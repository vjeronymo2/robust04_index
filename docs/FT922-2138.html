			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Fresh fighting in Sarajevo holes UN plan THE FRAGILE ceasefire in the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo collapsed yesterday, dashing United Nations hopes of sending food and humanitarian aid to the starving people of the city. UN officials said the ceasefire ended at dawn after the city came under fresh mortar and heavy bombardment from the surrounding hills, which are held by Serb irregulars and Serbia's proxy Bosnian army. Last night Serb irregulars were again pounding the city and its suburbs with artillery, and the main government building was bombarded for several hours. Street fighting moved towards the centre of Sarajevo as Serb irregulars and Bosnian territorial defence units engaged in long and sustained battles for control of parts of the city. Eye witnesses reported that Serb irregulars had entered the suburb of Dobrinja, near the airport and had taken many people from their apartments, evidently to exchange them for captured Serb snipers. A senior UN official in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, said it was too dangerous for the UN to try to reopen Sarajevo airport for an airlift of food and other supplies. He said a UN convoy that left Belgrade yesterday morning with relief supplies was still blocked from entering Sarajevo. 'There is no water, no food, no electricity. There is no hope. There is only fighting. We are being abandoned by the world community,' said Mr Ivan Knezovic, a philosophy professor at Sarajevo university. He said he was afraid that the Serb irregulars would eventually take Sarajevo street by street, house by house. UN officials had pinned great hopes on the ceasefire, as one of the last chances to re-open the airport. Serb irregulars have blockaded the airport for 11 weeks, preventing the city's 300,000 inhabitants from receiving any food supplies. 'There is little chance now that Canadian troops will be sent to take over control of the airport,' Mr Knezovic said. The Serb irregulars, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic, and General Ratko Mladic, agreed to a ceasefire last Sunday in the belief they could use a lull in the fighting to consolidate their positions in the city and eventually divide it. The Serb irregulars have repeatedly broken previous ceasefires. But western diplomats said an agreement between Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to form a military alliance could have persuaded the Serb irregulars to abandon the Sarajevo ceasefire.</p>

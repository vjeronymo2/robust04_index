			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Michal Strak, minister and chief of the </F> Office of the Council of Ministers, URM, by Malgorzata Subotic;  place and date not given: "Spectacle for a Connoisseur"]    [Text] [Subotic] What actually happened to have caused  this sharp kind of conflict after 100 days of what would seem on  the surface a harmonious functioning of the coalition?    [Strak] I would put it another way: The fact that so far, on  the surface, these conflicts were not visible means we are  ruling the country in a responsible manner. Being in power is  not about taking the advice of your neighbor with every conflict  that might occur.    [Subotic] But the matter has already happened....    [Strak] And it is done with. It is over now.    [Subotic] Exactly. Do you expect a counterattack on the part  of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]?    [Strak] There was no attack in the first place, so there  will be no counterattack. Some differences became visible, but  to those who were watching the arrangement from the inside, it  was no big surprise. First, it was wrong to assume at the  beginning of the Cabinet's term that this will be a coalition  where everything will go very smoothly, or that the slogan  "Let's love each other" will be the coalition's leading slogan.  This coalition consists of two independent political bodies.  Each of them has its own history, its own problems, and its own  political foundations. So there can naturally occur  divergences, but I think the will to act together is stronger  than those divergences. A coalition is a kind of contract.    [Subotic] But was there not a breach of this contract in the  "Kawalec-Borowski case" [former Deputy Finance Minister Kawalec  who was dismissed, and former Finance Minister Borowski who  resigned]?    [Strak] The outcome demonstrates that there is agreement  over such a solution.    [Subotic] And what kind of solution is that?    [Strak] We are waiting for a candidate for the post of  deputy prime minister and finance minister.    [Subotic] Does it mean it will be just one person?    [Strak] That is up to the SLD.    [Subotic] You said one could have expected from the  beginning that there would emerge differences between the Polish  Peasant Party [PSL] and the SLD....    [Strak] The differences that emerged were not only between  the PSL and the SLD but also within each of the two structures.  That is a new element compared to the Sejm of the previous  term. Back then, the main emotions were associated with  interparty relationships. Right now, the focus of the emotions  is being shifted "inside." We were aware from the beginning  that the government's biggest problems would not be with Sejm  deputy clubs or opposition parties, because they are definitely  weaker, but with its own basis of support.    [Subotic] Meaning?    [Strak] It will be much harder for us than for our  predecessors to come to agreement within the coalition.    [Subotic] What is the essence of the heterogeneity within  the PSL?    [Strak] The PSL's situation is perhaps better than that of  the SLD, even though there can occur different assessments of  our policies vis-a-vis rural areas. Theoretically, it is  possible to have a view that we are not doing enough for those  areas. But other people in turn say we are doing too much.  There is nothing wrong with having such differences of opinion.  The only question is: How are these differences eliminated?  Does it not happen in a way that would endanger the cabinet's  stability?    [Subotic] From that standpoint, what is your assessment of  the manner in which the coalition crisis was terminated?    [Strak] The coalition's stability remained unshaken, and,  from that standpoint, one can say that the parties' leaderships  demonstrated sufficient effectiveness.    [Subotic] Who demonstrated greater, as you put it,  effectiveness?    [Strak] I would not make any distinctions. We put an end to  the conflict together.    [Subotic] So there are no winners or losers?    [Strak] That is right, there are not. The interpretations  that appeared in newspapers were written by people who are on  the outside. It is their right to think this or that, but it is  the governing arrangement that comes out as the only and common  winner--it continues to function. If it were to collapse, that  would be a common defeat.    [Subotic] Do you really believe, in accordance with what a  joint communique had declared, that the governing PSL-SLD  coalition is destined to last four years?    [Strak] You know, there are many people who would like us to  last that long. If one assumes that the arrangement is not  fixed but that it is going to undergo various  convulsions--meaning that there will be thunder coming from the  volcano but the volcano will not erupt--it is possible to  maintain the arrangement for four years. Flexibility is  indispensable.    [Subotic] What could prevent this four-year scenario from  materializing?    [Strak] A sudden outbreak of social discontent.    [Subotic] On the basis of research and analyses conducted by  the government, can it be concluded that such an outbreak is  very likely?    [Strak] Not right now. We will rather witness some local  conflicts and ones limited to specific groups.    [Subotic] Perhaps you have an idea for an alternative  governing coalition with the PSL's participation?    [Strak] Theoretically speaking, other coalitions are  possible. But, from a realistic standpoint, there are no  alternative solutions for the nearest future. This lack of  other solutions should last about four years. Incidentally  speaking, it is my observation that society is no longer  interested in politics per se. What it wants is normalcy and  peace, not spectacles. After the four years during which the  nation suffered various setbacks, what society wants right now  is that those whom it had elected be in power for some time to  come. And if they rule efficiently, they will be reelected.    [Subotic] Yet you did show precisely this kind of political  spectacle for several days.    [Strak] I had meetings with Sejm deputies during this, as  you put it, spectacle. What is interesting is that not a single  question about it was asked. So it was a spectacle for a very  small group of connoisseurs. Politics is a bit like an  automobile: You get interested in how it works only when it  begins to break down.    [Subotic] And this particular automobile, to use your  metaphor, has not yet begun to break down?    [Strak] Perhaps something was escaping from the exhaust pipe  with too much noise. But I think society had a feeling that  everything that was happening did not present a danger of the  vehicle coming to a halt.    [Subotic] You did not fear even for a moment that the  coalition would collapse?    [Strak] Not even for a moment. It is like in a marriage:  Even if you have an argument with your husband, that does not  mean you will immediately want to get a divorce.    [Subotic] "Getting rid of Strak" was one of the SLD's  preconditions during the conflict. Can the SLD have something  against you?    [Strak] You should ask it about that.    [Subotic] My question was: Can the SLD "have something  against you"?    [Strak] I cannot be the judge in my own case.    [Subotic] What is actually the story with local governors  [wojewodowie]?    [Strak] All of the local governors that replaced the  previous ones were approved of in a double way: by both the PSL  and the SLD, except for one case. At this point, there are  indeed some more new local governors coming from the PSL.    [Subotic] So far, you have dismissed 19 local governors.  How many more of them do you intend to replace?    [Strak] In accordance with the rules of the game, one does  not disclose one's plans. An old and experienced politician  once told me that you should not utter a word until the decision  is "officially in."    [Subotic] With regard to the issue of local governors, why  do you succumb to local party organizations, primarily the PSL?    [Strak] It would be hard to call it succumbing. Perhaps I  have a better understanding than others of a need that has  emerged after the most recent elections: For the whole  arrangement to function efficiently, what is needed is  harmonious cooperation among the government, local governors,  and political power centers in voivodships [administrative  units]. If the harmony can be introduced without replacing a  local governor, I am very satisfied. But if it is not possible  to avoid a replacement, then to maintain the disharmony for some  time period would be bad for everyone. Parliamentary democracy  has its own rules: One cannot limit the functioning of parties  only to the central level. After all, these parties have their  own structures, which means also their own interests, at the  level of voivodships.    [Subotic] So they must be given prizes?    [Strak] It is not an issue of prizes but one of realistic  participation in ruling the country.    [Subotic] So you see no danger whatsoever of local party  structures really determining who should be appointed voivode?    [Strak] It is too early to talk about it or to disclose  details of decisions that are being made. But to say that local  party agencies determine everything is an oversimplification.  There have been a great many such oversimplifications. But it  is a fact that we have granted the local structures the right to  come up with their candidates for the posts of voivodes.    [Subotic] Has it ever happened that someone was appointed  voivode than what the local structures "came up with"?    [Strak] Yes, it has.    [Subotic] When was that?    [Strak] I do not want to go into that, but I can guarantee  you that it really has happened. And, from among the  more-than-10 newly appointed local governors, practically only  one failed to obtain a positive opinion from local  self-governments. Even though we have allowed our party  authorities throughout voivodships to influence the process of  appointing local governors, it turned out that they are  sufficiently good candidates to have gained the support of local  self-governments. I should add that majorities within these  local self-governments are, after all, composed of supporters of  other political parties.    [Subotic] You once said: Seeing the way Solidarity is in  power, I am convinced the time will come for the PSL.    [Strak] As early as in 1989, when the revolution was just  beginning, during a meeting with activists for the United  Peasant Party, someone asked the question of whether the party  will manage to defend itself. I replied then that it is not  possible for a social group as large as peasants not to come up  with their own political representation. A need for the PSL was  widely felt. All that was left after that was the issue of  political efficiency.    [Subotic] But why did the others who wanted to lead the  peasant movement fail--for instance, Gabriel Janowski and Jozef  Slisz?    [Strak] We simply proved better. They were not capable of  adopting down-to-earth positions: They talked too much and they  were not doing enough.    [Subotic] Let us return to the coalition issues. Does Sejm  Deputy Pek express the PSL's position on privatization well?    [Strak] Sejm Deputy Pek is the chairman of the Sejm  Ownership Transformations Commission; he has access to materials  that he studies and analyzes.    [Subotic] But you did not answer my question.    [Strak] I think there is no need to identify the PSL's  position with that of Sejm Deputy Pek. By the same token, one  could ask a question on whether measures undertaken by me  regarding local governors reflect the PSL's position well.    [Subotic] Do they?    [Strak] There is definitely a correlation, even though there  is no unanimity, strictly speaking. If you talked to my  colleagues, I am sure you would hear as many positive  assessments as critical ones of what I do.    [Subotic] But isn't it the case that the negative views  prevail?    [Strak] Perhaps they do, but not as much as to manifest  themselves in organizational measures.    [Subotic] How would you comment on the view that you are  Pawlak's Wachowski?    [Strak] All I can do is have a laugh at that.</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Getty Won't Get Sculpture: The J. Paul Getty Museum was denied a license to  export a $12-million sculpture after the British government announced new  guidelines to keep art treasures in Britain. The Department of Trade and  Industry announced Friday that works of art considered important to Britain's  heritage cannot be exported if a British buyer can be found. The Getty Museum  applied to export Canova's "Three Graces," a 19th-Century statue of three  standing nude women, from Britain in March 1989, after its $12.4-million bid  was accepted by the sculpture's owners, a trust in Britain's Caribbean Cayman  Islands colony.

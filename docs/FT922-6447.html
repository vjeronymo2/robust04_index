			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Travel: Menorca: simple fare, astral experiences - The influences which have shaped the most easterly of the Balearics MAJORCA . . . Menorca . . . these Balearic islands always sound to me like a pair of chirpy Spanish public schoolboys. The difference between them is much more than 100 miles of Mediterranean. Menorca is the quiet and modest one. If you felt energetic you could cycle across it in a day along its central spine of a road. Menorca is remarkably sane about tourism. For a start, its season lasts only from the end of April to the end of October. I caught the final charter flight out of Mahon last October, having been the last guest to check out of the Hotel Gala Galdana which faces the superb horseshoe bay of Gala Galdana in the south. Shutters were going up all over the island. No wonder that it only has 10 per cent of the visitors who stay in Majorca. There are also tight and strictly-observed controls on hotel development and only eight petrol stations on the whole island. At the oddly-named Bar Alaska near the hotel, Antonio told me over a farewell San Miguel that he was about to go back to his family on the mainland in Andalucia. 'Six months you earn: six months you spend. But even in the season it's quiet here. If you want discos and late nights go to Ibiza or Majorca.' I wanted neither of those, and I have been to Majorca enough times to know that you can escape noise by choosing carefully even there. But Menorca's legendary tranquility is a deceptive facade. Yes, English visitors do a double-take when they see huge Friesian cows lolling in green fields, and you can spot blackberry bushes in country lanes or sash windows in Mahon's 18th-century Georgian houses. But the legacy of British occupation in the 18th century is matched by the impact of the other invaders of this most easterly of the Balearic islands. Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Arabs, Moors, Catalans and French - all occupied the island. The most interesting of the settlers were the oldest and most enigmatic  - the prehistoric inhabitants who, 3,000 years ago, built the hundreds of stone monuments that make Menorca a unique open-air museum. Imagine 100 miniature Stonehenges scattered across the Isle of Wight, lying in farmers' fields, and you have some idea of the impact of Menorca's monuments. I used the excellent Landscapes of Menorca by Rodney Ansell to find my way to a dozen different sites where you can stroll around three types of prehistoric monument. There are talayots, conical mounds of stone which were originally watch-towers; navetas, burial chambers which look like upturned stone boats, and taulas, mysterious pairs of massive rectangular stone slabs carefully slotted and balanced together to give the appearance of a capital T. The best way to explore Menorca is to drive or, where possible, walk to a selection of these sites which are accessible in superb countryside. Green hills, artful dry-stone walls which separate every field like punctuation, sharp ravines and rocky headlands form a dramatic backdrop to many of these sites. The best example of a naveta is at Es Tudons, 4 km outside Cuidadela. This two-storey burial chamber has been well restored and is reckoned to be the oldest roofed building in Spain, if not in western Europe. I walked along paths of dry red earth studded with tiny wild autumn crocuses to reach the naveta. Not far from Es Tudons I found my first taula at a settlement called Torre Llafuda. To navigate accurately to these sites, I recommend a second slim book called Taulas and Talayots by Michael Hoskin and William Waldren, two English academics. At Torre Llafuda, the taula precinct is set in an olive grove and the book led me accurately over cattle grids, iron gates and past a farmhouse to find the enigmatic T-shaped slabs of stone still standing in their original grooves after 3,000 years. The largest of these sites are in central Menorca. Torre d'en Gaumes and Torralba d'en Salort are easy to find off the main Mahon-Cuidadela road near the town of Alayor. Both settlements have been thoroughly excavated and you can wander among taulas, talayots and the ingenious water irrigation sytems that, with their hollows and contours, remind one of rough-hewn, weather-beaten Giacometti sculptures. My ideal day included taking one of the walks suggested in Landscapes of Menorca, a visit to some prehistoric sites, lunch in a simple Menorcan restaurant and relaxation in one of the island's 120 bays and coves. Ferreries, the nearest town to Gala Galdana, has a modest restaurant lumbered with the unfortunate name of Vimpi. It soon became our local because of its outstanding tapas and fish dishes, although I decided to decline Vimpi's speciality, 'Rabbit of the House'. Squid in garlic, octopus, breaded mussels and stuffed aubergines were quite good enough. And we could always climb the nearby hill of Santa Agueda. It is only 870 ft, but you climb up a path that used to be one of the oldest roads on the island. The Romans had a fortress on the summit and much of the original Roman paving is still there, set in the ochre earth. The 40-minute climb takes you past pine trees, wild pomegranates, rosemary and fennel, crickets and darting lizards, until you reach the remains of the Roman fort and a Moorish castle, surrounded by fig trees and an outstanding view of western Menorca. Based at Gala Galdana, it is easy to walk to many other nearby horseshoe bays or creeks which are often deserted, like Gala Mitjana and Macarella. On the way to the airport at Mahon, I couldn't resist a final stop at the newly-excavated settlement of Sonacasana. It was a lucky diversion because I met two German researchers who were plotting the alignments of every taula on the island. Laying their complex charts on the yellow limestone, they showed me the evidence to support the theory proposed by Michael Hoskin of Churchill College, Cambridge, that the taulas are most probably sacred monuments linked to ancient worship of the stars. Every mysterious giant stone T on the island has a clear view of the horizon and points directly towards specific bright stars, mainly the Southern Cross and Alpha Centauri. The taulas are all oriented towards these stars' trajectories across the southern Menorcan sky of 3,000 years ago. Evidence for animal sacrifice and the discovery of religious artefacts at the taulas (including a statue of the Egyptian god of medicine, Imhotep), support the theory that the early Menorcan religion, like Egypt's, was astral. Thomson Holidays has flights only to Menorca from Pounds 132 return, and half-board holidays at Hotel Cala Galdana from Pounds 256 for seven days. Both its Small and Friendly and Summer Sun brochures have a selection of other packages to different resorts in Menorca.

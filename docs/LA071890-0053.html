			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A WACKY NIGHT IN BASEBALL;  </P> <P> BO HAS GAME OF HIT AND MISS;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: JACKSON HITS THREE HOME RUNS BUT INJURES SHOULDER AND MISSES CHANCE  TO TRY FOR FOUR.  </P> <P> Although Deion Sanders has never decked Bo Jackson on a football field, he KO'd  him on a baseball field Tuesday night. And it cost Jackson the chance to tie  the major league record of four home runs in a game.  </P> <P> Jackson homered his first three times up in Kansas City's 10-7 victory over the  New York Yankees. But he partially dislocated his left shoulder diving for  Sanders' inside-the-park homer in the sixth inning and had to leave.  </P> <P> "That's the best performance I've ever seen by an individual in a major league  game," Kansas City Royal Manager John Wathan said.  </P> <P> Jackson hit two-run homers in the first and third innings off Andy Hawkins  (1-8) and hit a three-run shot off Hawkins in the fifth. The third home run  gave Jackson 19 for the season and 100 for his career.  </P> <P> But he never got an opportunity to tie the record. Sanders' hit rolled to the  wall for a two-run homer that pulled New York to within 8-7. Jackson, clearly  frustrated, had to come out.  </P> <P> "I certainly didn't expect a night like I had, especially getting hurt,"  Jackson said. "But the X-rays came back negative and I should be all right in a  few days.  </P> <P> "I felt great up until the ball I tried to dive for. I didn't go out and try to  hit three home runs, but all three pitches were right in my zone."  </P> <P> Jackson was taken to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center to have the shoulder  X-rayed. Wathan said the Royals believe it was a partial dislocation in which  the bone pops out of the joint and pops back in.  </P> <P> "I think he'll be able to play in a few days," Wathan said. "Usually what  happens in this case is you're out a couple of days."  </P> <P> Wathan, like the fans, was disappointed Jackson didn't have a chance to bat  again.  </P> <P> "I think he would have electrified Yankee Stadium just coming up to the plate a  fourth time," the Kansas City manager said.  </P> <P> Sanders, who also plays defensive back for the Atlanta Falcons, has been a  rival of Jackson, a running back for the Raiders. The two haven't met in a  football game since 1985, when Jackson's Auburn team played Florida State.  </P> <P> "He ran all through us, over me and everybody," Sanders said.  </P> <P> Jackson's first two homers were monster shots. He followed George Brett's  first-inning walk with a 412-foot drive over the center-field wall.  </P> <P> After Bill Pecota led off the third with his first home run in a year, Hawkins  walked Brett again and Jackson hit a 464-foot, opposite-field homer halfway up  the right- field bleachers.  </P> <P> "That ball got so small so fast," Brett said.  </P> <P> The third home run was more modest, a 328-foot, opposite-field fly down the  line that gave Kansas City an 8-1 lead. Hawkins gave up a single to Kevin  Seitzer and a double to Brett, but chose to pitch to Jackson rather than walk  him with first base open.  </P> <P> Yankee Manager Stump Merrill made the decision to face Jackson and Hawkins  concurred.  </P> <P> "There was no other thing to do," Hawkins said. "They've got two left-handers  coming up after that and they're both good hitters (Gerald Perry and Jim  Eisenreich). I wanted to go after him anyway. The guy's just hit two home runs  off me."  </P> <P> It was the seventh three-homer game in the major leagues this season and it  matched the Kansas City club record for homers in a game. The seven RBIs also  tied the Royals' record.  </P> <P> Hawkins, who has not won since May 6, has not pitched well since early July,  when he lost a no-hitter to Chicago, 4-0, on unearned runs, and lost to  Minnesota, 2-0, after pitching 11 shutout innings.  </P> <P> "He's adjusted," Hawkins said of Jackson. "The first at-bat when I got two  strikes on him he choked up 1 1/2, two inches."  </P> <P> Willie Wilson, who replaced Jackson, hit a two-run single in the seventh. He  singled in the ninth, giving Kansas City five hits and nine RBIs from the  cleanup spot.  </P> <P> 3 HOME RUNS IN A GAME  </P> <P> Players who have hit three home runs in a game this season.  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.89IN:3.76IN:2.11IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Date  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Player (Team)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Against  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> May 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Cecil Fielder (Tigers)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Blue Jays  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> May 25  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Kevin Mitchell (Giants)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Pirates  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> May 26  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Jeff Treadway (Braves)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Phillies  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> June 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Glenn Davis (Astros)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Giants  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> June 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Cecil Fielder (Tigers)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Indians  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> June 9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Randy Milligan (Orioles)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Yankees  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> July 17  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bo Jackson (Royals)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Yankees  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P></p>

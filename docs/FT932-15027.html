			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Waste Management sees flat term WASTE Management, the world's largest rubbish hauler, said that it expected to report flat earnings in the first quarter. The Illinois-based company's stock tumbled to a 52-week low this week as investors became disillusioned with the company's growth potential. Waste Management issued the earnings estimates in response to adverse Wall Street projections earlier this week. It will release official results next week. In spite of adding more than 400 salespeople in North America last year, Waste Management forecast first-quarter earnings of 40 to 41 cents per share. This was little changed from last year's first-quarter result of 39 cents per share. The group's publicly-traded subsidiary, Chemical Waste Management, is also expecting flat results for the first quarter, at Dollars 29m, or 15 cents per share. Waste Management's Wheelabrator Technologies subsidiary is expected to earn between 17 and 18 cents per share in the quarter, down sharply from last year's 29 cents per share. Earnings at Waste Management International, the group's UK subsidiary, were projected at between 13 and 15 cents per American depositary share. The company said that first-quarter results for its newly-formed Rust International subsidiary were expected to meet internal expectations, but the company did not provide details. Waste Management, which had been expected to benefit from the new American administration's interest in the environment, plans to change its name to WMX Technologies at its annual meeting on May 14.</p>

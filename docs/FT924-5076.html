			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Dares Estates cuts deficit to Pounds 2.87m Dares Estates, the property investment and development group, cut its pre-tax losses from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 2.87m for the half year to June 30. Mr Ervin Landau, the chairman, said the results had been delayed because the directors had expected to be able to announce an agreement with its bankers regarding a financial restructuring. Unfortunately, he said, that had not proved possible although he expected an agreement in principle very shortly. Turnover fell from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 2.9m with rental income at Pounds 2.81m (Pounds 4.34m). The pre-tax result was after interest charges of Pounds 5.09m (Pounds 7.87m) and an exceptional credit of Pounds 757,000 (Pounds 8.61m debit). Losses per share were reduced from 8.75p to 1.54p.</p>

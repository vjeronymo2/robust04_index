			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By G. Sablin and A. Troshin from Kaliningrad; from the </F> "Vesti" newscast]    [Text] [Sablin] The combat and tactical training of Baltic  Fleet crews and ships deserves the highest appraisal. This  opinion was expressed to journalists by Admiral Igor Kasatonov,  first deputy commander in chief of the Navy, summing up the  results of his visit to bases of Russia's oldest fleet.  Dwelling on the timescale for the withdrawal naval forces from  Latvia, he confirmed the readiness of the last major unit -- a  submarine brigade -- to quit Liepaja by 1 June of this year.    At the same time Igor Kasatonov stressed that with the loss  of its bases in Baltic countries, the Russian Navy will not lose  its might or mobility.    [Admiral I. Kasatonov] Whereas the fleet now has 27 percent  of nuclear warheads, this figure will rise to 42-47 percent by  the year 2000. On 21 December I had the honor of being the  senior Ministry of Defense official attending the laying of the  keel of the latest submarine. In addition, the keels of a  number of surface vessels have also been laid, and individual  vessels have been commissioned.    However, the concept of a new fleet, the fleet for the third  millenium, needs to be confirmed. Naturally, it will have to  pass through government.</p>

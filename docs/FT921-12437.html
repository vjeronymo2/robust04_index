			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Job cuts and closures at Sun Alliance subsidiary LEGAL PROTECTION Group, the legal expenses insurer and a subsidiary of Sun Alliance, is to close all of its five regional sales offices and make 57 people redundant out of a total of 400. The move follows a recent review of the structure of the company and the announcement by Sun Alliance last Friday that it plans to cut 800 jobs across the group as part of a rationalisation programme. Mr Brian Raincock, who founded the company in 1977, loses his job as group managing director. He will become a consultant to the parent company on terms still to be determined. Mr Malcolm Gilbert, finance director who will become managing director, said the costs of the reorganisation would be nearly Pounds 1m. He stressed that the company would continue to operate its existing services, including commercial and personal legal expenses and indemnity insurance, and a 24-hour international telephone assistance line. LPG generated an estimated Pounds 12m of income during the 1991 year but failed to make a profit. Mr Gilbert believed LPG would make a small profit in the current year if the costs of restructuring were excluded. The company's headquarters in Sutton, Surrey, and administrative offices in Halifax and the City will continue to operate.</p>

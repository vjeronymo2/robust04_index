			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Cash-strapped councils run for cover: The expected strains from a steep rise in premiums EXETER City Council's insurance policies with the troubled Municipal Mutual expired on Wednesday night. Yesterday, having failed to obtain cover elsewhere, it closed its leisure facilities and took all its vehicles off the road. Aerobics classes and guided tours were suddenly halted as the council met in emergency session to resolve the crisis. Mr Chester Long, council leader, said the authority had two firms of brokers working all day and could secure only one 'highly unsatisfactory' offer which, for some aspects of business, was four times the MMI premium. Exeter's troubles are an extreme example of the difficulties many councils face as a result of the demise of Municipal Mutual, which stopped writing new business and temporarily stopped paying claims on Wednesday. Municipal Mutual insured the great majority of local risks. Councils face steep increases in premiums, as well as sizeable reductions in the amount of insurance cover they are likely to obtain after their policies expire. Hard hit by two years of record losses and with their own capital bases depleted, other insurance companies are not enthusiastic about selling policies to local authorities, although their business is worth over Pounds 600m a year. Some cover is available at the Lloyd's market, but underwriters, stung by losses, are taking a cautious approach. Insurance brokers have been able to find alternatives but are negotiating cover on a case-by-case basis. One broker said yesterday: 'It is extraordinary to see the ninth-largest insurer going insolvent and the insurance industry unable to do anything about it.' Insurers are worried about claims arising from awards to victims of the 'pin-down' disciplinary regime, the epidemic of arson attacks on schools, and the cost of cleaning up contaminated land, which they fear might fall on public liability policies. Contraction in the insurance market means coverage on the basis offered by MMI will be much more expensive. Jardine International yesterday offered a one-month policy covering employers' liability, public and product liability and most other risks, quoting prices well above the rates councils had been used to. Eastleigh District Council yesterday bought a Jardine policy, allowing it to operate its bus services. Mr Arthur Boulter, local-government director of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, said premium increases of 30 per cent to 40 per cent appear to be 'par for the course'. Mr Boulter said: 'There is no obligation on local authorities to insure themselves, but it would be imprudent for them not to do so. They should also exercise extreme care to ensure that the use of cars for private use, and the like, is properly covered.' With spending of most councils capped by the government, and next year's spending limits certain to be tight, the implications for council budgets are serious. Mr Bob Block, chief executive of Oxford City Council, said he expected to have to find an extra Pounds 100,000 for insurance cover on a capped budget of Pounds 18m. Spending limits from the Department of the Environment for councils make no specific allowance for insurance. The department said it was 'very unlikely' that the standard spending assessment targets for councils would be altered next year to account for higher insurance costs. The difficulties may also mean a tougher time for local-authority managers. Mr Peter Friend, of brokers Leslie &amp; Godwin, which arranged insurance coverage for about 40 councils over the past year, suggests managements will come under more pressure to contain claims. He says insurers are likely to offer less cover, insisting on much bigger excesses. Brokers will also offer consultancy services to councils advising them on how they can reduce the number of smaller claims. Local-authority associations are anxious to play down crisis talk. The associations, which yesterday met Municipal Mutual, still hope the company will be able to meet claims on outstanding policies. Mr Brian Briscoe, chief executive of Hertfordshire county council - almost all of whose insurance is covered by MMI - said MMI's troubles were of 'extreme concern, but not a matter for panic'. In the 'worst case', Hertfordshire may face a bill of up to Pounds 5m in uncovered claims and increased premiums. But, provided MMI met past and current claims, the cost would probably be in 'hundreds of thousands'. A number of authorities had already begun to shift their insurance cover away from MMI before the collapse. Newcastle and Leeds city councils for example, have moved a significant proportion of cover to other companies and both are paying lower premiums than those offered by MMI. Mr James Gravenor, Newcastle-upon-Tyne's assistant treasurer, said the city was prepared to pay 'significant excesses' in moving its remaining MMI cover, and predicted 'a marked trend towards more self-insurance'.

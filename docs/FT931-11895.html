			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Zambia to scrap exchange controls ZAMBIA plans to abolish exchange controls inherited at independence nearly 30 years ago, Mr Emmanuel Kasonde, the finance minister, announced on Friday in the course of an innovative budget warmly welcomed by western donors. In a move thought to be without precedent in Africa, Mr Kasonde said the central bank would be given the authority to prevent government ministries from spending more than the amounts voted by parliament. Despite drought, falling GDP, and an 80 per cent rise in public spending, Mr Kasonde presented a balanced 'cash limits' budget, warning that the country could no longer afford to live beyond its means. Government would stop borrowing from the central bank, monetary growth would slow, and private sector investment would no longer be crowded out, the minister told the national assembly. Mr Kasonde said the government no longer played any role in setting the exchange rate for the Zambian kwacha. It had liberalised interest rates and was funding government debt by a treasury bill auction system. Legislation to abolish exchange control would be introduced later this year, he said.</p>

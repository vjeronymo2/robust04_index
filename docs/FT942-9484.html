			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Union stands aside from Labour race Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of Unison, the public services union, yesterday said that the union executive would make no recommendation on the new leader of the Labour party to those members who pay the political levy. Unison's stance, announced at the start of its annual conference, was not unexpected since only parts of the union are affiliated to the Labour party, but some other union leaders may follow the lead. Some leaders said at the weekend that they hoped the new party leader would emerge without a contest, as they honoured the request not to name their preferences at least until after the funeral of John Smith later this week. But yesterday Mr Bill Jordan, the AEEU engineering union president, said: 'It would please us no end if a natural leader emerged. If the politicians within the Labour party believe they have consensus among themselves on who should be their natural leader I'm fairly certain that would be welcomed throughout the trade union movement.' The AEEU would probably back either Mr Tony Blair or Mr Gordon Brown in the event of a contest. Most unions, including the TGWU general union, Labour's biggest affiliate, are expected to hold postal ballots but some may opt for cheaper workplace ballots. 'We certainly hope that everyone will go for postal ballots; we all know that workplace ballots are not always transparently fair in all workplaces,' said one union leader. Unison and other large unions confirmed yesterday that a July election was perfectly practical, although some smaller unions might have an organisational problem. The election will be open to some abuse as the electorate should not only be political-levy payers but also supporters of the Labour party, something which will be difficult in practice to ascertain. Assuming that most unions do make recommendations, the field looks wide open. Leaders have been stunned by Mr Smith's death and have been careful not to repeat the 'undignified rush' to publicly anoint his successor as happened in Mr Smith's favour after Mr Neil Kinnock's resignation. One official said last night that 'the heart is for Prescott but the head is for Blair or Brown'. Another added: 'Union leaders are just desperate to win and there is a grudging acceptance in some quarters that Blair is the only one who can do it.' Separately at the Unison conference, Mr Jinkinson yesterday committed the union to a protracted campaign against the public-sector pay-bill freeze and job cutting programme. He urged members however not to be drawn into early industrial action.</p>

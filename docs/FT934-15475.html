			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Treasury axe poised over housing budget THE Pounds 8bn housing budget is set to become one of the worst-hit casualties of the government's determination to cut public spending next year. With the cabinet's public spending committee, EDX, resuming its meetings this week ministers expect the Treasury to reduce both the capital and revenue sides of the housing budget. In last year's spending round capital spending projects escaped relatively lightly, to the relief of the recession-hit construction industry. But in the current discussions, housing expenditure through both the Housing Corporation - which makes grants to housing associations - and local authorities is expected to be targeted. Local council leaders will today ask Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, to extend beyond the end of the year the period in which authorities can spend proceeds from selling property or land. The latest estimate from Mr Gummer's department is that local authorities will raise about Pounds 500m less than the Pounds 1.75bn that had been expected. A sharp reduction of up to Pounds 300m is also expected in the capital earmarked for the Housing Corporation. A large proportion of its Pounds 1.8bn budget is committed in advance, so any cut would have a severe effect on the number of projects that could be started. EDX is also thought to be considering further reducing the proportion of public money used to fund housing association projects, although this could not take effect until years two and three of the government's spending review period. Mr Michael Portillo, chief Treasury secretary, believes it would be fairer and more efficient to target subsidy on beneficiaries through housing benefit, rather than on bricks and mortar through housing association grants. The Commons environment committee warned the government in July against further reducing these grants. The environment department is expected to publish its response to the committee later this month. Spending on housing is already set well below 1992-93 levels, when an additional Pounds 750m was provided in the 1992 Autumn Statement for housing associations to buy 20,000 empty homes. The department's urban programmes are expected to be hit slightly less hard in the spending round. This is partly because the government is anxious to ensure the new Urban Regeneration Agency, to be chaired by Lord Walker, is not strangled at birth. The agency will aim to reclaim 150,000 acres of vacant land. Labour yesterday warned that cutting infrastructure projects could threaten the fragile economic recovery. Capital spending in other departments such as transport is also under severe pressure but ministers and officials are trying hard to use the private sector as a 'safety valve' by persuading it to take up endangered projects.</p>

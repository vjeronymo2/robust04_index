			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Galina Afanasyeva report in the "Situation" column: </F> "Lithuania Watches Ostankino"]    [Text] Recently the governing board of the Lithuanian  Radio and TV Company asked viewers to respond to the question:  Should the Ostankino TV channel be preserved in Lithuania?    The request was due to the fact that this year the term of  the agreement whereby the Ostankino TV Company covered the costs  of beaming its programs to Lithuania has run out. As of April,  Channel I programs were to be broadcast free of charge only up  to the borders.    In Lithuania, where Russian speakers constitute less than 20  percent, Ostankino's rating is substantially higher than of  other TV companies, including state TV. Therefore Lithuanian  Radio and TV Company executives decided to conduct a survey to  make sure whether it is worth asking the government to allocate  funds from its scarce budget to pay for Ostankino programs.    In spite of the fact that this appeal to viewers came on the  eve of a holiday -- the Catholic Easter -- the Radio and TV  Committee was showered with letters. According to Committee  Board Chairman Gedeminas Ilgunas, 90 percent of correspondents  -- predominantly Lithuanians -- spoke in favor of keeping the  Ostankino channel. The Lithuanian Radio and TV directors  considered this sufficient grounds for forwarding an official  request to the government on allocating the requisite funds.    Experts estimate that to satisfy the Lithuanians' wish to  watch Ostankino from 1800 till the end of the programs (on  average 45 hours a week), 800,000 lits ($200,000) will be needed  annually. The board is going to ask the government for another  200,000 lits to pay for Mayak radio broadcasts.    These spending plans were called into question by opposition  leader Vytautas Landsbergis. He promised to state his case in a  special letter to the premier. Now it is up to the government  to decide who has a stronger case to argue.</p>

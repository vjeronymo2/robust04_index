			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / FT Law Report: Manager has duty to act faithfully TICEHURST AND ANOTHER v BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PLC Court of Appeal: (Lord Justice Neill, Lord Justice Ralph Gibson and Lord Justice Stocker): March 11 1992 INDUSTRIAL action short of striking taken by a manager on trade union instructions aimed at inconveniencing or damaging the employer, is a breach of her implied contractual duty to serve him faithfully within the requirements of her contract, and entitles him to refuse to let her work and to withhold wages for any period in which she evinces an intention to withdraw goodwill from her work-performance. The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by the defendants, British Telecommunications plc (BT), from Judge Oddie's decision in the Mayor's and City of London County Court, that Pounds 817.70 and Pounds 297.66 wages were due to the plaintiffs, Mrs Alison Ticehurst and Mr Michael Thompson respectively. The appeal judgment referred only to Mrs Ticehurst, but applied equally to Mr Thompson, a computer support manager employed by BT. LORD JUSTICE RALPH GIBSON said Mrs Ticehurst was employed as buildings manager at BT's Stone Technical College in Staffordshire. About 30,000 out of the 40,000 executives employed by BT in certain grades, were represented by the Society of Telecom Executives (STE), a trade union. STE was seeking a pay increase. From about June 1989, its members took part in industrial action short of striking, described as 'withdrawal of goodwill'. They were instructed to choose work options which would cause the most inconvenience to BT; not to do certain work not already agreed with the STE; and not to co-operate with consultants or on projects, or to accept new practices, unless agreed by STE. In February 1990, STE members voted in favour of strike action. A half day strike was called for April 6 1990. A letter dated April 4 was sent by BT to STE members, saying it was no longer prepared to tolerate refusals to work in accordance with terms and conditions of employment. It said that following the April 6 strike, managers would be expected to work normally, and 'those who are not prepared to honour fully the terms of their contract can be sent home, without further notice and without pay, until they are prepared to work normally in accordance with their contract'. On April 9, STE decided there should be a rolling campaign of strategic strikes. All members were instructed to take strike action on April 10 and 11. Mrs Ticehurst, who had taken part in the half day strike on April 6, also took part on April 10 and 11. On April 12, the Thursday before Good Friday, Mrs Ticehurst returned to work. She was in charge of 40 staff. She worked normally for about two hours and was then told that because she had taken further strike action she was to leave the premises, and that on her return to work after the holiday, on Tuesday April 17, she would be asked to give an undertaking to work normally. Mrs Ticehurst attended for work on April 17. She was asked to sign a document which read: 'I undertake to work normally in accordance with the terms of my contract with BT from now on and to take no further industrial action.' She was told if she refused to sign she must leave. She refused to sign, and left. The same occurred each working day down to April 26. Judge Oddie found that her refusal to sign the undertaking was not breach of contract, nor was it a refusal to obey a reasonable instruction. He held she was ready, willing and able and wished to return to work. On the appeal, Mr Burke for BT contended that if an employee was willing to perform only part of her duties or declined to carry them out properly, with the object of damaging the employer's business, the employer was not obliged to accept performance short of full performance and was entitled to refuse to permit the employee to work, and to refuse to pay wages. Mr Elias for Mrs Ticehurst submitted that, on the evidence, the only reasonable inference was that she was willing to do her work fully in accordance with her contract of employment and without qualification. He said if that was wrong and she was offering to work subject to qualification, neither the intention to respond in future to any strike call, nor to continue withdrawal of goodwill, would constitute breach of contract. The appeal would be allowed on the ground that Mrs Ticehurst did not prove she was ready and willing to work contractually, and she was plainly evincing the intention to continue withdrawing goodwill in breach of the implied terms of her contract. BT was, without bringing the contract of employment to an end, entitled to refuse to accept part-performance. It was common ground that before April 12 Mrs Ticehurst had been taking part in withdrawal of goodwill. STE had called on her to do many things, with the intention of making BT's business unmanageable. In ASLEF No. 2 (1972) 2 QB 455,498, where work to rule instructions avoided a specific direction to breach any express term of the contract but were aimed at frustrating the employers' commercial activity, Lord Justice Buckley said there was an implied term in the contracts of employment 'to serve the employer faithfully within the requirements of the contract'. He said 'the employee must serve the employer faithfully with a view to promoting those commercial interests for which he is employed'. It was necessary to imply such a term in the case of a manager who was in charge of other employees and who therefore must be entrusted to exercise her judgment and discretion in giving instructions to others and in supervising their work. Such a discretion, if the contract was to work properly, must be exercised faithfully in the employers' interests. The term was breached when the employee did an act, or omitted to do an act, not in honest exercise of choice or discretion for the faithful performance of her work, but in order to disrupt the employer's business or to cause the most inconvenience possible. The action by way of withdrawal of goodwill did have adverse consequences. If on her return to work Mrs Ticehurst was evincing an intention to continue to participate in the action of withdrawal of goodwill, BT was in entitled on that ground, and without terminating the contract of employment, to refuse to let her remain at work (Miles v Wakefield MDC (1987) 1 AC 539). The principle in Miles was that an employer did not have to accept and pay for the work of an employee who was not willing to perform his contract in full. If the only intention evinced by Mrs Ticehurst was to continue to respond to a strike call if and when called upon by her union to strike, she would have been intending to perform her full contractual duties until sometime in the future, which might not happen at all, when she would break her contract by striking. The evincing of an intention to continue to participate in the strike campaign did not constitute breach of contract which by itself would have entitled BT to refuse to permit her to work. The strike was in sharp contrast with industrial action consisting of an intention to injure the employer while maintaining that the employee was working normally. The intention to continue in the action of withdrawal of goodwill if it was evinced, did entitle BT to refuse to let Mrs Ticehurst work. Mrs Ticehurst did evince that intention for the following reasons: She took an active part in the withdrawal of goodwill before the strikes; STE's announced intention was that it would continue the withdrawal after the first strike; STE made no announcement before or after the second strike that the action would not be continuing; Mrs Ticehurst gave no evidence of saying to anyone at BT that she would no longer participate. The appeal was allowed. Their Lordships agreed. For BT: Jeffrey Burke QC and Roy Lemon (Colin R Green). For Mrs Ticehurst: Patrick Elias QC and David Bean (Lawford &amp; Co, Richmond-upon-Thames).</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Observer: Out of Africa Things don't get better for the African Development Bank. Weighed down by arrears, its recent AGM ended in a shambles. Now the regional development bank has lost its treasurer, Kofi Bucknor, to Lehman Brothers. A skilled negotiator and a fine ambassador for the bank, Bucknor apparently became disenchanted when he was not made chief financial officer - a post that has been vacant for some time - and for which he seemed perfectly well qualified. 'So he has auctioned himself to the highest bidder,' as one banker put it - even if Bucknor, a scion of one of Ghana's leading families, is not exactly short of a bob or two. Moving to London, he will head up Lehman's African investment banking operation. James Ranaivoson, a Madagascan who previously worked for the Caisse des Depots, the state-controlled French financial institution, is his most likely replacement. With the AfDB suffering losses that could imperil its very survival, the new man won't be bored.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Zedillo succeeds murdered Mexico presidential frontrunner Mr Ernesto Zedillo, a former budget and education minister, has been chosen to replace the murdered Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio as the presidential candidate of Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party. Mr Zedillo managed Mr Colosio's campaign until the latter was assassinated in the northern town of Tijuana last Wednesday. With Mexico's governing party in power for the past 65 years, and well ahead of the opposition in opinion polls, Mr Zedillo becomes strong favourite to win the presidential election set for August 21 and succeed President Carlos Salinas. Mr Zedillo, 42, is a US-trained economist who represents the technocratic, pro-economic reform wing of the party. He is a protege of Mr Salinas, and is expected to gain support from the allies of Mr Colosio in the party, and foreign-trained bureaucrats in the government. His nomination sends a clear signal of continuity with the economic policies of President Salinas. However, he has never held elective office, and his views on social and political issues are hardly known. He does not inspire much confidence among party traditionalists, who consider him a sober and unimaginative technocrat. Mr Zedillo was mentioned as a possible presidential contender last year but was passed over because of his lack of political experience and party support. In a speech yesterday Mr Zedillo sought to unite the party around his candidacy by projecting himself as the heir to Mr Colosio. He fully embraced Mr Colosio's political programme, and signalled that he intends to capitalise on the enormous sympathy felt for the slain candidate both in and out of the party. 'The PRI does not begin a campaign, but continues one,' he said. 'We already have a precise diagnosis of the national problems that were elaborated with vision and lucidity by Luis Donaldo Colosio.' Yesterday Mr Fernando Ortiz Arana, president of the PRI, formally announced Mr Zedillo's candidacy, soon after taking himself out of contention. Mr Ortiz Arana had been Mr Zedillo's main rival for the nomination. In Mexican politics the president selects the PRI candidate after consultations with party leaders in a process known as the dedazo - or the pointing of the finger. President Salinas appears to have followed tradition and chosen Mr Zedillo just as he chose Mr Colosio. Mr Zedillo is from modest origins from the northern state of Baja California. He briefly studied at the University of Bradford, England, earned a PhD in economics from Yale University, then worked at Mexico's central bank. In 1988 he became budget minister at the age of 36, and in 1992 was appointed education minister. As education minister he oversaw important reforms that gave states greater control over education policy. However, he was widely criticised for putting out new school textbooks that revised the nationalist interpretation of Mexican history. Despite misgivings about Mr Zedillo's political talents, there had been no obvious alternative to him. Other eligible rivals either lacked government experience, or were not viewed as loyal followers of Mr Salinas. Candidates in the government were taken out of contention by Mexico's constitution, which prohibits ministers and governors from being nominated as presidential candidate six months before the election.</p>

			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPOSITES TAKE OFF;  </P> <P> WHILE SOME AEROSPACE SECTORS CONTRACT, THE SOUTHLAND'S MAKERS OF REINFORCED  PLASTICS TRY TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND.  </P> <P> When the Northrop B-2 Stealth bomber -- variously described as looking like a  bat, a whale or an alien spaceship -- lifted off a Mojave Desert runway for the  first time last July, world attention focused on the aircraft's unconventional  aerodynamic shape.  </P> <P> But the flight also signaled a major leap forward in the use of composite  materials, the reinforced plastics that are finally coming out of research labs  and into major production programs.  </P> <P> The aerospace industry has researched and tested composites for decades, but  only in the past several years have manufacturers made large-scale shifts to  lightweight composites from traditional aluminum for aircraft structure.  </P> <P> Although much of the aerospace industry faces a difficult contraction these  days, the specialty companies that have staked out positions in composites are  more concerned with managing explosive growth.  </P> <P> "We are growing at an average of 25% a year, said Stephen Gill, president of M.  C. Gill, a family-owned company in El Monte that specializes in making  composite floors, ducts and cargo liners. "I have been here for 25 years and  things have never looked better. If I could get the people in place, I could  double in size tomorrow."  </P> <P> As in past aerospace industry evolutions, Southern California has emerged as  the center of the composites industry, possessing a rich mix of major prime  contractors, large specialty subcontractors and smaller vendors of everything  from composite parts to capital equipment.  </P> <P> "I can't think of another area of the country that has more going for it than  Los Angeles," Thomas Hynes, owner of Composites Horizons, a Covina-based  producer of advanced composites for aerospace and health care.  </P> <P> A major impetus of recent growth has been the development and production of  stealth technology aircraft, which are designed to evade detection by enemy  radar. Composite materials play a central role in the ability of stealth  aircraft to absorb and deflect radar waves.  </P> <P> The B-2 bomber is possibly the most advanced aircraft in its use of composite  materials, although much is still secret. Northrop officials declined to  discuss the types of materials or the amount of materials used in the B-2, but  industry sources estimate that composites make up about 80% of the B-2  structure.  </P> <P> Composites are made of two essential ingredients: high-strength fibers that  have been woven into tape or broadcloth and polymers that bind the fabric into  a rigid and lightweight matrix. Carbon, graphite and glass are the most typical  fibers used. Epoxy, polyester and phenolics are the most typical polymers used.  </P> <P> In producing parts, the tape or broadcloth, which is impregnated with the  polymer, is laid down on to a mold that represents the shape and contour of the  part. Then, the entire piece is cured in an autoclave at a temperature of about  350 degrees and a pressure of 100 pounds per square inch.  </P> <P> The resulting part is typically 30% lighter than a comparable aluminum part and  has four times the fatigue life -- critical parameters in aircraft design. Such  parts can also be substantially stronger than aluminum because it is possible  to orient the fibers so that the part is strongest in the direction that bears  the greatest load.  </P> <P> Art Rosene, Northrop project engineer for advanced programs, said the  technology involved in producing the composite parts for the B-2 is just as  advanced as the aircraft itself.  </P> <P> In the early 1980s, Northrop built its Integrated Composites Center in Pico  Rivera at an abandoned Ford Motor car factory, part of a $1.2-billion  investment in new technology. Today, it is believed to be one of the biggest  composites fabrication facilities in the industry, Rosene said.  </P> <P> Rosene said Northrop has developed a computerized system that directly  transfers three-dimensional designs for aircraft parts to machine tools in the  factory. The company has also pioneered a new software system to automate the  production of composite parts, increasing both efficiency and accuracy.  </P> <P> Automating the fabrication of composite parts has been critical to increasing  their usage. Northrop has developed what it calls a geodetic software system  that permits complex contours to be built with automated tape-laying machines.  Other manufacturers, including Lockheed, assert that they have the same  capability.  </P> <P> "It is like trying to wrap masking tape around an orange," Rosene said. "No  matter how hard you try, there will be gaps where the tape doesn't touch the  orange."  </P> <P> So far, aerospace companies have turned to composites because they are best for  the mission of the aircraft or spacecraft, such as in the stealth technology  case.  </P> <P> The drawback with composites is  </P> <P> their cost, both for raw materials and labor. But automation is rapidly  bringing down the manufacturing cost, and aerospace experts say the day is  close at hand when composite parts can be built and assembled as cheaply as  aluminum.  </P> <P> "In most cases, you can't beat the cost of making individual parts out of  aluminum, but when you start putting the airplane together, that's where  composites really shine," said Arthur James, a Lockheed program manager at its  Composites Development Center in Burbank. "Most of the parts that make up an  airplane are pretty small, and it costs a lot of money to put them together.  So, we want to eliminate a lot of these smaller parts with more complex  composites."  </P> <P> In another vote of confidence for the future of composites and for the Southern  California aerospace industry, Lockheed is building a major composites  fabrication facility in Palmdale.  </P> <P> James said composites will make up 40% to 50% of the advanced tactical fighter,  the next-generation Air Force jet that is being developed in a competition  between Lockheed and Northrop. By comparison, the F-15 fighter developed in the  early 1970s had only 4% of its structural weight made up of composites.  </P> <P> In gross measures, the aerospace industry is rapidly increasing its use of  composites. Including both military and commercial sectors, the industry used  41.1 million pounds of composites in 1989, up from 39.4 million in 1988 and  36.4 million in 1987, according to Stuart Lee, technical director of the  Society of Materials and Process Engineers.  </P> <P> But in some specialized areas, particularly the use of high-strength carbon  fibers, growth is even more rapid. Consumption of carbon fiber composites is  projected to grow from 5.3 million pounds in 1988 to 11.3 million pounds in  1994.  </P> <P> The next big breakthrough in composites will be production of thermoplastic  composites, a breed apart from the current generation of thermoset composites.  </P> <P> With thermosets, the parts take their final shape in the autoclave. But with  thermoplastics, the heated laminates come out of the autoclave and are pressed  into their final form, much like metal is stamped in a press. Thermoplastics  could dramatically cut production costs and virtually eliminate current  environmental problems with emissions of volatile solvents and other toxics.  </P> <P> In addition to the big aerospace firms and smaller subcontractors, Southern  California has a huge supply industry, including six major firms that  impregnate fabric with polymers. They are called pre-preggers.  </P> <P> Hitco, Hexcel, Sargent-Fletcher, Air-Tec, Richmond Technology, Ferrow,  Ciba-Geigy, American Cyanamid, Fiberite and others also are players in the  local industry. Total employment is unknown but is believed to be in the tens  of thousands.  </P> <P> B. F. Goodrich makes composite aircraft brakes in Sante Fe Springs and is  moving into building high-temperature parts for the new National Aerospace  Plane, the craft that will take off like an airplane and soar into space like a  rocket.  </P> <P> The industrial infrastructure also includes three manufacturers of plastic  vacuum bags that are used in the autoclaves. One small vacuum bag maker,  Bondline Products in Norwalk, has as many patents as it has employees -- four.  It is making a line of reusable bags to displace the costly throwaway bags.  Cosby M. Newsom, president of the firm, said his technology can reduce by a  hundredfold the time that it takes to bag a part.  </P> <P> Even though Southern California has the largest pool of skilled aerospace  workers in the country, composites companies face a severe labor shortage.  </P> <P> "I have 30 companies looking for people," said Terry Price, chairman of the  department of manufacturing technology at Cerritos College, a major regional  center for composites studies. "Companies are just screaming for people. There  are jobs for lab technicians, salesmen, engineers, lay-up fabricators and  quality control inspectors."  </P> <P> Cerritos College is opening a 10,000-square-foot manufacturing technology  center for composites and plastics, James said, funded in part by a consortium  of local aerospace firms. Meanwhile, at the higher academic research level,  UCLA has become a leading center for research into high-temperature composites,  including ceramic, metal and carbon composites, according to Professor J. M.  Yang of the school's department of materials science and engineering.  </P> <P> THE GROWING USE OF COMPOSITES  </P> <P> Development of composites has reached the point where application is moving  from military sectors into the commercial sectors of the aerospace industry.  This raises expectations of revolutionary methods of airframe construction that  will considerably exceed the potential of most present-day eqiupment.  </P> <P> F-117A STEALTH FIGHTER: The Lockheed F-117A Stealth fighter makes the first  broad application of composites technology to a U.S military jet.  </P> <P> B-2 STEALTH BOMBER: The Northrop B-2 Stealth bomber is the first heavy aircraft  built mostly of composites, used extensively in its skin and in its structure.  The bomber has composite stringers, reinforcements that span its frames.  </P> <P> B-1 BOMBER: This present-day bomber has incorporated the use of composite  materials in the follwing places: 1) fuselage, 2) wings, 3) tailcone, 4) engine  inlets. Use of composite materials in the next generation of aircraft coming  into production will be even more widespread.  </P> <P> SLATS: Used to chamber the wing for high lift at low speeds and high angle of  attack.  </P> <P> WING TANKS: Fuel is housed in self-sealing tanks inside the entire wing.  </P> <P> TAILCONE: Houses a large part of the electronic countermeasures system.  </P> <P> VARIABLE GEOMETRY WING: The swing wing is moved into the swept position by  hydraulic screw jacks. The fully swept position is used for supersonic flight.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALS: MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> What do baseball and bankruptcy investing have in common? Easy. They're both  wonderful spectator sports, provided you know how the game is played. And in  both sports, you are constantly reminded that no matter how good a team's  players are or how rich the owner is, no one wins them all.  </P> <P> Today's example involves Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., perhaps the classiest  investment banking firm in the country, if not the world, and the thrashing it  received when it tried to take control of the bankruptcy of Wheeling-Pittsburgh  Steel Corp. Goldman is rich, powerful and smart. It even plans for the long  term, which is not only admirable, but almost unheard of among securities firms  these days. But Goldman isn't infallible, despite what many of its partners  would like the world to think.  </P> <P> Goldman decided in early 1989 to invest $15 million in the common stock of  Wheeling Pitt, which had been operating under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code  since 1985. Why buy stock in a bankrupt company, paying the seller something  like 150 times what he had paid for his shares? Because Goldman was convinced  that it could use that stock to influence the course of the bankruptcy, making  a ton of money for itself.  </P> <P> Along the way, Goldman would show the masses that Wall Street aristocrats can  outfight the junkyard dogs of bankruptcy investing. Bankruptcy investors, in  case you've never met one, are a particularly fierce, smart, proud and hungry  crew. They love making money, humiliating opponents, beating each other up--and  eating outsiders for lunch.  </P> <P> But instead of showing the commoners how it's done, Goldman showed everyone how  it shouldn't be done. Goldman has finally given up the fight, and is in the  process of departing the field of battle, having left behind a bit of its money  and a good hunk of its reputation for shrewd investing.  </P> <P> Making things even worse--or better, if you're one of Goldman's competitors--is  the fact that Goldman couldn't have picked a more inconvenient time to take its  bath in Wheeling Pitt.  </P> <P> Why? Because Goldman is in the midst of trying to round up $400 million  (minimum investment: $5 million) for a fund that will invest in securities of  bankrupt and near-bankrupt companies. Goldman is throwing in $100 million of  its own capital, making the fund's potential size a cool half billion dollars.  The fund is designed not only to buy securities of bankrupts and  near-bankrupts, but to influence the course of bankruptcies and corporate  reorganizations. Which is why Wheeling Pitt isn't a small pimple, but a running  sore.  </P> <P> Even though Goldman's sales materials for the fund show the firm to have a good  record in playing bankrupt securities, the one thing they always ask on Wall  Street is, 'What have you done lately?' And lately, unfortunately, Goldman has  Wheeling Pitt.  </P> <P> To understand what happened, you have to remember that in a bankruptcy, you  turn the normal world on its head. Under normal circumstances, a company's  common shareholders control the show, and the only right that creditors have is  to be paid on time and in full. But in a bankruptcy, unless there are very  unusual circumstances, the power lies with the company's creditors.  </P> <P> In the case of Wheeling Pitt, partnerships run by Ronald LaBow, a veteran  bankruptcy investor, seemed to have enough pieces of the right kind of paper to  control the outcome of the bankruptcy. Though Goldman isn't talking about this,  it's clear that the firm thought that LaBow's paper was vulnerable to attack.  Goldman also thought that this was a bankruptcy in which power lay with holders  of common stock.  </P> <P> Oh, well. After 14 months of sparring with LaBow and various other players, and  spending millions on legal fees--thank you, Goldman, for helping put more  lawyers' children through college--Goldman decided to throw in with LaBow's  plan rather than to keep letting its money and prestige continue going down the  drain.  </P> <P> 'The mistake they made was thinking they could control the bankruptcy by buying  common stock,' LaBow says.  </P> <P> While the success of LaBow's plan isn't assured--in bankruptcy investing, you  shouldn't count your profit until your securities have been sold and the check  has cleared the bank--the defeat of Goldman is certain, absent a miracle.  </P> <P> Goldman paid $8 a share for its Wheeling stock, more than any bankruptcy player  was willing to pay. As this is being written, Wheeling stock is below $8, and  seems to be headed downward. By some analysis, the LaBow plan values Wheeling  stock at $6 or less. But even if Wheeling stock goes above $8, Goldman is still  out a bunch of money, given legal fees and other expenses.  </P> <P> Goldman says that instead of harping on Wheeling Pittsburgh, we should look at  the profits the firm stands to make on its investment in Penrod Drilling. In  the Penrod bankruptcy, a group that includes Goldman, Texas investor Richard  Rainwater and a company that he controls are duking it out with Loews Corp. But  that paper profit isn't in the bank. And it's far from clear that is a Goldman  show rather than a Rainwater show.  </P> <P> Goldman, being full of smart people, may well end up doing a great job of  playing Bankruptcy Hardball. But so far, the score is Junkyard Dogs 1, Goldman  0. Best of three, anyone?  </P></p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: US fund to invest Dollars 1bn in China's car parts industry A new investment fund backed by US institutions plans to invest up to Dollars 1bn over the next three years in China's automotive components industry to take advantage of a boom in the vehicle sector. The Asian Strategic Investments Corporation (Asimco), through its China Automotive Components Group, plans an initial Dollars 160m investment in joint ventures with about a dozen local manufacturers. Mr Jack Perkowski, chairman of Asimco, said the company would bring 'experienced management and technology, as well as capital' to the components sector. Its aim is to become the largest components company in China. Shareholders in Asimco include Pacific Alliance Group, a Hong Kong and China-based merchant bank, and Dean Witter Capital Corporation and TCW Capital Investment Corporation, both of the US. Among Asimco's local partners will be the China National Automobile Industry Association (CNAIC), Norinco, China's largest integrated motor vehicle company, and the municipal government of Changchun, China's main vehicle manufacturing centre. Mr Perkowski said his organisation would take majority stakes in joint ventures and develop these into the dominant players in their respective segments of the market. China's automotive components sector is highly fragmented with some 4,000 manufacturers, many of them tiny operations. The CNAIC estimates that Dollars 20bn is required for the components industry to keep pace with developments in vehicle manufacturing. China's spare parts market is the fourth largest in the world, according to some estimates. The Chinese authorities will soon unveil a new car industry strategy which is expected to freeze the number of vehicle manufacturers, but it is likely that encouragement will be given to the components sector.</p>

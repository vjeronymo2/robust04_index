			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATTACKERS, REPORTERS CAN ATTEST: HIS HARD-HEADED IMAGE WAS REAL  </P> <P> As Reggie Smith walked to his car after a game late in the 1978 season, two  toughs attacked him in the nearly deserted Dodger Stadium parking lot.  </P> <P> One of the men broke the window of Smith's car and the other smashed a beer  bottle over Smith's head.  </P> <P> "People always told me I had a hard head," Smith said.  </P> <P> Enraged, Smith fought back. He mopped up the parking lot with his assailants,  sending them to the hospital. And after they had recovered, they were found  guilty of assault.  </P> <P> The two men had learned, as many others had, that it wasn't wise to challenge  Reggie Smith.  </P> <P> Smith was perceived as an angry young man, and he worked hard to maintain that  image. He snapped at sportswriters and fought with his teammates.  </P> <P> "(Sportswriters) created an image for me, and I tried to live up to it for the  sake of gaining an advantage," Smith said. "It probably cost me popularity, but  I never really cared about that.  </P> <P> "I felt I needed to put up a wall around myself to get ready to play the game.  I wasn't an angry man because when I got away from the park I left the ballgame  there.  </P> <P> "But there weren't too many people who knew me. Those that did laughed (at his  reputation)."  </P> <P> Smith comes across these days as a mellow fellow.  </P> <P> "I'm not playing now and I can be myself," he said. CHRIS BAKER  </P></p>

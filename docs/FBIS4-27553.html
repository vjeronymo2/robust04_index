			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Chinese Foreign Trade and  Economic Minister Wu Yi on Thursday [2 Jun] asked Japan to  exercise prudence in taking a unilateral measure to curb textile  imports from China.    Meeting Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister  Eijiro Hata in Tokyo, Wu said, "China is concerned about Japan's  invocation of a discriminatory curb on textile imports,"  according to ministry officials.    "Beijing cannot accept such a step," Wu was quoted as  saying.    The Chinese trade minister was referring to a set of rules  recently worked out by a Japanese Government panel for  activating a safeguard measure on textile imports under the  multifiber agreement (MFA).    The rules are designed to protect the Japanese textile  industry from possible damage following massive textile imports,  especially from China.    Japanese trade minister Hata said Tokyo is prepared to  discuss the issue with China on a working-level.    Wu said China will strive to make its textile exports  orderly, the officials told reporters.    The remark hints at Beijing's preparedness to introduce a  voluntary curb on textile exports to Japan in order to prevent  Japanese invocation of the safeguard measure.    During the one-hour meeting, Wu requested that Japan map out  a framework for its fourth yen-loan program for China, the  ministry officials said.    Hata replied that Japan will work out specifics of 60  projects being selected under the five-year lending program from  1996 "as early as possible," they said.    Hata was quoted as saying Japan will support China's early  admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).  But there remain various problems to clear the way for  Beijing's smooth entry to GATT, including China's quantitative  import restrictions, dual pricing systems and inconsistent  enforcement of administrative rules between the central  government and local governments, Hata said.    "China should reform these domestic systems so that its  economy can be incorporated into the global economic system at  an early time," he said.    Wu arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday for an eight-day visit to  Japan aimed at encouraging Japanese investment in China. She is  the first Chinese cabinet minister to visit Japan since the  government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was formed in late  April.</p>

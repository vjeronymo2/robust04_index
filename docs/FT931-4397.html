			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / People: D C Gardner Chris Cawcutt, who resigned as personnel director of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew last September, shortly after the sacking of the head of research Terry Smith, has turned up as a partner of fledgling consultants Fairplace. Set up six months ago by Colin Gardner, founder of publicly quoted consultancy group D C Gardner, Fairplace now has 10 partners, including 49-year-old Cawcutt, and specialises in management development strategies, principally for City firms. Cawcutt has spent most of his career in personnel, including ten years at Ford and a spell later at Lloyd's agency Merrett. After two years on the management consultancy side of Touche Ross, he moved to UBS P&amp;D in 1989. He is now at pains to downplay the role of the Terry Smith affair in his departure. 'I resigned because I felt I had come to a stage in my career where I wanted more control over my own destiny,' he said yesterday. ***** Joe Hinton, president of Mobil Europe, will retire on April 1 and be succeeded by Bill Walsh who is currently vice president for Middle East and Marine Transportation. Walsh is based in Mobil headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia, but will soon move to London. Mobil Europe is responsible for the oil company's refining and marketing operations in Europe - a separate division covers exploration and production. The company changed its previously geographical organisation to restructure along functional lines when Hinton took over in 1991. Walsh has been with Mobil for 35 years, including a previous stint in London as vice-president of manufacturing and supply.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Armenian president faces stiff protests ARMENIAN President Levon Ter-Petrosian yesterday defended himself against a growing tide of opposition to his handling ofthe war with neighbouring Azerbaijan. Last night he won a parliamentary motion of no-confidence after three days of protests in the capital sparked by a series of Armenian setbacks in the war. Observers said that up to 50,000 people attended a rally in Yerevan last Friday, in which speakers demanded that Mr Ter-Petrosian resign. 'If I saw Ter-Petrosian, I'd kill him,' said Mr Valeri Mirzaian, 46, an Armenian soldier who attended an opposition rally on Sunday night at Yerevan's Liberty Square. 'We're not losing Karabakh. We're losing Armenia.' The four-year old war is centred on the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, which lies entirely within Azerbaijan. But the fighting has recently spilled over into other areas. The weekend protesters in Yerevan expressed dismay with Azeri success in capturing several Armenian enclaves lying within Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan controls the north of Nagorno-Karabakh, or one-fourth of the enclave. Last week, Azerbaijan also captured the Armenian region of Artsvashen. Mr Ter-Petrosian is thought still to enjoy majority support in the republic of 3.3m people. But 'the opposition is growing stronger every day,' said a western diplomat in Yerevan. Mr Raffi Hovannisian, the foreign minister, defended the president's policies, and said Armenia might 'reply in kind' to Azeri bombing last week of border villages. Mr Hovannisian also said the government might declare emergency rule 'in the immediate future' in those regions bordering Azerbaijan. 'Azerbaijan is carrying out a military final solution,' he said.</p>

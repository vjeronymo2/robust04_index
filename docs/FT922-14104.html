			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: PM appeals on ticket of '10 Tory truths' MR JOHN Major last night stressed traditional Conservative values such as strong defence and trade union reform - what he called '10 Tory truths' - as he invoked the government's achievements since 1979 with his own record and his aims for Britain. At his last rally of the campaign, he made a personal appeal to voters, telling his 1,000-strong audience at Wembley Conference Centre in London: 'I have only just begun the tasks I have set myself. 'I ask this nation to look at my record of service and my ideals for the future, to place their trust in me, and in this party, that has served them so well and faithfully.' His own experiences, he said, meant that he understood 'what makes the heart of Britain beat'. In spite of the opinion polls continuing to show a slight Labour lead and a day's campaigning that was at best low-key, the mood on the Major tour is relentlessly cheerful. This final rally broadly followed the format of others in the campaign but was given some razzmatazz by the presence of Ms Cilla Black, video tributes from Mr Douglas Hurd and Mr Michael Heseltine - Mr Major's opponents in the contest for the party leadership following Mrs Thatcher's resignation - and the distribution to the audience of flags, hats and party poppers. In an upbeat, effective performance, the prime minister set out his vision of a Europe of nation states, and of economic recovery in Britain together with both cuts in taxation and higher spending on public services. While most of his '10 truths' promised more of the same for a fourth term. It was notable that the message on privatisation merely referred backwards to the changes that had already been made. Mr Major's speech also contained stark warnings about the effects of a Labour victory. He said that there would be a steep and immediate drop in the value of homes, shares and pensions if Labour won, and underlined the prospect of greater powers for trade union leaders. Labour would mean, he said, perhaps the biggest transfer of wealth away from personal ownership that the UK had seen. 'It would be a massacre of the innocents by the ignorant.' Mr Neil Kinnock came under a fierce attack, as the prime minister accused him of the 'anything-for-office' syndrome, in which no belief was indispensable. 'To what principles, to what beliefs would the Labour leader resort when the going is tough? Labour would be a rudderless ship in a storm-tossed sea,' he said. He also condemned Mr Kinnock's offer to open discussions on proportional representation. PR was 'nothing to do with fair play; everything to do with power play', he said.</p>

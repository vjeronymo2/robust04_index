			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Lloyd's may change debt recovery rule Lloyd's of London yesterday provoked a fresh confrontation with lossmaking Names by unveiling plans intended to ensure damages won in court by Names for negligence are used to settle their outstanding debts at the insurance market. Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, said the rule change was a response to pressure from members who had settled accounts and were annoyed at those who had not. But action groups representing Names said the move was likely to be challenged in the courts. 'Many burnt Names have taken the most horrendous risks in pursuing legal action,' said Mr Tom Benyon, director of the Society of Names, which represents lossmaking members. 'Now many will feel it's 'tails they lose, heads Lloyd's wins'.' He said a one-month consultation period on the plans announced by Lloyd's was 'a fig leaf'. The change - subject to Department of Trade and Industry approval - would affect the deeds of 'premium trusts' held by Names, whose assets have traditionally supported the market. These funds are used for receiving premiums on behalf of members and for paying out claims and profits. To protect those taking out insurance polices at Lloyd's, the insurance market has set up a 'central fund' which is used to pay claims when Names' funds are not sufficient. Currently the corporation is pursuing members for Pounds 1.2bn paid on their behalf. A 1992 court case made clear compensation payments for negligence did not have to be paid into the premium trusts. Lloyd's intention is that in future they should - up to the level required to cover Names' outstanding liabilities. The rule change may well have been provoked by the question mark over whether members of the Gooda Walker Action Group would use damages which it won in the High Court earlier this month, to settle debts with Lloyd's. But the right of Lloyd's to make payments on behalf of Names out of the central fund is already being challenged in a separate court action. Moreover, Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said Names owed money to many sources, including banks, and the rule change amounted to an attempt by Lloyd's to become a preferential creditor. He said Lloyd's was trying to alter the terms of its contract with Names without their consent.</p>

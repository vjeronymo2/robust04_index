			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lyell declines to advise on treaty SIR NICHOLAS LYELL, the attorney-general, yesterday took refuge behind deputy speaker Mr Michael Morris in declining to advise MPs on whether they could reverse the government's opt-out from the Maastricht treaty's social chapter, David Owen writes. Questioned by Labour frontbencher Mr John Fraser, Sir Nicholas said he was 'surprised' to be invited to comment on an amendment to the bill which Mr Morris was still considering whether MPs would be able to debate. Mr Fraser had asked whether an amendment tabled by Mr Calum MacDonald, Labour MP for Western Isles, or any other, would be an effective route via which MPs could adopt the social chapter.</p>

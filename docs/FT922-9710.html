			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Prince Charming finds his Cinderella: Michael Heseltine outlines his strategy for the trade and industry department WHEN Mr Michael Heseltine was offered the job of trade and industry secretary three weeks ago he chose to revive the title of president of the board of trade. It is a potent symbol of the political clout he has brought to a job that had become one of the Cinderellas of successive Conservative administrations. Already his staff refer to him simply as 'the president'. But Mr Heseltine is also a political realist. If he is to deliver a partnership between government and industry  - mapped out during his political exile under Mrs Margaret Thatcher  - there will be battles to be fought, not least with the Treasury. So yesterday it took 30 minutes to prise from him a phrase to encapsulate his new role in Mr John Major's government: 'My job is to help British industry to win . . . commerce and industry to win.' Speaking to the FT in his first interview since his appointment, Mr Heseltine was concerned to damp speculation that he had arrived with a bagful of instant solutions. 'I know that industrial success, commercial success is essentially a long-term phenomenon,' he said. 'The great danger is to try to adopt the psychology of the fairy godmother.' He intends to build a closer relationship between government and industry  - to establish over time what he calls an industrial strategy. Yet he is not in the business of raising expectations that he cannot meet. His starting point is that his advocacy of such a strategy is still misunderstood. For others it conjures up images of 'picking winners' or subsidies for sunset industries. He said: 'What I have always meant by an industrial strategy is an awareness in government of the impact that government can have on industry as a consequence of the many interfaces between the role of government and the wealth-creating process.' That rather long-winded explanation can be condensed as follows: since government decisions are constantly impinging on the nation's businesses, it is up to the DTI to introduce some coherence into the process. Mr Heseltine promises to be a sympathetic listener. His predecessors  - Mr Peter Lilley and Mr Nicholas Ridley  - never managed to persuade industrial leaders that they particularly cared about anything beyond deregulation. Their successor likes dialogue. 'I've always believed in all government departments, including this one, that you should talk and listen carefully to the industries, to the companies, which you sponsor.' It was such dialogue, he added, that led to the creation of the European Space Agency and brought lucrative contracts for British industry from the European Fighter Aircraft project. 'Some people believe that talking to people is a sign of weakness,' he said. 'I've never believed that.' What about action? In his books, Mr Heseltine had after all set out in some detail how the DTI should co-ordinate government industrial strategy. It should replace the Treasury in the lead role at a strengthened National Economic Development Office. A cabinet committee should be established to take a broad view of departmental decisions which affect business. Mergers policy should be less tightly drawn to include a wider judgment of the national interest as well as the impact on competition of proposed mergers and takeovers. Here Mr Heseltine became distinctly cagey. He did not disavow completely such ambitions but was careful to stress that they were not prerequisites. A new cabinet committee under his direction was a matter 'for the prime minister'. It was perfectly possible to take a strategic view of government's relations with industry within existing cabinet committees. On mergers policy  - perhaps the most sensitive of his responsibilities  - he will say practically nothing. His approach to the battle for Midland Bank between Lloyds Bank and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation should reveal some of his thinking. For now, though, he insists that any change in the so-called Tebbit doctrine would require a collective decision by the cabinet. 'I have inherited a set of (merger) policies, Until and unless any announcements are made those policies prevail.' So what were his immediate priorities? Some set themselves. Britain's forthcoming presidency of the European Community will put Mr Heseltine in the driving seat of efforts to complete the single market. His concern was that the regulations that gave force to that market did not end up representing a 'cloying intervention in the marketplace'. The legal framework had to be sufficiently flexible to adapt to a fast-moving competitive environment. Completion of the stalled Uruguay round of trade talks was also essential if British industry was to take full advantage of the opportunities on the international horizon. Closer to home, Mr Heseltine was unsure whether industry appreciated the scale of the opportunities that were already there to be taken. His suspicion was that the government's advice had too often been getting through to only a 'relatively thin strata'. He would be looking closely at improvements in the 'delivery' of advice from Whitehall. He then came up with a phrase that is likely to figure prominently in his public pronouncements - 'incremental excellence'. Instead of looking for instant solutions, the government needed to look constantly and comprehensively at all its policies to ensure that they helped to foster wealth creation. On one level, that meant sticking with macro-economic policies that provided stability and fostered enterprise. On another, it meant ensuring that policies such as those for education and training provided industry with the quality of recruits they needed. He would also be constantly on the alert to ensure that government decisions did not inadvertently impede industrial success. It was, he concluded, 'the aggregation of all these policies that adds up to an industrial strategy'.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THIS BOY'S LIFE A MEMOIR BY TOBIAS WOLFF (HARPER &amp; ROW:  $8.95)  </P> <P> Readers may find it difficult to believe that the subject of this arresting  autobiography survived his unhappy childhood to become a highly respected  writer rather than a convict on death row. His efforts to escape from his  abusive stepfather and ineffectual mother lead Tobias Wolff to lie, cheat,  steal, drink, run away and forge checks.  </P> <P> He changes his from name "Tobias," an old name in his father's family, to  "Jack" in a gesture of rejection, but he lies and falsifies transcripts to gain  admission to the exclusive prep school his father and brother attended. The  author spares neither his audience nor himself: He was clearly an incorrigible  thug as a youth, but his pain is so overwhelming that the reader longs to  comfort him rather than discipline him. Wolff's vigorous, straightforward prose  makes "This Boy's Life" a darkly memorable book.  </P></p>

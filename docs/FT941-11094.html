			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Private View: Musical mystery man Icons hung on the walls and a candle flickered on the mantelpiece. In the corner stood the concert grand on which John Tavener composes his music. This room in the Sussex countryside is a sanctum in every sense of the word. Tavener was 50 last week and for his birthday he was given a four-day festival of his work. For a modern composer of serious music whose spirit dwells in the Byzantine Age he enjoys a remarkable - some might say mysterious - popularity. He even gets fan mail, from teenagers. Two years ago a recording of The Protecting Veil, a cello piece dedicated to the Mother of God, went to the top of the classical charts for several months. ('Not one of my favourite pieces,' he says. 'In fact, I'm sick to death of hearing it.') I asked: Is your music the product of religious belief? Or the other way round? The composer paused and dreamily quoted a line of Yeats - 'the singing chant of my soul' - before continuing: 'In a way they are inseparable, because writing music to me becomes more and more, as I grow older, an act of prayer. 'I don't think there is anything new about this. It seems to irritate some people - certainly some critics - that they seem to have forgotten that in almost every civilisation except the western this has always been the case.' With hindsight, he said, the religious experience that prompted him to write music was hearing Stravinky's Canticum Sacrum at the age of 12. 'I never wrote music that was totally secular, even before my conversion to the Orthodox church.' Whether or not he is descended from his 16th century namesake, another writer of sacred music, Tavener was precociously talented. He was barely in his teens when he started to compose, and he studied to become a concert pianist. As a youth he would entertain his aristocratic godmother and her friends at parties by playing nursery rhymes in the style of any composer or improvising a musical character sketch of somebody in the room. Tavener's background is Scottish Presbyterian and, like his father before him, he played the organ in a Presbyterian church. 'That made no spiritual impact on me whatsoever, except, I suppose, a sentimental love of hymns which I think I've just about lost.' As a student he flirted with Roman Catholicism, but, repelled by its emphasis on punishment and hell, was received into the Russian Orthodox church at the age of 33. 'I'm not a sort of crank who plays a bit with this and the other; but I read books, particularly Ananda Cooramaswami who has far more penetrating things to say about Christianity than most so-called Christian writers in the west today. It doesn't surprise me that so few young people in the west have little time for Christianity. It compromises so much with modernism.' What do you mean by 'modernism'? 'For me modernism is anything that has no connection with tradition, has no connection with symbolism, has no connection with metaphysics.' And surprisingly, he added: 'It's basically what our future king advocates. I think we are extremely lucky to have someone who feels as deeply as he does.' What would you say to being called a reactionary? 'I don't think it's a question of being reactionary. You see, tradition is something that stems from God himself therefore you can't talk in terms of being reactionary. A modernist would say I was reactionary. I can understand that. But in that case I'm very glad to be a reactionary.' He laughed. Pointing to a collection of records, he said he had listened to all the moderns: Stockhausen, Berio, Ligeti, Boulez, but found it all 'totally meaningless'. He prefers the music of Sufism, Byzantium or Russian chant while continuing to venerate Bach. But he has a special weakness for Mozart's Magic Flute. For you music is primarily a religious medium? 'I think it's totally that.' So when music came out of the churches and into the court that was the beginning of the end? He laughed. 'For me it started to go downhill' You would have to say the same about painting, I said. 'Yes. I would. Possibly even more strongly.' He pointed to an icon. But there would have been no Cezanne, no Monet . . . 'That wouldn't matter to me. On the other hand you can't say God only operates in a middle eastern context. I realise I can't take this point of view to an absurd stage. I particularly agree about the Impressionists. I love them. They are much more like icons because they are not literal. Where I stumble is with so-called religious art in the Renaissance, where you see a fat woman with a fat baby. It doesn't inspire in me the same veneration because it lacks the gnosis - another word we have lost.' Music was God-inspired, but that did not make it easy. 'It's much tougher than people think. One is brought up with the idea that music has got to be complicated, got to be interesting, to follow an argument. It takes a vast amount of thought to make music simpler, stripping it of complexity.' Are other composers self-indulgent not to make music about God? 'It's not really for me to judge. Obviously their music falls, as far as I am concerned, on deaf ears. That's all I can say.' Talk of self-indulgence prompted me to ask whether behind the modest manner and devotional writing there lurked a secret vanity. Almost every page of the festival programme carried his photograph and I recalled the moment when Tavener strode theatrically down the aisle of Westminster Cathedral, coat draped nonchalantly over his shoulders and long hair flowing, to take the applause for Ultimos Ritos. Yes, the composer said, he had a personality problem - he found it hard to say No, to photographers or anybody with a job to do. 'Have I the right to say I won't be photographed? It's a kind of humility.' And the hairstyle? 'I've always had it long. I'm losing it terribly on the front and . . . It really isn't conscious.' Later, he said: 'There are paradoxes in my life. I love old cars; I've had a succession of old Bentleys. I don't think that's a bad part of me, just another part of me.' It may, however, be an important fact about Tavener that his life is hostage to serious hereditary heart trouble, related to a condition known as Marfan's syndrome which affects the connective tissue of some tall people. He is 6ft 5in and thin, with long, tapering fingers. Rachmaninov, he thinks, was another sufferer. He has had major surgery, and tires easily. These bouts of illness he takes as a divine signal. What did the signal mean? 'That giving into despair is the wrong idea and that I still had to keep going.' A sign that you were paying for something? 'The fact it's taken me so long to be able to cope with the idea of marriage,' he said. (Tavener's first marriage, to a Greek dancer, was short-lived. In 1991 he married Maryanna Schaefer and they have a fat five-month-old daughter, Theodora.) 'I think in this last illness when I came so close to death I realised that the only way to live was to live at all risks, otherwise there is no point in living at all.' Did selfishness stop you? 'Yes. Absolute selfishness and the fact that it would interfere with my precious work - that I couldn't have children because they'd make such a noise. Now I have child, and thank God.' Are you so prolific because of your illness? 'I'm much more aware of mortality, even though it seems ridiculous when one thinks of it. Who really cares whether I write any more music or not? I mean, in the light of eternity, is it so important? And yet it seems the most important thing in the world. It must seem like that, otherwise what the hell's the point of doing it?' What would you like to do, say you have done, before it catches you . . . 'Before death,' he corrected. 'Um. Obviously, even though I have a wife and a child, the most important thing for me still is music. So, it would be to make music actually become meaningful, not in a way that Romantic music is meaningful but in the way it was at the time of say, Plato, when the right notes had to be found before parliament could be opened. So that music was so sacred, so much part of life . . . 'Of course, I can't do it. Stockhausen believes he can do such a thing and Scriabin thought he could bring the world to an end by inventing a certain mathematical chord. There is a danger of going completely cuckoo.' If you were to hold a cuckoo theory would it be that certain sounds, combinations or pitches can reach certain parts of the human psyche? 'Of the human spirit, not psyche. That's right. I think you've got it. Absolutely. It would be impossible, but that would be my cuckoo thought. 'Music has become so abstract and so unconnected with anything that at least I have reinstated some of the sacred backing to art.' To save music from total disintegration? 'That's what I really believe.'</p>

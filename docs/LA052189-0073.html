			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: KINGDOM COME "IN YOUR FACE." POLYGRAM **: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A  SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Wow, Kingdom Come's second album almost doesn't sound like Led Zeppelin! If the  band starts to Zep out, singer Lenny Wolf tones down the Robert Plant stylings.  If Wolf gets a little Plant-ish, then the music pulls back on the Zep vibe. In  places, the group even sounds more like AC/DC! Seriously, though, this record  does take a step up from the quintet's debut, which sold a ton but brought the  band ridicule for being a total Zep clone. On a couple of songs here --  "Perfect 'O' " and the hypnotic "Gotta Go" -- Kingdom Come shows that it's  starting to learn how to blend its own heavy-handed personality with its  influences.

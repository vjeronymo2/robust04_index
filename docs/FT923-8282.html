			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Letter: The means to pay restraint end need to be stronger Sir, In your leader, 'Pay restraint and the ERM' (August 6), the aim is admirable, but the means suggested to achieve it need strengthening. You recommend that 'the government should state categorically that it will not accept settlements in excess of 2 per cent next year . . .', but progress could be made on settlements still outstanding this year. The wage rise for 40,000 firefighters falls due in November and should be based on upper quartile male earnings increases 1991-1992, expected to be at least 6 per cent. A 6.5 per cent rise for 120,000 police from September 1 has not yet been ratified. And 10,000 National Health Service managers have their pay decided by a secretary of state decision which has yet to be finalised. You say 'now is not the best time to cut public employment', but settlements for the 1.5m local authority workers cannot be controlled until July 1993 (white collar) and September 1993 (manuals). Manpower reductions are the only way to make immediate savings. Finally, settlement norms which apply equally across the board are inefficient. Increases only where extra revenue generated exceeds the additional expenditure, or where the adverse consequences of persisting with existing rates outweigh the benefits of increasing them, may be a better way to get the desired result.

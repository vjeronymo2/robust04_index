			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Tide of malaise that threatens to engulf Major - Ian Davidson strips away the political drama and finds the EC facing profound historical choices THE British government lives in fear that the European summit it is hosting in Edinburgh tomorrow and Saturday will turn out to be a total disaster. If the omens of failure prove true, the Community will be precipitated into a deep political crisis; and there will be a chorus of denunciation from the other member states, blaming it all on Britain. Strictly speaking, such denunciations will be unjustified; they will also be beside the point. The immediate symptom of the crisis is the rejection of the Maastricht treaty by the Danish electorate in their referendum last June. The British government may have made that crisis much worse, by its prevarication in the House of Commons, and its undisguised dissent from the underlying objectives of the treaty in Brussels. But in a broader perspective, it is clear that the looming drama of Edinburgh is really the symptom of a profound malaise which reaches far deeper, and goes far wider, than anything which Mr John Major could be expected to devise for good or ill. For what is germinating in the European Community is a three-dimensional crisis in the true meaning of the term; a moment of truth, a decisive choice point, and possibly a parting of the ways. The first of these is a crisis about the relationship between the founding member states and some of the later arrivals; the second is about the objectives of the Community and how far the integration process can or should go; the third is about the size of the Community, and whether it can take in a large number of new members without a profound change in its character and/or its constitution. The first is really short-hand for Britain's ambivalence over the purposes of the European Community as laid down by the original Six. Mr Major says repeatedly that he wants Britain to be 'at the heart of Europe'; perhaps he thinks he means it; surely he must see that it is vital for Britain's future; but it is his misfortune that British ambivalence towards the Community model of Europe appears to be as visceral and as uncomprehending today as it was 35 years ago when the then British government declined to take part in the drafting of the Treaty of Rome. Some of the newest of today's Twelve, like Spain and Portugal, have become almost as unconditional in their commitment to Community integration as the Six founding members. The British, by contrast, have never liked the integrationist Community devised by the others, and despite 20 years of membership, they are still trying to turn it into a loose free-trade area. This unresolved British quarrel with the European Community is now reaching its climax in the second layer of the three-dimensional crisis, over the Maastricht treaty. British ministers do not care to be told that their government does not like this treaty and never has. But there is no getting away from the fact that the British opt-out from monetary union, described by Mr Major as a triumphant victory, is not merely a signal diminution of the British commitment to the objectives of the treaty, but is all of a piece with those Danish reservations which may yet bring the treaty to grief. British ministers consistently minimise the significance of Maastricht, in some cases going so far as to claim that the treaty will make the Community less federalist than it would otherwise be. And yet it is hard to reconcile such minimalism with a treaty whose most conspicuous objectives are monetary union and a common foreign policy. The fate of the Maastricht treaty now depends solely on the Danes. For if they were to get another No, in a second referendum, the British government would abandon the attempt to ratify it in the House of Commons. In this uncertainty, British officials talk the double language of ambivalence. Maastricht is deeply flawed, they say, because it is intellectually messy, because it is too ambitious in political terms, and above all because recent events have proved that monetary union is unworkable. And yet it is essential to ratify the treaty, because that will avert a crisis, and we shall then be able to reach pragmatic compromises in the real world. But the fundamental British interest in ratifying the treaty is that it would stave off a split in the Community, in which an inner core would move ahead towards closer economic, monetary and political integration. British officials are too blase about this. While France and Germany and the Benelux would undoubtedly prefer the Community to stay together, British officials translate such a preference into an absolute priority, claiming that France in particular could not really tolerate a mini-Europe, which would lead to progressive French subordination to Germany. This analysis may prove correct; the problem is its British perspective; for it may underestimate once again the force of the integrationist urge on the continent, especially between France and Germany. There are obvious drawbacks in a mini-Europe; but in the past the British have too often paid the price for assuming that others think the same way as they do. Finally there is the crisis of Community enlargement, which will move to the top of the agenda if the Maastricht treaty is ratified. The conventional wisdom is that the Community can admit new members from Efta without changing the rules, because they are rich, developed and western European. Only later, with a subsequent wave of new members, would it be necessary to rewrite the treaty. Everyone knows this is Panglossian nonsense. With 16 or 17 members, decision-making under current arrangements would become virtually impossible; with 25 it would cease altogether. This issue cannot be postponed until Poland and Hungary are at the gates, because the admission of the Finns and the Swedes will determine the institutional terms of the next enlargement. Yet the Germans insist that enlargement is necessary, and even the French have now started talking the same way. The advantage of ratifying Maastricht, from a British perspective, is that it is one way of shelving the long-standing ideological argument between the inter-governmentalists and the federalists. The problem is that it opens the door to what will become a very much larger Community. Such a Community would certainly need a new constitution, and probably an explicitly federal constitution at that.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Zhang Baifa, executive vice mayor of Beijing </F> Municipality and vice chairman of the board of directors of the  China Urban Development Research Society, at the third congress  of the China Urban Development Research Society, entitled:  "Priorities of Beijing's Urban Construction" -- on 9 June]    [Text] Under the leadership and concern of the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council, Beijing, the capital of China,  has presented itself before the people in the world with a  completely new appearance of "ancient cultural city and modern  city."    Beijing is the political and cultural center of China as  well  as a center in which China contacts with foreign countries. To  meet the demand of this nature, Beijing has built, over the past  40 years or so, some 10 million square meters of buildings for  the use of administrative organs, foreign affairs offices,  cultural and sports centers, scientific research institutes, and  institutions of higher learning. Since the commencement of  reform and opening up, Beijing has also built a number of  modernized guesthouses, hotels, diplomatic apartments, and  office buildings, that are mainly used to do business with and  serve foreign firms and nationals. The building of these  administrative, cultural, and international contacting  facilities has strengthened the function as the capital, and, at  the same time, promoted the development of the secondary and  tertiary industries. From 1949 to 1993, Beijing's industrial  output value rose from 170 million yuan to 125.6 billion yuan,  and the volume of retail sales of commodities rose from 280  million yuan to 54.9 billion yuan, thus having greatly enhanced  the economic strength of Beijing.    Meanwhile, Beijing expanded the scope of the areas under its  jurisdiction on five occasions, with the total area expanding  from 707 square km to 16,800 square km and with the area of  plan-covered urban districts developing to 1,040 square km.  Beijing's permanent population increased from 4.14 million to  10.51 million, of which, the permanent population in urban areas  increased from 1.76 million to 6.65 million. The total floor  space of houses of various kinds increased from 20.50 million  square meters to 220 million square meters, of which, the floor  space of residences in urban areas increased from 13.54 million  square meters to 115 million square meters.    Cities are the carrier of economic and social development.  The more rapidly the economy and society develop, the higher is  the demand on urban construction. For a municipal government, a  very important duty is to beef up urban construction with a view  to providing conditions and service for the development of all  professions and trades. Since urban construction touches upon a  multitude of things and trades, it is necessary to give  prominence to key trades and use them to bring along non-key  ones. Viewing from the practice in the past and from the  development in the future, we must, in the content of  construction, accelerate the building of urban infrastructure  and residences, and, in the links of work, successfully grasp  urban planning and the reform of urban construction economic  structure. Then, I want to give a brief speech on these four  issues.  <H5>  1. On the Issue of Firmly and Unswervingly Putting the </H5> Construction of Urban Infrastructure in the First Place of Urban  Construction    Urban infrastructure is the ordinary condition for the  production of materials and for the livelihood of the people and  is the foundation on which a city depends to exist and develop.  If a plant is cut off from communications, posts and  telecommunications, water, coal, electricity, gas, and heat  facilities, its production will be in a state of chaos and even  stop. If a family is cut off from these facilities, it will  feel very inconvenient in livelihood and even be unable to lead  a life. These facilities are even more frequently utilized and  consumed by guesthouses, hotels, and shopping centers. A city  will be at a standstill if it is cut off from these facilities  for a short while and will be at a low ebb if being cut off from  these facilities for a long period of time. In a certain period  before the commencement of reform and opening up, Beijing failed  to put the construction of urban infrastructure in a due place,  and, therefore, it suffered, like other big, medium-sized, and  small cities in the country, the shortages of communications,  postal, and telecommunications facilities, the insufficient  supply of water, electricity, gas, and heat, poor environmental  conditions, and the low ability in guarding against natural  calamities.    Over the past 10 years or so since the implementation of  the reform and open policies, Beijing has regarded the  construction of urban infrastructural facilities as the primary  task for urban construction. Over the past 14 years, Beijing  has invested 29.3 billion yuan in fixed assets of urban  infrastructural facilities, an increase of 270 percent over the  figure in the past 30 years before 1979. A group of key basic  transportation, postal and telecommunications, energy resource,  water supply and drainage, environmental, and disaster-combating  projects have been built.    Although Beijing has rapidly developed the urban  infrastructural facilities, it is still confronted with some  difficulties. To be an internationally modernized large city,  Beijing should rely on the diversion of water from south to  north in order to ensure the supply of water for the urban  areas, place hope on Shaanxi's natural gas supply in order to  ensure the supply of gas for the urban areas, and vigorously  develop underground railway tracks and light railway tracks in  order to alleviate the traffic jams. A considerable number of  capital must be spent in these huge projects. Thus, the burden  is heavy. We have not found more feasible countermeasures for  resolving some of the difficulties, such as central heat supply  and garbage disposal. To this end, the construction of urban  infrastructural facilities should be regarded as a priority in  urban construction. We have to do so not only in the past and  at present but also in the future.  <H5>  2. On the Issue of Improving the Living Standards </H5>   A stable life can set the people's minds at rest. When  living in peace, the people can work in contentment. Only when  the people live and work in peace and contentment will society  be stable, there be a relaxed environment for reform, and the  economic and social development ceaselessly be elevated to a new  height. Therefore, Beijing has paid full attention to the  construction of residential houses. Since the founding of the  PRC, Beijing has built more than 100 million square meters of  residential houses, accounting for more than 50 percent of the  municipality's total houses. Particularly, since the  implementation of the reform and open policies, the municipality  has expanded the dynamics of developing new areas and rebuilding  old towns. So, more than 5 million square meters of residential  houses were built annually, and about 80,000 to 100,000  households moved to new houses every year. As of the end of  1993, there were 115 million square meters of urban residential  houses, and the per capita land use areas reached 12.5 square  meters. More than 90 percent of the households attained the  level of "being seperately accommodated." In the past three  years, the municipality completely solved the problems for the  households with housing difficulties whose per capita housing  area was less than 2 square meters. Through reconstruction of  the houses in dangerous conditions, the municipality solved the  housing problems for 56,000 households whose houses were in  dangerous conditions. More than 70 percent of the houses are  built with their own kitchens and toilets. The interior designs  have been developed toward the orientation of "large living  rooms, kitchens, rest rooms, small bedrooms, and more closets."  Through overall development, the municipality has strengthened  the construction of auxiliary facilities. Thus, the living  environment has noticeably improved.    But, the urban permanent population has increased by 4.89  million due to the rapid development of the urban areas in the  municipality since the founding of the PRC. Along with the  long-term implementation of the low-rent welfare housing system,  nearly 200,000 households are still living in the conditions  that per capita living space is less than 4 square meters, and  more than 8 million square meters of dangerous and shabby houses  are in urgent need of reconstruction. Some 100,000 urban  permanent population will increase with each passing year in the  future. So, the municipality's strained housing situation is  extremely serious. The central authorities set forth the  requirement for being comparatively well-off by 2000. The  municipal party committee and government set forth the  requirement for being fairly well-off three years ahead of  schedule, including that for being fairly well-off in the  housing conditions. There are three standards for being fairly  well-off in the housing conditions. First, the per capita  housing area reaches 14 square meters. Second, more than 80  percent of the houses are built with their own kitchens and  toilets. Third, the problems that the per capita housing area  is under 4 square meters should completely be solved, and the  problems that the per capita housing areas are less than 5 or 6  square meters should partially be solved. It is more difficult  to attain the third standard. The key to attaining this  standard hinges on that whether or not the housing problems for  the households with low and medium-level incomes can be solved.  To this end, we should focus our efforts on grasping the  following two tasks in the foreseeable future.    First, we should carry out the project to provide  comfortable houses. On the one hand, we should do a good job in  registering and verifying the low and medium-income households  which have housing difficulties, clarifying who and where they  are and their number. On the other hand, work responsibilities  should be assigned to every level of different departments and  different areas to build and collect housing resources through  five channels. Housing construction funds should be shared by  the government, the work units, and individuals, with the  government responsible for the 10 categories of local  construction taxes and fees, individuals purchasing houses in  line with the housing reform policies, and work units paying for  the differential between the construction cost and the  purchasing price. Meanwhile, it has been stipulated that  development companies or housing construction units responsible  for developing and building the houses to resolve people's  housing difficulties and provide them with comfortable houses  are not allowed to make profits. In spite of this, there are  still some individuals and units who cannot afford to pay for  the houses. In addition to the long-term mortgage loans and the  housing construction loans provided to individuals and work  units, respectively, we are studying the plans for resolving the  housing difficulties of the second batch of households through  adjustment.    Second, we should speed up the renovation of dilapidated  houses. Many low and medium-income households with housing  difficulties are living in dilapidated housing areas with few  houses and a poor living environment. As early as 1990, the  municipal government put forward a principle to renovate the  dilapidated houses, which called for shifting the housing  construction focus from development of new areas to a  combination of new area development with renovation of  dilapidated houses; placing the leadership work for renovation  of dilapidated houses mainly on district and county governments;  and coordinating renovation of dilapidated houses with the  development of new areas, with real estate business, with  housing reform, and with the protection of the styles and  features of the ancient capital. Over the past three years and  more, 1.5 million square meters of dilapidated houses have been  pulled down, and 2.16 million square meters of houses built to  enable 56,000 households to move to new houses already or in the  near future. The renovation has become more and more difficult,  and continuous study is needed to solve new problems and put  forward new countermeasures. If the urban plan is not further  improved, it will be difficult to develop the essence and  discard the dross of the old city. If construction of urban  infrastructural facilities and key projects is not accelerated,  it will be difficult to possess even the minimum conditions for  the renovation. If reform and opening up are not expanded, it  will be difficult to gain the land price differential through  real estate business, to make the state, the work units, and  individuals to share the burdens through housing reform, to draw  in investment from abroad for our projects, and to raise funds  for the renovation.  <H5>  3. The Issue of Developing the "Leading" Role of the Urban </H5> Plan    The healthy development and the fairly great achievements in  Beijing's urban construction are attributed to a fairly mature  and continuously improved overall urban construction plan. As  early as 1950's, Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and other  revolutionaries of the older generation gave instructions on  many occasions on Beijing's construction, planning, development,  and other major issues. Since the third plenary session of the  11th party Central Committee, Deng Xiaoping and other party and  state leaders, the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, and  the State Council have given explicit instructions on the  principles for Beijing's construction. The State Council again  officially approved the revised "Beijing overall urban  construction plan" on 6 October 1993 and promulgated it for  implementation on 21 February 1994. The new overall plan draws  a trans-century grand blueprint of Beijing's urban construction  and development of other undertakings and defines the target to  be attained, namely to bring Beijing's social development and  its overall economic as well as scientific and technological  strength up to or surpass in some areas the levels of the  capital cities of medium developed countries by 2010 so as to  lay a solid foundation for building Beijing into a first-rate  modern international city by the middle of the 21st century.    The current task is implementation. For this, we should  conduct propaganda and education to make the vast number of  leading cadres and people in all walks of life clearly  understand that the State Council's written reply and the new  overall plan are the programmatic and authoritative documents on  Beijing's construction and that it is necessary to embrace the  idea of subordinating local interest to overall interest and  immediate interest to long-term interest and to guide and  promote the implementation of the overall plan in line with the  needs of the socialist market economy. Meanwhile, legal,  administrative, and economic means should be adopted to  strengthen the management of the plan. Only in this way can we  implement this scientific plan to the letter and enable it to  play a leading role in guiding urban construction and management.  <H5>  4. On the Issue of Accelerating the Reform of the Economic </H5> Systems Concerning Urban Construction    As an organic body, cities have their objective operating  mechanism. Therefore, there should be a set of economic systems  concerning urban construction that are suitable for the  mechanism of cities. Urban construction consumes a huge amount  of money. From where does the money come? Under the planned  economic system, the unified state allocations and collections  were carried out, thus resulting in too much debts and cities  being operated in an inefficient and disorderly manner. Under  the market economic system, we should make great effort to  gradually transit from the unified state allocations and  collections to self-allocation and self-collection, to effect a  favorable cycle of input and output, and to make cities have a  complete and sound organism and reach an efficient and orderly  state of operation. To realize this transition, we should, in  the course of continuously carrying out various reforms in urban  areas, strengthen the reform of economic systems concerning  urban construction. The focus of this reform is to reform three  systems and establish five markets.    The first system that should be reformed is the urban  infrastructure investment system. In the form of investment  compensation, urban infrastructure can be divided into three  categories: The first category is the compensation by society.  This category of facilities, such as urban roads, rainwater  drainage facilities, natural calamities prevention facilities,  and urban green lands, cannot be calculated and their charges  cannot be collected from users. Thus, the cost should be borne  by the whole society through perfection of tax revenue systems.  The other category is the compensation by markets. The  facilities covered by this category include water, coal,  electricity, gas, and heat supply facilities. The products  provided by this category of facilities can all be calculated  and thus the cost should be borne by consumers through the  exchange at equal value on markets. Another category is the  compound compensation. This category include public traffic  means and sewage discharge and treatment facilities. The first  investment in such facilities should be borne by society, while  their regular operating expenses should be borne by markets.  Touching upon tax revenue reform and pricing reform, the reforms  in all categories of urban infrastructure will meet grave  difficulties and it is impossible to accomplish them at one  step. However, the later these systems are reformed, the graver  the waste is, and the more losses the state will sustain. Only  when the normal and stable investment sources are ensured for  the above three categories of urban facilities, the banking  credit can be brought into full play. With a long service life,  urban basic facilities are built by one generation but will  bring benefit to several generations. With the banking credit  as the lever, the funds for building these facilities can be  raised by one generation but be paid back by several  generations. The second system that should be reformed is the  land- use system. Only when we transfer land-use rights with  compensation can we make the most of land resources, can we  withdraw the profit gained from the grade difference of land,  that originally belong to the government, and can we attain the  goal that what is taken from the land is used in the interests  of the city. No longer should we beg for food by holding a  golden bowl in our hands. The third system that should be  reformed is the housing system. In this reform, we should  mainly depend on the efforts of the state and units, and then on  the efforts of individuals. The best way is to sell public  houses to workers and staff. This reform touches upon the  interests and the renewal of concepts of numerous households and  upon the reforms of financial system and wage system of  enterprises, administrative units, and institutions. Thus, it  goes without saying that there will be grave difficulties in  this reform. However, without reform, there would be no way out.    The five markets that should be established include the real  estate market, the building materials and equipment market, the  project bidding market, the building laborers markets, and the  technological information market. At present, we should, on the  one hand, strengthen the management function of the government  and regulate the markets and should, on the other hand, perfect  various rules and regulations and standardize markets.  Particularly, we must make the real estate market more visible  to the public and make known to the public all the transaction  behaviors and transaction links. Otherwise, there is no end of  trouble for the future.    The above opinions are offered for your common discussion,  and your comments are welcomed for those which are inappropriate.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 09, BNS -- Latvian President Guntis  Ulmanis, who also heads the country's voluntary paramilitary  organization, the Home Guard, met Friday [8 April] with its  Kuldiga branch Commander Egons Granatskis and discussed  cooperation opportunities between Home Guard and police.    Granatskis told Ulmanis that the recent directives that  demand strict coordination of all Home Guard actions with state  institutions make quick actions impossible.    Commenting on financial issues, Ulmanis said that he and  Staff Cmdr. Juris Eihmanis would decide on the distribution of  state budget funding for the needs of the Home Guard. Home  Guards should be allowed to perform private guarding orders in  addition to their direct service duties, said Granatskis.    Ulmanis said he planned to tour all Latvian Home Guard  battalions soon to acquaint himself with the work and problems  of Home Guards.</p>

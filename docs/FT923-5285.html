			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Ulster talks reopen today ROUND-TABLE talks on the political future of Northern Ireland will resume in Belfast today after a 40-day recess. The talks will enter what the participants believe to be the most important stage of the three-strand talks process which started in April. Preliminary discussions took place yesterday to agree an agenda, establish ground rules and organise a manageable negotiating structure. The main talks will involve three days of meetings each week. They will be held initially at Stormont Castle in Belfast and will then move to Dublin, probably in the last week of this month. It will be the first time since the partition of Ireland in 1922 that Unionist political leaders have travelled on official business to Dublin. The talks are part of Strand Two of the three-strand process. The aim is an agreed formula for self-rule in Northern Ireland to replace the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. Strand One involved only political parties while Strand Two will include the Dublin government. Strand Three will involve discussions between the British and Irish governments. A month has been set aside for the current round of talks, which will be chaired by Sir Ninian Stephen, a former governor-general of Australia. Talks in July were seen as a preliminary phase, and the real negotiations are now expected to get under way. Signs of flexibility will be sought - for example, on whether the Irish government is prepared to relax or amend its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland, and on whether the unionist parties are prepared to concede a role for Dublin in an Ulster administration.</p>

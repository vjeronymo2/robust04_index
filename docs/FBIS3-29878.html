A Defense Ministry source said on Wednesday that the main  body of the Sangnoksu (Evergreen) Unit will be brought home in  early April as earlier planned.    "But, we plan to bring home an advance party of 250 men  beginning mid-March depending on the conditions of Somalia," he  said. To help arrange their withdrawal, Brig. Gen. Son  Yong-che, deputy director of operations at the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, and four other officers flew to Somalia on Monday, the  source said.    The transportation means and expenses for the withdrawal of  the Korea troops and their equipment will be shouldered by the  UN authorities. The expenses are estimated at about 1 million  dollars.    Meanwhile, the ministry decided to donate part of the  equipment and supplies of the Sangnoksu Unit to the UN  peacekeeping authorities in Somalia on its withdrawal.    The items to be donated, worth about 500,000 dollars, will  include seven jeeps, nine generators, two water supply trucks,  20 refrigerators, 50 air conditioners and some medical and other  supplies, the source said.</p>

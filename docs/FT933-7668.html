			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Profits rise well ahead of earnings UK COMPANY profits grew far faster than earnings as the economy continued its steady growth in the second quarter, the Central Statistical Office reported yesterday. Measured at current prices, provisional figures showed that gross trading profits of companies rose by 4.8 per cent between the first and second quarters of this year and were 9.6 per cent higher than in the second quarter of last year. Overall income from employment rose only 0.1 per cent in the second quarter compared with the first and was 1.6 per cent higher than in the second quarter of last year. Figures for the UK gross domestic product deflator, the most comprehensive measure of domestically generated inflation, suggest overall earnings from employment may have fallen in real terms between the first and second quarters. According to yesterday's data on UK output, income and expenditure, the GDP deflator rose 0.6 per cent between the first and second quarters but was just 1.1 per cent up on the second quarter of last year, the lowest annual growth rate since the third quarter of 1962. The Central Statistical Office confirmed its earlier estimate that GDP increased by a real, seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent in the second quarter and was 1.5 per cent up from the same period last year. But it was unable to provide complete figures on the components of GDP. Officials said details of the construction industry were omitted because of a lack of official data and because the Department of the Environment would not consent to the CSO publishing its own forecast of latest trends. Information provided yesterday showed that consumer expenditure rose by a real 0.5 per cent in the latest quarter and was up 1.9 per cent on the year before. Gross domestic fixed capital formation fell 0.7 per cent after the first quarter's erratically high 0.8 per cent growth rate but was l6 per cent higher than in the second quarter of last year. By contrast, general government final consumption rose 1.1 per cent in the latest quarter but was 2.7 per cent down on the second quarter of last year. The Treasury said the 'figures confirm the recovery is under way over a broad front'. Capital expenditure by UK manufacturing industries fell by a real 1 per cent in the second quarter and was 1 per cent lower than in the same period last year, according to provisional estimates. The CSO said that total capital spending was little changed in the year to the end of June compared with the previous four quarters, although spending on plant and machinery rose 1 per cent and on vehicles by 25 per cent. Outlays on new building work fell 14 per cent.</p>

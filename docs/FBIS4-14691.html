			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By correspondents </F> Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and  others]    [Text] The Russian plan of the settlement in Karabakh  envisages a solution of the Armenian-Azeri conflict in stages, a  Russian presidential representative at the talks on the  settlement of the Armenian-Azeri conflict Vladimir Kazimirov  told journalists in Baku.    He said that first it is planned to carry out a gradual  ceasefire and to separate forces. After that it would be  possible to start talks on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh.  "Anyway the principle "peace in exchange for territories" for  the Karabakh conflict is unacceptable, the diplomat said.    Kazimirov spoke in favor of sending peacekeeping forces to  the region, of which Russian troops could be a part. Only in  that case, he said, it would be possible to guarantee a  ceasefire and a lasting peace in the conflict zone.</p>

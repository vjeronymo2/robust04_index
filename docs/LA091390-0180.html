			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UPDATING A SILENT CLASSIC;  </P> <P> FILM: A TRULY ECLECTIC MIX OF LIVE MUSIC ACCOMPANIES TONIGHT'S HOLLYWOOD BOWL  SCREENING OF THE GERMAN SILENT MOVIE 'THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI.'  </P> <P> The days of outdoor movies at the Hollywood Bowl continue. On the heels of last  year's "Alexander Nevsky" and last month's screening of "Singin' in the Rain"  comes a screening tonight of the 1921 German silent film "The Cabinet of Dr.  Caligari."  </P> <P> But this latest cinematic-music event -- part of the Los Angeles Festival --  promises to be considerably more inventive if not controversial. The film will  be accompanied by a live soundtrack provided by the Los Angeles Philharmonic  performing John Adams' tone poem "Harmonielehre" under the baton of David Alan  Miller.  </P> <P> In addition to this odd mixture of Expressionism and contemporary music will be  two especially different local ensembles: the five-member World Kulintang  Ensemble (an ancient Philippine gong and drum ensemble) from Reseda and the  F.A.M.E. Gospel Choir from central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "It's a West Coast event, with strong ties to Los Angeles and San Francisco,  but with other elements scattered here and there as well," Los Angeles Festival  director Peter Sellars explained by telephone while rehearsing at Cahuenga  Pass. "In Los Angeles, one type of culture doesn't swallow up another, they all  exist in diversity, and this concert celebrates this idea."  </P> <P> "Months ago, Peter told me he had a dream and vision of our ancient gong music  being performed on the same stage as the L.A. Philharmonic," recalled Eleanor  Academia-Magda, director of the Kulintang ensemble. "It came as no surprise a  few weeks ago when he asked us to join this event."  </P> <P> Originally, the performance was to include the world premiere of a silent film  by Sellars entitled "The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez," a non-satirical but  occasionally humorous examination of the world of Wall Street. Because of his  duties at the Los Angeles Festival, he was unable to shoot the film last July  as scheduled.  </P> <P> Sellars wrote the movie with Adams' "Harmonielehre" in mind as a soundtrack. He  defends this process of filmmaking, putting the images to pre-existing music,  as a product of today's culture as well as a return to movies like Walt  Disney's "Fantasia."  </P> <P> "We're in an era of MTV and the idea of matching images and music in this way  is very logical," he explained. "More and more, our culture is growing  non-verbal and that's not good in many ways, but in some ways it's a relief.  </P> <P> "I remember first hearing 'Harmonielehre' at about 2 a.m. as I was walking home  from the Kennedy Center in Washington. (Adams) had sent me a rehearsal tape and  I was listening to it on my Walkman.  </P> <P> "I pictured the music as the soundtrack of a lost Alfred Hitchcock movie. I  could imagine a fevered Jimmy Stewart riding in a car while the music plays."  </P> <P> Because the initial inspiration for the film was "Harmonielehre," Sellars  wanted to keep an event dedicated to that work. He hopes that using "Dr.  Caligari" instead of "Dr. Ramirez" will enhance both the film and add a  dimension to Adams' work that is not immediately perceptible.  </P> <P> "The silent era of film is my favorite time for movies," Sellars said. "And the  artists who worked on 'Caligari' weren't very prominent after the film opened.  This was their one claim to fame. It's a great movie, but not that good of a  movie.  </P> <P> "And most people find John's music very transparent, and can't immediately hear  the connection he has made with Schoenberg." (The title for Adams work comes  from a treatise on harmony by Arnold Schoenberg.)  </P> <P> "By putting this film -- with all its German Expressionist roots -- alongside  the music, elements of the music that usually go unnoticed are drawn out,"  Sellars said.  </P> <P> " 'Harmonielehre' is basically a musical gloss on the styles and moods of  Expressionism, though very whimsical," Adams said during a recent trip to Los  Angeles, where he is working on a documentary film for children with Sellars.  "I'm sure that this will change the original intent of the film, since music  creates the context of a cinematic situation."  </P> <P> Adams admits that these recent projects have made him eager to work in the area  of film as he imagines the numerous possibilities. But he remains skeptical  about playing the role of a traditional Hollywood film composer.  </P> <P> "Every now and then I get a package from someone in Hollywood who wants me to  score a movie, but then I look at the scripts, which usually aren't that good,"  Adams said. "I think of all the work it would take and usually conclude that  it's just not worth it.  </P> <P> "Ideally a filmmaker should consult with the composer from the very beginning  of a project but because film is so expensive, collaborating like that is  almost impossible."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 29 KYODO -- Japanese workers' average  monthly wages showed the first year-on-year decline in 13 years  in fiscal 1993, though a scant 0.1 percent, while annual working  hours also declined by 50 hours, the government said Friday [29  April].    The Labor Ministry said in a report on the nation's labor  situation for the year ended March 31 that average monthly basic  salaries of workers at companies with 30 employees and more  increased 2.7 percent from the year before to 272,743 yen.    But special allowances, including bonuses, declined 1.6  percent to 106,594 yen per month, reflecting the sluggish  business climate.    Payments for overtime work also dropped 5.6 percent to  21,957  yen per month as companies cut back overtime hours during the  recession.    As a result, workers' total monthly wages averaged 401,294  yen, up 1.0 percent from the year before. The ministry said the  increase is the lowest since it started such a survey in fiscal  1970.    Taking into account the 1.1 percent consumer price hike in  fiscal 1993, monthly average wages showed a 0.1 percent decline  in real terms, it said.    Regarding working hours, the ministry said annual regular  working hours in Japan averaged 1,777 per worker in the year,  down 37 hours from the year before.    Overtime hours averaged 131 for the year, down 13 hours.    In total, annual working hours came to 1,908 per person,  down  50 hours from the year before, the ministry said.    The government has long promoted a reduction of Japan's  notoriously long annual working hours to 1,800.    In fiscal 1992, annual working hours declined by 50 to  1,958,  with regular hours dropping by 24 and overtime hours by 26.    Compared with the 1992 figures, regular working hours  declined more than overtime in 1993.    A ministry official said the trend was because many  companies  reduced their regular hours last year ahead of a planned law  revision in April requiring a cut in regular working hours to 40  hours a week.</p>

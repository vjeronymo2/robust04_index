			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Maxwell businesses 'ready for sale' SALES of most of the remaining businesses controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell are moving towards final preparation, according to accountants working on different parts of the publisher's empire. Plans for selling the principal companies in Maxwell Communication Corporation - including Macmillan and Official Airlines Guide in the US - are to be submitted by accountancy firm Price Waterhouse to the US and the UK courts next month. Separately, discussions are well advanced for the sale of British International Helicopters, the remaining trading business in the network of private Maxwell companies being administered by accountants at Arthur Andersen. Andersen expects to raise at least Pounds 50m from selling BIH, along with a number of property interests and investments in Hungary and France. That will only leave the majority shareholding in Mirror Group Newspapers. Mr Mark Homan, one of the administrators to Maxwell Communication Corporation at Price Waterhouse, told the House of Commons social security select committee last week that the firm was 'making substantial progress' on sales, in conjunction with its adviser JP Morgan, the US bank. Administrators have been hampered by the highly unusual arrangement whereby MCC is controlled by Chapter 11 proceedings in the US as well as administration under UK insolvency law. This has caused much of the more than Pounds 5m in legal bills incurred so far. Another reasons for the delay has been difficulties in negotiating the tax position of the companies. Mr Homan has been reluctant to provide too much information on the expected price of realisations because of commercial sensitivity. He has also been concerned about creating a false market in the discounted trade of MCC debt. He believes that up to Dollars 250m of MCC debt had changed hands since the company went into administration. But he said that MCC's assets in the UK apart from claims from third parties were about Pounds 100m. The US assets were worth up to Dollars 1.1bn, excluding receipts from the sale of Berlitz shares.

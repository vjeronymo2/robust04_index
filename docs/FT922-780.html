			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (8): Bank reform may be a slow process - Bold moves, including recapitalisation, are necessary THE FIRST, tentative steps have been taken in the long process of reviving India's dilapidated commercial banks. But whether the country's politicians and banking authorities have the nerve to take the bolder moves that will be necessary to complete the job has yet to become clear. The problems engulfing the commercial banks stem from the way the country's credit system has been used as an instrument of government policy over the past two decades. Around two-thirds of all lending by banks is in effect directed by the state. Three problems have resulted. The first is that banks have been forced to accept large blocks of low-yielding assets. To finance India's fiscal deficit, 30 per cent of bank deposits must be invested in government debt (known as the statutory liquidity ratio). A further 15 per cent is held in deposits with the central bank. Some headway has been made in reducing this burden on banks. The statutory reserve ratio fell from 38.5 per cent in April, and the interest rate paid on government debt was eased by three-quarters of a percentage point to 12 per cent. 'The tax on credit has come down substantially,' says Mr S. Venkitaramanan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India. But the Bank is still some way off allowing the yield on government debt to find its own level in the market. Banks have also made substantial subsidised loans to meet the social policy objectives of extending credit into rural areas and to support smaller companies. By government fiat, 40 per cent of their 'free' deposits (those not earmarked for government debt or the cash reserve) must go this way. These subsidies will not disappear. 'In all developing countries, there is some element of subsidised lending,' says Mr Venkitaramanan. However, the level of subsidy should come down, and it should be made more transparent, he says. The low return on many of their assets has forced banks to charge a huge margin (currently at around 6 per cent) to the small proportion of their customers who do not benefit from these subsidies. Not surprisingly, that has begun to prompt better-quality borrowers to bypass the banking system altogether: a commercial paper market, currently with around Rs5bn of paper outstanding, has begun to develop. With a ceiling on bank deposit rates of 13 per cent, depositors have also begun to turn away from the banking system towards mutual funds which offer higher returns. The extent of disintermediation remains minimal, but most bankers expect it to pick up in the future. The banks' second problem is the large volume of bad or doubtful debts they have been forced to shoulder. Establishing quotas for lending to priority customers has inevitably undermined the credit-assessment process inside banks. 'The input of credit was necessary,' says Mr G S Dahotre, chairman of the Bank of India. 'But whether it was done on sound principles is another matter.' The effect has been to erode the capital base of the banks - though since they are not required to disclose their non-performing loans, or the level of provisions they have made, it remains impossible to assess their true financial condition. Two years ago, the World Bank suggested that Indian banks should aim, 'as a first step', for a ratio of capital to assets of 2 per cent. However, the Reserve Bank claims that the position is not as bad as this suggests - partly because revaluations of some of their assets would bolster reserves. 'We may be at 4 to 4.5 per cent on a fully adjusted basis,' says Mr Venkitaramanan. Whatever the true picture, it is clear that a recapitalisation of the banking system will be needed. In a report published at the end of last year, Mr M. Narasimham, a former central bank governor, suggested the creation of a new fund to take over part of the banks' bad debts, and the provision of subordinated loans by the government. Stronger banks should raise capital from the public, Mr Narasimham said. The Reserve Bank has talked of setting up a new bank to take over lending to the agricultural sector, and agrees with the need to clear banks of some of their bad loans. 'We may need an asset reconstruction fund,' says Mr Venkitaramanan, drawing a parallel with the Resolution Trust Corporation in the US, the agency which has taken over the assets of savings and loans institutions. As yet, though, it has given no clue as to how existing commercial banks could be recapitalised. The possibility of privatisation has provoked a backlash from militant bank unions, prompting the government to rule it out for now. The third problem for banks is the administrative and political straitjacket in which they have been held. Virtually every aspect of their operations is centrally directed, and managers are given little freedom to manoeuvre. That has created a bureaucratic culture, and a lack of attention to credit quality or service. It has also left banks saddled with large unprofitable branch networks and hefty cost bases. When it was nationalised in 1956, the State Bank of India (then called the Imperial Bank of India) had 414 branches. It now has 8,500, a reflection of government policy of extending bank branches into rural areas. Very few of these branches are computerised - a product in part of union opposition which has prevented the automation of the banking system. State Bank has at least been able to automate its central general ledger, which is more than can be said for others, including Bank of India. The problem for banks is how to bring down costs and improve service, while at the same time continuing to work within this straitjacket. The power of the unions, and the political need to maintain extensive branch networks, suggest that any progress will be slow.</p>

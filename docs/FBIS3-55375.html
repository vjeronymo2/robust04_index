			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow, 6 Jan (ITAR-TASS) -- Lithuania's unfriendly  statements about Kaliningrad Oblast cause bewilderment and could  complicate Lithuanian-Russian relations. This was said at a  briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the department  of information and the press of the Russian Foreign Ministry, in  connection with the latest statements by some Lithuanian  politicians who have called for the "demilitarization" and  "deoccupation" of Kaliningrad Oblast, for a review of its  international status, and for it to be removed from Russia by  forming on its territory "a new Baltic republic integrated into  the structures of Northern Europe."    In connection with this the Russian diplomat recalled that  the decision of the Potsdam Conference on transferring  Kaliningrad Oblast to the Soviet Union was final and without any  time limit. The territorial possession of the oblast by the  Soviet Union and consequently by Russia was subsequently laid  down in the treaty on the final settlement in relation to  Germany of 12 September 1990 and the treaty on  good-neighborliness, partnership, and cooperation between the  USSR and the FRG of 9 November 1990. "Thus, juridically and by  right of morality and history Kaliningrad Oblast is an  inalienable, integral part of Russia, and Russia will not permit  a review of the international legal acts establishing and  confirming its present status," he stressed.</p>

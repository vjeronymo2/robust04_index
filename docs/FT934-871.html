			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Eurotherm's 38% advance to Pounds 20.1m helped by cost cuts and growth in US Eurotherm, the industrial process control equipment supplier, turned in a 38 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to October 31, buoyed by improved productivity, higher margins and the positive impact of currency movements. Pre-tax profits were up from Pounds 14.6m to Pounds 20.1m, on turnover which edged ahead by 2.5 per cent to Pounds 158.4m (Pounds 154.6m), mainly reflecting growth in the US market. Earnings per share rose by 35 per cent, from 22.3p to 30.2p. An increased final of 6p is recommended, making a total for the year of 9.5p (8p). Shares in the group, which is also proposing a 1-for-1 scrip issue to improve liquidity, closed 16p ahead at 690p. Tight control on costs, including a further reduction in the workforce to 2,030, and a renewed focus on profitable product sales, helped boost gross profit margins by almost 2 percentage points. As a result operating profits increased by 29 per cent to Pounds 20.1m. The group, which derives an increasing proportion of its turnover from outside the UK - over 65 per cent in the latest period - also benefited from sterling's relative weakness against the dollar. If 1992 figures are restated at 1993 exchange rates and disposals are excluded, like-for-like turnover slipped by 2.6 per cent and pre-tax profits expanded by 30 per cent. Growth from the group's range of AC drives helped offset lower turnover from process automation and the effects of the recession in Germany and France. Net interest costs fell to Pounds 25,000 (Pounds 1.03m) reflecting the group's strong Pounds 14.2m (Pounds 8.2m) cash generation, including a sharp Pounds 3m reduction in stock levels, which enabled it to eliminate net borrowings and end the period with cash balances of Pounds 6.8m. COMMENT Over the past three years Eurotherm's management has refocused the business and introduced more profitable products while driving costs down and introducing tighter financial controls. As a result most of the group's key performance measures, including its return on capital, have improved substantially. While there is still some scope for margin improvement, future performance will mostly depend on the group's ability to grow organically - despite the lack of any general upswing. This will mostly be achieved through new products like the AC drives and expanded recorder product range which will add about Pounds 7m to sales in the current year. Pre-tax profits should reach Pounds 25m this year producing earnings of about 37.7p. The shares, which have more than tripled in price over the past three years, are now trading on a forward multiple of 18.3 - but still look like a good buy.</p>

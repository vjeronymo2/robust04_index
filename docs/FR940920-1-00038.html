			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nationwide emissions of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would be reduced by about 200 Mg/yr, or about 1 percent nationwide, over levels associated with the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Water and Solid Waste Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The acid gas/PM and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  control technologies used as the basis for today's proposed NSPS are the same technologies used as a basis for the subpart Ea NSPS. Those technologies were determined to have negligible water or solid waste impacts, as discussed in the previous  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice (56 FR 5488).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed NSPS, activated carbon injection is the technological basis for controlling Hg emissions. Activated carbon injection does not produce a wastewater stream, and it would have a negligible solid waste impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with the 1991 NSPS, the EPA concludes that MWC ash disposal is adequately addressed by waste management standards so that considerations of ash quality do not play a role in this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Energy Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The energy impact of applying acid gas/PM controls to small plants and applying Hg controls to both small and large MWC plants will result in a total national energy increase of about 27 gigawatt hours per year (GW-hr/yr) of electricity. No increase in the use of natural gas is anticipated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the small plants covered under today's proposal produce steam that is used to generate electricity for sale. For example, a typical 100 Mg/day MWC plant would generate about 12 GW-hr/yr of electricity. Such an MWC would require additional energy to operate pollution control equipment. The required energy would be about 0.7 GW-hr/yr of electricity, which has a relatively small impact on energy generated at the plant (about 6 percent of energy generated).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Control Cost Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA estimates the incremental annual social cost of control of the proposed NSPS over the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS to be about $43 million per year and the incremental national average cost per unit of waste combusted to be about $1.95/Mg. The incremental capital cost of control in the first 5 years of application is estimated to be $156 million over the cost of the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Impacts of the Proposed NSPS Over a Pre-1989 Baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following provides a discussion of the impacts of the proposed subpart Eb NSPS over a pre-1989 baseline. Since the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS has been effective for 3 years, the impacts presented below provide a useful account of the total impact of the NSPS, based on both the 1991 subpart Ea and proposed subpart Eb standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Air Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The air emission reductions discussed below are nationwide impacts that would result from full implementation of the NSPS in the fifth year after adoption. These are not incremental impacts relative to the February 11, 1991 NSPS (see section III.A for a description of incremental impacts).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In combination, today's proposed standards and the 1991 NSPS would reduce nationwide emissions of dioxins/furans by about 29 kg/yr, total mass. Emissions of dioxin/furans on a TEQ basis would be reduced by about 480 g/yr. This represents an overall reduction of about 97 percent compared to baseline dioxins/furans emission levels in the absence of the 1991 and proposed NSPS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed standards and the 1991 NSPS, nationwide emissions of PM would be reduced by about 6,500 Mg/yr. This represents an overall control level of over 80 percent for PM emissions compared to baseline levels in the absence of the 1991 and proposed NSPS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nationwide emissions of Cd and Pb would be reduced by 10 and 157 Mg/yr, respectively. This represents an overall reduction of about 94 percent for Cd emissions and about 98 percent for Pb emissions, compared to emission levels in the absence of the 1991 and proposed NSPS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of the 1991 and proposed NSPS, nationwide Hg emissions would be reduced by about 27 Mg/yr over baseline levels. This represents an overall reduction of about 80 percent for Hg emissions compared to baseline levels in the absence of the 1991 and proposed NSPS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nationwide emissions of SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would be reduced by about 38,000 Mg/yr, and nationwide emissions of HCl would be reduced by about 50,000 Mg/yr. The 1991 and proposed NSPS would reduce MWC acid gas emissions by about 94 percent compared to baseline emission levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nitrogen oxides emissions would be reduced by about 10,500 Mg/yr. This represents an overall nationwide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction in NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions of about 35 percent as compared to levels in the absence of the 1991 and proposed NSPS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Water and Solid Waste Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in section III.A.2, the technologies used to comply with both the 1991 subpart Ea and proposed subpart Eb NSPS do not produce a wastewater stream; therefore, no significant water pollution impacts are projected to occur. Additionally, the application of these technologies would result in a negligible solid waste impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Energy Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of the proposed and 1991 standards, total national usage of energy is estimated to increase by about 290 GW-hr/yr of electricity above baseline. No increase in the usage of natural gas is anticipated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The majority of the MWC's covered under the proposal produce steam that is used to generate electricity for sale. Those MWC's would require energy to operate pollution control equipment, but such energy requirements have a relatively small impact on energy generated at the plant (about 4 to 6 percent of total energy generated).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

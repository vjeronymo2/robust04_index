			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Banking on BCI's appeal By offering shares in Banca Commerciale Italiana at a 5.3 per cent discount to the market price, the Italian government is showing growing confidence. The privatisations of Credito Italiano in December and IMI last month were both heavily oversubscribed. The rise in Credito's shares since then must have made some in government wonder whether the 10 per cent discount for that offer was, in retrospect, too generous. While Credito's shares stood close to a 12-month low when its offer was priced, though, BCI has risen by 25 per cent this year to an all-time high. Credito was trading at a discount to net assets in December, while BCI is trading at around book value. On that basis BCI is being offered at nothing like a bargain basement price. Like Credito, BCI's interest margins are being squeezed by lower short-term interest rates. It faces the similar challenge of keeping operating expenses under control while developing new sources of income, primarily by selling financial services through an expanding branch network. The promise of 20 per cent annual growth in fee income will be difficult to fulfil. With lower exposure to celebrated corporate collapses such as Ferruzzi, BCI arguably has the edge in terms of asset quality. That said, its relatively low level of provisioning might leave less scope for earnings growth as the Italian economy turns and the bad debt situation improves. Given the interest shown in Credito and IMI, it is difficult to believe that BCI will be anything other than oversubscribed. Neither would it do to count on a windfall profit.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> (4) A midpoint payment to the Government was required to provide additional incentive for timely timber removal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These changes in timber sale financial requirements have been somewhat successful in stabilizing timber sale contracting by encouraging performance; discouraging speculation; and more adequately securing contract performance. However, additional changes are needed to further enhance financial security of timber sale contracts and to protect the taxpayer from repudiation of bids and default of contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Past experience indicates that prices being bid for Forest Service timber frequently rise substantially over the advertised rates established by the agency's appraisal of the fair market value of the timber. The agency determines the appraised value by using the selling value of lumber and other forest products or by using transaction evidence of other comparable timber sales. When bid values far exceed advertised values and lumber selling values remain constant or rise minimally, the potential for purchase financial loss increases. Thus, based on bidding experience, the Forest Service believes that the public and the Government could be facing additional repudiations of bids and defaults of contracts if lumber selling values do not keep pace with bid values and if additional financial security requirements are not instituted. Accordingly, the agency believes it is essential to take additional steps to protect the public's financial interests in timber sale contracts, assure timely execution and completion of contracts, and minimize the financial risk to the Government. These additional financial security measure were published as a proposed policy in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of December 7, 1990 (55 FR 50651). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis and Response to Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The comment period on the proposed policy closed January 7, 1991. Nineteen respondents submitted comments. The comments came from 2 private citizens, 10 timber purchasers, 5 timber purchase associations, a preservation association, and timber advocacy group. Of the 19 public comments received, 15 came from the West and 4 from the East. Fifty-eight percent of the respondents expressed support for the policy proposals either in their entirety or with suggested modification. The remaining 42 percent did not support the proposal primarily because of perceived increases in the cost of doing business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following summarizes the comments and suggestions received on the proposed policy changes and the Department's response to these in the final policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Performance Guarantee Ceiling <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed policy would have eliminated the present $500,000 ceiling on the amount of performance guarantee required by the timber sale contract and set the minimum performance guarantee at 10 percent of the bid value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One respondent suggested that, at the time of first entry into a sale area, the performance bond be equal to the present value of the ``worse case'' outcome of the logging operation. The agency disagrees. The objective of a performance guarantee or performance bond is to assure that the terms of the contract are met. Performance guarantees must protect the interests of the Government. The respondent's suggestion would be impossible to administer. The Agency believes that determining the ``worst case'' outcome would be highly subjective and subject to dispute between the contract parties. The ``worst case'' outcome might be the default of a high priced sale which was later resold to determine damages. Making a projection of some future resale value of a sale that may or may not be defaulted is speculative and could result in very high performance bonds which would place an unfair economic burden on the majority of the timber purchasers who fully perform their timber sale contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four respondents objected to eliminating the performance bond ceiling. They thought the change would result in increases in their bonding requirements, put them at a competitive disadvantage, and discriminate against small business. The agency recognizes that small business could be disadvantaged in obtaining bonding in excess of $500,000. Nevertheless, the agency believes that only a few large and high value timber sales will require bonds of more than $500,000. The agency is of the opinion that 10 percent of the bid value is a reasonable amount for providing the minimum amount of performance bond to provide assurance of contract performance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the timber sale contracts sold within the last 15 years have required a performance guarantee that was equivalent to 10 percent of the bid value subject to certain maximum amounts. The maximum performance guarantee for sales sold since the spring of 1982 has been $500,000. Removal of the $500,000 ceiling would ensure that the performance guarantee amount would be applied equally to all sales. In the face of existing bids, the current ceiling could result in less secure guarantees that purchasers of high-priced sales will perform their contracts. Removal of the ceiling on performance guarantees should not affect many of those purchasers that ordinarily bid on National Forest timber sales. The removal of the cap would only affect sales with more than $5 million bid value. Very few sales are this size, and few small businesses buy timber sales that are this expensive. Therefore, the change would not stifle or constrain competition. What the removal of the ceiling will do is help to deter speculation by increasing capital requirements and, thus, in these large sales increase bidder financial liability in the event of default. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Having considered the comments received, the agency is retaining the elimination of the $500,000 upper limit on performance bonds in the final policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Increased Bid Guarantee <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the proposed policy, the amount of bid guarantee required for bidding on National Forest System timber sales would increase to 10 percent of the advertised value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One respondent suggested that the purchaser be required to pay the full amount of the winning bid at the time of the sale. The agency believes this would place a severe economic hardship on timber purchasers that would result in a significant decrease in competition and a reduction in receipts to Federal, State, and county treasuries. In some cases, requiring full payment of bid value at time of sale could prevent companies from purchasing National Forest System timber resulting in loss of employment and economic hardship to dependent communities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

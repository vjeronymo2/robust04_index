			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> RSPA exercises its discretion more narrowly in regulating materials that may pose longer-term harm to humans or other animals, or harm to the environment. As RSPA noted in 1980, in its first notice of proposed rulemaking to regulate hazardous substances as hazardous materials:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOT should not attempt to develop the criteria for materials that are subject to the FWPCA unless they fall within the realm of the existing defining criteria for materials presently designated as hazardous materials. (RSPA) believes the EPA has both the expertise and the technical resources necessary to deal with the determination and designation of those materials which should be considered for inclusion in the reporting requirement mandated by the FWPCA. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 44 FR 10677.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The assignment of authority under the FWPCA and CERCLA between DOT and the EPA reflects the agencies' relative areas of expertise and resources. Both 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(2) and 42 U.S.C. 9602(a) direct the EPA Administrator to designate as hazardous substances those materials that may substantially endanger public health or the environment, and to establish for each the RQ that determines which hazardous substance releases must be reported. Both the decision to designate a material as a hazardous substance and the choice of an RQ are matters for the exercise of the EPA Administrator's broad discretion. The assignment to RSPA under 42 U.S.C. 9656(a), conversely, is strictly confined: if the EPA has designated a material as a hazardous substance, RSPA must list it and regulate its transportation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rulemaking challenged by petitioners was preceded by a notice and comment rulemaking in which the EPA affirmed its designation of lead sulfide as a hazardous substance, and determined that on the basis of chronic toxicity, the lead sulfide in petitioners' concentrates warranted assignment of an RQ of 10 pounds. 58 FR 35316. If RSPA were to consider petitioners' argument that the low bioavailability of the lead sulfide in their concentrates justifies excepting the concentrates from the hazardous material designation, the result would be untenable. In every rulemaking under section 9656(a), RSPA would be required to consider, on a cost-benefit basis, the appropriate level of Federal hazmat regulation for each hazardous substance designated by the EPA and the appropriateness of excluding certain forms of hazardous substances from regulation entirely. Costs and benefits could not be estimated without RSPA independently assessing the health and environmental risks that a hazardous substance posed. The statute cannot reasonably intend that each hazardous substance and RQ designation, determined by the EPA through consideration of public comment and the exercise of its own expert judgment, be subject to full reconsideration by RSPA before it is incorporated into the HMR. This reading would be contrary to the statutory recognition of agency expertise and all notions of executive branch efficiency and consistency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA does have discretion as to precisely how it regulates hazardous substances in transportation. Regulation may be extensive or minimal. Vehicle operating requirements, segregation requirements and routing restrictions might be imposed, or shipping paper and package notations might suffice. RSPA's task is to formulate a principle that reconciles (1) the EPA's authority to adjudge public health and environmental risk by designating hazardous substances and their RQ's with (2) RSPA's inescapable discretion to determine the specific requirements that apply to the transportation of each hazardous substance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The guiding principle is this: RSPA, in its discretion, may prescribe reasonable requirements to govern the safe transportation of hazardous substances, so long as those requirements do not, in effect, revisit the EPA's assessment of health and environmental risks. In practice, this means that RSPA may exercise discretion under 42 U.S.C. 9656(a) in three respects: (1) It may prescribe regulations for the transportation of hazardous substances  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> as a class <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; (2) it may regulate differently hazardous substances with different RQ's; and (3) it may regulate hazardous substances by class on the basis of shared characteristics other than the degree of health or environmental risk posed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Petitioners' Substantive Claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners contend that although RSPA must ``list and regulate'' all hazardous substances as hazardous materials, it has the discretion to except copper, molybdenum and zinc concentrates from the hazardous material designation. In support of this claim, petitioners suggest that RSPA already has exercised this sort of discretion under 49 CFR 171.8, by: (1) Regulating hazardous substances only when transported in excess of their RQ's; and (2) not regulating mixtures and solutions containing a hazardous substance, when the hazardous substance is below a specified concentration. Petitioners ask that RSPA merely amend the rule governing mixtures and solutions to increase the concentration of lead sulfide that must be present in their concentrates before they are considered hazardous materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners argue that the exception from regulation for hazardous substances in amounts below their RQ's and for those in mixtures or solutions below the specified concentration proves that RSPA has the discretion to disregard the 42 U.S.C. 9656(a) command to ``list and regulate'' each hazardous substance. These exceptions, however, do not contravene the statute, but implement it. As discussed above, the primary purpose of section 9656(a) is to provide for identification of cargo subject to CERCLA reporting requirements if released. There is no need to regulate a hazardous substance being transported in an amount below its RQ, because no reportable release could occur during transportation. 42 U.S.C. 9603(b);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> cf.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(5). The provision setting a minimum concentration for designating as a hazardous material a hazardous substance in a mixture or in solution is to simplify the operator's task of determining whether an RQ of a hazardous substance is present. 45 FR 34569; 44 FR 10676&hyph;77.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the statute requires reporting of a hazardous substance release only when the release equals or exceeds the RQ of the substance. 42 U.S.C. 9603(a). This is an implied finding that the release of a limited quantity of a hazardous substance is of lesser regulatory concern.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cf <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(4) (defining the RQ as the quantity of a hazardous substance ``which may be harmful'' to the public health or welfare or the environment).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

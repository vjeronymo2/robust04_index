			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Way cleared for Polish credit POLAND and the International Monetary Fund yesterday completed negotiations on a letter of intent which should pave the way for a new Dollars 660m IMF standby agreement. The letter still has to be approved by the Polish government and by the IMF board at its next meeting in January. Once finalised the new 14-month standby accord should open the way to a resumption of debt reduction talks with western commercial banks stalled since June 1991. Agreement with the fund is crucial to Poland receiving a further 20 per cent reduction of its Dollars 35bn official debt to western governments in 1994. In March 1991 government creditors agreed to cut Poland's official debts by 30 per cent in that year and made a further cut contingent on Poland obtaining the IMF's seal of approval for its economic policies. Its overall foreign debt was Dollars 50.9bn at the end of August. The letter of intent was worked out by an IMF team led by Mr Michael Deppler, head of the European Department, and Mr Jerzy Osiatynski, the finance minister. It concentrates on next year's budget proposals which foresee an 81,000bn zlotys deficit or 5.1 per cent of GDP compared to this year's deficit which will reach 7.5 per cent of GDP. The budget still has to be approved by parliament, which until now has resisted government demands for a reduction in pension and other social payments which will be needed to honour the IMF limits. The budget forecasts were based on the assumption that the Polish economy will grow by 2 per cent next year. Real incomes are to stay at this year's levels while prices are expected to grow by 39 per cent. This is below this year's 46 per cent increase, in spite of big rises in the cost of gas, electricity and central heating planned for 1993. The government's budget documents foresee inflation falling gradually to reach 10 per cent in 1997. Editorial comment, Page 18</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Croatian Foreign Minister by an </F> unidentified annnouncer -- live]    [Text] [Announcer] Our guest tonight is Mate Granic, the  deputy prime minister and foreign minister of Croatia. Good  evening to you. What should Croatia expect from tomorrow's  meeting of EU [European Union] foreign ministers in Brussels, or  to put it briefly, will sanctions [against Croatia] be imposed  or not.    [Granic] I believe they will not be imposed.  Bosnia-Herzegovina was placed on the agenda earlier. We are  aware that Denmark will put forward a proposal to impose  sanctions but we believe that this will not take place. It is  possible that they will discuss taking away some privileges. We  believe that the meeting tomorrow will end with a declaration  that will call on all three sides to do all they can to achieve  a cease-fire and an agreement. Additional pressure on Croatia  is also possible but I believe that sanctions are not probable.    [Announcer] Two days ago Croatia received a statement issued  by the UN Security Council chairman. What is Croatia preparing  as a reply. I noticed that the Council for National Defense and  Security held a meeting yesterday. What now?    [Granic] The statement issued by the UN Security Council  chairman represents additional pressure on all three sides,  Croatia in particular. It followed a letter sent by Haris  Silajdzic [on the regular Croatian Army's intervention in  Bosnia] and was accompanied by pressure exerted by Islamic  states. The statement is toned down in comparison to its first  version. Its intention is of course to press the Croatian side  in doing its best to reach a lasting cease-fire and an agreement  on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croatia is prepared to do all it can  because of its own interests, the interests of the whole region,  and the international situation. We were urged to do so in all  other contacts we had, by the Holy See, and all other important  states.    Croatia will accept the supervision of the borders and it  has  proposed the supervision of all borders between  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia and all the other borders of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croatia has also proposed the supervision of  all of its military units, and it will propose the same to the  Croatian Defense Council, telling them to invite international  inspections. We claim that 2,000 volunteers from Croatia are  fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina to protect their homes, but in  any case, we will accept all the results of the inspections. It  is known that regular Croatian Army units are deployed in the  area north of Dubrovnik [inside Bosnia-Herzegovina's Trebinje  municipality] in agreement with the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Government. In any case, Croatia is prepared to do everything  it can to continue negotiations on an unconditional cease-fire  and to achieve a lasting solution as soon as possible.    [Announcer] You visited Rome and the Vatican this week. This  was followed by a report from Rome that Italian Foreign Minister  Andreatta was prepared to host a meeting between President  Tudjman and President Izetbegovic.    [Granic] Yes, the Italian side is prepared to organize such  a  meeting and we have conveyed this to the Bosnian side. It was  agreed that Prime Minister Silajdzic and I will hold a meeting  in Geneva on Wednesday. If any progress is made a decision will  be made on a meeting at the highest level and its venue.    [Announcer] A meeting of Bosnian Croats is taking place in  Sarajevo today and another one will take place in Livno. You  will go to Livno as President Tudjman's envoy. What do you  think about the meeting in Sarajevo.    [Granic] We understand the delicate and specific position of  the Croats in Sarajevo, and that is why the meeting in Livno is  taking place as a meeting of all Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- those expelled, those in free  territory, or those in Posavina -- are in different positions in  comparison to the Croats in Sarajevo. I hope that these  meetings will be meetings of unity of the Croatian nation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that they will not harm Croatian state  policy and the basic Croatian interests in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Announcer] After the next round of Geneva negotiations  there  is another meeting in store. The deputy prime minister of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is expected to visit Zagreb on 12  February.    [Granic] Yes, this meeting will take place in Zagreb, and it  is planned that an initial meeting of the joint commissions for  finding missing persons, humanitarian issues, and refugees will  take place. We will also discuss all details about the opening  of [diplomatic] offices in Belgrade and Zagreb, and all other  important political issues in connection with the normalization  of Serb-Croat relations will be on the agenda.    Tomorrow we expect to sign seven agreements with the  Slovenian Government, and as early as tomorrow we will also  resume negotiations on all unresolved issues with the Slovenian  Government.</p>

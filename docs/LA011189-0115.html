			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> STRONG FINISH ENABLES BELL-JEFF TO NOTCH 14TH VICTORY  </P> <P> Powered by Nick Sanderson's 29 points and Greg Dunn's 20, Bell-Jeff High rolled  to an 84-65 victory over St. Genevieve in a San Fernando Valley League game at  Harvard on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Despite the win, however, Bell-Jeff Coach Joe Dunn was not pleased with the  play of the Guards (14-1, 2-0 in league play).  </P> <P> "We've yet to put together four good quarters this season," Dunn said. "I know  it sounds funny to hear a coach complain when he's 14-1, but I'm always looking  ahead. Sooner or later, we're going to run into a team that plays well for four  quarters."  </P> <P> With guard Chris Dyer getting into early foul trouble, Bell-Jeff struggled in  the first half.  </P> <P> The Guards trailed St. Genevieve, 24-18, midway through the second quarter  before reeling off a 12-4 streak to end the quarter.  </P> <P> In the second half, Bell-Jeff began to pick up the defensive intensity and it  paid off in the fourth quarter when the Guards outscored the Valiants, 33-19.  </P> <P> Sanderson scored 15 points in the final quarter and 21 points in the second  half. Dyer scored 11 of his 13 points in final 2 periods.  </P> <P> Mike Cassidy had 21 points and 10 assists for St. Genevieve (1-1 in league  play).  </P> <P> Burroughs 75, Alhambra 67 -- Trailing, 64-59, with 5 minutes to play, Burroughs  went on a 16-3 tear to win the Foothill League game at Alhambra.  </P> <P> Marnie Calderon's 3-point shot with 3:30 left gave the Indians a 66-65 lead  they never relinquished. Calderon also had 8 assists.  </P> <P> All-Foothill League forward Dan Murphy scored a game-high 25 points -- 10 in  the fourth quarter -- and grabbed 14 rebounds for Burroughs (10-5, 2-0).

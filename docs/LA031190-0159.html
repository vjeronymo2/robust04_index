			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: COLORADO COACH RIDES WAVE TO INEVITABLE UNEMPLOYMENT  </P> <P> This isn't quite as goofy as the Bo Schembechler Fires Bill Frieder, Hires  Steve Fisher, Wins National Championship, Is Forced to Keep Steve Fisher  college basketball headline story of 1989 -- but it's getting there, it's  getting there.  </P> <P> Tom Miller is the coach at the University of Colorado -- temporarily. His team  will play here today. If it wins, it will qualify -- with 17 defeats -- for the  NCAA tournament's 64-school field. As long as Colorado keeps playing, Miller  keeps coaching.  </P> <P> Except, he's already been canned. Miller's team struggled through the regular  season with a record of 10-17. It finished eighth in the Big Eight. The  university president concurred with the director of athletics that Miller must  go. They tried to withhold the news, but a TV station got hold of the story, so  they had to give Miller his notice and go public. They did so a few days after  he returned from his father's funeral.  </P> <P> Unlike Schembechler, Colorado did not decide to bring in a temporary. Leaving  wasn't the coach's idea, as it was last season with Frieder taking a job with  Arizona State while he was still employed by Michigan. Leaving was strictly the  administration's idea.  </P> <P> As Miller himself said: "I came to Colorado knowing that in big-time  basketball, you either win or move on."  </P> <P> Well, the plot thickens. After Saturday's 82-72 upset of Oklahoma State,  coupled with Friday's 92-88 mega-upset of Missouri, the coach is suddenly Mr.  Popularity. Suddenly, nobody from Boulder is eager to see him go. Suddenly,  everybody wants this former West Point cadet to stick around, to start what he  finished.  </P> <P> These people include the Big Eight's leading scorer and rebounder, 6-foot-10  junior center Shaun Vandiver, who is threatening to leave Colorado now that the  coach has been dismissed. And the talkative Vandiver is still talking. After he  lit up Oklahoma State for 26 points and 16 rebounds Saturday, Vandiver, unlike  many intimidated schoolboy athletes, did not mince words.  </P> <P> "If we win this tournament and make the NCAAs," Vandiver said, "the president  and athletic director (at Colorado) are going to have their (tails) between  their legs."  </P> <P> Tom Miller, 41, is trying to enjoy all of this, but it's not easy. He's a  tight-lipped guy by nature, a guy who tends to be leery of the media, a guy who  played for Bob Knight at Army and coached under Knight at Indiana, a guy who  was warned by Athletic Director Bill Marolt in 1988 that he would be fired if  he kept grabbing or manhandling players at practice.  </P> <P> On the other hand, much like Knight, Miller is a big believer in discipline, is  dogged in his determination to make his players attend class and is concerned  about the priorities of scholastic basketball, saying: "If you look at the  college game, there are some strange things happening. You don't need to be a  Rhodes scholar to figure it out. Is it a win-at-all-costs mentality, or what?"  </P> <P> The coach got at least a partial answer after Colorado's victory over Missouri,  when the university president, Gordon Gee, issued a written statement in  Boulder congratulating Miller on his splendid achievement. One day, the guy's  fired. Next day, he gets told what a good job he's doing.  </P> <P> Miller, also like his mentor Knight, has a few eccentricities, superstitions,  such as wearing the same lucky clothes. Knight is known for his crimson V-neck  sweater. Miller wore the same faded pink shirt and droopy red necktie during  both the Missouri and Oklahoma State games and is expected to have it on for  today's championship game.  </P> <P> "If I can't find a dry-cleaner open, I'll have to hand-wash it myself in the  sink," Miller said.  </P> <P> He can be a character, a charmer, when he wants to be. When one of his  forwards, Rodell (House) Guest, a notoriously bad shooter of free throws, came  through with two in the clutch Saturday, Miller said: "I think he's on a tear.  But don't get any ideas about shooting the ball after this, Rodell."  </P> <P> Same as you-know-who, Miller trades friendly barbs with his players at news  conferences, dares them to one-up him, re-directs questions to them, as when  someone asked how Colorado's strength was holding up, having to play three  difficult games in less than 72 hours.  </P> <P> "How about it, you guys? You gonna have the strength to show up tomorrow?"  Miller asked his players.  </P> <P> "Si, senor," replied team joker Reggie Morton, a senior guard who can't speak  Spanish except to order from a menu.  </P> <P> Or when forward Brent Vaughan (from Bloomington, Ind., incidentally) spoke of  what a pleasure it was to play before 17,000 cheering fans after averaging  about 3,000 for home games at Colorado, Miller piped up and said: "What Brent  doesn't understand was that those people who were cheering for us were OU-KU  fans."  </P> <P> Oklahoma and Kansas, he meant self-deprecatingly, were rooting for a chance to  play Colorado. They thought they could beat Colorado. Everybody in the Big  Eight thought they could beat Colorado. Tom Miller's Colorado. Or at least what  used to be Tom Miller's Colorado.  </P> <P> "The coach is like a diamond in a rough mine," said Vandiver, who has his own  way of putting things. "The guys who let him go, I guess they went with their  own best thoughts."  </P> <P> He wonders what they might be thinking next -- or where their heads might be  when they're thinking it. "I still don't know if this is a fairy tale or a  nightmare," Vandiver said. Neither does his coach.  </P></p>

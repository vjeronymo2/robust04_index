			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Travel: Hit by Berlin's hammer blows of history - Adam Hopkins grapples with a city's painful but fascinating past and finds a great deal worth exploring in the eastern areas We left the cabin window open so as to hear the ducks and moorhens - also the S-Bahn trundling over the iron bridge across the Spree. For this, after all, was former East Berlin, and the hotel we had chosen was a riverboat, retired from many years of service on the Rhine and the Moselle. The waterbirds woke us daily before dawn, complaining and racketing about. But the S-Bahn trains soon sent us back to sleep, pulling up in soporific succession at Treptower Park, gateway to acre upon acre of anonymous housing blocks and the huge Soviet war memorial hidden within the urban forest of the park. The Victoria Hotelschiff, our temporary home, was moored on the Treptower side. Away among the trees behind us we could almost feel the ghostly presence of the thousands of young Soviet soldiers killed in the last days of the second world war and buried here, surrounded by the marble pomp of their own empire, Babylonian in scale. Stralau lay on the far side of the water, an industrial peninsula in the watery maze of east Berlin. From the saloon where we took our breakfast of herring and rye bread, it seemed to be full of abandoned vehicles and defunct factories - its demise a product not only of 40 years of socialist economics but, more immediately, of the rupture of the Wall in 1989. Berlin is a place that hits you every way you turn with the hammer blows of history, remote or recent, painful, fascinating, forcing you always to grapple with both the city and yourself. The physical situation of the Hotelschiff ensured that our reactions remained at the customary high pitch induced in most visitors by Berlin. What is more, we had a mystery on board, the kind you become aware of little by little . . . shadowy figures sitting on the river wall when nobody was looking, two young girls seated on a descending stairway, comparing rings and giggling and turning their faces away, a drift of cigarette smoke from an unexpected quarter, the sound of card-players below. So tantalising grew the presence of these other, unacknowledged denizens of the riverboat - clearly not ordinary guests - that we finally plucked up courage to ask about them. Yes, as we had secretly suspected, they were Bosnian refugees on an indefinite stay, their cabins paid for by the powers-that-be. The refugees seemed entirely fitting both to the oddity of our arrangements and to the kindly face which Berlin, paradoxically, has often shown to refugees and strangers. Be it said that during our week deep down in the old east, we never once caught sight of a skinhead. On the contrary, we made a friend, and a more agreeable and kindly man you could not hope to meet - Lothar, an unemployed translator of Portuguese. Once, he said, it had been a useful language in the liberation struggles of Angola and Mozambique; now it was less urgently required. He took us home to meet his wife and children in their cosy, book-filled flat, walking over the iron bridge across the Spree in darkness and past the corner where the cars slow down, thus giving the local prostitutes - high boots, tiny skirts and wild blonde wigs - a chance to interview potential punters. Where the Spree turns into Osthafen, the old industrial harbour, full of latter-day dereliction, there is now a Chinese restaurant, its cheery windows lending an unexpected exoticism. 'Even though I've lost my job, I would never go back to the old situation,' says Lothar. 'Never, ever. Freedom of speech, freedom of movement, these are too important.' Heike, his wife, gave us fried bread-balls with mincemeat in the middle, the children were put to bed, and the little home seemed to radiate peace and even hope. For ourselves, during the daylight hours, we would take the clanking S-Bahn back into the city centre, to Mitte, heart of the old east, exploring with new eyes from this entirely changed perspective. Homing in on the old centre, we marvelled at the great grey bulk of east Berlin, like an untidy rug thrown down across the lakes and waterlands of Brandenburg. What an astonishing hive and hubbub of industry there must have been here once upon a time. And what a fearful aberration to build, however well-meaningly, the huge, unornamented, desperate housing blocks of socialism. Yet exploring among the inner districts of the centre, more intimately than we had done on previous, west-based, visits, we were struck repeatedly by how much of the grander domestic architecture of old Berlin survives. Unter den Linden, with its majestic, oversized Prussian public buildings, has long been restored, or mostly so, as has the elegant Nikolaiviertel hard by. But go up to Prenzlauerberg, where new arty cafes are sprouting like nobody's business, and you will suddenly see that houses here and there along wide streets - Rykestrasse, for instance - are starting to be done up, revealing a grace and amplitude previously hidden by decay. The same is true round Oranienburger Strasse, in the area the tourist board is pleased to call, with doubtful historical accuracy, the Scheunenviertel. (The real thing was a little further up: the one-time jam-pocked, crime-prone, slum and ghetto-district celebrated in Alfred Doblin's great 1920s novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz.) Meanwhile, in the 'new' Scheunenviertel, the catalyst has been the rebuilding of the grand New Synagogue and the takeover of such huge and gaunt old factories as the Berolina Margarinefabrik in Augustrasse as artists' co-operatives and so forth. Trendy cafes abound in this district, too, serving breakfast to sleepy customers all day long on Sunday. There was, we felt, an enormous amount worth exploring in the east, quite apart from the grand imperial museums and architectural set-pieces. It may have been the Victoria Hotelschiff that did it, or meeting our new friends on the Osthafen. Or, for once, it may have been objective observation. But we certainly felt that it is former east Berlin - and not the west - which now holds most of the cards and, little by little, will start to lay them on the table. Lufthansa (tel: 0345-737747) flies from London Heathrow, Pounds 140 return for a stay that includes Saturday night. The Victoria Hotelschiff is at Puschkin Allee 16/17, Am Anleger 3, 12435 Berlin, tel: 010-49 30 272 370. A cabin for two costs Pounds 85 per night; cheaper at weekends.</p>

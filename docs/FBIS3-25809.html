Although the national figure is not available, the Bank of  China's Beijing branch had recalled more than 127 million yuan  in FECs as of January 27.    The central bank announced on December 29 that the dual-rate  exchange system would be unified on January 1 and that it will  stop issuing FECs.    Although the Central Bank said existing FECs can still be  used temporarily, some people misunderstood and thought FECs  would be devalued or even become worthless    So they rushed to banks to exchange FECs for U.S. dollars,  creating long queues in the two days following the central  bank's decision.    The Beijing branch's daily withdrawal peaked at 15 million  yuan in FECs, said an official with the branch.    The rush eased later when the central bank reiterated that  FECs can be exchanged at the previous official rate of 5.8 yuan  per dollar.    In order to withdraw the FECs as quickly as possible, the  bank has simplified the exchange procedures.    Foreigners, overseas Chinese, and people from Hong Kong,  Macao and Taiwan can exchange FECs for dollars by showing their  passports and identification certificates.    In the past, they were allowed to return only 50 percent of  the amount specified on the exchange memos they were given when  converting foreign currency into FECs.    China introduced FECs in 1980 as a convertible version of  the  renminbi. The Bank of China issued nearly 2 billion yuan ($230  million) worth of FECs.    Although FECs are supposedly equal in value to the renminbi  yuan, they actually are worth about 30 percent more in the  market.    The price of FECs has also fluctuated dramatically in the  black market.    In the first three days after the central bank's  announcement, the price of 1 yuan FEC equaled only 1.05 renminbi  yuan. But now speculators must pay 130 or even 140 yuan ($15 or  $16) for 100 FECs.    Despite the rising price, black market dealers are still  enthusiastic about buying FECs since they can make money from  the margin between the previous official rate and the current  rate.    They can use ruses to exchange FECs for dollars at the  previous official rate of 5.8 yuan. Then they can sell the  dollars at the current rate of 8.7 yuan.    For example, if a speculator uses 14,000 renminbi yuan to  buy  10,000 yuan of FECs, he can get more than $1,724.    Selling the dollars at the rate of 8.7 yuan, he can get  14,998 yuan. This leaves him with a profit of nearly 1,000 yuan.</p>

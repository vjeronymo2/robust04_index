			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRYSLER NET UP DESPITE 20% RISE IN INCENTIVE COSTS  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp., the No. 3 U.S. auto maker, Monday reported a higher profit for  the second quarter despite a 20% increase in the cost of incentives aimed at  enticing buyers.  </P> <P> But industry analysts, citing soft industrywide sales and the heavy incentive  programs, said they were pessimistic about the company's outlook for the rest  of the year.  </P> <P> Chrysler said it earned $341 million, or $1.46 a share, up from $320 million,  or $1.45 a share, in last year's second quarter. Sales climbed to $10.11  billion from $9.34 billion.  </P> <P> Chrysler was the only U.S. auto maker to post a year-over-year improvement.  General Motors Corp. on Thursday said net income fell 3% to $1.45 billion while  Ford Motor Co.'s earnings fell 16% to $1.40 billion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expects Sales Drop  </P> <P> Although Chrysler's performance came in on target, several analysts cut their  forecasts of 1989 and 1990 earnings.  </P> <P> Chrysler last week announced a $1-billion cost-cutting program, including  layoffs of 2,300 white-collar employees. The auto maker has said it expects  industry car and truck sales this year of 14.8 million, down 6% from 1988, and  thinks that sales will drop next year to 14.2 million.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Natalya Ishchenko: "Meshkov Cannot Be </F> Rationalized"]    [Text] Ukrainian Minister of Justice Vasyl Onopenko was  shocked by last morning's reports that Crimean President Yuriy  Meshkov dismissed Crimean Justice Minister Yevhen Skisov by  virtue of another decree. "I simply do not understand Mr.  Meshkov," Vasyl Onopenko said in an interview with KIEVSKIYE  VEDOMOSTI. "I think that he does not take into account the  consequences of his actions. I will not list all Ukrainian laws  or articles of the Constitution that have been violated by this  decision. I will provide just one typical example: The Crimean  minister learned about his dismissal from the Crimean radio. It  is very sad that Yuriy Meshkov is violating the same  Constitution by which he swore and to which he pledged  allegiance."</p>

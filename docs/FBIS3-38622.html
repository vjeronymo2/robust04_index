Addressing the Indo-German Economic  Conference in Bonn today, Mr. Narasimha Rao described the  industrial climate in the country as extremely good and  favorable for investment. Making it clear that his government  has absolutely no hesitation in going ahead with the economic  liberalization process, Mr. Rao asserted that India will step up  the reform process. He assured the German industry that there  will be no constraints coming in the way. He added that  constraints if any will be resolved by him and the German  chancellor, Dr. Helmut Kohl.    Opening the conference, the chancellor, Dr. Kohl, assured  India of all possible assistance for the development of the  industrial and technological cooperation. He said the economic  policies of India are on the right path. He told the conference  that India with its reform-oriented economic policy is one of  Germany's most important partners on the Asian continent. Dr.  Kohl announced that both the countries have agreed to establish  a high-level India-German commission for science and technology.  The president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, Mr. N.  Godrej, asked Germany to remove the constraints and controls on  technology transfer.    Our correspondent, Sudarshanam, reports from Bonn that  German  industry has drawn up certain proposals for deregulating and  liberalizing India's economy. These proposals have been  forwarded to the Indian Government. The Indian Government after  a study has sent certain recommendations. These are being  examined to strengthen the economic and trade cooperation. Our  correspondent understands that a German festival in India will  be held as soon as possible.    Mr. Rao was given a formal ceremonial welcome in the  forecourt of the Federal Chancellor's Office at Bonn. Mr. Rao  inspected a guard of honor by the German Air Force.    Here is a report from our special correspondent A.  Karuppaswamy: [Begin Karuppaswamy recording] The opening of the  first India-German economic conference in Bonn by the German  chancellor and Mr. Narasimha Rao is another successful step  towards the India-German cooperation. The event follows the  successful dialogue between Indian and German industrialists  since the prime minister's last visit in 1991. The exchange of  view and suggestions between the two delegates at the conference  largely reflects the compelling necessity of both the nations to  come closer to strengthen their bilateral ties in global  interests. Modern India is viewed by Germans as a very valuable  strategic partner in economic and scientific development because  of India's ongoing reform-oriented economic policies aimed at  liberalization offering one of the biggest markets in Asia. [end  recording]    That was a report from our special correspondent in Bonn.    Earlier, Mr. Narasimha Rao held talks with the German  minister for economic cooperation and development, Mr.  Carl-Dieter Sprangar, and reaffirmed India's commitment to  closer cooperation with Germany. Mr. Rao also told German  leaders that New Delhi is keen on enhanced trade and investment  flow from Germany.    Germany has assured India that it will continue to take a  neutral stance on the Kashmir issue. Kashmir figured  prominently in the talks between the prime minister and the  German leaders in Bonn. Mr. Narasimha Rao explained the  problems faced by India because of Pakistan's abetment of  terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab. He said, Pakistan is  deliberately creating conditions to obstruct a meaningful  dialogue.</p>

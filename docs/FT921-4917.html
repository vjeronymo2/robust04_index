			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / House Democrats square up for battle over budget THE Democrat-dominated House of Representatives prepared yesterday to vote on a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 850m) budget resolution that would double the size of the 'peace dividend' by cutting defence spending more than President George Bush wants, and lay the ground for a political battle over the US budget. Mr Tom Foley, the Democratic House Speaker, predicted it would approve a budget plan that would shift money saved on reduced defence spending into domestic programmes such as road-building and healthcare. 'Our budget is realistic,' he said. But the debate will measure the strength of support for preserving the 1990 budget agreement, in which Mr Bush and Congress agreed on higher taxes, coupled with tight spending caps. While President Bush said this week that he made a mistake in agreeing to the 1990 budget compromise with Congress, he has nothing to gain by overturning it now. The tax increases are already in place, and abandoning the agreement would take away the spending curbs which he insisted on. The US will need to cut federal spending and raise taxes to bring its budget deficit under control, Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said last night in an unusually frank critique of US economic policy. He said the Bush administration's budget projections showed that the 'fiscal situation is worse than almost everyone thought.' The adjustment required was so large that a 'combination of expenditure cuts and revenue measures should be considered.' He gave a heavy hint that the Federal Reserve will soon need to consider increases in interest rates if it is to sustain progress in reducing inflation.</p>

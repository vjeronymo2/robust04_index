			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Arts: Yin and Yang of festivals - Cinema THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS (PG) Henry Selick DEAR DIARY (15) Nanni Moretti STRAWBERRY AND CHOCOLATE (18) Tomas Gutierrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabio I LOVE TROUBLE (PG) Charles Shyer A GOOD MAN IN AFRICA (15)Bruce Beresford The Nightmare Before Christmas fills us with terror. Not because it is frightening but because it is so good. Watching it, all our delicate preconceptions about popular movie-making start sliding around like tables on a swell-tossed ocean liner. We thought that Hollywood never extended itself in the cause of sophisticated anarchy. We also thought that it never fashioned feature-length animated films that catered for adults as much as for children. But this puppet phantasmagoria, with its stop-motion figures and crazed settings plundered from German Expressionism, should delight the over-forties as well as under-fourteens. We start in Halloweentown, where the rocky landscape is combed and curled like a frozen seascape and where strange-shaped houses (a witches' hat, an octopus) disburse stranger-shaped citizens. The Mayor has a revolving head with two faces: one for beaming at the electorate, one for gnashing covert teeth. The local Mad Scientist is part human, part cyber-duck. And our hero, accompanied by a ghostly flying dog who seems made from origami, is a long-legged, wire-thin dandy called Jack. (Short for Giacometti?) He is the Pumpkin King. But bored with Halloween, he wanders into the woods one day, stumbles down an Alice-like tunnel and discovers Christmastown. Snow] Colour] Good cheer] He sings a song - the best in the movie, called 'What's this?' - and then hurries home to report his delight at finding a new market for trick-or-treatism. I shall reveal no more: or only to say that Santa Claus might be captured by the Halloweentowners; that Pumpkin Jack might take over his beard, red coat and reindeers; and that Christmastown will almost certainly call out the police when shrunken heads start falling down their chimneys and giant toy snakes eat their Christmas trees. I cannot remember when I last heard the sound of happy, frequent laughter at a Monday morning press show. But a film like this rejuvenates everyone. If we thought that Tim Burton, the producer and original story writer, had grown old with success after Batman, here he is returning to the firefly-bright mischiefs of Beetlejuice. And director Henry Selick marshalls an animation and special effects crew who must have been high and wild on overtiredness. (A week's work in stop-motion produces about 10 seconds of film). Nightmare is 76 minutes of genuine merriment at the expense of regimented merriment. Christmas is mocked, battered and assaulted: from the Halloweentowners' atonal rendition of 'Jingle Bells' (sounding like Schoenberg performed in a morgue) to the scene in which a Santa Claus sleigh is unceremoniously blown from the night sky by anti-reindeer guns. Anarchic? No doubt. Mean-spirited? Never. The film pushes on, via songs, farce and decorative delirium, to an ending in which Christmas and Halloween are both allowed their pre-eminent places as the great Yin and Yang - or Jekyll and Hyde - of human festivals. The week gets better. Nanni Moretti's Dear Diary is bliss in three parts: an episodic, sumptuously paranoid comedy from the Italian performer/filmmaker - here playing himself - who makes Woody Allen seem a well-adjusted extrovert. In part one our hero, a bearded lankshanks who might have strayed from an El Greco painting, vrooms around Rome on his Vespa, voice-overing his thoughts on life, love and cinema. He lists favourite films (Flashdance) and unfavourite ones (Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer); he fantasises revenge scenarios on film critics; he sobers up for a visit to Pasolini's death-place. In part two he walks among the Aeolian Islands; where like the homonymous harp he is 'played' by the winds of comic happenstance. One running gag concerns a friend addicted to TV soaps; another (inspired) takes off from the simple notion of children answering phone calls intended for adults. In part three he becomes a medical guinea pig, as a chronically mis-diagnosed skin itch turns out to be cancer. (He has since recovered.) Here and throughout, Moretti has the courage to let jokes grow unforced. They become coloured with all the irony of quotidian calamity and textured with all the rueful hilarity of everyday frustration and disappointments. Strawberry And Chocolate is a Cuban film about being gay: which earns it points for political nerve to add to those it can claim as a deft comedy of AC/DC manners. Straight David (Vladimir Cruz) meets gay Diego (Jorge Perugorria). Diego introduces David to the sensual delight of Scotch whisky, opera records and - unselfishly - his man-hungry neighbour Nancy. David responds slowly and with shell-shocked look. Between-whiles the two men chatter about art, politics and homosexuality. When the director, that veteran movie guerrilla Tomas Gutierrez Alea (Memories Of Underdevelopment), fell ill with cancer, Juan Carlos Tabio completed the film. But you cannot see the joins. Senel Paz's screenplay is seamlessly sly and well-observed. And Havana itself winds around the cast like some rococo, affectionate ghost, or one of those playfully omnivorous snakes in The Nightmare Before Christmas. A large snake should have been let loose on both I Love Trouble and A Good Man In Africa. The first is a stuttering Julia Roberts/Nick Nolte comedy thriller set in the Chicago newspaper world: a place where long raincoats and flying pencils do not automatically turn you into Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell (though a good script might help). The second film is based on William Boyd's colonialism-spoofing novel. A Good Man In Africa - which surely had some wit on the printed page - has been turned into something resembling a village theatricals version of Waugh's Black Mischief. The village in question, though, is the Global Village. America's John Lithgow essays the frightfully British ambassador, Sir Arthur Fanshawe. Australia's Colin Friels attempts the frightfully English junior diplomat Morgan Leafy. And another Australian, Bruce Beresford, fairly frightfully directs. One moment we are in 'Carry on up the cleavage' vein, with Morgan losing his cool and his trousers to every eligible female in view (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, Diana Rigg). The next moment we are wondering how to deal with the film's one real human being who keeps wandering across the screen. He is Sean Connery as the titular good man, a doctor refusing to be corrupted by African political sleaze. Connery's presence is so majestic that he exposes aesthetic fraud or triviality merely by standing next to it. The makers of this film should have left the gate open for him to escape the lot on day one. That way their al fresco children's party could have continued without the one reproving adult. Connery has already escaped the Highlander saga. Only Christopher Lambert is left heaving the claymores in the tired and excruciating H3 (15, Andy Morahan). Why not see instead The Seven Samurai, Kurosawa's classic swashbuckler revived. Or - it is a busy week - you could catch a small but almost perfectly formed Hong Kong film at the ICA, Days of Running Wild (15). Hope, despair and comedy in the 1960s, caught on the wing by director Wong Kar-Wai.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The situation is calm in western areas of Kabul and  development activities continue in the fields of education and  construction. According to Dr. Abdorrahman, member of the peace  commission of western Kabul, the sporadic firing occurring in  the west of Kabul sometimes is the act of irresponsible people,  and is not to be concerned about. Answering a question, he said  that the peace commission reassures all residents of Kabul that,  as in the past, the permanent cease-fire continues to be  observed in the western areas of Kabul. Dr. Abdorrahman says  that four saboteurs have been captured by the commission and  their warmongering action has been prevented.    The peace commission of the western areas of Kabul was set  up  last year by Jami'at-e Eslami, Hezb-e Wahdat Eslami, Ettehad-e  Eslami and Harakat-e Eslami, and on top of preventing armed  clashes, it makes efforts in the field of social services too.</p>

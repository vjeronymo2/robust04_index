			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / International Company News: Mexico set to create market for mortgages THE Mexican government is set to introduce legislation that will facilitate the development of a market in mortgage securities, according to Mr Guillermo Ortiz, under-minister of finance. Mr Ortiz said the government 'was willing to contemplate government intervention to extend guarantees of mortgages'. The government may guarantee part of a loan over a given maturity, to help those who could not otherwise finance the purchase of a house or apartment. The legislation, to be introduced after November, will include allowing property titles to be transferred to third parties without being certified by public notaries. Difficulties in transferring titles have inhibited the development of a secondary market in mortgages. Mexico has an acute shortage of housing, in part because of the difficulty and high cost of obtaining a mortgage. But as inflation has fallen, loans of up to 10 years have become available and interest in the mortgage market has grown. However, banks have complained about the legal obstacles in securitising mortgage and consumer loans. The lack of a secondary market in such loans has kept mortgage interest rates higher than they would otherwise be, and stifled demand. Mr Ortiz concedes that the proposed legislation will not meet all of the bankers' demands. The legal process in taking possession of houses when a mortgage has been defaulted is long and uncertain. Mr Ricardo Guajardo, chief executive of Bancomer, Mexico's second-largest bank, says it can take about three years to win settlement in the case of a mortgage default. The government is also planning to introduce next year a derivatives market to allow investors to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risk, Mr Ortiz said. The government will first have to establish capitalisation rules for participants, he said.</p>

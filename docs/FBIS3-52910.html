			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has termed  the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a terrible stain  on the conscience of mankind and urged the world community to  focus their attention on the plight and suffering of the Bosnian  people. She was addressing a joint news conference along with  the visiting prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Dr. Haris  Silajdzic, in Karachi today. The prime minister in her  statement said:    [Begin Bhutto recording] [Words indistinct] we feel strongly  about Bosnia, not only because we are Muslims. We feel strongly  about Bosnia because we believe in freedom, we believe in human  rights, and we believe in the sanctity of life. The rape of  Bosnian women, the death of Bosnian men, the plight of Bosnian  orphanages [as heard] is not just the rape of Bosnia, of the  killings in Bosnia, of the plight of the children of Bosnia. It  is indeed the rape of the world's conscience, the killing of the  world's conscience, and it is a common plight of the world  itself. I would like to take advantage of the visit of the  prime minister of Bosnia to assure him that Pakistan stands  fully behind his government and it's efforts to end the killing  in Bosnia and the suffering of the people of Bosnia. We are  prepared to assist in every effort within Pakistan and without  at international forums to bring an end to what we call a stain  on the conscience of mankind. [end recording]    Speaking at the news conference, the Bosnian prime minister  said:    [Begin Silajdzic recording] I am certain that Pakistani  Government will continue supporting us at bilateral and  international forums. Pakistan is a prominent supporter of our  cause in the United Nations, in the Organization of Islamic  Countries [as heard] and other international forums. A  Pakistani is a member of the war crimes tribunal. And that is  all shall the support of Pakistan to us. [sentence as heard]  [end recording]    Earlier, when the prime minister of Bosnia flew into Karachi  from Islamabad on the last leg of his three day's visit to  Pakistan, he was received by the prime minister. Also present  to receive the distinguished guest was the Sindh chief minister,  Syed Abdullah Shah, and the defense minister, Mr. Aftab Shaban  Mirani. Dr. Haris Silajdzic was then introduced to the speaker  of the Sindh assembly, Mr. Ghaus Bux Meher; members of the Sindh  cabinet; senior officials of the provincial government; and  members of the diplomatic corps based in Karachi. The Bosnian  prime minister was accompanied by the federal minister for law  and parliamentary affairs, Syed Iqbal Haider, and ambassador of  Bosnia in Pakistan, Mrs. Seljida. The Bosnian prime minister  and Ms. Benazir Bhutto then proceeded to the VVIP [Very Very  Important Person] room and had a brief exchange of views on the  latest situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

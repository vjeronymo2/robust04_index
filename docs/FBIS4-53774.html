			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>   [Text] Washington, May 20 KYODO -- Japanese and U.S.  officials met for the second day Friday [20 May] to thrash out a  possible deal to jump-start stalled trade talks on ways to  increase foreign access to key Japanese markets. While  officials put a tight lid on what went on at the meeting behind  closed doors, there were at least indications that neither side  has given up hope of trying to fashion an agreement.    "The talks are ongoing," said a Japanese official after  emerging from three hours of talks held Friday morning at the  Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR).    Both U.S. and Japanese officials refused to comment on  substantive issues raised after the two sides broke off the  morning session. The talks resumed in late afternoon, and  another session is tentatively set for Saturday. The  negotiations to revive the so-called "framework" trade talks  have been closely watched on financial markets as a barometer in  the state of the relationship between the world's two largest  economies.    Reflecting the sensitivity of the negotiations, two Japanese  principals involved in the negotiations -- Vice Minister of  International Trade and Industry Sozaburo Okamatsu and Deputy  Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi -- slipped off after the  morning session without being noticed by a group of reporters  staking out the main entrance of the USTR office.    Like their Japanese counterparts, U.S. officials involved in  the talks were equally tight-lipped.    "You know I can't talk," said a U. S. official when asked  for  comment.    One senior U.S. negotiator involved in the talks, however,  sought to project an air of conviviality.    "We had a good and cordial conversation, and we will meet  again," said Bowman Cutter, deputy director of the Presidential  National Economic Council.    The trade talks, based on a "framework" accord the two  countries concluded in July last year, ruptured in February at a  meeting in Washington between President Bill Clinton and then  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata,  who succeeded Hosokawa in late April, and Clinton agreed last  week to work out a common "basis" for restarting the framework  talks before they meet at the group seven summit in Naples in  early July.    One major sticking point in the framework talks -- and the  primary cause for the rupture of the negotiations at the Feb. 11  U.S.-Japan summit -- is the idea of setting "objective criteria"  to measure imports to Japan. In what is known as a  "results-oriented" approach, the U.S. has insisted using  "numerical indicators" to ensure that a trade agreement with  Japan translates into increased foreign sales in the Japanese  market.    Tokyo has strongly objected to the idea, saying it amounts  to  government-managed trade.    Among the industry sectors covered under the "framework"  accord are Japanese Government procurement for medical and  telecommunications products, trade in autos and auto parts and  the Japanese insurance market.    The U.S. wants Japan to open its market wider to foreign  goods and stimulate domestic demand in order to reduce its vast,  and growing, trade surplus. The U.S.-Japan trade imbalance was  underscored by fresh U.S. Government data Thursday that showed  the U.S. trade deficit with Japan jumped 25 percent in March to  5.80 billion dollars. The U.S. trade gap with Japan came to  15.04 billion dollars in the first three months of this year,  well ahead of the comparable period last year which stood at  13.3 billion dollars.</p>

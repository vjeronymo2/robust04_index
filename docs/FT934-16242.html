			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Observer: Foreign face In selecting a little-known council member as the Bundesbank's 'foreign minister', Hans Tietmeyer, who took control of the German central bank at the beginning of this month, has signalled that he has no intention of relinquishing control of the institution's international relations. Ever since Tietmeyer came to the Bundesbank in 1990, the two departments, currency issues and foreign, have been his bailiwick, a role which involves representing the bank in such crucial forums as the EC monetary committee and at IMF meetings. In this capacity, Tietmeyer, with his highly-tuned international antennae, was very much his own man, as Karl Otto Pohl, president when Tietmeyer joined, rapidly discovered. So it comes as no surprise that a relative newcomer to the board, Bavarian Helmut Schieber, takes on the mantle in the new regime. A career Bundesbank man of 29 years service, Schieber has worked his way up at the regional central bank of Baden-Wurttemberg, becoming its vice president in 1985. He has only been a member of the central bank directorate since June. Buba watchers attempting to interpret the smoke signals emerging from Frankfurt following the handover will therefore have to contain themselves in patience a little longer.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COSTA MESA SHOW;  </P> <P> CAROLE KING SEEKS BALANCE ON THE ROAD  </P> <P> For a good part of the 1980s, Carole King pursued the quiet, private existence  of a homebody on the range.  </P> <P> While life on her 118-acre ranch in Idaho may have nourished King's soul, it  did not feed her creative urge as a songwriter. More than five years elapsed  from 1984, the time of her last album, until the release of "City Streets," the  new record that has prompted King to go back on the road for a tour that  reaches the Pacific Amphitheatre tonight.  </P> <P> "I was feeling too much peace," said King, 47.  </P> <P> "For a while I was writing about the only conflict I was dealing with": a long  court battle against the federal government, which wanted access to a private  road through King's property so it could speed development of a neighboring  mining tract. Songs inspired by the environmental dispute (eventually decided  in King's favor) "didn't seem to resonate with the mainstream of popular  music," she said.  </P> <P> Instead of writing a new album, King devoted her artistic energies to acting.  She took a couple of small film parts and played more substantial roles in  plays staged in New York and Los Angeles. As a New York City teen-ager, King  had studied acting at the city's famed High School for the Performing Arts. She  continued to attend acting classes and workshops as her musical career  unfolded.  </P> <P> In 1987, she returned to Manhattan to play the lead in a play called "A Minor  Incident."  </P> <P> "I really got back in touch with the energy and the emotional turmoil of the  city," King said. "That is what really inspired the writing of the "City  Streets" album, and its energy." Feelings of loneliness and romantic yearning,  set against a chilly urban landscape, form the emotional core of the album.  </P> <P> Now, King said, she parcels out her time among New York, Los Angeles and the  Idaho ranch where she and her fourth husband raise horses, mules and goats.  </P> <P> "It's very important to me to have that place to go and recharge and have the  natural beauty," she said. "Just get on my horse and ride, go into the  mountains and contemplate a stream. I need both. My work is very important to  me, and that takes place best in the city."  </P> <P> As one of pop's preeminent songwriters, King has written definitive musical  evocations of both the country and the city. With lyricist Gerry Goffin, the  former husband with whom she still collaborates, King wrote "Up on the Roof"  for the Drifters, achieving the height of urban romanticism. "Wasn't Born to  Follow," recorded by the Byrds, speaks of rural wanderings with rippling  beauty.  </P> <P> If King's muse responds to both the tenement and the forest, her psyche never  has been geared very well to the demands of the road. She summed up her problem  with touring in "You're So Far Away," one of the many enduring songs from  King's 1971 soft-rock album landmark, "Tapestry."  </P> <P> Traveling around sure gets me down and lonely,  </P> <P> Nothing else to do but close my mind.  </P> <P> I sure hope the road don't come to own me,  </P> <P> There's so many dreams I've yet to find.  </P> <P> King said she had some of those old misgivings as she started out last month on  her first tour since 1984. But, for the first time, she has found that the road  can be fun.  </P> <P> "This is the first (tour) I have thoroughly enjoyed every minute," King said,  her grainy speaking voice taking on extra brightness. "I don't mind the hotel  rooms, the travel, any of it. I love the band, and I love the response I'm  getting on stage."  </P> <P> She also likes the audience mix she is seeing at her shows: the Baby Boomers  who all bought "Tapestry" during the '70s, making it one of the best-selling  albums in pop history, and the younger fans who are also turning up.  </P> <P> Oldtime King fans who go to the shows at the Pacific and at the Universal  Amphitheatre on Thursday will get to hear eight selections from "Tapestry,"  which King plays without fear of being considered stuck in the past: "I'm aware  that people want to hear it. Most of the songs from that album are personal  favorites of mine, so it was easy to say, 'I'll do these eight.' Whichever ones  are the most fun for me to play -- that is the overriding criterion."  </P> <P> King said she also has fun with a more rocking, contemporary-sounding segment  of the show in which she steps out from behind her piano (she has her  son-in-law, veteran New York City session musician Robbie Kondor, to look after  the keyboards) and either straps on an electric guitar or bops with a hand-held  microphone. That segment includes a new version of "Will You Love Me Tomorrow?"  in which King lets fly with a bona fide rap.  </P> <P> "The song (a No. 1 hit for the Shirelles in 1960) has been around so long, I  looked for a way to have fun with it and make it contemporary," she said. "I  see the audience's collective jaw drop when I begin the rap. Then they get into  it."  </P> <P> King said she is not just using rap as a gimmick but has a genuine liking for  it -- a taste that is a little surprising in a songwriter whose forte, an  exquisite sense of melody, is foreign to rap.  </P> <P> "I do draw the line," she said. "I do not have any affinity for (rap) lyrics  that advocate violence. Although I'm aware that as a white woman I did not grow  up under the same circumstances as a group like NWA. If there is anger, anger  most definitely should be expressed, but it should focus on how (one) can take  this anger and make this situation better.  </P> <P> "My 15-year-old son listens to rap. We listen to some of the music together. We  discuss it. I tell him my opinion of the violence, and he agrees with me. The  sexual stuff we just laugh at. It opens up a dialogue. The parents who are  seeking to have that music banned are making a big mistake."  </P> <P> (King, who is Jewish, said one rap group she has not heard, and knows nothing  about, is Public Enemy, the militantly political ensemble that has been  embroiled in controversy because of flagrantly anti-Semitic interviews given by  a member of its performing entourage.)  </P> <P> King said her teen-age son and daughter live in Idaho with her former husband,  musician Charles Larkey. Louise and Sherry Goffin, the two daughters from her  first marriage, are both pursuing their own musical careers. Louise has been a  recording artist since her teens. King said Sherry, who is married to her  mother's touring keyboard player, Kondor, fronts a New York City band called  Sherry and the Sugar Beats that is working on "an album of children's music  sort of like the 'Little Chill.' It's music from the 'Big Chill' era, the '60s  and '70s," geared for contemporary kids and their musically nostalgic parents.  </P> <P> Of all the Goffin-King songs from that era that became pop standards in  performances by other singers, King says Aretha Franklin's reading of "(You  Make Me Feel Like) a Natural Woman" gives her the biggest chill.  </P> <P> "That would stand out in my mind as the all time blow-me-down pinnacle of how a  song of mine could be sung," she said.  </P> <P> King, who sounds well in touch with the current pop scene, said she also gets a  kick out of knowing that "The Locomotion" has been a hit in three different  decades (in the '60s for Little Eva, who was baby-sitter for King and Goffin  before they made her a star, in the '70s for Grand Funk and in the '80s for  Kylie Minogue). She is also happy to hear that Martika, a hot pop newcomer whom  King likes, is planning to release "I Feel the Earth Move" as a single.  </P> <P> With all those famous or imposing versions of her songs that other stars have  sung, has King ever felt nervous about tackling any of them herself?  </P> <P> "Never," she said. "I always figure I wrote it, I have the validation to sing  it any way I want."  </P> <P> Carole King and Wayne Toups &amp; Zydecajun play tonight at 8 at the Pacific  Amphitheatre, 100 Fair Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $24.75, $22 and $16.50.  Information: (714) 634-1300.  </P> <P> </P></p>

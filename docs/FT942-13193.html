			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Price for UAP public offer set The French government yesterday announced a price of FFr152 per share for the public offer of the privatisation of Union des Assurances de Paris, the country's largest insurance group. The price represents a discount of about 7 per cent to yesterday's close of FFr164 for UAP shares. Industry analysts said that the price was at the lower end of expectations. The French government also announced a group of long-term stable shareholders which will hold a combined 11 per cent of UAP's shares. Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the construction and communications group will hold 2.2 per cent of UAP's shares, as will Soparinvest, part of the Albert Frere group of Belgium and Germany's Westdeutsche Landesbank. Saint-Gobain, the French glass and building materials group will hold 1.2 per cent of the shares, while Peugeot Citroen, the vehicle group will hold 0.8 per cent. Meiji Mutual Life of Japan will take 1 per cent, with the balance accounted for by Credit Local de France, the local authority lender, and the Caisse des Depots, the state financial institution. In addition to the core shareholders named yesterday, Banque Nationale de Paris will hold 15 per cent of UAP's capital, reducing its stake from the current level of 19 per cent. Under the terms of the issue, individual investors will be able to confirm orders for UAP shares from this morning until the evening of May 3. In the case of excess demand for the 47.3m shares reserved for individuals, there will be a clawback of up to 15 per cent of the 47.3m shares allotted to the offering for institutional investors.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Xu Yong (1776 0516) and KEJI RIBAO </F> (SCIENCE-TECHNOLOGY DAILY) reporter Wei Hongkai (7614 3163 0418)]    [Text] Washington, 11 Apr (XINHUA) -- On 11 April, The  Chinese Government science and technology delegation headed by  Song Jian, state councillor and minister in charge of the State  Science and Technology Commission, began its busy schedule with  a view to promoting exchanges and cooperation in the field of  science and technology between China and the United States. The  Chinese delegation visited U.S. Government research institutes,  met with U.S. Government senior officials, and made contacts  with people of U.S. high-tech enterprises.    The nine-member delegation headed by Song Jian arrived in  Washington on the evening of 10 April to attend the sixth  meeting of the Sino-U.S. Science and Technology Cooperation  Joint Committee at the invitation of John Gibbons, U.S.  presidential science and technology advisor and head of the  Science and Technology Policy Office of the White House. The  principal members of the Chinese delegation include Liu Jiang,  minister of Agriculture; Yan Hongmo, director of the State  Maritime Bureau; Hu Qiheng, vice president of the Chinese  Academy of Sciences; Ba Denian [1572 1795 1628], president of  the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences; and Ye Ruqiu, deputy  director of the State Environmental Protection Bureau. This  morning, the Chinese delegation visited the U.S. National  Standardization Technology Research Institute. Delegation  members heard an introduction on the institute's "advanced  technology plan" and "manufacturing and promoting cooperation  partners project" and also visited two institute laboratories.    This afternoon, Song Jian had a meeting with U.S. Interior  Secretary Bruce Babbitt and exchanged opinions with him on  cooperation in protecting wild animals. According to a Chinese  delegation member who took part in the meeting, Babbitt pointed  out that he was "deeply impressed" with China's protection of  giant pandas and other rare wild animals and China's enforcement  of laws against the trade of animals that are in imminent  danger. Song Jian proposed that the two sides strengthen  unified management on the issue of exhibition of giant pandas  abroad. He said that, in addition, the two countries could  cooperate to improve the technology of multiplying giant pandas.    In a meeting with Neil Lane, chairman of the U.S. National  Science Foundation, Song Jian expressed the hope of expanding  cooperation in the field of "major sciences [da ke xue 1129 4430  1331]." Neil Lane was interested in China's desire to expand  cooperation and invited China to take part in the plant genetic  map project that is being undertaken in the United States.    Later, Song Jian met with U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel  O'Leary  and the two sides discussed prospects of cooperation in the  utilization of conventional and new energy sources and nuclear  energy.    This afternoon, Song Jian also met with U.S. Deputy Defense  Secretary Frank Wisner and discussed with him cooperation in  utilizing military technologies by civilian sectors. The U.S.  deputy defense secretary held that China started the work of  having military technologies serve the civilian sectors  relatively early and gained some experiences that the U.S. could  borrow.    This evening, the U.S.-China Trade Committee and several  U.S.  high-tech companies, mainly aerospace and aeronautics  enterprises, gave a dinner party in honor of Song Jian and  delegation members. More than 70 people attended the party.  Chinese Ambassador to the United States Li Daoyu and several  U.S. congressmen and former congressmen attended the party.  Robert Rowe, former chairman of the U.S. House Science  Committee, spoke at the dinner. He pointed out: Both China and  the United States are big countries. The two should join  efforts, cooperate with each other, and should not be entangled  in issues like the most favored nation treatment.    Starting tomorrow morning, the science and technology  delegation and the U.S. side will take part in the biannual  Sino-U.S. Science and Technology Cooperation Joint Committee  meeting. The Chinese delegation will end its activities in the  United States on 13 April.    On the eve of his departure for the United States, Song Jian  was interviewed jointly by XINHUA and KEJI RIBAO reporters.  Song Jian pointed out: Sino-U.S. cooperation in science and  technology has great potential and broad prospects because the  cooperation can play a role in leading and promoting the  constant development of the economy and trade of the two  countries. He emphatically pointed out: Strengthening  exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in science  and technology is not only in accord with the basic interests of  the two countries but also beneficial to the progress and  development of all of mankind.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Typical household will pay 35p a week levy - Insurance premiums MEASURE A tax of 3 per cent is to be imposed on general insurance premiums for risks located in the UK from next October. IN DETAIL The tax will apply to insurance such as buildings, home contents, motor, travel, private medical cover. Long term insurance products, such as endowments, will be exempt, as will many types of commercial insurance, such as export credit and shipping insur-ance. The tax will be paid by the insured, but collected by the insurer. Tax avoidance measures such as paying premiums in advance will not be possible. In a separate move, tax relief on private medical insurance for the over 60s is to be limited to 25 per cent; the relief will also cover the new premium tax. PMI contracts will no longer have to be approved by the Inland Revenue before becoming eligible for tax relief. THE BACKGROUND Most other European countries already tax insurance premiums; the Chancellor said that 3 per cent was one of the lowest levels in the EU and estimated the levy would cost the typical household, with motor, home contents and buildings insurance, 35p a week.</p>

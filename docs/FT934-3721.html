			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Russian prophecy of doom: A top regional reformer sees trouble ahead The following gloomy prediction is not the pre-election bombast of the communists, but the prophecy of Mr Boris Nemtsov, one of Russia's ground-breaking economic reformers and a candidate in this weekend's parliamentary elections. 'Unfortunately the next year in Russia will be a year of tremendous inflation, unemployment, strikes, factory closures and very acute political conflicts. I see nothing good in the future.' Mr Nemtsov is the 35-year-old governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region, about 400km east of Moscow. His reformist credentials are impeccable. Until two years ago, under its Soviet name of Gorky, the region was a closed centre for the defence industry and the bleak site of Dr Andrei Sakharov's exile. Under Mr Nemtsov's leadership, it has become a flagship for economic reform. 'Mr Nemtsov's record speaks for itself,' says Mr Anthony Doran, manager of the European division of the International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank. The region's 100 per cent backing for reform was what led the IFC to pilot its small-scale privatisation programme in Nizhny Novgorod. Since then, the region has privatised between 65 and 70 per cent of its small businesses, auctioned off 1,000 trucks, and 'created a demonstration effect for all of Russia', says Mr Doran. Last month, Nizhny Novgorod launched a project to privatise land, a contentious issue in Russia where even in Tsarist times most agricultural land was farmed communally. Its first privatised farm is now receiving an average of 30 visitors a day from all over the former Soviet Union who are eager to duplicate the process. Thus, Mr Nemtsov's acerbic attack on President Boris Yeltsin's economic policies - together with his criticism of the president's draft constitution for concentrating too much power in the hands of one man and his distress at the way in which Mr Yeltsin handled the confrontation with parliament in October - indicates an election more complex than a stand-off between reformers and conservatives. Instead, a contest is taking shape between different brands of reform, in which regional leaders, with their hands-on experience, are advocating policies at odds with those of Moscow's free marketeers. Mr Nemtsov is highly critical of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the intellectual force behind the Russian government's tight fiscal and monetary policies, and the leader of Russia's Choice, the most reform-minded of the 13 parties competing for seats in this weekend's elections. 'Let's write a letter to Gaidar and tell him what a cretin he is - he is killing Russian business,' Mr Nemtsov says, sitting behind a desk on which a photograph of the governor together with former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is wedged between a computer and recent issues of The Economist. The burden of Mr Nemtsov's discontent is his belief that, while privatisation should be pushed forward, the government's macro-economic policy of restricting credits to the country's inefficient heavy industries threatens to destroy Russia's economy. Mr Nemtsov cites the local example of GAZ, one of Russia's leading automobile manufacturers, which employs a quarter of Nizhny Novgorod's working population. Tight credits have pushed GAZ to the brink of bankruptcy, but instead of restructuring, the plant is on a four-day week and threatening to lay off 20,000 workers - a move which in one fell swoop could erode the strong public support for reforms in the region. It could also send Mr Nemtsov plummeting from his current 78 per cent approval rating in opinion polls. '(Boris) Fyodorov (the minister of finance) and Gaidar's tight fiscal policy is doomed,' says Mr Nemtsov, a former theoretical physicist whose conversation is peppered with references to 'the idiot Gaidar'. 'They (Fyodorov and Gaidar) think that if we stop giving the large factories soft credits they will begin structural reforms. In fact, the contrary is occurring - factories are raising prices and decreasing their production,' Mr Nemtsov explains. 'They are not doing so because they are evil communists, but because they are monopoly producers.' Mr Nemtsov, whose views are shared by some other reformist regional leaders, believes his disagreement with Mr Gaidar is not purely ideological. Instead, he contends that Mr Gaidar has been 'bought off by Moscow bankers', who are profiting from the very policies which are hurting heavy industry, and cites the recent restrictions on foreign banks as evidence of Mr Gaidar's dependence upon the financial lobby. As an alternative, Mr Nemtsov favours the slower pace of reforms advocated by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, who was instrumental in drafting Nizhny Novgorod's regional reform programme and is the leader of the 'Yabloko' bloc. Mr Nemtsov is in favour of lower interest rates, tax holidays and 'controlled inflation'. Critics of Mr Nemtsov's ilk might not cut too deeply into the vote for Russia's Choice, but they could form a chorus which will pose a more serious challenge to Mr Gaidar's market economics than the shriller cries of the extremist parties.</p>

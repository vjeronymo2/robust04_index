			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> FALL KILLS LANCASTER WOMAN, 87  </P> <P> An 87-year-old member of the Lancaster Woman's Club died after falling 20 feet  from a staircase into the orchestra pit of the city's new Performing Arts  Center during a tour of the facility, city officials said today.  </P> <P> Viola Parr of Lancaster, who had a prosthetic device on one leg, apparently  fell sideways from the staircase into the pit about 4:45 p.m. Monday, officials  said.  </P> <P> The city's cultural arts superintendent was leading Parr and five other members  of the club's executive board on a tour of the $7.5-million center, which is  under construction and scheduled for completion by spring, City Manager Dennis  Davenport said.  </P> <P> Firefighters took Parr to Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center, where she  died about 8:45 p.m., a hospital spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> It was not clear whether the prosthetic device on Parr's leg played a role in  her fall, Fire Capt. Steve Salhus said. Davenport said there were no railings  on the staircase, which had a wall on one side and the orchestra pit on the  other.  </P> <P> "In our minds it is a pure and simple accident," Davenport said.  </P></p>

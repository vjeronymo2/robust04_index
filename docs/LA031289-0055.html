			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO KINDS OF ENGLISH RESISTANCE;  </P> <P> EDMUND BURKE HIS LIFE AND OPINIONS BY STANLEY AYLING (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS:  $19.95; 306 PP., ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> 1989 marks the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. Coming at the end of  a century of French intellectual leadership and followed by an attempt,  temporarily successful, to make Europe a French empire, the Revolution well  deserves the torrent of books that will be devoted to it this year. Two of the  first of these books deal with the resistance to the Revolution: Edmund Burke,  right, in the intellectual resistance, challenging the political philosophy of  the Revolution; Horatio, Viscount Nelson in the military resistance, blocking  the advance of Napoleon.  </P> <P> Conservatism, like so many of the labels of modern politics, acquired its  meaning through the French Revolution. The Bicentennial of the Revolution makes  it timely to have a new biography of Edmund Burke, perhaps the Revolution's  most enduringly persuasive opponent. In "Reflections on the Revolution in  France, " published in 1790 when he was 62, Burke developed his principled  opposition to large-scale change, especially when directed by intellectuals  armed with comprehensive social theories, which has come to define much  Anglo-American conservatism.  </P> <P> Burke also advocated hereditary nobility, and an established church. He  preferred "prejudice," tradition and usage over rights and principles. Yet his  political affiliations were not with the Tories but the Whigs, a party that  believed in commerce and progress in "manners." His own century regarded him  chiefly as the author of a quintessential tract of Enlightenment science,  "Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful," in which the  29-year-old Burke applied the new mechanical psychology to the experience of  art. The diversity, if not clashing inconsistency, all this presents to the  modern mind suggests the enigma of Burke's genius. Yet if we are to come to  grips with modern conservatism it is vital that we see this giant of  18th-Century British letters and politics steadily, and at least try to see him  whole.  </P> <P> Stanley Ayling's crisp narrative of Burke's life provides a good sense of  Burke's diversity and how it was intertwined with the turns of his career.  Ayling is the first biographer of Burke to have had access to the complete  extant correspondence, and he uses this source well to connect the private with  the public person. Ayling brings to Burke's milieu the sensitivities honed by  his well-received biographies of King George III and John Wesley. He presents  Burke's life as a sometimes noble, often quixotic, drama of heroism which ended  in private sorrow, particularly the early death of his beloved son and heir,  amid the general failure of all his public efforts. Burke's own phrase, "an  Iliad of woe," seems to capture his sense of himself and career at the end.  Ayling shows us that the man Mathew Arnold called "our greatest prose-writer"  lived his politics passionately: "He was incapable of private peace and  contentment if the nation -- 'the empire' -- was in crisis. It is significant  that Burke thought his nation was often "in crisis."  </P> <P> Burke's political life was largely spent attempting to reform the British  Constitution -- so as to restore what he conceived as its ancient purity. This  propelled him to champion the grievances of the American Colonies, to support  both Anglican Establishment and religious toleration, and to oppose colonial  oppression in both Ireland and India.  </P> <P> The key to grasping how it all hung together certainly lies in the interplay  between Burke's situation as an Anglo-Irish outsider who became indispensable  to a branch of the Whig aristocracy and his lifelong passion for rectifying --  rather than leveling -- the hierarchies of social and moral order. But here the  book disappoints. Ayling enables us to see the workings of the society which  was the matrix of Burke's life and thought. He does not succeed in making us  understand that context. With a thinker as significant and as complex as Burke,  this is an important shortcoming.  </P> <P> Ayling allows us to see how Burke made himself the advocate of that peculiar  marriage of landed stability and commercial progress which called itself the  Whig party. However, he seems to presuppose that the reader will find the very  uncontemporary patterns of the social and intellectual order of Whig England an  obvious frame of reference. For most readers, however, it will not be obvious  but strange, as the past is always strange. The need is not to eliminate the  strangeness but to make it comprehensible so that the unmodern conjunctions in  Burke's thinking may become comprehensible as well.  </P> <P> An admirer of Montesquieu, Burke thought that vanished social order he called  the British Constitution to be a coherent whole: hierarchical and sacred, yet  simultaneously commercial and dynamic. It is a conception no longer alive, but  the survival of its disjoined members in modern conservatism (and not only  there) indicates how important -- but also how difficult -- it is to try to  comprehend what Burke was so passionate about.  </P> <P> Ayling has given us an engaging tapestry of the significant patterns of Burke's  achievement. The need now is to understand how Burke sought to make it all  cohere, and then to show why it is significant for us that he tried to do so.  </P></p>

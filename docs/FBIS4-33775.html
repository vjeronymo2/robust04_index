			<p>BFN     [Text] Belem, 9 Jun (EFE) -- The 34 OAS member countries on  9 June decided to create a work group that will prepare an  agenda for the Summit of the Americas organized by U.S.  President Bill Clinton.    According to the resolution approved on 9 June during the  24th General Assembly, the OAS considers essential the  participation of the chiefs of state and government of all the  hemisphere's countries, except for Cuba, which was not invited  to the summit by the United States.    The Summit of the Americas and the Haitian crisis have been  the main subjects of many of the debates in the 24th OAS General  Assembly, which began on 6 June and should conclude on 10 June  in Belem do Para, northern Brazil.    During the traditional unofficial meeting held before the  assembly on 5 June, the OAS member countries' foreign ministers  expressed the importance of the OAS, as the main political forum  of inter-American dialogue, actively participating in the  presidential summit by presenting proposals and preparing an  agenda.    "I believe that one of the most important events of this  assembly was the decision we made on 5 June to make the OAS  actively participate in the Summit of the Americas," said  Argentine Ambassador to the OAS Hernan Patino.    "The summit is very important because we admit a reality:  The active participation of the United States in the solution  of the problems of the continent's countries is indispensable,"  said Ecuadoran Ambassador to the OAS Blasco Pena-Herrera.    OAS Secretary General Joao Clemente Baena Soares himself,  who  this month steps down from his post after 10 years, said in his  opening speech that the OAS should contribute to the success of  the summit organized by Clinton.    Baena Soares mentioned "the positive and immediate reaction"  of member countries to Clinton's invitation and added that "such  favorable conditions to promote a broad and creative exchange  among the chiefs of state and government have not taken place  for a long time."    "I think that during the summit the OAS could mark its  presence effectively. Its institutional organizations and  mechanisms can help prepare and put into practice the results."    After several days of consultations, the member countries  decided to approve on 9 June a resolution formalizing the OAS'  role in the preparatory process for the Summit of the Americas.    In the resolution approved by acclamation, the OAS General  Assembly recommends that the OAS Permanent Council -- which  includes all the ambassadors accredited in Washington -- "make a  contribution to the Summit of the Americas and follow up the  recommendations it will make."    The OAS General Assembly also recommends that the OAS  Permanent Council form a working group that "can call the  extraordinary preparatory meetings necessary for such purpose."    In its resolution, the OAS considers the Miami summit "as a  favorable occasion to adopt a plan of action that includes all  the agreed-upon solutions for the challenges faced by the  hemisphere's countries," as well as an "important chance to  strengthen inter-American dialogue and cooperation."    Considering that the United States must make consultations  and hold several preparatory meetings before the summit, the OAS  has offered to operate as the "main political forum for  dialogue" and to coordinate the meetings and prepare an agenda.    About the matters on which the countries of the Americas  reached an agreement during the consultations on the summit,  Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga said there is  consensus in three main areas: the strengthening of democracy;  the areas of commerce, investment, and integration; and  sustained development without environmental deterioration.    Bolivia hopes the presidents will "engage in an effective  dialogue and prepare a true working agenda in which hemispheric  integration -- which is nothing but extending NAFTA to all  countries of the Americas -- will become something real,"  Aranibar emphasized.</p>

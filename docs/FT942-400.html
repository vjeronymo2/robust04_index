			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / GRT joins rush to consolidate bus sector The consolidation of the UK bus industry continues at high speed. GRT, the Aberdeen-based bus group which came to the market last month, yesterday made a recommended offer of Pounds 6.7m for Eastern Counties, the company which serves the Norwich area. GRT thus became the latest of the recently floated bus companies to snap up a former part of the National Bus Company, which was privatised in 1987. Only about 10 of the original 52 NBC operations which were sold off remain independent. The small but growing sector of quoted bus companies comprises former NBC subsidiaries such as Badgerline, the Avon-based group which came to the market last November, and former local authority operations such as GRT, which was the subject of a buy-out in 1989. Earlier this week Stagecoach, the Perth-based operator which came to the market last year, made an agreed Pounds 27.5m share offer for Busways, the main urban bus company in Tyne and Wear, which was bought by management and employees in 1989 from the passenger transport authority. Mr Moir Lockhead, chairman of GRT, said he was interested in making further acquisitions, including some of the former NBC businesses and the 10 London bus operations which are currently being bid for. 'Prices have been getting a bit high, but Eastern Counties is profitable and will be earnings-enhancing from day one,' he said. Mr Peter Brundle, managing director of Eastern Counties, said: 'During the past few years the bus industry nationwide has seen rapid consolidation and the directors believe that only by being part of a larger group can the interests of passengers, staff and the wider community be safeguarded.' Mr Lockhead added that the existence of GRT's employee share ownership plan had made the offer more attractive to Eastern Counties. About 200 of the company's 850 employees have shares, with one cleaner owning a stake worth more than Pounds 20,000. GRT also reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.4m for the year to March 31 - slightly ahead of the prospectus forecast - on sales of Pounds 39.9m. Pro forma earnings per share were 13.9p, against 9.5p. The company's shares, placed at 160p, yesterday gained 1p to close at 157p.</p>

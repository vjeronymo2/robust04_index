			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATH AS A GOOD CAREER MOVE  </P> <P> Devine's logic doesn't make sense. Maybe talking to the leaves in Maine has  something to do with it; a liberal dose of California smog just might clear his  thinking.  </P> <P> He says Judas Iscariot made a "good career move" when he hanged himself with a  halter from the limb of a tree. We were taught that Judas was a perfect example  of a coward. Perhaps if he (Judas) had admitted his error and tried to make  amends he would not have gone down in history as someone to be despised.  </P> <P> As for the cruel description of Bette Davis "dressed like an aging whore" on  the David Letterman show, Devine states, "Her face was a monument to booze,  disease and cigarettes." If he had done his homework, Devine would know she had  overcome a stroke and bout with breast cancer. I think she showed exceptional  courage during her long ordeal. If she chose to dress up in a red dress with  glass beads, then I say go for it, Bette. I'm sure when Ms. Davis stood outside  the "great fake mother-of-pearl gate," she didn't have time to say, "What a  dump," because I bet she heard "Well done, my good and faithful servant."  </P> <P> DOROTHY CROWLEY-CAVECCHE  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Estates  </P></p>

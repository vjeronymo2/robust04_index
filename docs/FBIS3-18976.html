			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Selin Caglayan: "Ankara Challenges Russia on </F> Azerbaijan"]    [Text] Turkey has categorically warned Russia that it  cannot unilaterallly deploy troops in Azerbaijan. HURRIYET has  ascertained that Bilgin Unan, deputy under secretary at the  Turkish Foreign Ministry, informed Russian officials in Moscow  last week that the peacekeeping force to be deployed in  Azerbaijan must be established by international units. He said:  "Russia cannot be the only country to deploy troops in  Azerbaijan. Turkey will also deploy its troops if Russia sends  its military forces to that republic."    Stressing that Turkey will accept no solution that will  allow  Armenian forces to be present in Azerbaijan, Unan reiterated  Ankara's view that the solution must come within the framework  of the CSCE Minsk Group's effort. Russian officials have  insisted that their country's plan must also be effected in  parallel with the Minsk Group's effort. Unan responded by  saying that a comprehensive solution must be found to resolve  the dispute.    According to the Turkish officials' impression, Russia will  keep trying to impose Moscow's plan on the Baku administration.  The plan calls for the deployment of Russia's troops in  Azerbaijan. It has been ascertained that Ankara, considering  the possibility of President Aliyev agreeing to Russia's plan,  regards the Azerbaijani People's Front and former President  Abulfaz Elchibey as a second force guaranteeing opposition in  that republic to Moscow's intention.</p>

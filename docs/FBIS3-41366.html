The customs officers at the airport discovered a  quantity of hashish carefully wrapped in nylon bags and covered  with linen cloth at the bottom of each of four tins of cheese.    Three Lebanese citizens were immediately detained for  questioning. One of them is a customs agent, the second is the  owner of a travel agency, and the third is an employee of the  travel agency's office in Beirut. Investigations have begun to  determine the identity of three Saudis who asked the travel  agency to send the tins by air to Tabuk, Saudi Arabia. [passage  omitted]</p>

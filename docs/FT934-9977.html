			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Accountants press for limit on audit liability: Fears over growing claims from company failures THE UK's largest accountancy firms are lobbying the government to limit their liability when sued after a company collapse to as little as 10 times the audit fee. The campaign to remove the requirement that all audits must be conducted with unlimited liability comes as accountancy firms face a growing number of potentially crippling legal claims. The largest case in recent years is an Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.2bn) writ against Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney, now part of Ernst &amp; Young, in connection with their audit of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The Polly Peck collapse and the Maxwell case are also likely to trigger claims for substantial damages. Ministers are being pressed to change company law to allow accountants to introduce a negotiable limit on audit liability over company collapses or financial mistatements. Senior partners from the eight largest accountancy firms, including Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Arthur Andersen and KPMG Peat Marwick met Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs at the Department of Trade and Industry, to press their case in the summer. Since then they have had detailed discussions with DTI officials. Their ambitions are set out in a confidential briefing paper prepared by the group earlier this year. The paper suggests that without protection from unlimited liability, firms might refuse to agree to their new obligations under the Cadbury code of corporate governance. These would commit accountants to comment on internal financial controls and whether a company is a going concern. It favours calls for an amendment to section 310 of the 1985 Companies Act, which forbids any limit on liability in an audit contract. Its outline proposal is to limit liability as a multiple of the audit fee. The minimum suggested in the draft is Pounds 50,000 for sole practitioners and Pounds 100,000 for all other accountants, but all the figures represent initial bargaining positions. It also wants to make it compulsory for directors and officers of companies to have insurance cover, which would ensure they could pay any damages awarded. Having a statutory cap on damages - which exists in Germany - would be desirable but concerns over fairness and the failure to introduce it in other countries mean it is unlikely to gain sufficient political support to lead to changes to the law, it says. The eight firms' senior partners have agreed to provide the DTI with more information on the financial costs of litigation and to make a stronger case that no other groups such as shareholders would be disadvantaged by reform. They are also attempting to win wider support from industry and from smaller firms of chartered accountants before launching a public campaign for reform.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, April 23 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef  Moravcik is prepared to meet his Hungarian counterpart Peter  Boross at any time, either before the Hungarian elections or  after them, Moravcik says in an interview for the Hungarian  daily NEPSZAVA today.    A possible meeting before the Hungarian elections in May was  cancelled after the two sides failed to agree on whether a joint  communique should be issued after the talks. Hungary accused  Slovakia of showing a lack of interest in the meeting.    "Of course, no-one wants these meetings to be nothing more  than visits out of politeness," Moravcik says, adding that both  sides had to bring something.    He says there are three specific problems in  Slovak-Hungarian  relations, and if these are solved "an atmosphere of trust would  start to reign."    The first problem is that of the inviolacy of borders  between  Slovakia and Hungary, Moravcik says, pointing out that many  Slovaks, with or without justification, are afraid of the  borders changing in a way unfavourable to Slovakia, and this is  a "disturbing element" in bilateral relations. Slovak leaders  are aware that the Hungarian Government and realist Hungarian  politicians are not putting forward any territorial claims on  Slovakia, but in the interest of strengthening trust there is a  need for the Hungarians to issue a concrete declaration  confirming the current borders.    The second question concerns national minorities. "The  difference between the Slovak and the Hungarian standpoint is  only really apparent when it comes to collective rights," the  Slovak premier says. From the Slovak point of view there exists  only areas with a mixed Slovak and Hungarian population, and  therefore "a solution to the problem using collective rights  would not be proper." He adds that the Slovaks are naturally  willing to negotiate on "certain individual rights in such a way  that all citizens, regardless of their nationality can fully  realise their identity and cultivate their language and national  culture."    Moravcik says Slovakia is prepared to fulfil the  recommendations of the Council of Europe concerning the official  use of minority-language names and bilingual signs for towns and  villages. Everything is already prepared and it is just a  question of time before the relevant laws are passed, he says.    The third problem is the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric  project. Both the Hungarians and Slovaks should listen to the  opnions of experts more, and should try to depoliticise the  whole affair as much as possible, Moravcik says.</p>

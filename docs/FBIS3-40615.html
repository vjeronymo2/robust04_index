The finance minister for the present  government, who was also the PPP [Pakistan People's Party]  finance minister in 1988, has given us the good news that the  nation's foreign exchange reserves have doubled since the PPP  government's rise to power because of its better economic  policies. By following instruction to reduce the deficit from  eight percent to three percent over the next three years, the  rate of inflation at the time he took over the ministry has  fallen from 15 percent, to nine percent through its efforts. It  should be remembered that international financial organizations  were hinting at reducing the deficit to five percent. Madam  Bhutto, by ordering a reduction of the deficit to three percent,  has made a strong decision to help the common people. Within a  short period her government has decided to borrow money to a  limited extent. According to V. V. Jaffery, the amount of  government loans from the State Bank has been reduced, and this  may help bring down the loans from 35 billion to 11 billion  rupees. There is no doubt that during the previous government no  prudence was practiced in the economic area. However, we should  keep in mind that it was not only Nawaz Sharif's government that  had ruined our economy. His teacher, Ziaul Haq, was so  indecisive in financial issues that the dangerous results are  still in front of the people now. The caretaker government had  openly admitted that because of the actions of the previous  government, the country was on the brink of insolvency. It is  the responsibility of the present government, seeing the  economic misappropriations that have happened, to work hard to  put our economy on a strong footing. Their efforts will also  help the country's work force. Not only the government, but  every person in the nation must participate in this effort. They  do not have to follow the example of the previous government and  try to push the country's economy into a blind well. Instead, it  must take steps to build a bright economic future. It is the  responsibility of the Central Bank to maintain economic  stability in the country. But Zia never understood this  responsibility, because the Afghanistan war made Ziaul Haq a  favorite of the United States. It gave foreign aid to Pakistan  without any restrictions, and Ziaul Haq continued to increase  internal and foreign debts because of his unskilled economic  policies. The Nawaz group also followed this path, and control  of the Central Bank remained in the government's hands. Because  of this, prices, inflation, and the budget deficit continued to  increase, and the Nawaz government tried to avoid the problem by  printing additional currency notes. By keeping the State Bank  under government control, he had the National Bank issue huge  loans to his favorite people at nominal interest rates. He also  caused an economic crisis in the country by allowing these  people to open new banks without approval from the State Bank.    The caretaker government studied the whole situation and  issued an ordinance to make the State Bank independent in  October 1993. The present finance minister has followed this  decision, saying that old loans must be returned to the banks,  and that the process to collect taxes must be accelerated. This  is a good, solid plan by the government, and, if its claims  prove to be realistic, the people will see stability in  Pakistan's economic system. Inflation and the budget deficit  will also be controlled. Therefore, it is imperative for Madam  Bhutto and her economic experts to follow the ordinance of the  caretaker government, which had given autonomy to the State  Bank, approved in the National Assembly, so that the country  follows the path of economic discipline. This way our national  economy will be able to stand on its own feet without depending  on anyone else, and government workers will be able to take a  sigh of relief and be proud that they are working for the  government. This will reduce inflation. Madam Bhutto's goal is  still far away because she wants to reduce inflation to below  nine percent. However, these efforts are paving the way for  attaining it.    The industrial sector could use various tricks to avoid  paying taxes because they were close to Nawaz Sharif, and this  hurt the country's economy very badly. They put the whole burden  of their crime on the low-income salaried people. In 1977, the  people that Ziaul Haq had gathered around him came mostly from  industrial families. After 1985, new institutions emerged in  front of the people, and the balance of power went in favor of  the business and industrial sector after the army's priority.  Money became more important than faith and religion in the  country. These people used this power to gain important  political clout. They played with the rules and declared some  areas industrially frozen and tax-free zones. Investors  purchased huge acreage there and then sold them for large  profits. They earned huge amounts, but did not give one rupee to  the treasury in taxes. They profited in many areas this way. The  State Bank instructed banks and financial institutions that they  must receive an OC for any loan over one million rupees. In  addition, they are not to issue new loans until old ones are  paid. If we follow these steps strictly, then the causes of  unemployment will die their own death in our country. We should  start plans that make it necessary for our government to take  loans from inside or outside the country. Programs, as decided  by President Leghari, should be started to develop the backward  and underdeveloped areas of the country. In order to alleviate  the problem of insufficient health services, we must make sure  that every citizen has access to medical services. If the  government takes strict action to take back the loans worth 59  billion rupees from various industrial organizations, it would  be a welcome development for the people, and the plans and  projects started with this money would provide additional  employment to the people. The previous government passed the  limit of a 100 billion rupee budget deficit during its tenure.  It will be reduced by the return of these debts.</p>

And Honduran  President Jose Azcona Hoyo said that if the Contras turned their guns toward  Honduras instead of accepting a call from Central American presidents to  disband, they would be dealt with severely. "The Contras have to understand  that (their) military option is practically canceled," he said.  </P></p>

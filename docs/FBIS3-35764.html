			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Hryb comments are recorded] </F>   [Excerpts] Our correspondent Petr Makritskiy attended the  first news conference given by Myechyslaw Hryb, the new speaker  of the Belarus parliament. [passage omitted] Outlining his main  positions on getting the republic out of crisis, Mechyslav  Ivanovich focused on the possibility of new elections.    [Hryb] We assume -- as I have said before -- that we must  resolve the issue of how our state system is structured.  Whether we should we have a strong president, elected by the  people; or perhaps the Supreme Soviet will decide that we should  have a parliamentary republic. I absolutely do not rule out the  likelihood that this issue will be raised in the Supreme Soviet  in the future.    [Makritskiy] The new chairman was asked what his first steps  would be in his new post.    [Hryb] I shall try to look into the activities of our  Supreme  Soviet. We are not pulling together at all at the moment, and  in our present situation it will be very difficult to emerge  from the critical economic state we are in. We must learn to  listen to one another, understand one another; we have a lot to  learn in the way of patience in our work.    [Makritskiy] The journalists asked whether there would be  any  change in the foreign policy priorities of the Republic of  Belarus.    [Hryb] Our state's foreign policy course will not change.  Our course has been set: peace, friendship with all states,  with all peoples, recognition of our existing borders -- we  recognize those borders which are established today. We are  Slavs, we are neighbors, we hope to be good neighbors, first and  foremost to Russia and the Russian people, to treat one another  with respect.    [Makritskiy] Journalists got the following reply to a  question about the unification of the monetary systems of  Belarus and Russia:    [Hryb] I support the point of view voiced by esteemed  Stanislav Shushkevich in regard to the unification of currencies  and exchange rates and fuel prices. This option would suit us  very well indeed, then we could somehow regulate the prices of  our goods and sell them on the Russian Federation market.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Arts: Today's Television For decades, the Lancaster look has dominated country house interiors, so whatever you feel about gardening, it might be a pity to miss tonight's programme in the series, An Englishwoman's Garden (BBC 2, 8.30). Nancy Lancaster, aged 95, created a lovely garden just off the M40 outside Oxford. Including her in this hotchpotch series was obviously a temptation even though Lancaster was born in the US. However, she is still better known for her influence on the British concept in the postwar era of what makes for impeccable good taste . East: South Africa, An Indian Experience (BBC 2, 8.00) is the second of two interesting programmes about the Indian community in South Africa. There are roughly one million Indians in the country, and many of them feel that with the coming of black majority rule they are likely to find themselves sitting ducks. Otherwise, it is a dismal enough Friday night's viewing except for the gentle nudge of nostalgia which That Was the Week That Was (BBC2, 11.15) gives to viewers of the right vintage.</p>

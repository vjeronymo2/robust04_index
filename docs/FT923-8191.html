			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Serb forces switch prisoners to beat Red Cross checks BOSNIAN Serb forces are moving prisoners out of camps in Bosnia-Hercegovina ahead of impending visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross, in a bid to give the impression of better conditions, a senior US official said yesterday. Mr John Bolton, assistant Secretary of State for International Organisation Affairs, said in Geneva that it was essential to ensure the ICRC had immediate and unimpeded access to detention camps before transfers of prisoners became more widespread. Earlier this week, following an international outcry over conditions in the camps, the Bosnian Serb leadership said it would open more detention centres for ICRC inspection. Mr Bolton said the US had 'indications', independent of press reports, that 'Bosnian Serb forces have been moving prisoners in an effort to decrease crowding and improve the appearance of camps which may be visited by the ICRC'. It was important that the ICRC saw the actual conditions in the camps, including those held by other parties in the conflict. Mr Bolton was in Geneva for an exceptional two-day session of the UN Human Rights Commission on human rights abuses in ex-Yugoslavia, which begins today. A US-drafted resolution to be put to the Commission includes a demand for the ICRC to be granted 'immediate, unimpeded and continued access to all camps, prisons and other places of detention' in the former Yugoslavia. The resolution also calls for appointment of a special rapporteur to investigate human rights violations in the region and report back, with recommendations, to the Human Rights Commission and the Security Council by August 28. Mr Bolton said it was essential to have an objective, unbiased, multilateral investigation to sift allegations made by all sides and to make the facts public. The ICRC, by contrast, works behind the scenes to help conflict victims and prevent human rights abuses where it can. Based on the rapporteur's report, the US would be willing, in the Human Rights Commission and elsewhere in the UN, 'to consider additional steps', Mr Bolton said. This could include the stationing of human rights monitors on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, as proposed by Mr Max van der Stoel, the UN human rights investigator for Iraq.</p>

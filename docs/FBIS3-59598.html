According to Cray officials, the T3D must lead the  company to MPP market leadership within one year. First orders  include Switzerland, France and the United Kingdom. [passage  omitted, describing Cray T3D features.]  <H5>  Performance </H5>   On some tests, the 128-processor T3D system was as much as  four times faster than all other MPP products with up to 128  processors, Steve Nelson, head of Cray's T3D development program  said; and continued that in these tests, and in operation at  Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC), the Cray T3D system  demonstrated latency of under one microsecond. Latency -- the  time it takes for a processor to begin using data it has  requested -- is key to overall MPP system performance and  ease-of-programming, "current leading MPP vendors are in the  100-microsecond latency range, and are targeting the  tens-of-microseconds range in the next two years," Nelson said.  "For this key performance indicator, the Cray T3D system is  typically two orders-of-magnitude ahead of current leading MPP  products."  <H5>  Installations </H5>   PSC has installed and accepted a 32-processor T3D prototype  scheduled to grow in early 1994 to a 512-processor production  system. Other early customers are NASA's Jet Propulsion  Laboratory and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology EPFL  (Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne) which has signed a  preliminary agreement to acquire a 256-processor system in early  1994. These three customers will collaborate under Cray's  Parallel Applications Technology Program (PATP), to develop  targeted software applications for the T3D system.    Further European customers are the European Centre for  Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the French Atomic  Energy Commission, Commissariat a L'Energie Atomique (CEA).    ECMWF ordered a Cray T3D MCA64-8, a 64-processor, air-cooled  system. The T3D will be closely coupled with a Cray Y-MP2E  system also ordered by ECMWF. Both systems are scheduled to be  installed at the Centre's Reading, England, headquarters in  mid-1994. ECMWF will use the T3D to develop new forecasting  models that take advantage of MPP technology, and also to run  the Centre's ensemble prediction package, used to generate  forecasts provided to 18 national weather services throughout  Europe. In Ensemble forecasting, meteorologists run multiple  versions of a forecasting model, varying the data describing the  initial weather conditions with each run. This  computation-intensive technique is used to improve the accuracy  of forecasts by determining their sensitivity to variations in  initial weather conditions.    The CEA Division des Applications Militaires [Military  Applications Division] ordered a Cray T3D MC128-2, a  128-processor system that will be coupled with a Cray M92 system  that is already on site. The system is scheduled to be  installed in the fourth quarter of 1993 at CEA's Centre d'Etudes  de Limeil-Valenton [Limeil-Valenton Study Center], near Paris.  The French will use the T3D for research in fundamental and  laser physics, and for electrodynamic and aerodynamic studies.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Philip Morris chiefs committed to change The new bosses of Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, yesterday promised a sharp change in management style in an effort to restore growth to the company's flagging share price. Mr William Murray, who took over from Mr Michael Miles as chairman at the weekend, said: 'I want to say categorically that we are not committed to doing things in the way they were done in the past. I want to emphasise that point.' Mr Murray and Mr Geoffrey Bible, who took over Mr Miles's role as chief executive, were speaking in New York just three days after their promotion to the top two jobs at Philip Morris following Mr Miles's sudden resignation. Mr Murray said their overriding priority would be to produce rates of earnings growth that compared 'very favourably' with the rest of corporate America. All the group's businesses were performing well, and the domestic and international tobacco businesses 'had never been stronger,' he said. Superior earnings growth would produce superior cash flow, and this is turn would give Philip Morris the flexibility to consider a wide range of options for improving shareholder value. These could include a bigger share buy-back programme, bigger dividends, strategic acquisitions or debt reduction. Mr Murray confirmed that an earlier plan to demerge the tobacco businesses - seen by some as having brought about Mr Miles's demise - was off the table. He said structural changes to the company would always be considered if they enhanced shareholder value, 'but I do not think we will be making any announcements soon regarding separation or other forms of structure'. Mr Murray Green, Philip Morris's general counsel, said a demerger of the tobacco business had been abandoned because of the danger that it would be challenged in the courts as a fraudulent conveyance by those seeking damages from the group over smoking-related diseases. Mr Bible sought to play down the legal and political challenges facing Philip Morris over its tobacco operations in the US. 'We are confident that all of these remain manageable,' he said. 'On the litigation front the good news is that there is really no new news there. There are some new and experienced plaintiff lawyers, there are some novel approaches, but we also have extremely talented and experienced counsel working for us,' he said. 'And you must remember that we have never lost a case.' On the Washington front, Mr Bible played down challenges to the tobacco industry as the rhetoric of 'a handful of anti-tobacco legislators'.</p>

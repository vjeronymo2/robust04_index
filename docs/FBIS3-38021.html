Barkashov's men took an active part in the hard-line  revolt last October. ITAR-TASS learned of Barkoshov's  intentions on Thursday through his lawyer, Larisa Dementyeva.    Dementyeva also announced that, according to Article Five of  the criminal procedural code of the Russian Federation, "The  application of an amnesty should not depend on whether or not  the accused has confessed to the charges filed against him".    The lawyers of other participants in the October 3-4 events  refused, when asked by ITAR-TASS, to make any statements until  they receive the official text of the anmesty from the State  Duma. Procurator-General of Russia Aleksey Kazannik has promised  to distribute the text to the concerned defenders as soon as it  is forwarded to his office.</p>

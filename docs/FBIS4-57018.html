			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of the Haitian Army, General Raoul Cedras,  was interviewed on U.S. NBC Television. The general, questioned  on a possible U.S. military intervention in Haiti to allow the  return of President Aristide, said it would be a gross mistake.  For the Army commander in chief, the solution to the crisis  should come through dialogue. Regarding those who attempt to  reach Florida by boat, Gen. Cedras indicated they are economic  refugees. Rothschild Francois filed a report:    [Begin recording] [Francois] The first subject touched on  with Gen. Cedras on Sunday 8 May on NBC was the situation of the  boat people. To the Army chief, those Haitians who go to sea are  economic refugees. They go searching for greater economic  welfare and the American dream, he added. The general pointed  out that under the administration of President Aristide, in  April 1991, 400 Haitian boat people were able to reach Florida's  coasts. Clearly, to the first in command of the military  institution, the economic situation is responsible for the  refugees.    Questioned on the proposal made by some sectors of the  United  States who favor a military invasion of Haiti to restore  President Aristide to power, Gen. Raoul Cedras asserted that  such a decision would be a gross mistake and indicated that for  him, the solution to the crisis would come through dialogue:    [Cedras in French, with passage-by-passage translation into  English] You know that Haiti is a very small country. One can  always ensure trial of strength [?over night, over right]. I  personally think that a military invasion would be a gross  mistake.    [Unidentified reporter in English] Would you resist such an  invasion, or would you escape?    [Cedras] It is not the Army which is [word indistinct]. It  concerns a country, a country which must be indemnified, a  country which has its laws, its rights. You are asking me if I  would escape. I would tell you that personally, I do not have  any importance. The nation's highest interests order me to  support dialogue to reach a solution to the crisis.    [Francois] On the thorny question regarding his resignation  as head of the Army, and his willingness to respect the  agreements made on Governors Island, Gen. Cedras explains, and  we quote: The problem has always been wrongly posed. People  focus more, he says, on the superficial points included in the  agreement. For me, the Governors Island agreement is a global  plan which would allow for reconciliation among Haitians. I  was quoting the Army commander in chief. If the parliament  passes the amnesty law, would you be ready to resign as head of  the military institution and allow the return of President  Aristide to Haiti?    [Cedras] At this point in the situation, everyone in Haiti  and abroad should favor dialogue as the only way for us to reach  a satisfactory conclusion.    [Unidentified reporter] General, that does not really answer  my question. Would you be willing to accept an amnesty law and  step aside for President Aristide?    [Cedras] I am telling you that, when, in the Governors  Island  agreement, we considered the amnesty law, it was based on a  global plan. Now, we are talking about the amnesty law. What  about the other measures? What about those who did not respect  their word?    [Francois] During his interview on 8 May with NBC, Gen.  Cedras condemned the sanctions, saying they should have been a  means not a policy. He hopes the international community will  reconsider before the total embargo takes effect in less than  two weeks.    Gen. Cedras, who was questioned by NBC from the Teleco  [telephone company] Building, asked U.S. President Bill Clinton  to review his policy toward our country. [end recording]</p>

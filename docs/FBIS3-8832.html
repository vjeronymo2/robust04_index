			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister-designate Jozef Moravcik by </F> an unidentified correspondent; place and date not  given--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] [Passage omitted] The previous  government decided that state secretaries would leave their  posts. Are you going to fill these posts, or will the new  ministers abolish the decision made by former ministers?    [Moravcik] This decision made by the government is very  unusual and is very strange. I think that our people could and  should assess this measure and form their own opinions on the  matter. We have not decided yet to rectify this decision made  by the government. We want to have proposals this week so that  we can fill the posts of state secretaries and heads of offices.  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] From the citizens' point of view, the  content  of government activity will be the priority. What will be the  priorities of the government?    [Moravcik] The government will have only a limited period  for  its activity. The basic trends of its activity are already  clear to us. The order in which I am going to list them does  not necessarily mean what priority they are given.    The new government will have to secure political  stabilization and the calming down of the political scene. It  will have to secure the normal operation of state administration  and to stop the deterioration in some aspects of its activity.  The government will have to focus on the economy because that  is important for all other areas. I have said several times  already that it is important to stop the negative trends that  are becoming clearly visible in the economy, and to lay  foundations for the new government to build on these foundations  after elections.    [Correspondent] The tasks that you have listed indicate that  they will include measures that will be not very attractive to  voters. Hence, from the point of view of a voter, this  government may become less interesting. How do you view your  role? Is it really going to be only until the next elections?    [Moravcik] We believe that a realistic picture of Slovakia  and especially of its economy should be presented. I think  that, when a citizen gets such a true view of the reality, he or  she will understand measures that are inevitable to secure a  certain positive development of society after new elections.

The resolution said serious apprehensions have been roused  worldwide as the United States, Japan, South Korea and some  other quarters created a grave situation on the Korean peninsula  on the pretext of the "North' nuclear problem".    It expressed support to the DPRK' position on the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and dialogue, saying  they affirm their solidarity for the DPRK's policy of peaceful  reunification.    The National Executive Committee of the Mariateguista United  Party of Peru adopted a resolution on the Korean question on  March 1. The resolution said the "10-point programme of the  great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the  country" is a significant, highly important guideline for the  reunification of the country.    Noting that it is the aspiration of the international  community and the world people to eliminate all the nuclear  weapons and realize the denuclearization of the whole world  including the Korean peninsula, it called upon the United States  to promote DPRK-USA talks for a fair solution of the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula.</p>

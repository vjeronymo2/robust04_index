			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: Fujitsu, ICL in talks on marketing agreement FUJITSU, the Japanese electronics company, is in talks with ICL, the UK-based computer manufacturer in which it has an 80 per cent stake. The talks could lead to Fujitsu selling the ICL-designed and manufactured personal computers in Japan. ICL said yesterday reports that such a deal had already been concluded were premature. However, it agreed that the two companies were discussing possible synergies. Although Fujitsu has a controlling interest in ICL, the two companies operate at arms' length and marketing deals between them are struck on a purely commercial basis. An agreement to sell ICL personal computers in Japan would be mutually beneficial to both, ICL said. The personal computer market in Japan is dominated by NEC. It and other Japanese makers, including Fujitsu, sell PCs of their own design in Japan. The world market for PCs, however, is dominated by systems of a design (MS/DOS) popularised by International Business Machines of the US. Japanese manufacturers now accept they will have to open their home market to MS/DOS designs. ICL has substantial MS/DOS PC manufacturing capacity and expertise boosted by its acquisition of the computer interests of the Finnish company, Nokia Data, last year. The deal would also underline the growing confidence Fujitsu is showing in its European partner. It already markets ICL's high-performance workstations in markets other than Japan. It said last year it intended to extend that policy to personal computers. ICL, which uses Fujitsu microchip and printed circuit board technology for its mainframe computers, is now playing a part in the design of Fujitsu's large computers. Fujitsu has established a subsidiary in the US for the development of communications services, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo. Fujitsu said the wholly-owned company, Fujitsu Networks Industry, would be capitalised at Dollars 8m.</p>

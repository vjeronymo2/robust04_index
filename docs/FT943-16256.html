			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: S African shares post quarter's biggest rise The Federal Reserve's move towards tighter US monetary policy, begun in late February, provided the major theme for many equity markets during the second quarter of the year. The FT-Actuaries World index, however, rose 2.9 per cent in dollar terms, with a stunning 10 per cent advance in the Pacific region as investors rediscovered Tokyo and Singapore, more than outpacing declines elsewhere. South Africa provided the world's best performance in the three months to the end of June, as April's general election was successfully concluded and the violence which had marred outside perceptions of the country subsided. The market strengthened 14.2 per cent, almost eradicating the losses seen in the previous 12 months. European money which had begun flowing into the market after Mr Nelson Mandela was released from prison was augmented by American funds late last year as US city, county and state bans on pension fund investment in South Africa were lifted. More important was the appearance of specialist funds for South African investment by several leading US money managers, including Morgan Stanley and Alliance Capital. More recently, the IFC has said that it is to include South Africa in its global index of emerging markets within the next few months, with a weighting of 13 per cent. SG Warburg estimates suggest that this could imply inflows of between Dollars 6.5bn and Dollars 21bn into the market, compared with purchases totalling Dollars 650m last year. The market is, however, markedly illiquid, with only about 13 per cent of listed stocks changing hands last year. But Mr Michael Coulson at Credit Lyonnais Laing believes that Mr Mandela might be in the mood to change that next year through a privatisation programme which could include the telephone sector, South African Airways and Escom, the electricity generating company. 'It would be a wonderful way of liberating assets, generating much needed cash and putting money back into the economy,' he said.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                      MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change   % change                  % change in local currency **   sterling **  in US                                                             Dollars **           ------------------------------------------------------------                1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of   Start of   Start of                                           1994       1994       1994  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria         +2.34    +5.32   +18.83    -7.44     -3.40      +0.42 Belgium         -1.02    -4.40    +4.31    -8.09     -2.70      +1.15 Denmark         +0.81    +0.66   +13.81    -3.37     +0.86      +4.85 Finland         +0.02    -4.83   +44.37    +5.83    +10.79     +15.16 France          -1.28    -7.99    -0.55   -15.97    -12.65      -9.19 Germany         +1.08    -4.54   +16.42   -10.73     -6.48      -2.78 Ireland         -0.87    -2.66    +5.30    -8.94     -5.47      -1.74 Italy           -2.54    -7.09   +23.20    +9.92    +14.17     +18.68 Netherlands     -0.11    -4.55   +10.58    -8.89     -4.81      -1.05 Norway          +1.71    -4.04   +17.23    -3.04     +0.67      +4.65 Spain           -0.20    -9.00   +10.01   -10.16     -6.10      -2.39 Sweden          -1.93    -8.84   +19.19    -4.74     -2.37      +1.48 Switzerland     +0.36    -4.87   +10.60   -10.63     -4.55      -0.77 UK              +2.02    -2.29    +2.03   -13.55    -13.56     -10.14 EUROPE          +0.53    -4.52    +7.44   -10.89     -8.34      -4.72  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia       -2.81    -5.43   +11.74    -8.81     -5.83      -2.10 Hong Kong       -3.06    -7.20   +20.37   -28.22    -30.96     -28.23 Japan           -0.86    -1.48    +4.62   +14.20    +24.23     +29.13 Malaysia        -2.99    +3.22   +43.25   -24.71    -25.09     -22.13 New Zealand     -2.86    -7.41   +17.92    -9.34     -6.82      -3.14 Singapore       -2.00    -3.64   +24.40   -14.70    -13.35      -9.93  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada          +1.20    -5.99    +3.33    -5.78    -13.14      -9.71 USA             +0.82    -2.97    -0.87    -4.15     -7.79      -4.15 Mexico          +1.05    -7.40   +37.72   -12.62    -23.04     -20.00  --------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa    -3.36    -1.35   +35.10   +10.26     -4.31      -0.52  --------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX     -0.01    -3.04    +4.24    -2.12     -0.76      +3.17  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on July 1st 1994.

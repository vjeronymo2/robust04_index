			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Poorer countries grab more investment Developing countries are snatching a growing share of international investment and this trend is likely to continue, according to a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) to developing nations reached record levels of nearly Dollars 50bn (Pounds 34.2bn) in 1992 and about Dollars 70bn in 1993, Unctad estimates. As a proportion of total FDI flows, they rose from 33 per cent in 1992 to 37 per cent last year as overseas investment in the industrialised world continued to fall. The report, presented to this week's meeting in Geneva of Unctad's Commission on Transnational Corporations, notes that Asia continues to be the largest host developing region while flows to Latin America have increased since the late 1980s. Most African nations, and least-developed countries, have seen FDI flows stagnate or decline. Unctad attributes the rapid expansion of FDI to the strong economic performance of many developing countries as well as to privatisation and more open equity markets. However, FDI growth had created relatively few new jobs in multinational corporations worldwide, fuelling criticisms that multinationals were reshuffling jobs away from rich countries. Talks restart this week in Geneva which aim to open individual country markets in three services sectors - maritime transport, labour movement and basic telecommunications. Trade officials agreed to continue the talks last December when the rest of the Uruguay Round was completed. The negotiations on freer labour movement to supply services abroad, a priority area for developing countries, are due to be wrapped up next year, in parallel with talks on financial services. The negotiations on shipping and telecoms will extend until 1996.</p>

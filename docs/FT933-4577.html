			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Industrial Control up at Pounds 6.23m INDUSTRIAL Control Services Group, the electronic safety systems manufacturer which obtained a listing last year, raised pre-tax profits by 34 per cent from Pounds 4.64m to Pounds 6.23m in the year ended May 31. Turnover climbed 13 per cent to Pounds 72.9m. Mr Peter Hall, chairman, said the results were satisfactory and took account of the dilutive effect of the joint venture with Elsag Bailey which was forecast last year. The Bailey ICS joint venture and acquisitions had contributed to the results and Mr Hall was confident that the current year would continue well. The group was gaining a substantial amount of work in the North Sea, while continuing to win new contracts in the Middle East and Far East. In addition, the proposed joint venture in China was expected to establish an entry into the market. Earnings per share rose by 7 per cent to 9.76p (9.1p) after allowing for the joint venture dilution, and the recommended final dividend of 3.07p makes a total for the year of 4.4p (special 0.3p). The 1992 flotation proceeds helped reduce interest charges to Pounds 692,000 (Pounds 1.44m) in the year. Gearing at year end was 37 per cent.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: German engineering units ahead THE FLOW of black news from German industry was interrupted yesterday by reports of rising profits and pay-outs from two engineering groups. Barmag, which claims to be the world's leading synthetic fibre machinery maker, offered a DM2.50 bonus on top of a repeated DM10 dividend. Vogele, a specialist in road-building equipment, proposed a DM2 increase to DM12 after a 20 per cent increase in net profits in 1992. Against a background of deepening slump elsewhere in engineering, Barmag benefited from strong demand for exports. Net earnings rose by a third to DM36m (Dollars 22m) on sales up 20 per cent at DM1.18bn, the company said yesterday. The group, which exports more than 80 per cent of its output, reported especially strong growth in Asian markets. Incoming orders almost doubled last year to DM1.53bn and according to an interim report, further improvements are expected in 1993. At present Barmag has nine months' orders in hand, around double the level in engineering at large. Meanwhile, Vogele increased net profits 20 per cent to DM3.6m. The company has continued to enjoy the fruits of the infrastructural building boom in eastern Germany and exports more than half its road construction machines. While it expected a further satisfactory result for the current year, it noted that orders had fallen.</p>

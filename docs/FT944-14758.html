			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Arts: The Broken Heart - Theatre Marital discord, overpowering jealousy, eating disorders, the future of the ruling dynasty . . .I refer, of course, to - what else? - the 1633 tragedy The Broken Heart. Its author, John Ford, is better known for 'Tis Pity She's A Whore; but by some strange chance this year has already seen two London fringe productions of The Broken Heart, and now the Royal Shakespeare Company is presenting it at the Swan. The director, Michael Boyd, tells the excessively complex story with astounding clarity. And the story, albeit complex, is actually the great strength of The Broken Heart. I have called it a tragedy, but it only intermittently starts to compel any pity or fear. What it is chiefly, is full-bloodied melodrama of proto-Romantic type: the dark, tormented, Byronic hero Orgilus, alienated from society and from virtue because his beloved Penthea has been married by her brother Ithocles to another man; the suffering Penthea, martyred by her brother's action and by the crazy jealousy of her husband, Baffanes, until she is driven mad. It is a revenge tragedy, but it ends by transcending revenge. Heartbreak has been widespread among the cast, but we are unprepared for the final breaking of a heart that gives the play its title. And the princess Calantha, who has been a minor character hitherto, reveals a tragic authority that lifts us, at the end of the play, into awe. Like the plot, the language is full of striking effects which are more exciting than revealing. But that seldom bothered me while I was watching this production; and the role I had thought the most unplayable, the jealous Baffanes, becomes here in Philip Voss's performance, the most rounded and imaginative character of all. Voss, indeed, is emerging as the master-actor of the Stratford season. (His Menenius is the most multi-faceted character in the current Coriolanus.) He knows how to make Baffanes's jealously both ridiculous and dismaying. And how - only an instant later - to show the remorse and love that redeem the man. ('Light of beauty,' he exclaims, looking up from the floor to his wife, 'deal not ungently with a dreadful world,'). In movement and in speech, he brings abundant detail to the role, and makes him always convincing. Iain Glen, who plays Orgilus, has the same lack of stillness that marred his otherwise fine Henry V. His head, in particular, keeps moving during every line he speaks; and his voice adds unnecessary motion to his lines - with rises and falls and extra stresses that lend unmeaning decoration to his role. Too bad, since Orgilus's dark thoughts are the still centre of the play. In other respects, Glen's performance is excellently fresh, intelligent, urgent. But this is an actor of great gifts, who has not yet relaxed to discover the authority that could make him outstanding. Emma Fielding, as Penthea, is quite the opposite. This young actress has, in bearing and voice, stillness, authority, poise; and she has learnt a tellingly cleaner attack into words and phrases. Her stillness here has the same radiant pathos that it had, earlier this year, in Moliere's School for Wives at the Almeida, but here the radiance is of anguished, vigilant virtue. Her voice, based in an ever-developing contralto of rare firmness, has wonderfully touching accents and phrases. Her Penthea is planned out, scene by scene, with somewhat too much calculation; and the steady, slow walk (which reveals her repressed but incessant grief) becomes, for all its beauty, a shtick. Even so, this young actress is already a star. Several other roles are played with not quite all their power they deserve, but I note that both Robert Bowman (Ithocles) and Olivia Williams (Calantha) are young RSC actors who are gaining in accomplishment and force. Tom Piper's dreadful scenery with its clanking metal curtains should be replaced immediately, but his Jacobean costumes are handsome. One masterstroke occurs near the end, when the Princess leads a wedding-dance (choreographed by Janet Smith) that moves briskly while Craig Armstrong's slow music gives it no rhythmic support at all. The effect is eerie, and prepares us brilliantly for what will follow. In repertory at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Doeflex advances to Pounds 1.5m DOEFLEX, the plastic sheet maker, lifted pre-tax profits by 22 per cent to Pounds 1.51m in 1992, on turnover ahead by 40 per cent at Pounds 26.1m. The result was achieved in difficult market conditions and was after absorbing two acquisitions - Horizon and Iridon - into the thermoplastic sheet division, directors stated. The dividend is increased from 4.02p to 4.6p, with a final of 3p. Earnings were ahead 16 per cent from 10.59p to 12.28p. Group performance continued to be hit by depressed conditions in construction and DIY markets. Results so far in the current year showed intense competition in many UK markets but better volume and profitability overseas.</p>

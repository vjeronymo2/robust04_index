The  meeting was presided over by General Briquemont, commander of  the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In  addition to the commanders, the meeting was also attended by  General (Ramsey) and General (Filieu), Messrs. (Dimelo) and  (Andreyev), as well as Brigadier General Stjepan Siber.    The participants in the meeting discussed the situation in  central Bosnia, the opening of the  Metkovic-Mostar-Jablanica-central Bosnia road, problems  concerning the release of the helicopters of the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina in Medjugorje, and the obligations of the HVO  to allow the transit of a field hospital for Mostar.    After the talks, which were held at the request of Messrs.  Stoltenberg and Akashi, a joint statement was issued. The  statement reads:    First, the General Command of the Supreme Command of the  Army  of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the General Staff of the Croatian  Defense Council are ready to start talks on the ways of  establishing a total cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which  could go into effect pending an agreement between the  delegations of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.    Second, it was agreed that bilateral talks on the exchange  of  prisoners open, and that issues concerning the release of two  helicopters of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina currently blocked  in Medjugorje be resolved.    Third, General Roso has issued the authorization for  engineering material, including the ferries [trajekt] of the UN  forces, to set off on the main route from Ploce, via Mostar, to  the Mostovi area in Bijela. If the state delegations of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia reach a bilateral  agreement, talks on the realization of the agreement between the  Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian  Defense Council would continue.    This was stated in a communique issued by the Press Centar  of  the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

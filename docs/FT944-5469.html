			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / International Company News: VW and Ford loosen Brazilian straitjacket - Autolatina's winding up is expected to take the whole of 1995 The separation of Volkswagen and Ford's joint operations in Brazil and Argentina, announced on Thursday, could turn into one of the biggest and most complicated industrial divorces in history. The winding up of the holding company Autolatina is expected to take the whole of 1995. The company is Latin America's biggest carmaker and Brazil's largest private sector company with expected sales of Dollars 8bn this year. In Brazil, where the vast majority of production is concentrated, the two companies share seven plants and 47,000 workers as well as purchasing, administrative, financial and legal services. Vehicle production was 612,000 units last year. For VW, and particularly for Ford, there have been growing worries that what began as a lifejacket in 1987 when Brazil's car market was in a slump had become a straightjacket in the 1990s when production, and competition from imports, were soaring. Mr Pierre-Alain De Smedt, Autolatina president and future president of the VW subsidiary, says the union was 'the right decision at the right time'. It allowed the two companies to achieve economies of scale by making similar-looking hybrid cars from joint production platforms at a time when Brazil's market was largely closed to foreign competition. However, since 1990 Autolatina's structure has appeared increasingly ill-suited to an economy that has been gradually opened to imports and where production has soared following tax cuts and higher productivity. The trend towards global car production has also called into question the company's structure. Like Fiat and GM, the other two main car groups in the region, Autolatina has benefited from Brazil's rising market but its share of the cake has shrunk. Brazil's production will approach 1.6m vehicles this year compared with 914,000 in 1990. But during that time Ford's share of sales has fallen to 12 per cent from 18.8 per cent and VW to 33.6 from 37.4 per cent. Rivalries between the two dealer networks also played a key role in the split. Earlier this year the VW dealers' association succeeded in its battle to stop the company turning over the new production platform for its best-selling Gol so that Ford could produce a similar car. The opposition symbolised a growing dissatisfaction, prevalent among both VW and Ford dealers, that the two companies' sales and brand awareness were suffering from the joint venture. There were tensions within Autolatina. 'In the later years, with the move towards world cars, both sides got very protective about their research and Ford, for example, was worried that its numbers were being relayed to Germany,' says one industry observer. Mr De Smedt says the relationship was successful: 'There were no more fights than in any other family.' He also stresses that Autolatina was almost continually financially successful. Last year, after-tax profits increased to Dollars 377m from Dollars 48m in 1992 and it only once made a loss, in 1991. The task ahead will be to disentangle the companies' shared activities. Although the companies will return to their original factories the production of existing hybrid models will continue until the end of the models' natural life, which will mean in practice beyond the dissolution of Autolatina, says Mr de Smedt. This means, for example, that the VW saloon models Pointer and Logus, which are built on a Ford Escort production platform, will continue to be produced when Ford returns to take over its plant in Taboao near Sao Paulo. Ford will continue to build the VW cars and sell them to VW. There are important management challenges for both car makers. Ford, which dominated Autolatina's middle and upper management, particularly in finance, will have to find a new cadre of production managers. Conversely VW, which took charge of production management, will need middle and upper managers. For Ford, the challenge is to increase its slumping market share. Sales have been plummeting since the government announced in early 1993 large tax breaks for one-litre cars, which now dominate the market. Fiat's subsidiary has nearly doubled its market share to 26 per cent since 1990, partly thanks to its one-litre Uno Mille car but Ford has not had a small car to take advantage of the increased demand. The company is likely to expand its product line by importing more models. Importing has become a more viable strategy since the Brazilian government recently reduced import duties to 20 per cent from 35 per cent. The company is to import Fiestas from Europe next year and is planning a Dollars 450m investment next year to build Fiestas locally. Industry experts add that Ford will probably need to import a more powerful engine to replace the current model developed in the 1970s. VW's aspiration to return to its pre-Autolatina market share of 40 per cent is regarded as wishful thinking given the increased competition from both domestic competitors and from imports, which have increased sharply in the last two years to 10 per cent of sales compared with 4 per cent. However, it is still the dominant car maker in Brazil, which is VW's second most important market worldwide. Its strategy will be to rely on production of its new range of Gols, which range from one-litre models to a GTI model. It may also produce the Golf and Passat in Brazil. The company said it was considering a Dollars 100m investment in a commercial vehicles' plant as Autolatina's lorry and bus factory in Sao Paulo will be returned to Ford.</p>

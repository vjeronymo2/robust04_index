			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: All you need is love . . . and dress sense Sir, Further to your coverage of the Takarazuka Revue (Arts: 'Cross-dressing Japanese style', July 13), please allow me a brief word in reply. Is it really necessary to take everything in life so seriously? Or do people in England not feel that there are moments when you can say 'It may be crazy but I love it', or 'It may be kitsch but it's fun . . .'? You see, all that I am trying to do through my work is to bring a little more light into the world. And if we do have to be serious, please at least remember that, unlike some people, we do not set out to hurt anyone. I believe that it was your countryman John Lennon who said it best: 'All you need is love.' Shinji Kimura, artistic director, Takarakura Revue, 1-57 Ichome, Sakaemachi, Takarazuka, Japan</p>

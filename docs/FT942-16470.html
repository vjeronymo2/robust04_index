			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Books: Punk rules OK - Hanif Kureishi on John Lydon ROTTEN: NO IRISH, NO BLACKS, NO DOGS by John Lydon Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 14.99, 342 pages Rock star autobiography, as with the saccharine accounts by movie actors and politicians of their lives, is not a highly regarded form. With reason: few of these memoirs betray a desire to discover the truth rather than settle scores, and even fewer have any literary merit. Bob Geldof's book Is This It? illustrates that he is a better writer than singer, but it is an exception. For years John Lydon, aka Rotten, has been promising, or threatening, to give his side of the Sex Pistols story. Other versions of the history he helped create, notably those given in interviews by Malcolm McLaren, Vivienne Westwood and others, he has derided. He also refused to co-operate with Jon Savage on England's Dreaming, the one masterly account of that mad time of dazzling street-level cultural anarchy. Lydon was a rancid howling boy with decomposing teeth who led the group that changed British rock music - blowing out the monstrous over-inflated post-1960s bands - and whose echoing yells of hatred can still be heard today, particularly in the voice of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain. Unfortunately this is a long book, and Rotten's mind circles around the same concerns - who exploited whom, and what Vivienne and Malcolm did to him - like a rat in a wheel. The boy, once so bitingly sarcastic, has become very serious in his old age and cannot manage much colour, self-knowledge or wit. I think, too, that I would rather read Nigel Lawson's memoirs - twice - than hear another word about that dismal Romeo and Juliet of the Welfare State, Sid and Nancy. But at his most eloquent, and in particular when recalling his childhood, Rotten does have something to say. He tells of a London inhabited by spiteful Dickensian boys and uncouth girls, of petty thieves, junkies, dealers, hooligans, wasters, of sex-in-toilets and bottles-in-faces. He refers to Richard the Third, Clockwork Orange and Brighton Rock as influences; Pinkie and Alex as role-models. It is a shame the book is dull and repetitive, for Rotten's experience could stimulate and provoke anyone uninterested in rock music but concerned about Britain. For those gobbing and hating droogs of 15 years ago have been succeeded by a new generation which considers politicians scurvy liars and culture - including the 'enterprise culture' - a middle-class con. Punks, then and now, cannot be dismissed. They are our children. What release do many young people have for any creativity not bashed out of them? Their saving grace, amply expressed in a lot of rock music, is knowing that they have been conned, put-down, written-off. Ineptly educated and badly housed they are offered nothing constructive to live for, apart from, if they are lucky, some mindless badly-paid job. No wonder people were horrified by punk in the mid-1970s and are now terrified by its legacy. Fasten the doors, fix the alarms, build more prisons: your children are coming for your homes, cars and wallets. What else can they do to live? In the end, after all the tedious recrimination and bitterness is mercifully put aside, what remains of Rotten's magnificent rage is one record, Never Mind The Bollocks, It's The Sex Pistols. And what a record it is. If you play it today, like the early Rolling Stones, or the Who, it has an energy, caustic joy and subversive passion which is the essence of English rock music. It represents the dark, knowing and resistant edge of this wretchedly run, sinking-fast country. If 'England's dreaming', as Rotten once memorably howled, it has become a nightmare. It's enough to make you spit.</p>

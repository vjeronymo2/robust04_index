			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Bank of Japan We have been asked to make it clear that the figures concerning doubtful debts of Japanese financial institutions quoted in Saturday's Financial Times are estimates by Japanese bankers and not the Bank of Japan. The estimates are based on bankers' own assumptions and various data. The correct range of the bankers' estimates of the total bad and doubtful debts of banks and financial institutions is Y42,000bn-Y56,000bn as given by the table accompanying the article.</p>

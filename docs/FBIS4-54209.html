			<p>CSO     [Excerpts] Ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae, 58, is not  a career diplomat, although he passed the foreign service  examination upon graduation from the Economics Department,  College of Commerce of Seoul National University; most of his  government career was with the Economic Planning Ministry. But  he is not widely remembered as an official of the Economic  Planning Ministry, either. After the position of deputy  assistant at the ministry, he went for to study in the United  States. Returning from this study, he pursued an academic  career.    However, his academic career did not last forever. He  transformed himself into a politician, assuming the role of a  political advisor on international affairs to now President Kim  after meeting the President during his tenure as the director of  Foreign Language Institute. He had served as a member of the  13th National Assembly representing Kangnam district of Seoul.    And, with the advent of the Kim Yong-sam administration, he  is now a diplomat: Korean Ambassador to Beijing, with which our  government established an official relationship less than a year  ago and things have not been quite settled yet. It has been  only five months since Ambassador Hwang took office as the  ambassador in late May 1993.    With his various career experiences come the stories. It has  been reported that he was in charge of political funds for  President Pak Chong-hui as a deputy assistant minister of the  Economic Planning Ministry. [passage omitted]    [Pak] Reforms in Korea and those in China are completely  different..., how would you define, in fact, the nature of  China's reforms?    [Hwang] There was a surprising news article in the paper  this  morning. The article said that China will recruit 14,000  professionals in the fields of economics and technology.  According to China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's latest  comment, the engine of China's socioeconomic development is  China's elite. He further insisted that the elite should take  the lead to lighten the burden borne by the general public.  This implies, it seems to me, that he sees Chinese society as  two tiered: the elite and the general public. What do you  think of that? Officially, China pursues a socialistic path but  in reality its economy is entirely similar to that of a  capitalist system.    The difference you would find between our current economic  system and that of China, if you really have to look for one, is  in name only. Our market economy may be called an enlightened  market economy. The only distinction we might draw between our  economic approach of the 70's and the 80's, and the socialist  approach, is that we called ours government planning and  guidance instead of socialism.    In some aspects, China is more open than we were. A typical  example of this is the broad recognition of a local government  authority over its economy. Local governments have jurisdiction  over foreign trade activities under 20 million dollars. Most  import authority, except for major items such as automobiles and  TDX's (Transistor Data Exchanges), have been transferred to  local governments.    We should also note that China is training professionals and  entrepreneurs. In spite of systemic problems in its socialist  mechanism, China currently practices a market economy backed by  the Government. Whatever discrepancy there is, it's merely  semantic. In substance, it's exactly a market economy.  Recently Lawrence Kline, during the seminar he conducted in  China, said: The economy we see in China, called a socialistic  market economy, is a transitional phenomenon from socialism to  market capitalism, i.e. from a planned economy to a market  economy.    Jiang Zemin, president and Communist Party General  Secretary,  questioned (Kline) for an hour and a half. What China is hoping  for is that it would eventually arrive at a system--through the  course it is taking--in which all systems would function under a  market economy, except its political power structure, which  would remain controlled by the Communist Party. Of course, one  big question still remains: Can the Communist Party can keep  its grip on power as the economy transforms into a  market-oriented system. My view is this: The Chinese Communist  Party could be successful, for a while anyway, because the  Chinese people recognize and accept a one party dictatorship of  the Communist Party. The Chinese accept this, whereas the  Russians would not.    This is why, lately, President Pak Chong-hui's economic  development models implemented in the early days of our economic  development, and his biography are gaining popularity in China.  [passage omitted] I repeat: there are a great many similarities  between China today and Korea in the early days of President Pak  Chong-hui's rule. How the people of China manage the current of  democratic change would greatly affect the record rate of  China's economic development seen at the present time.    [Pak] Right after the Tiananmen Square incident, a scholar  named Ha Shin of the China Academy of Social Science (CASS) came  up with a theory called neo-authoritarianism which summarized  what you, Mr. Ambassador, have just said. In short, the  conclusion of this neo-authoritarianism theory is that  "political authoritarianism is necessary to bring about economic  development in Asia."    Validity of the theory has been evident in the Nationalist  Party system in Taiwan, the Lee Kuan Yew system of Singapore,  the period of Japan immediately following Meiji Restoration, and  our own past. Not long ago Mr. Peter Hyon [Hyon Ung] related  the following episode as I met with him in Beijing. Some time  ago, Mr. Peter Hyon asked President Pak, "When are we going to  have democracy in our country?" And, President Pak was said to  have replied: "At the present, we can hardly expect to see true  democracy in our country because we do not have the middle class  as a nation. But it is probable that we will have democracy  once formation of the middle class becomes reality as the result  of successful implementation of my economic development  policies."    Mr. Peter Hyon seems to imply that there is irony in our  country's political scene. What he means is that it was  President Pak's successful economic development, which brought  about the formation of the middle class in our country, that  made the advent of a civilian government of President Kim  Yong-sam. He was the most critical political adversary of  President Pak's. The power base of this government is the  middle class. Nevertheless, I wonder if we can genuinely call  the current political system in Korea democratic rather than  authoritarian. There seems to be something amiss in the system,  though we can not exactly pinpoint it, in spite of the  expectations we all had for the new administration early on.    The reform measures carried out in Korea seem to be  "forcedly  administered" in accordance with President Kim's visions, by any  definition. This seems to be incompatible with the current  worldwide trend. Although, I suppose, future scholars of  political science would sort out President Kim's reforms..., how  about, Mr. Ambassador, giving us your views on this? (As soon  as I presented this question to him, Ambassador Hwang asked me  to change the subject. And he wanted our conversation centered  around the events in China. Thus, our subject of conversation  turned to China.)    [Hwang] Let us look at what the future holds for China. In  addition to the fact that China's economy is currently growing  at the rate of more than ten percent yearly, one thing we have  to pay close attention to is the national trait of Chinese  people. I mean their patience in spite of everything. I  believe the people of China, with their patience and  forbearance, will definitely surprise the world. They are  showing, these days, the kind of economic growth observed in the  record-rate growth of Japan in the 60's and in our own economic  growth of the 70's. By the time the 21st century rolls around,  their economic growth will definitely surprise the world. And,  as the economy grows, the democracy will follow; wouldn't you  say?    Here, once again, the question one might raise is how long  the socialist ruling system of the Communist Party could last.  Although this is strictly my own personal opinion, we are the  only country among Asian nations that arrived at democracy as  the result of economic growth. Where Korea has arrived is only  a natural outcome, considering that the path it took was a  textbook case of the Western theories. Yet, it remains to be  seen whether the case of Korea could be considered a general  rule applicable to the development history of all Asian nations  or an exception.    It would be difficult to expect, even after the year 2000,  that there would be a change in China from the state of the  system in which the press were censored and that the Communist  Party would not cling to the system of one party rule. But I  suspect there would be a change in division of power between the  central and the local governments in China. What I mean by this  is that the central government would deal with foreign policies  and national defense, and economic matters would become the  responsibilities of various local governments. In other words,  I am contemplating the possibility of China, with such vast  territory, becoming a "United States of China" as the result of  division of power between its central and provincial governments.    [Pak] However, publications in Hong Kong gave the impression  that the reform faction, who attempted the delegation of power  to provincial governments, had been crushed during the course of  Tiananmen Square incident. They said that, at the time, Za  Ji-yang, the General Secretary of the Party, initiated the  process of delegating authority to local governments, having  concluded that "the centralized power was not the answer," and  came to encounter the Tiananmen Square incident, and that  Premier Li Peng, after the Tiananmen Square incident, stalled  the delegation of power process and began to reinforce  centralization of power.    [Hwang] Nonetheless, currently, the most often debated  subject is actually local governments' rights to separation of  power. They say that this is a major subject of research at the  Chinese Academy of Social Science. There have been numerous  books written about it and I recall an article stating, "The  worst enemy of China is in the provincial issues."    At any rate, there is hardly a sense of insecurity about  openness and reform in China today. The people feel confident  enough in carrying out reforms to be adventurous. One other  indisputable fact is that Mao Zedong's populism is finished in  China. But it seems that this is not the case in our country.  I remember reading a Korean newspaper article, in which the  writer stated, "Ten percent of the public are reluctant to  endorse the reform although 90 percent welcome it." The point  the writer is making is that the ten percent still deserve  critical attention even though the reform was being applauded by  the other 90 percent.    In socialism, certain measures are designed for popularity  with the masses rather than being based on their own merits,  but the reform measures in China today are based on their own  strengths. For farmers, the only measure taken by the state is  economic assistance such as providing the development funds,  otherwise, they are left alone. Thus, the populism is  disappearing in the economic front, as well.    [Pak] There is Ozawa in Japan and there is Deng Xiaoping,  though aged, in China. Who, in your opinion, would be the  comparable leader in our country who would lead the nation with  a set of objectives?    [Hwang] In my opinion, President Kim holds the idea that  "power is inherently corrupt," having spent 30 years as an  opposition party leader. Accordingly, he is strong on  dissecting things but seems to have somewhat detached optimism  toward a subject matter, once sorted out, in following it  through. He seems to believe that things do get better when you  shake them up. For the truth of the matter, we will just have to  wait and see. Economic matters do not always seem to follow  this reasoning.    [Pak] As for the precedence in China of controlling cultural  life being an impossible task as seen in the short-lived  Cultural Revolution initiated by Mao Zedong...    [Hwang] What it amounts to is that Mao Zedong stepped on a  tiger's tail.    [Pak] Cultural Revolution ended in 1976 Tiananmen incident.  The forcible control of the incident by the military killed the  Cultural Revolution. Learning a lesson from this, do you think  it at all possible that the reform in Korea might end in the  same fashion one day suddenly like the demonstrators in front of  Seoul City Hall, crushed with force because of the policies that  encourage and please only the poor and lower strata of our  society?    [Hwang] It seems unlikely. President Kim has long, hard  experience with political dissent. He is identified with the  mass participatory democracy (democracy in which the mass public  participates). The mass democracy surrounding the Cultural  Revolution was not quite the same thing. Should I have to  define the current state in Korea whether it was a mass  democracy or an elitism democracy, I would at the moment, tend  to call it a mass democracy.    If detracted, a mass democracy could result in a populism.  What started as a mass democracy could, by one misstep, become  a populism. However, in any event, there will be a period of  pause for reassessment our reform after it reaches a certain  point. You cannot just tear things down nonstop, of course. If  things begin to generate fears, there could be little chance for  any further construction. The way I see is that the  house-cleaning and the symbolic phases of reform have been  concluded with the implementation of the real name financial  system. What remain would be reform efforts in areas such as  education, administration and financial system. I can not  imagine that the President would make any wrong move. He is now  at the threshold of his policy for which he would need a  metaphysical perspective and operations management skills. In  the case of Mao Zedong, there is strong evidence that he was  reaching for equality of consequences and horizontal equality;  in other words, he was not only for economic but also political  equality. But President Kim, quite apart from what Mao Zedong  personified, is trying to realize much more liberal democracy,  through his reform which is a reflection of reassessment and  surgical in nature. There is no comparison between President  Kim and Mao Zedong because what President Kim is trying to  accomplish is not to realize equality for all but to carry out a  "surgical operation" as the necessary intermittent course of  action. And, there is no paralled between the two.    [Pak] Russia is lately going through turmoil. Originally,  Russia and China had the same political system; yet, China seems  to keep things relatively well under control and Russia seems to  have such difficulty; what could be the reason?    [Hwang] There are two reasons. Russia has been a country  which has not meant to be one nation. What binds a nation  together is its nationalism; is it not? A sovereign state has  to have a common sense of a nation in order to establish itself  as a nation and the Soviet Union was not able to establish  itself as a nation from the very beginning. The reason the  Soviet Union, despite this, became a nation is that it used the  ideology, socialism, as the common thread binding the nation  instead of nationality. Thus, the first reason: The Soviet  Union had used the oppressive policies of communism.    The biggest distinction we see between China and the Soviet  Union is that China still retains its nationality even after the  worldwide demise of socialist foundation. And the second reason  is that China, backed by this nationality and through its  economic development, was able to give its citizens hope that  they would have a better living.    I think the foundation for better living in the Soviet Union  fell also after the fall of socialist foundation, don't you?  Thus, I believe the nation which benefits the most from the  disintegration of the Soviet Union is China. The People of  China are confident. I think the people of China themselves  care very little about issues such as freedom and so forth but  are all for making money right now, although the outside world  has been busy lately talking about the anniversary of the  Tiananmen Square incident; don't you? They concern themselves  little with things like human rights.    [Pak] I remember a story. At the time of the fall of the  Soviet Union, Deng Xiaoping was said to have remarked: "In  Russia, the man named Gorbachev violated a cardinal rule.  Disregarding Marx's maxim that, for an organization, the change  of its upper echelon would naturally follow if its base units  were successfully changed, Gorbachev initiated perostroyka which  was intended for reform of the upper structure and ended up in  miserable failure for the lower structure too of the Soviet  Union." And Deng Xiaoping was said to have instructed that the  firm grips on the upper echelon should continue but there should  be diligent efforts to nurture and strengthen the lower echelon.    [Hwang] The story has a good point. The Soviet Union had to  deal with the additional problem of geographic sectarianism in  addition to the fall of its two main ideologies: socialism and  equality. And the Soviet Union ended in turmoil, as it was not  equipped with an ideology to overcome this sectarianism, and the  central government authority disintegrated. Furthermore, the  third contributing factor was the fact that the hope for a  better future of its people, too, has been destroyed; hasn't it?  Contrasting this, there is a superabundant hope among its  people in China that the 1.2 billion population will have a  better future with improved living standards, don't you think?    [Pak] Some say that the reforms currently in progress in  Korea do not accompany a strong lower-level structure,  organizationally. What they are saying is that the whole system  could become shaky as the result of the current frequent  practice of restructuring and cutting the upper echelon under  the assumption that all is well with the lower echelon as the  upper echelon in the days of (5-6 Kong) could easily have been  manipulated to implement successful economic policies for their  ineptitude.    [Hwang] They have a point. Because we realize that what  President Pak had practiced was the economy pulled by an  enlightened government. This economy pulled by an enlightened  government seems to be in a state of confusion because it lost  its center post one morning as the political scene had changed.  Supposing that you wake up one morning to find that for a  government assistance to your business had been dashed, you  would naturally be overcome by the fear of your bankruptcy;  wouldn't you? I would like to call it regimentation, i.e.  business health maintenance. Although President Kim had already  stated along the same lines, I believe, the system should be  able to nourish businesses despite the change in political power  structure. We cannot afford the government's hands-off policy  neglecting the health maintenance of businesses.    You know as well as I do that a patient's life depends on  the  care given for recovery after surgery. This is precisely the  type of problem our nation's economy faces right now. it raises  a vital concern for us to contemplate where we would be in the  next few years with economic growth of only four percent per  year compared to the 13 percent annual growth rate of China with  a population of 1.2 billion. One other point here: it would  indeed be a grave situation if the relationship between our  economy and China's ever became competitive. We must keep the  relationship to be one of co-existence and cooperation. From  the start, we and China were not to compete against each other.    The point I would like to make is that we should place  strong  emphasis on investment in China rather than trade. Our  investment would lead a path to a joint progress through our  technological resource and China's labor force. This is a  relationship of coexistence and cooperation. We ought to  cultivate a strategic relationship of cooperation with China  through our investment in such industrial fields such as the  automotive industry. If we limit ourselves to short-term trade,  which is bound to be competitive in nature, we would not last  for very long. The objectives of Korea-China relations should  be coexistence-cohabitation centered around investment rather  than trade.    [Pak] Although what you have just said is probably true in  an  economic field, China appears to hold its prescribed opinions on  its neighboring countries as was shown in the political  situation of Cambodia. It seems that China would like to have  the governments of the nations near its border under its  influence as was demonstrated in its welcome for Sihanouk with  open arms when he had nowhere else to turn to. China has  maintained its own plans on North Korea and I wonder if it has  not had its operating objectives toward South Korea, with which  it had not had official relations for the past 40 years, to  realize a structural change in, South Korea, receptive to its  political influence.    [Hwang] In the past, there had been a period in China when  its internal politics were dictated by Mao Zedong and its  foreign policies by Chou En-lai. During the period, Chou En-lai  left a monumental legacy, considered to be of timeless  soundness, for the conduct of international politics. To be  exact, it consists of five principles of peaceful coexistence.  Those five principles are still adhered to, today by the  government of China. I believe some of the results of China's  foreign policy based on the five principles are seen precisely  in the cases of Cambodia's Sihanouk and also of Arafat; wouldn't  you say?    I heard that Arafat visited China more than 30 times. There  has been not a single deviation in China's foreign policy  conduct from the five principles of peace. (Chon Ki-song),  (foreign minister of China), has been saying the same thing at  the United Nations recently. Ever since the Bandung Conference  of 1955, they have consistently been the guiding principles of  China's foreign policy. During that time, even faced with some  hard choices, China has been consistent in maintaining its  posture adhering to the principles without a compromise. This  is the foundation, I believe, on which China has been able to  maintain consistent relations with Sihanouk and Arafat. China's  move on North-South Korea relations is based on the principles,  as well. I understand China made its position clear stating  that it "supported negotiated relsolution through dialogues but  opposed any rival conflict as a means of solution for the  North-South Korea relations and firmly believed in nuclear-free  Korean peninsula."    These principles maintained by China impressed Kim Il-son  recently, as well. It appears that Kim Il-song acknowledged  them, for the first time. He said, "China's reform and open  policies are going rather well." China's five principles of  peace are having great effects on the relations between the  United States and North Korea. I suspect the reasons behind  North Korea's approach to the United States, of course, are to  prevent a United States military attack or economic embargo.    However, the principal cause for North Korea's overture to  the United States was, above all, the application by China of  its five principles of peace to the issues of Korean peninsula.  Eventually, North Korea had little choice but to follow the  Chinese initiative. As you may recall, North Korea clearly  stated that it would maintain dialogues with the United States  as China wished, and lead a policy toward foundation for  stability in Korean peninsula and its borders," to Ho Kum-su, a  regular member of the Chinese Communist Party Political Bureau,  and Wang Han-mu, Vice Chairman of the Standing committee of the  National People's Congress of China, during their visits to  Pyongyang.    I wrote about this in my report to Seoul not long ago. North  Korea's openness would follow once the nuclear issue between the  United States and North Korea, and the problems between South  and North Korea and between North Korea and the International  Atomic Energy agency were resolved. Kim Il-song would move  quickly to openness. That was my report.    Also, I sent a long report concerning our approach, had  North  Korea decided to take the road of reform and openness. We would  benefit from China's five principles of peace, just as Sihanouk  of Cambodia did.    [Pak] If my memory serves me correctly, I believe diplomatic  issues had been nearly non-existent in China during the Cultural  Revolution because of preoccupation with internal problems.  There had not been, on China's part, any mention of the five  principles of peaceful coexistence for some time, even after the  Cultural Revolution. About the fall of 1989 China all of a  sudden proclaimed "We will resurrect the five principles of  peaceful coexistence we had in past and adopt them as the  principles for foreign policy of today. It seems to me that this  revival of the five principles of peaceful coexistence of the  50's happened because China saw the need for peace and order in  carrying out its reform, openness, and economic development, as  it was experiencing internal difficulties surrounding the  incident of Tiananmen Square. Lately, the five principles of  peaceful coexistence are being applied to the issues of Korean  peninsula as well. Have you not observed any attempt or move by  China to secure a leverage for its influence in Korea, i.e. to  install a group supporting China by forming a pro-China  political faction in Seoul, etc.?    [Hwang] On that point, the Chinese do not seem to be overly  anxious. The way they see it, it seems, is that China could  return to its past glory as a strong power by uplifting its  economy as a nation, and freeing itself of foreign economic  pressures. What they are trying to do preponderantly seems to  be to maintain good-neighbor relations with most of the nations  of the world, but to be alert enough not to be ignored or  intimidated by any. They seem to think that the number of the  nation's population, 1.2 billion, in and by itself gives them a  supremacy.  [Pak] Not long ago, Kim Il-song had made, it seems to me, a  remark of major proportion when he said, "China's reform is  encouraging to us, North Koreans," during the visit to Pyongyan  by (Wang Han-mu), (Vice Chairman of the National People's  Congress (NPC)) of China.    [Hwang] Kim Il-song came to Beijing 99 times, but, since the  establishment of diplomatic relations between South Korea and  China last year, he has not made a single visit to Beijing.  China discontinued its once brisk exchanges with North Korea  and high-level exchange has become infrequent. After one year  of this kind of atmosphere, Kim Il-song had no choice but to say  that China's reform was the right course of action. That portion  of Kim Il-song's speech in which he said that "China had become  a nation of wealth through its reform and openness" deserves a  special attention. The word "wealth" is reminiscent of the old  concept of "a nation of wealth and mighty army" and not of a  vocabulary conducive to the socialistic ideals. In other words,  the word connotes the idea of luxury living; wouldn't you agree?  The word takes the bite out of combative spirit. Thus, we  might say that what Kim Il-song said was that Chinas' becoming a  nation of wealth had been an encouragement to North Korea.  Realizing this, we can understand why Kim Il-song said to China  "there would be no rival conflict in Korean peninsula." And,  about the nuclear issue, he said that there would be  satisfactory dialogues with the United States. This, I believe,  was the meaning of Kim Il-song's statement.    Although it might be somewhat premature to draw a conclusion  definitely as such, I suspect, reading fine points in what Kim  Il-song said, that North Korea would join hands with China soon,  is pursuing its reform and openness. In this context, it calls  our attention to the fact that North Korea is ready to accept  China's venture capital in the Nachin frontier area, north of  Chongjin. One other interesting development is the story being  circulated that North Korea would give a 50 year lease of  Chongjin to China.    My gut feeling is that North Korea is trying to develop the  area of the Nachin frontier and Tumen river basin to such a  massive scale that, once completed, would resemble nothing we  have seen or heard of so far in North Korea. What North Korea  is betting on is that once China invests its capital in the  region, naturally South Korea would follow and, then, Japan,  Taiwan and Hong Kong and so forth, as well. It would be a big  mistake if we did not take our part in the investment and left  when China invested its capital in North Korea. We have to  prepare ourselves for this. As for Kim Il-song, I doubt he  would ask for a direct dealing with South Korea. He would  probably look for the dealings with South Korea through China.  This is one of the reasons why our relationship with China is  critical to us.    [Pak] If and when such a prediction becomes reality, I  suppose our economic potency, above all, would be a critical  factor; do you think we might be left out because of our less  than ideal economic posture?    [Hwang] There are a few facts that should make us feel safe  as far as China is concerned. First, we are at least 10 years  ahead of China in economic development.    Secondly, we as a people have always been very cost  conscious, i.e. driven for efficiency. In contrast, cost  consciousness or cost accounting is not the norm in China. This  is, in a way, a detrimental shortcoming of China's economy.    Thirdly, people in China are used to being ordered around by  bureaucrats to manage their economic lives. It would take a  long time for China to arrive at the properly functional  mechanism and system of its economy, including those financial  and monetary areas. Recently, they have been studying Japan's  monetary system. Setting up the system alone would take China  the next four to five years at least, as they are currently  debating about institution of a taxation system.    As for economic systems, I believe China is 10 to 15 years  behind us. I don't think we have to worry much if China  continues at this current pace. If we fail to invest more  capital and improve our technology, and China keeps up its  economic growth at the current rate, which is 13 percent per  year, we will have a big problem. However, we need not worry, I  believe, if we deal with the situation, as we did before, with  new investment and continued improvement on management  technology of our industry.    [Pak] Yasushi Akashi, a former Japanese Ambassador to  Thailand, is famous for having made it possible for Japan to  expand outward. As an ambassador to a Southeast Asian nation,  he led Japan into Southeast Asia. Have you, Ambassador,  considered yourself the Korean version of Yasushi Akashi  regarding our relationship with China?    [Hwang] There has been a lot of criticism lately. As you  probably heard, the Germans rushed into their reunification too  hastily. What is clear to us is that the reunification of North  and South Korea is the most important of all issues regardless  of its final shape or form. Nevertheless, we can learn a lesson  from the case of East and West Germany and be ready to let North  Korea choose its own way of life, which, I believe, is terribly  important. Even after the fundamental issues were ironed out, I  am afraid that there would be a considerably long period in  which North and South Korea would be in a state of commonwealth  or federation, meaning one nation with two different systems.  In order to achieve all these, we must maintain our close  relationship with China. The reason for this is obvious. North  Korea is currently in a situation where it would welcome any  party that came jointly with China. The timing and the laying  of foundations for unification should also be attempted and  attained with the help of China.    [Pak] It has been over five months now since you arrived in  May of this year. How do you, Mr. Ambassador, assess the  situation? Has it been a wise policy decision, on our part,  that China should lend a helping hand in order to keep North  Korea from causing any trouble?    [Hwang] North Korea at present still remains a country whose  people are have a hard time just affording three meals a day.  In contrast, per capita income in South Korea is more than  6,000 dollars and if the two countries merge, with this  backdrop, it is highly probable that this disparity would cause  a further division internally for the nation. The economic  disparity would naturally lead into cultural discord and  adversely affect the very lives of the people. We must exercise  the utmost care in order not to rush into things as even Mr. Kim  Tae-chung stressed. It takes time to solve socioeconomic  problems. I believe any hasty action out of political  expendiencey could simply compound the problem.    [Pak] I recall seeing Mr. Han Sung-ju, once in the early  part  of this year, prior to becoming the Foreign Minister, on  television conversing with Professor Lester Thurow of the United  States. As Minister Han said "we were greatly concerned about  the cost of unification," Professor Thurow, with a grin in his  face, was saying: "West Germany had a detailed plan to improve  the East German living standard to the same level as West  Germany's within five years. Part of this plan included a  program to install a $3,000 cellular telephone for East German  families despite the fact that the West Germans used an 800  dollar telephone in their homes. This was an example of why it  was necessary for West Germany to deal with unification cost.  But I would question, indeed, if such preposterous measures  would necessarily be considered a part of Korean unification  cost." He seemed to be saying, in other words, it could be a  strategic mistake for South Korea to place too heavy an emphasis  on unification planning, and...    [Hwang] Professor Thurow is purely an academic economist.  Economic solutions alone would not bring answers to  politico-cultural questions and the emotional question of a  nation within. We should consider unification cost a secondary  issue. Problems we would face as a nation are political though  they contain elements of economics, too, to a degree. Consider,  if you will, that there are people who shed tears simply by  viewing Kim Il-song, in North Korea, particularly. This is not  the same as the East Germans felt about Honecker.    We have to look and see things beyond their superficial  appearances. Even the Japanese are getting worried that there  might be an influx of the North Korean refugees as the result of  a riot in North Korea... Consider this for a moment, if you  would. Supposing that a mass of North Koreans came and lived in  Uichongbu, it would bring hardship to people living in Seoul,  also. We should be concerned about what in reality had happened  in Germany, i.e. a flood of East Germans came and lived in  rural areas of West Germany.    [Pak] What should be the role of our embassy in China and  what can we expect the embassy would accomplish? Please tell me  your views on this, from the experience you have had so far.    [Hwang] The role of Korean Ambassador to China is to seek  out  the best ways to maintain comfortable coexistence between Korea  and China, especially, in the future, in the 21st century. In  short, the role should be to enhance the relations of the two  countries based on economic matters, also to go above and beyond  economics and, thus, coexist.</p>

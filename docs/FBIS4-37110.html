			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has notified PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat that the dialogue between them will go on  in order to continue the implementation of the agreements  between Israel and the PLO. Our political correspondent Gadi  Sukenik has learned from sources in the PLO that this remark was  made in a personal letter Rabin sent to 'Arafat yesterday  morning. The letter was taken to Tunis by Jamil al-Tarifi.    The letter is warmly worded and in it, Rabin expresses his  commitment to the peace process and to cooperation with 'Arafat.  In the letter, Mr. Rabin also expresses a commitment to help  the autonomy settle in, but it does not contain any financial  commitment.</p>

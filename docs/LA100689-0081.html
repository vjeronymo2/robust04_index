			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHARE-THE-RIDE DAY SPEEDS RUSH-HOUR TRAFFIC BY 7 M.P.H. -- WHICH IS BETTER THAN  IT SOUNDS  </P> <P> Motorists on some of the Los Angeles area's most crowded freeways zipped to  work at up to 7 m.p.h. faster on Thursday as an estimated 43,000 commuters  pledged not to ride solo as part of the state's "Keep California Moving Day,"  organizers said.  </P> <P> Although the top average speed in rush-hour traffic between 7:30 and 9 a.m.  reached only 38 m.p.h. (that was on the southbound Harbor Freeway), the  increase was seen as significant because participants represented "barely a  dent" among the Southland's commuters, said Michelle Perrault, chairwoman of  the weeklong car-pooling campaign.  </P> <P> Commutes were slowest on the westbound Pomona Freeway, where the increase in  average speed was 4 m.p.h. and drivers crept along at an average 13 to 18  m.p.h., according to Steve Parks, spokesman for Commuter Computer, a  ride-sharing group that helped promote the campaign.  </P> <P> State transportation officials determined the increases by recording Thursday's  speeds and comparing averages against existing figures.  </P> <P> Perrault said the campaign was designed to showcase commuting alternatives,  such as car pooling once a week and encouraging employers to reduce employee  driving times by adopting a four-day workweek.  </P> <P> Just after the morning rush hour ended, a truck dropped a load of caustic  concrete mix on the Pomona Freeway near Hacienda Boulevard, blocking traffic  until about 2:40 p.m., the California Highway Patrol reported.  </P> <P> While traffic was backed up, a 28-year-old San Diego man, Gregory Michael  Smith, tried to speed through roadblocks and crashed into a guardrail. Smith  was arrested on charges of reckless driving, car theft and other offenses.  </P></p>

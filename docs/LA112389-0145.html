			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: CHIEF OF PARSONS TO RETIRE AFTER 24 YEARS WITH FIRM  </P> <P> William E. Leonhard will retire as chairman and chief executive of Parsons  Corp. on May 15 after 24 years with the Pasadena-based engineering and  construction firm, it was announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> Leonhard, who will be 75 next month, said he has accomplished all his  objectives at the firm, adding, "I feel good at this moment contemplating  retirement and handing the reins to younger hands to take the company into the  21st Century."  </P> <P> Leonhard joined Ralph M. Parsons, now a unit of Parsons Corp., in 1966 as  senior vice president and assistant general manager. His intent was to make the  then-heavily leveraged company solvent, to diversify beyond its focus on the  oil and gas industry and to eventually take the firm private, which happened in  1985.  </P> <P> The company recorded sales of $706.5 million last year.  </P> <P> Since Parsons Corp. was created in 1978, Leonhard has been its chairman and  chief executive.  </P> <P> Parsons' board will select a replacement in March from senior officers  including Ray W. Judson, Parsons Corp. president; Leonard J. Pieroni, executive  vice president and director of corporate planning; Robert B. Sheh, Ralph M.  Parsons Co. president; Thomas L. Langford, Parsons Corp. executive vice  president and chief financial officer, and Joel H. Bennett, executive vice  president and director of business development.  </P> <P> Leonhard served in the military for 28 years, rising to the rank of Air Force  brigadier general in 1960. The next year he was made chief of staff of the Air  Force Systems Command at Andrews Air Force Base.  </P> <P> Parsons Corp. projects included building Los Angeles International Airport's  second level roadway, which opened in 1984, and designing the 103-mile  Washington Metrorail system. Parsons is building a multibillion-dollar  industrial city in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia, which the company said is one of the  world's largest engineering and construction projects in progress today.

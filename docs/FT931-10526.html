			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Arts: American String Quartet Until this weekend the American String Quartet had never appeared in London, though they have been performing for almost 20 years and are regular European visitors. At home they are loyal champions of new American music, as well as of Schoenberg; but they chose to bring only works by DWEMs (dead, white European males) to the Wigmore Hall, with only Bartok to represent the twentieth century. Accuracy, clarity and transparent balance are their great virtues. They boast a notably strong second violin, and a viola that sports more pungent character than their suave cello, which means that middle voices stand out uncommonly well without protruding. The quartet's lucid textures are partly achieved, I think, by a gingerly avoidance of dramatic extremes: on Saturday there was scarcely a real fortissimo, nor a pianissimo either, until their closing Bartok Fourth. Even there, though the music occasionally sizzled it never seared. The rhythms were admirably precise, but without the expected truculent thrust. In the muted Prestissimo, which was in its way a tour de force, the semiquaver buzzes rarely stung. Yet as a study-performance, it was all correctly and quite vigorously set out, and jewelled with scrupulous detail; one could learn from it. They had begun with the A major quartet from Beethoven's op. 18. It slipped smoothly by without leaving much impression. Odd approach to tempi: the Americans chose mostly speeds on the high side, but kept to them so metronomically that there was neither an exciting pulse nor room for dramatic emphases. Their leader's tone, excellent for spinning a cultivated line, lacked depth here. It was better found in Schuberts' great A minor quartet, lyrically crepuscular; and indeed all the players had distinguished moments in that haunted work, where they allowed themselves more freedom. Nevertheless, the expressive climate remained very temperate, as if restrained by a prudent thermostat. The grand breadth of the Schubert was merely suggested, not vitally realised. One might conclude that these musicians are not primarily interested in performing, in the vulgar full sense - though jet-lag might have been the only problem this time. But I felt too unconfident that their Mendelssohn and Dvorak on Sunday would rise to more exciting heights to feel like taking my streaming cold back to the Wigmore to find out.</p>

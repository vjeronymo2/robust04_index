			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Government Minister Danilo Estuardo </F> Parinello and U.S. citizens Mr. and Mrs. Rosse, with  unidentified reporters on the release of U.S. kidnappee Georgina  Rosse Robyn; place and date not given; from the "Telepress"  newscast--recorded]    [Text] [Parinello] At this moment, as thank God Georgina is  back with her family, I would like to remind the people of what  the president of the Republic said on 11 April. At that time  the president ordered and asked for the support of all the  security forces, the Army, as well as the police, to help bring  calm to the Guatemalan people.    The fact the child is back at home with her parents is the  result of the work of all the Guatemalan security forces at all  levels, at midlevel and top-level. I am talking about the  operation and the strategy that was developed. It is important  for you to know this is the result of the first phase of the  joint operations we are conducting.    The Army's patrolling the outskirts of the city has forced  the bands of criminals to move their hiding places. This move  helped the police, supported by military intelligence and all  the Guatemalan security forces, find the group that was holding  Georgina, return her safe and sound, without the payment of a  ransom, and bring this incident to a happy conclusion.    I would like to add the honest people's cooperation played a  vital role in this case. We got information from neighbors and  people who observed strange or dangerous comings and goings.  This contributed to the return of happiness to a family. The  family is together again today, thank God.    In conclusion, I would like to inform the local press, and,  through you, the Guatemalan people, this is the result we  expected. Many times the amount of disclosed information is  limited, because we do not want the criminals to know what we  are doing. We can talk about it today, because the outcome was  a happy one. We ask for your understanding and cooperation.    Mr. and Mrs. Rosse and their two daughters are now together;  they are safe. The president of the Republic, who has been in  constant contact with us, is very pleased with the outcome. I  am also very pleased with the outcome, as are all of those who  were closely following this case.    I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the support we  received from military intelligence and the police. They were  the ones who rescued Georgina.

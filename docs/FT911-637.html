			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Lang moves toward a more pragmatic party - Scottish Conservatives' Conference MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, yesterday attempted to shift the Scottish Conservative party from its past emphasis on ideology towards a more practical emphasis on meeting ordinary people's needs. Mr Lang, a close associate of Mr John Major, the prime minister, told Scottish Tories at their annual conference in Perth that 'perhaps too often in the past we have expressed our policies in abstract or ideological terms when we should have been relating them more clearly to every day issues.' Echoing Mr Major, he spoke of citizens' rights in the areas of housing, education, health and the environment. The party, he said, had its ideals such as belief in the free market, sound money and a property-owning democracy. 'But we are also the party that cares about quality and excellence and opportunity. We are the common sense party, the party of good government.' However the Tories had to demonstrate its care and common sense. 'We must do more to explain our policies - to consult, to listen, to respond to people's anxieties.' Referring to the marked revival in Tory support in Scotland since Mr Major succeeded Mrs Margaret Thatcher, he said that in the past few months there had been a 'new buoyancy and vitality and enthusiasm amongst our supporters' in Scotland. Mr Major will use his closing address to the Perth conference tonight to emphasise that a Conservative government under his leadership will satisfy Scottish aspirations to strengthen their sense of national identity. Environment secretary Mr Michael Heseltine won a standing ovation from the conference yesterday, after a wide-ranging speech in which he claimed that the Tories had proved themselves the only party which could effectively safeguard the environment. The enthusiastic if less than warm reception from the conference came after his prediction that the government was firmly on course for a fourth election victory.</p>

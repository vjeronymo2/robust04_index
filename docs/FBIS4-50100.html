			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 12 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Senate today  passed two amendments urging the government to try to lift the  UN- authorized arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Although the two documents called for an end to the  two-year-old embargo, one urged president Bill Clinton to do so  unilaterally while the other directed him to first seek support  from the European allies and Russia.    The amendments, both passed with votes of 50-49, have yet to  be approved by the house and signed by Clinton before becoming  law.    The Clinton administration, which all along favors lifting  the ban, has failed to register support from its European allies  and Russia.    While the white house "certainly understands the Senate's  sentiment," Clinton's spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said it refuses  to do it alone.    "The president does not support unilaterally lifting the  arms  embargo," Myers told Cable News Networks' "inside politics"  program. "He thinks that would have implications for other  multilateral actions that we've taken in places like Serbia."    As debates on the unilateral actions were raging in  Washington, Secretary of State Warren Christopher was preparing  for Friday's meeting on Bosnia in Geneva with foreign ministers  from Britain, France, Germany, Greece and Russia.    Although the Clinton administration has time and again said  it would press other nations to lift the arms ban, it is very  unlikely to succeed.    Visiting French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe reiterated on  Wednesday Paris' strong objection on the ground that, among  other things, more weapons flowing in would worsen the war,  endangering its troops in the Balkan republic.    France is the largest contributor of UN peacekeepers in  Bosnia. Its objection to lifting the ban was echoed by Russia  and Britain, which also have troops in the former Yugoslav  Republic.</p>

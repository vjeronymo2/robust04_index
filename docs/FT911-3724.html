			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Passage from India 'Indians massacre villagers', read the headline over a short news item from my colleague David House-go yesterday. His report, detailing the actions of Indian security forces in Kashmir, came as a salutary reminder of the internecine strife, government indecision and financial crises that threaten the world's most populous democracy. We who watch from afar have naturally been transfixed by events in the Gulf and the slow disintegration of the Soviet Union; meanwhile the outlook for India becomes more uncertain. Kashmir, the only one of India's 25 states with a Moslem majority, is being held within the republic by military force. In the Punjab a Sikh uprising by proponents of an independent 'Khalistan' - note how like Kurdistan it sounds  -appears to be continuing. This is complicated by divisions among the Sikhs themselves. Militancy has been met with brutality. The slaughter of innocents by terrorists is evident. Yet the grievances endure; the ideal of Khalistan will persist even if modified by events. There is also a continuing undercurrent of revolt in Assam, in the north-east, while in the enchanting southern state of Tamil Nadu the Tamil Tigers take their recreation leave from fighting in Sri Lanka by imposing their own will on parts of their home ground. Clearly the peaceful democracy so well espoused in London salons by the late Mr Jawaharlal Nehru is not working as well as it should. This is hardly surprising. The US has cohesion because its original settlers, who were overwhelmingly from the British Isles or German-speaking parts of Europe, created a melting-pot into which later arrivals have to be poured. It works, if imperfectly. But imagine a federated Europe, stretching from the Atlantic to the Urals and Stockholm to Naples, in which the Germans predominated and their language and that of a departed army of Hindi-speaking conquerors were the two official media of government and business. In the long run it would not work. Perhaps what we are seeing in India today is the beginning of the end of the long run. There was no Indian state before the British created its political boundaries. The legacy of the Raj was picked up by an educated elite wedded to the notion of a socialist, secular, permanently unified state. The older members of this elite still retain England - its language, history and culture - in their heads; their children less so. The more ambitious among the governing classes still entertain visions of India's grandeur as the leader of the non-aligned nations, a senior player upon the world stage, even a nuclear power. Reality is eating away at the ideas of Mr Nehru and the founding fathers. Socialism is increasingly out of fashion in most parts of the world, perhaps puzzlingly so to some Indians. (There are two Communist parties, which together have 56 seats in the country's 524-member lower house of parliament.) Yet for the election due next month Mr Rajiv Gandhi, inheritor of the leadership of the founding Congress party, is fighting on a manifesto that promises both a programme of privatisation and a cut in government spending. It is hard to maintain the secular ideal. The revivalist Bharatiya Janata Party, BJP, trades upon the paradoxical feelings among Hindus that although they are the overwhelming majority they are somehow threatened by Moslems, Sikhs, and other minorities. This reaches deep into the psyche of many Hindus. Indian acquaintances of wide erudition and a cosmopolitan mien have confided to me that they see a point in BJP's proposal to construct a Hindu temple on a site claimed by Moslems. Mr Gandhi needs Moslem votes and cannot play the Hindu card, but he has offered a compromise on job reservation for lower castes, offering to support a scheme without giving figures. As to national unity and international status, post-war Indian foreign policy has been firmly based on cementing a special relationship with the Soviet Union. But now we live in a one-superpower world, and any outside acquiescence in bloody attempts to repress secessionist movements will depend upon the US. There is not much point in being non-aligned if there is no balance of power within which not to align yourself. During the Gulf war India managed to offend almost every party - its old friends, the Iraqis, by doing nothing, and its potential business partners, the Americans, by cutting off overflying rights to refuel at Bombay. It will be difficult to mend such broken fences until the election produces a new government, probably a coalition, possibly led by Mr Gandhi. The first step, however, will be to produce a budget, postponed for electoral reasons, and the step after that will be to sit down with India's creditors. This is where outsiders, like the IMF and the World Bank, have some leverage. They will not provide cash without strings. But how far should conditionality go? It is in everyone's interest to strengthen Indian democracy, and - as the Gulf war and its aftermath show - it is the prevailing fashion to maintain existing boundaries however colonialist their origins. But Indians are independent-minded people. They need not follow fashion. They would be wise at least to loosen their tight republic and replace it with a true federation, or, better, confederation - in short, to decentralise administration outwards and far away from Delhi. The new government should state its intentions about economic liberalisation, and clear its mind about whether it welcomes inward investment or seeks to drive it away by the sheer weight of obstructive bureaucracy. I have anecdotal evidence about an Indian mega-millionaire who made his money in the US and wanted to invest Dollars 250m back home but withdrew after three months of frustrated attempts to meet the demands of the Indian civil service. There is a huge wealth of talent and drive among India's 850m people. They need to shed the remaining burden of the Raj, even take the risk that in the end some of them go their separate ways, if they are to realise their potential.</p>

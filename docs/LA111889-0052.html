He also scored three two-point  conversions.  </P> <P> Ocean View scored on a 16-yard pass from Randy Karliner to Albert Fanaga three  minutes into the game, but the Seahawks didn't score another touchdown until  they scored twice in the third quarter.  </P> <P> "We had the opportunities," Ocean View Coach Howard Isom said, "but we just  didn't capitalize on them."  </P> <P> Karliner completed seven of 15 passes for 129 yards, but San Gorgonio sacked  him seven times.  </P> <P> "They're a good team," San Gorgonio Coach Karl Gayton said. "This is the first  time we weren't able to just run up the middle." PAM CEREN  </P></p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Danish Bonds: Yield gap with Germany narrows DANISH government bonds have performed well this year, with the effective yield coming down from about 9 per cent in December to 6.83 per cent at the end of last week on the 10-year government benchmark bond. Investors have benefited not only from a general fall in interest rates this year, but also from a narrowing of the yield spread between Danish and German bonds, which at times in the second half of last year was as much as 2 percentage points, but is now down to about 21 basis points. The yield spread widened when the voters rejected the Maastricht treaty in the referendum last summer and has narrowed now that the electorate, in the May 18 referendum this year, has finally approved the treaty. The fall in yields and rise in prices, combined with a rising need for government debt finance, sent turnover in the first half-year to a record. The current benchmark bond carries a coupon of 8 per cent, but its place will probably be taken by the 7 per cent bond maturing in 2004, which was launched earlier this year, as turnover in this series grows. On Thursday last week, the first government issue carrying a 6 per cent coupon was issued - Treasury notes maturing in 1996. A total of DKr11bn of paper was sold within an hour of opening, although the pricing, 99.75, giving an effective yield of 6.08 per cent, was considered ambitious. The market is already preparing for a 10-year issue carrying the 6 per cent coupon. The Guarantee Institute for Futures and Options is hesitating between introducing a futures contract on the 7 per cent bond or waiting a while before launching one on the expected 6 per cent (or even lower) paper instead. There is, meanwhile, an interesting situation in the mortgage bond market. Mortgage bonds carry higher yields than government bonds and there are big, liquid series, but the bonds have some characteristics which tend to put off international investors. The big series are in annuity loans, not bullets, and are callable (ie, redeemable at par before maturity). The major development over the next few months and into next year will be that householders are able to convert from bonds carrying coupons of 9 to 12 per cent into new series with a coupon 6 per cent. The first 20 and 30-year issues with 6 per cent coupons were launched last week. The 30-year bonds were priced at 95.00, giving an effective yield of 6.7 per cent. The mortgage institutes and large institutional investors expect that bonds worth some DKr300bn will be converted. The interesting point of the exercise for international investors is that the bond-issuing mortgage credit institutes will take the opportunity to launch some very large series, and although issued by the different institutes they will have identical characteristics, which will allow them to be traded as one large series. There is an interesting macro-economic aspect to the conversion boom as well. As the governor of the Nationalbank, Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, has said, it will have an unprecedented wealth effect for householders. Conversion means that the cost of annual mortgage servicing will fall. It also means that the typical mortgage level will fall from the chimney to the gutter, opening up an opportunity for additional borrowing. It so happens that this effect will coincide with a rise in demand in 1994 and 1995 as the result of a reform of the income tax system, a reform which in these two years will not be fully financed. At the same time, there is a big programme of public sector infra-structure investments. The tax reform and public investment programme will pump around DKr12bn to DKr15bn, equal to 1.2 to 1.5 per cent of GDP, into the economy in 1994. The bond conversion boom could add another half per cent of GDP to this effect. What nobody professes to know, however, is whether consumers will spend the extra money or take the opportunity further to reduce their debts/increase savings.</p>

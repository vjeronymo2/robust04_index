			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Inform the judiciary about technical evidence presented in impaired driving cases, including SFST and DEC testimony; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Educate the judiciary in appropriate and aggressive sanctions for offenders including violators of commercial motor vehicle safety regulations; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ensure that judges are knowledgeable and prepared to adjudicate youthful offenders in an appropriate and aggressive manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Licensing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Driver licensing actions can be an effective means for preventing, deterring, and monitoring impaired driving. In addition to the license sanctions for impaired driving offenses discussed earlier, States should: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issue provisional licenses to novice drivers; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provide for license suspension for driver under age 21 who drives with a BAC exceeding .02 (or some other low value); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issue distinctive licenses to drivers under the age of 21; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monitor licensing records to identify high risk drivers for referral to education or remediation programs; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ensure the accurate and timely reporting of alcohol and drug violations as proscribed by the Commercial Drivers License (CDL) regulations; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assure that all licensing records are used to help assess whether a driver requires alcohol or drug treatment; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Actively participate in the Driver License Compact to facilitate the exchange of driver license information between jurisdictions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Treatment and Rehabilitation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many first-time impaired driving offenders and most repeat offenders have substantial substance abuse problems that affect their entire lives, not just their driving. They have been neither prevented nor deterred from impaired driving. Each State should implement a system to identify and refer these drivers to appropriate substance abuse treatment programs to change their dangerous behavior. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Diagnosis and Screening <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> States should have a systematic program to evaluate persons who have been convicted of an impaired driving offense to determine if they have an alcohol or drug abuse problem. This evaluation should: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Be required by law; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Be conducted by qualified personnel prior to sentencing; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Be used to decide whether a substance abuse treatment program should be part of the sanctions imposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Treatment and Rehabilitation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> States should establish and maintain programs to treat alcohol and other drug dependent persons referred through traffic courts and other sources. These programs should: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Ensure that those referred for impaired driving offenses are not permitted to drive again until their substance abuse problems are under control; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Be conducted in addition to, not as a substitute for, license restrictions and other sanctions; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Be conducted separately for youth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Program Management <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Good program management produces effective programs. Planning and coordination are especially important for impaired driving activities, since many different parties are involved. Each State's impaired driving program management system should have an established process for managing its planning (including problem identification), program control, and evaluation activities. The system should provide for community traffic safety programs (CTSPs), State and local task forces, data analysis, and funding. It also should include planning and coordination of activities with other agencies involved in impaired driving programs, such as MCSAP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. State Program Planning <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> States should develop and implement an overall plan for all impaired driving activities. The plan should: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Be based on careful problem definition that makes use of crash and driver record data; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Direct State and community resources toward effective measures that address the State's impaired driving issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Program Control <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> States should establish procedures to ensure that program activities are implemented as intended. The procedures should provide for systematic monitoring and review of ongoing programs to: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Samper renews drive for peace in Colombia: President tries to end guerrilla war President Ernesto Samper of Colombia marked his first 100 days in office last week with a push to get the country's guerrilla groups to the negotiating table and by announcing a set of conservative economic targets that placated some of his critics. The administration has not insisted on a ceasefire before starting talks with guerrilla groups. Instead, it is demanding 'humanisation' of the war to protect civilians and wounded combatants. Since 1989, most of the M-19 and the Popular Liberation Army movements have exchanged their weapons for electoral politics, but the two biggest guerrilla armies have been growing in numbers and military strength. The former Soviet-line Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the once Castroite National Liberation Army (ELN) between them control extensive rural territory in the northeast, northwest, centre and south of Colombia. The FARC alone has over 50 fronts and guerrilla combatants may total 10,000 or more. According to police figures, there were more than 1,200 terrorist incidents and over 1,000 kidnaps in the first 10 months of this year, most attributed to guerrilla groups, which use extortion, robbery and drug trafficking to finance their activities. Guerrilla actions in the last decade have led to the spilling of 1.2m barrels of oil as a result of pipeline bombings, the loss of considerable foreign investment and the displacement of 150,000 people. By opening the door for peace negotiations and imposing neither deadlines nor obstacles, the government has made it difficult for the guerrillas to refuse to talk. Political, business and church leaders have all given qualified approval to Mr Samper's proposals, and guerrillas have also commented in positive terms. Given their increasing regional power - evidenced in last month's local government elections - and their economic strength, it is not obvious why the main guerrilla movements should want peace. During his first 100 days, Mr Samper announced a series of employment and social programmes, which he tied together last week in a four-year national development plan he called the 'social leap forward.' In the plan, the government blames the persistence of 'alarming poverty levels' and the growing income gap between rural and urban areas on continuing violence. Central bank and other economists, dismayed by the administration's somewhat incoherent initial proposals to cut inflation, speed devaluation and raise public spending at the same time, have welcomed Mr Samper's commitment to generating a budget surplus of at least 0.7 per cent of GDP, or more if necessary. The inflation target for 1995 is 18 per cent, compared with this year's 22-23 per cent rate. 'This is down to earth, they're recognising that they need to cut back on planned spending and they're also going to improve tax collection. It's a big step in the right direction for macroeconomic stability,' said Mr Salomon Kalmanovitz, a director of Colombia's central bank. The development plan includes large investments in transport, oil and other infrastructure with a strong import component, which will help use up foreign exchange. The emphasis, however, is on social welfare. This is not only inflationary, say economic critics but the money would be better spent on remedying the structural problems underlying poverty, rather than on handouts. On drug trafficking, there have been minimal successes and discouraging trends: the area planted with coca, marijuana and opium poppies has doubled to over 50,000 hectares and Colombia's cocaine production is up to about 1,000 tonnes a year. Several major Medelln traffickers who surrendered under the last government are due to go free next year, while Cali cocaine chiefs want even more generous terms if they are to hand themselves in. Although President Samper has promised to keep fighting drugs, most Colombians clearly place far greater importance on ending violence and solving economic problems than confronting drug barons.</p>

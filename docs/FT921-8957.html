			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian supply fears lift metal prices NERVOUSNESS ABOUT the impact of new Russian export regulations on aluminium and nickel supplies caused prices to rise sharply on the London Metal Exchange yesterday. Management at Krasnoyarsk, the world's second-largest aluminium smelter, have warned the Russian government that it will start to shut down the export sector of the plant - which accounts for about one third of the 800,000 tonnes annual output - from February 25 unless the regulations are revised. 'We are on the brink of bankruptcy,' Mr Vladimir Krutko told Reuter. He said the new regulations had added 3m roubles in export duties to the 1.4m rouble cost of transportation. In addition, half the hard currency earned had to be converted into roubles. Analysts suggested the Krasnoyarsk management was putting political pressure on the Russian government but was unlikely to make production cuts. 'I would be very surprised to see this followed through. This is one of the few ways Russia can earn foreign currency,' said Mr William Adams, analyst at the Rudolf Wolff commodities group. Mr Robin Bhar, analyst at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez group, said: 'This is posturing to get the export tax reduced. The Russian civil servants are new to the job and need educating about what is reasonable in a market environment. They will back off.' Norilsk, the world's biggest nickel producer, is also complaining that its ability to finance essential technical improvements is being handicapped by the new regulations which involve Russian companies having to convert 50 per cent of any foreign exchange earnings into roubles. At risk is the USDollars 600m plan submitted by Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish group, to renovate Norilsk's Pechenganikel smelter on the Kola Peninsula. Mr Pekka Hynynen, project director, told Reuter Norilsk hoped to pay by selling aluminium abroad but the new regulations would cut its income. 'We understand that Norilsk will ask the government to make some exceptions to the rules so that it can pay for the project,' he added. The LME's three-month nickel price jumped by Dollars 55 a tonne to Dollars 7,892.50 yesterday after the market absorbed this news. Aluminium, which rose strongly on Wednesday because of rumours about the Krasnoyarsk problems, closed up another Dollars 20.25 yesterday at Dollars 1,293.75 a tonne.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Wagon Industrial falls in line with forecasts to Pounds 14m PRE-TAX profits at Wagon Industrial Holdings fell from Pounds 21.5m to Pounds 14.1m in the year to March 31, pretty much in line with forecasts. The shares rose 1p to 442p. Mr John Hudson, chief executive, said Wagon had 'taken the bad news on the chin' - there were exceptional costs of Pounds 2.06m, provided for in the first half, relating to factory and product restruc-turing. While continuing its policy of 'selective' and 'infilling' acquisitions, often from the receiver - thereby enlarging the customer base for modest outlay and increasing throughput - the group has undergone 18 months of 'rationalising our main sites and downsizing the continuing ones'. With its net cash pile growing to Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 12.2m), Mr Hudson said Wagon would continue its acquisition strategy 'indefinitely'. Trading profits of the material handling and storage side fell to Pounds 8.81m (Pounds 10.7m) on turnover of Pounds 99.4m (Pounds 105.8m). Link 51 and the other shelving and racking companies 'experienced flat or declining volumes', according to Mr Paul Taylor, chairman. The engineering division's profits declined to Pounds 3.02m (Pounds 6.54m) on turnover of Pounds 58.2m (Pounds 62m). Mr Hudson said Paul Forkardt, the German machine tool maker, had a bad year as its East German and eastern European markets disappeared and its western markets suffered from recession. Automotive products provided the best news with a profits advance to Pounds 5.43m (Pounds 4.82m). Earnings were 23.72p (38.51p) per share at the basic level and 23.72p (35.89p) fully diluted. The total dividend was maintained at 17p with an unchanged final of 10.675p. COMMENT With the recovery in UK markets neither immediate nor even anticipated in the longer term, Mr Hudson and his team have shown themselves to be good managers in recession. In bold moves they have actively tackled the thorny cost base problem - working capital is down Pounds 7.3m, capital expenditure is one-and-a-half times depreciation, Pounds 4m-Pounds 4.5m has been lopped off the fixed overhead and cash generation has been good in a bad year. Cheap infill acquisitions suit slow economic growth, though Wagon has the cash for anything larger, should it want to splash out. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 19m are expected for the current year, with earnings between 32.3p and 34p per share. This gives a prospective multiple of about 13.3. As a quality cyclical stock with recovery potential, accumulation would carry little risk.</p>

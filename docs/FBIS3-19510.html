In Kohl's view, the economic situation is gradually  improving. The "light at the end of the tunnel" will "have to  be made bigger." Kohl pointed out that he regards more flexible  working hours a key factor in increasing industry's  competitiveness.    In the talks the economy was represented by members of the  Confederation of German Employer Associations (BDA), the Federal  Association of German Industry (BDI), the Federation of German  Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHT), and the Federal  Association of German Trade (ZDH). ZDH President Heribert  Spaeth sees signs for the "coalition of reason" that has been  demanded by the trade association becoming possible. It is  beginning to form under the pressure of the present conditions.  As examples for this development he mentioned that several  tariff agreements contained the possibility of extending working  hours or reducing them with a proportionate wage reduction, or  of concluding zero wage rounds. Only a year ago this would have  been unthinkable. BDA President Klaus Murmann expressed  "respect" for the trade unions for achieving this.    While Spaeth considered the government's action program to  promote growth and employment as a "step in the right  direction," Murmann once again made it clear that industry does  not agree with the compromise achieved over nursing insurance.  Yet, he agreed with the chancellor on the necessity of finding  more flexible economic structures.    The chancellor pointed out that the current crisis is not "a  normal recession, but a deep structural crisis." He does not  "see any reason to be pessimistic" and is confident that the  existing problems can be solved. All efforts must be  concentrated on creating new jobs by stimulating the economy.  In this context, he spoke out clearly against further subsidies.    The chancellor aims at lowering the public share from the  existing 54 percent to 45 percent by the end of this decade.  Above all, structures must be made more flexible. As an  example he mentioned part-time jobs. While 34 percent of the  working population in the Netherlands work part-time, in Germany  the figure is only 15 percent. On Tuesday [15 March], the  cabinet discussed ways of "drastically increasing" the number of  such jobs in the public services. Kohl considers the tariff  agreements in the chemical and metal industries to be examples  for rethinking. Flexible working hours have much more weight in  these agreements, which is decisive for the future  competitiveness of German industry.    Kohl said he wants to stick to the corporation tax reform.  Referring to his position as Christian Democratic Union  chairman, he added: "In our election campaign we will make very  specific proposals for the next legislative period."  Furthermore, the chancellor demanded "that the stupid  animosities toward research be overcome" as well as "a climate  that is friendly toward science and technology." Whether the  recent increase in patent fees is sensible, needs to be  discussed. Asked whether an increase in fuel tax, which was  suggested by Finance Minister Theo Waigel recently, will  actually take place, he said: "This is not my idea. You know  who the head of government is."    In Kohl's view, the stimulus for creating jobs in German  industry must come from medium-sized companies. This motivation  must be supported. It is not his aim to increase the number of  employees in the public services any further, Kohl said.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Rationalise and keep risks to a minimum: Chemical Banking chairman Walter Shipley explains why asset quality is paramount For a man of 6ft 8in, Mr Walter Shipley does not impose himself, being quiet, courteous and unassuming. His bank also has a low profile for its size. With Dollars 166bn (Pounds 105bn) of assets, Chemical Banking is the fourth largest bank holding company in the US, but is still known primarily for the two banks that formed it. Yet 2 1/2 years after the merger of Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical Bank  -two ailing money centre banks whose headquarters faced each other across Park Avenue - it has started to gain a reputation as more than a product of a marriage forced by mutual weakness in hard times. Mr Shipley also appears to be enjoying his new-found prominence since taking over as chairman and chief executive this year on the retirement of Mr John McGillicuddy. Mr Shipley, the former chairman of Chemical Bank, agreed to serve under Mr McGillicuddy as part of the merger. His statement, in a recent interview with the Financial Times that he was prepared for Chemical to lose its dominance of the US syndicated loan market rather than accept loose terms and conditions on loans, was part of a determination not to squander Chemical Banking's new-found strength. The most obvious symbol of that is the restoration of its tier one ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets to more than double the 4 per cent Basle accord minimum. This contributed to Moody's, the credit rating agency, raising its long-term rating to A2 from A3 this April. Mr Shipley is most impassioned when talking of how crucial it is for the bank to maintain and improve its rating. Companies are now willing to accept it as a partner in long-term contracts such as interest rate swaps. 'There is no single thing I can do that is more important than being the champion of asset quality. Everything else we do can be overwhelmed by poor assets,' he says. Mr Shipley says, moreover, that day-to-day management is affected by whether the bank is perceived as strong or weak. 'We went through a period where we were on the defensive, and external events determined our daily and strategic thinking. We have emerged into a period where we can switch to the offensive and chart a course and keep to it. The one thing I can impart to my successors is the power of that.' Getting bigger without taking true account of the risks lay behind the problems of both Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover. The banks were in turn assailed by the less-developed-country debt crisis and real estate lending problems in the US, and had to sell assets to restore capital. So perhaps it is unsurprising that Mr Shipley does not see the new Chemical  -as it is known internally - reasserting itself through aggressive growth. Indeed, his determination to curb risk in syndicated lending could threaten its position in one of the few markets it truly dominates. He sees 'chapter two' of the merger as being primarily devoted to cost-cutting rather than generation of more income. This is particularly so in its retail and mid-market operations in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and in Texas through its Texas Commerce Bank. Like other US banks faced with the prospect of narrowing net interest margins, Chemical has embarked on rationalisation. Mr Shipley points out that its reduction from 430 branches to 280 in the New York area has left it with deposits of Dollars 85m per branch, compared with an industry average of Dollars 30m. 'We have been kept busy getting the merger done, but chapter two is a tough view, business by business,' he says. 'It is rationalise, rationalise, rationalise. Traditional ways of banking are becoming more and more obsolete as technology brings new ways to deliver products.' Mr Shipley professes no great appetite for taking part in the current phase of consolidation of US banking in which small banks are being bought to fill in the networks of larger regional banks. Smaller banks are now commanding prices of about 2 1/2 times book value. Chemical has concentrated instead on building its product range in retail banking. This means a stronger focus on credit cards, and the Dollars 330m acquisition in May of Margaretten Financial, a New Jersey-based residential mortgage lender. Mr Shipley is also cautious about diversifying in corporate banking. Although it is natural for the bank to use its powers in debt securities underwriting as an extension of its strength in loan syndication, he says it will take a long time to build strength in equity origination. 'The jury is out on the extent to which commercial banks can truly become a major factor on their own in equities,' he says. He cites the efforts of JP Morgan. 'Morgan has a clear head start on everyone else, but they too have got a long, long way to go,' he says. He sees Chemical's task in the medium term as a less clear-cut one than Morgan's attempt to bridge the divide of the Glass-Steagall Act separating commercial and investment banking in the US. 'By definition, we do not have a singular reputation because we have a diverse base,' he says. Instead, Mr Shipley wants to push through operating improvements, shifting capital into its highest return areas, and gradually trying to push its return on equity up from last year's 16.6 per cent during a good trading year to a 16 per cent minimum in bad years for financial markets. This is not a particularly glamorous mission, but Mr Shipley believes it is the only choice without taking excessive risk. In the long term, he does not rule out a merger with another large bank. But the medium term promises a continuing struggle to reinforce Chemical's new name.</p>

It is very  encouraging to meet with representatives of eight organizations  which make up our party's Youths Parliament. It is very  encouraging because it is irrefutable proof of how you have  undertaken a new task; of how a new way to exchange opinions,  arguments, and reasons has been established; and above all, it  shows you are truly offering youths greater opportunities to  participate in politics within our party. You represent  imagination, the search for change, the energy and the ability  to establish a more open relationship, a more dynamic and  authentic relationship with Mexican society. Above all, however,  I am very pleased to meet with you at a time when Mexican  society is immersed in the most important political process.    We live in times of competitive democracy in which each  political force, including ours, must present to society its  programs, the actions it will carry out, its end-of-the-century  vision of Mexico, its proposals, and above all, show each's  political force capabilities to promote the transformation and  change that Mexican society demands.    PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] youths, our option,  our party's option, the option you represent -- let there be no  doubt about this -- is to promote a profound transformation of  our Mexico. In this regard, we must place our party at the front  of this process by ensuring it fully assumes a rigorous agenda  that will lead us to present new political practices to society  and to overcome old vices.    We are a party that has the ability of making good use of  the  efforts we Mexicans have carried out so far. Looking beyond the  accomplishments and mistakes, we cannot ignore the efforts  Mexican have made in recent years. We cannot, we must not,  remain trapped within the boundaries of proposals made six years  ago, when the country was facing other kinds of problems.    We are and we must see ourselves as the party most capable  of  making good use of what has been accomplished, as the party with  the strength to promote the changes and transformations that  society is demanding. We have our mind set on making changes,  but we do not plan to start from zero or to build everything  anew. Countries are not born every six years. We do not want, we  are not planning on remaining where we are now either. We will  not succumb to inertia. With our plans for changes we offer new  roads while making good use of what we have already accomplished.    In my trips throughout the country during these past  campaign  months, I have been able to establish that Mexico wants a  significant change, but in a safe and responsible way. This is  why security, responsibility, and changes are the three big  components of our plan. We must act in a responsible way because  our accomplishments, regardless of how modest they may be, have  been made at the expense of big sacrifices; and we must make  changes because without changes, progress cannot be made.    We represent security because we have experience, expertise,  and we will make extensive decisions within the law and a de  jure state. We are not promising magic. Our ideas are based on  an objective and a real analysis of the progress that has been  made and of what is necessary to change.    As the century draws to its end, Mexican society also  demands  responsible work. The next administration, the one that will  head the efforts of the Mexican people at the conclusion of this  century and this millennium, will have to be responsible and  find ways to increase efficiency and fight incompetence and  waste. It must be able to react in a timely fashion in the face  of injustice; and it must be able to overcome bureaucratic  paralysis, arrogance, and the temptation to look at everything  from behind a desk.    A new phase of progress must begin with a new culture of  responsibilities adopted by all but, most of all, the  government. A government responsibility or a new culture of  responsibility, like the one I am proposing, is something the  next government definitely has to adopt to wipe out corruption  where it is found, either in influence peddling or the  paternalist [patrimonialista] view of power.    Security, responsibility and change, because I said one  cannot talk of progress without them; while those who say  everything is bad are lying, but those who defend the status quo  are also mistaken. Mexico needs change with security and  responsibility. Mexico demands a profound change at the  grassroots level; a change that preserves what is valuable and  at the same time allows us to make the progress society is  demanding from us. And I intent to head those changes. We must  respond to the change of mentalities with new actions -- you  yourselves have said so through this tribune. Mexico has  changed; it is different. It is an eminently young society; it  is demanding. And it is to transformation to which we must  respond, with new actions capable of overcoming gaps, extreme  poverty, the existing imbalance among our regions, among  Mexico's different regions, and the inability that often exists  to guarantee compliance with the law.    We are, friends, young lawmakers, facing the need for a  simultaneous change in politics and society. One cannot view  with fear the change Mexico is demanding, nor can this change be  accomplished through haggling, simulation, or fabrication. We  will bring about a change in Mexico by implementing a firm  policy with strict adherence to the law, with security and  responsibility, so that our national unity is reinforced and our  stability is guaranteed. That is the vision we have of the  Mexico that is to come.    We have to go from good national economy indicators to a  better income for each family, a better savings proficiency, a  better quality of life, and most of all, a better future for our  children. This is a change, that in politics, will do credit to  the great strength of our plurality, and which will only be  possible if we all become committed, in good faith, to  consolidating our nation as a genuinely democratic nation.    With the end of old times, of little competition among  parties, we also must relinquish the times of anticulture  politics, of authoritarian domination.    These changes, within a social transformation, should cause  us to forget the excuses that distance us from new opportunities  in the poorest communities in the country, especially the Indian  communities. We must forget the excuses, which, for centuries,  compelled our Indian communities to maintain practically the  same levels of welfare and immersed them in the same conditions  of poverty and deprivation. We must fulfill our constitutional  pledges to provide education, health, and housing for all  Mexicans and to overcome inequality, deprivation, backwardness,  and destitution. This is how we will reach a new degree of  confidence; this is how we will achieve new changes with  responsibility; this is how the PRI must rise to the challenge  and prove it wants to win the people's trust on its own, and  play an essential role in the future.    In this campaign I intend -- and I invite you to accompany  me  in this endeavor -- to draw on the support of citizens and  Mexican society to make the changes that will allow us to build  an economy that grants opportunities without losing the  stability we have achieved. A political life that accepts  elections as an instrument to solving competition between  parties and increases opportunities for democratic  participation. A social policy that efficiently fights poverty  and great inequalities with efficiency.    Let there be no doubt, my young parliamentary friends, we,  you and I currently represent the greatest opportunity to  achieve changes in our country. And we fully intend to assume  the responsibility we have, abiding by the rules, with security,  responsibility, and unity in harmony.    I want to remind you young PRI members that events in  Chiapas  have shown us the urgent need for a political-democratic change.  The urgent need for the economy to allow new and better  opportunities for everyone, every citizen in every corner of our  homeland. Events in Chiapas have shown us the urgent need to  overcome generalizations so Mexicans can enjoy specific  opportunities in each community where the Mexican citizen lives  his daily life -- in the family, the community -- aware that he  belongs to a great nation which requires unity and strength for  the future.    We recognize the urgency of the events in Chiapas as an  appeal to start a new phase. The PRI candidate and members are  ready. That is my appeal to all of you, friends, young  parliamentary members. The events in Chiapas serve as a warning.  They emphasize that destitution, deprivations, accumulated  insults, and frustrations can no longer be silenced with  dilatory answers and new appeals for patience. We must not  forget different problems prevail in our communities, our  regions because our national geography is different, but it is  all part of a single reality -- the reality which prevails in  our country in 1994 as we approach the end of the century. This  reality is characterized by insufficient family incomes;  unemployment; but also that each and every one of us are willing  to change.    In summary, my proposal is to find new options and new roads  to freedom, justice, and democracy for all Mexicans thereby  precluding violence, death among brothers, and confrontations.  The PRI members in Mexico want, at this hour, to prove there is  no valid reason to shed blood; that we must overcome our  problems no matter how big they are; and that peace is the only  thing which guarantees our welfare.    We must make sure no Mexicans needs to turn to weapons to be  heard. We have the option of resolving any difference and that  option is democracy; that option is the legal state, and that is  the option we must choose. Thank you.</p>

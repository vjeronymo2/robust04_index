			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 13 May (MTI) -- This was the first time  in Hungarian history that the country freely voted for the left,  Lajos Fur, chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF),  told a news conference today. In the first round of the  elections on May 8, the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) gained  a considerable lead, while the MDF finished in third place. In  Fur's view, the outcome of the first round will cause many  voters to reconsider their position, or at least revise their  passions.    Fur claims the failure of the MDF and other conservative  parties was mainly due to objective factors, including  unfavorable external conditions and the special hardships of  transition in Hungary, which were exacerbated by the opposition  and the left-wing press that discredited Hungary. Of course,  discontent was also generated by the errors of the governing  coalition, Fur said, adding that the MDF's internal affairs were  not perfect either.    Most people were shocked to learn the outcome of the  elections. Nor is a triumphant feeling manifest among the  winners, Fur said.    The MDF chairman qualified as unacceptable the statement of  the left-wing press and some politicians that the failure of the  MDF and the conservative forces was due to their ivory-tower  arrogance, aristocratism, and lack of expertise. After the  second round, the MDF will analyse the causes of the failure,  Fur said.    The MDF chairman announced that the party presidium had  approved a strategy for the second round, including local deals  between conservative candidates still in contention. At  present, 99 MDF candidates are preparing for the second round,  he said. Fur said voters should be made aware that all votes  cast for the MSZP and the Alliance of Free Democrats would  strengthen the left- wing coalition.</p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Markets: Interest rate relief buoys market rally - London but, it appears, not just yet. For this relief, the equity market gave much thanks and the FT-SE 100 ended the week up 84.9 points. Having got into a flap the previous Friday about a possible imminent increase in base rates, the City was relieved by the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report on Tuesday. The Bank was not complacent, warning that the government could fail to meet its target of reducing underlying inflation to a 1-2.5 per cent range by the end of this parliament, unless interest rates were increased in the next few months. However, the Bank also signalled that there would be no rise before its governor and the chancellor of the exchequer next meet, on September 7. The market's mood was further bolstered by a string of upbeat company results. British Petroleum lifted its second-quarter profits by more than 40 per cent. Economic recovery in the US and Europe helped its chemicals business move back into the black and the group said: 'We are more sanguine about the spreading economic recovery.' TI Group, the specialist engineering and aerospace company, attributed an 11 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to buoyant automotive production in north America and growing orders from European manufacturers. Glynwed International, the Birmingham-based engineer which makes Aga-Rayburn stoves and a variety of industrial products, lifted interim profits by 59 per cent and said five of its six operating divisions had increased profits. The group said confidently: 'There is a lot of economic growth to come. The economic background is good.' A Pounds 100m restructuring charge did not impede a rise in the share price of Zeneca, the bioscience group demerged last year from Imperial Chemical Industries. Underlying sales and operating profits rose. The share price also reflected a market reassesment of the value of all pharmaceutical groups, in the light of Tuesday's Dollars 8.5bn bid by American Home Products for one of its competitors in healthcare, American Cyanamid. National Westminster Bank reported an 83 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, aided by a sharp reduction in provisions for bad and doubtful debts. Britain's second largest bank also lifted its interim dividend by 14 per cent, as a gesture of confidence. However, NatWest warned that parts of the UK market were very difficult, and said it did not intend to lose its strong market share. In particular, the group said it might respond to the cut in authorised overdraft lending rates by Abbey National, the home loans and banking group. Abbey National had the previous day illustrated the growing competitiveness in the sector by announcing a joint venture with Commercial Union, the UK's biggest insurer, to sell general insurance to personal customers. The most striking example of competitive pressure came when Tesco, Britain's second biggest food retailer, made a knock-out Pounds 247m bid for William Low, the Scottish supermarket chain. That was Pounds 93m more than Tesco's initial offer, made a mere 18 days earlier. The sharp increase in the bid followed the intervention of J. Sainsbury, Tesco's bigger rival, which had topped Tesco's first recommended offer of Pounds 154m with a bid of Pounds 210m. Sainsbury quickly said it would not bid any higher - apparently content that it had forced Tesco to pay a much fuller price for Wm Low's 57 stores and Scottish distribution network. Some questions were asked over how the the board of Wm Low and its merchant bank advisers, Baring Brothers, could have recommended the original bid as 'full and fair'. It emerged that Tesco had made its bid conditional on a board recommendation - and the Scottish group had felt pressured by a sudden deterioration in its trading position over the summer. Barings said the only way to test whether more could be obtained for shareholders was by making the offer public, and letting the market decide. What few would have predicted - in particular Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco - was that Sainsbury would abandon its long-standing tradition of not becoming involved in takeover battles. Sainsbury emerged well from the tussle, having demonstrated to the City that it was now prepared to become involved in hostile takeovers, but not to overpay. At the very least, it had the satisfaction of knowing it prevented a rival from picking up strategically important assets on the cheap. More doubt surrounds the value of the victory to Tesco, which was still confident that the acquisition would enhance future group earnings - in spite of having increased its original offer by 60 per cent. Sir Ian said analysts who feared the deal would be dilutive underestimated how much Tesco could improve the performance of the Wm Low stores. The Bank's inflation report said the continuing reduction in inflation, which the chart illustrates, reflected a squeeze in retail margins which has spread well beyond the food sector. It said: 'Part of the reduction in margins may stem from a structural change in competition, but a significant cause is the continuing disinflationary effect of the recent recession.' The Bank said these disinflationary pressures would be moderated by the growing recovery in output. Share prices reflect the balance between investors' optimism over the improvement in corporate performance and concern about the inflationary outlook - and what that means for interest rates. As the market moves into the dog days of August, with more people on holiday and fewer companies reporting, further jitters could lie ahead.</p>

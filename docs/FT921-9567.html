			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Germany calls for check on UK's EC rebate GERMANY, by far the biggest net contributor to the European Community budget, is pressing the Commission to re-examine Britain's budget rebate negotiated in the early 1980s. The Commission is due today to finalise its proposals to raise the Community budget by about a third over the next five years. Germany's demand threatens to revive the revenue row which paralysed EC decision-making a decade ago. Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, successfully argued that Britain got proportionally less than its equally or more developed peers from the biggest EC budgets, for agriculture and regional development. The UK rebate was worth Ecu2.4bn in 1990 and Ecu3.3bn (Pounds 2.35bn) last year, according to UK officials. Last week, a senior Commission official warned privately that 'we are already beginning to smell' that Germany - concerned by the cost of unification, and demands that it should pay more through the EC to help the poorer southern countries prepare for economic and monetary union (Emu) - wanted to reopen the terms of the UK deal. German officials confirmed yesterday that they had raised the matter with Brussels, since the new five-year budget package would 'require more revenue from many sources'. One said: 'It is pretty obvious that we have to talk about the UK rebate again.' At the Maastricht summit in December, Chancellor Helmut Kohl pointed out testily that Germany would be contributing a net Ecu9bn to the Ecu66bn budget this year. Precise details on net contributions are closely guarded by the Commission, which wants to avoid 'the Community being seen as a business', a senior official said. The incomplete figures published by the EC court of auditors for 1990, however, show Germany contributing a net Ecu5.5bn, the UK paying a net Ecu3.4bn and France a net Ecu1.8bn. Two key aims of the mid-term financial plan for 1993-97, due to be presented to the European Parliament tomorrow, are to double regional aid funding for Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece, the four poorest EC members, and to distribute the revenue-raising burden more fairly. Spain has argued that it contributes more than it should, both in relation to its resources and to what it gets out of the budget. High per capita income countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands meanwhile take more out than they put in. But Commission officials warn that to calculate contributions and receipts with 'algebraic equity', as one put it, could led to endless feuding. There are already worries that Italy will also balk at the proposed arrangements. It will be hit by the new five-year plan just as it is struggling to reduce its own budget deficit in time for Emu.

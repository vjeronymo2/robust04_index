			<p>BFN     [Text] The electricity ministers of the five countries  involved in the power grid linkage project -- Syria, Egypt,  Jordan, Iraq, and Turkey -- last night concluded the meetings of  the fourth term of their council in Cairo.    During their meetings, the ministers signed with the Arab  Fund for Social and Economic Development a protocol for joint  cooperation and financing of a five-way power linkage plan to  complete the linkage and implement the first and second phases  of the plan by linking Egypt with Jordan, Jordan with Syria, and  Syria with Iraq, and the last phase by linking Turkey with Iraq.    The Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development and the  Islamic Bank endorsed the financing of the plan in its three  phases in light of coordination between the parties of the plan.    The electricity ministers also approved the recommendations  of the executive committee of the power linkage project,  including the execution of the rest of the phases of the project  and how work will proceed.    At the conclusion of their meetings, the ministers agreed to  hold the fifth session of their council on 5 April 1995 in  Turkey.

Are,  according to the Russian Statistics Committee said in a report  circulated among participants in the extended meeting of the  Russian government which opened in the Kremlin on Friday  morning. [sentence as received]    President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin are meeting with ministers, leaders of state  committees and other federal executive bodies, as well as  parliament chamber speakers, faction leaders and heads of local  governments, as well as the leaders of interregional  associations and public organisations to discuss the state and  prospects for the development of the russian national economy.    The report says the volume of industrial production in the  country dropped by 31.3 per cent from 1991 through 1993, the  consumer goods production by 24.8 per cent, food products by  27.3 per cent.    Capital investments in 1993 amounted to 51 per cent of the  1991 level. Fifteen per cent fewer new houses were built.    Last year's trade turnover reached 58.8 trillion roubles, 2  per cent up from 1992.    The Russian transportation system carried 3.6 billion tonnes  in 1993, one quarter less than in 1992, and 43 per cent less  than in 1991.    Russia's total exports last year are valued at 43 billion  U.S. dollars, 1.4 percent more than in 1992, but 16 per cent  less than in 1991. Imports reached 27 billion dollars, 73 per  cent of the 1992 level and 61 per cent of the 1991 level.    The budget deficit in 1993 is expected to amount to 11  trillion roubles (seven per cent of the Gross Domestic Product),  an 18-fold increase from 1992, while the inflation growth rate  grew ten times.    Unemployment in Russia reached 3.8 million people (as  calculated in accordance with ILO [International Labor  Organization] methods), of which 835 thousand are formally  recognised as jobless. This is 13.5 times more than in 1991.    39.6 million Russians, or 26.7 per cent of the total  population, received registered incomes below the survival  minimum. Real incomes in 1993 decreased by 43 per cent from  1991, and the aggregate index of consumer prices soared 245  times during the same period, the statistics reports circulated  among participants in the extended meeting of the Russian  government in the Kremlin today attended by President Yeltsin,  ministers, leaders of state committees and other federal  executive bodies, parliament chamber speakers, faction leaders  and heads of local governments, as well as the leaders of  interregional associations and public organisations.    Statisticians told the Russian government that the fuel and  energy sector produced in 1993 less electricity, oil, natural  gas and coal in comparison with 1992. Electricity generation  dropped by 6 per cent, the production of oil, including gas  condensate, shrank by 14 per cent, of natural gas by 0.4 per  cent and of coal by 5 per cent. Nonetheless oil exports to  foreign countries increased 1.2 times from 1992 to 79 million  tonnes, while supplies to Commonwealth and Baltic countries were  cut by almost one half.    In their agrarian sector land redistribution and  privatisation went ahead along with social and structural  reforms. 24,000 of collective and state farms, or 95 per cent  of their total number, had re-registered by the end of 1993 as  partnerships, farming cooperatives or other organisational and  legal entities. State-owned agricultural enterprises now  control no more than 15 per cent of all farmland. Individual  private farmers own five per cent of farmland and six per cent  of all arable land.    The gross production of agriculture dwindled by four per  cent  in 1993 in comparison with 1991 (in comparable prices),  including by 2 per cent in horticulture and by 5 per cent in  livestock farming.    The country harvested 99 million tonnes of grain in 1993,  seven per cent less than in 1992. Meat production also reduced  by 7 per cent from 1992, while the output of milk remained at  the same level.    From January through November of 1993, as many as 39,000  enterprises were privatised, making a total of 86,000  enterprises since the beginning of privatisation in Russia.</p>

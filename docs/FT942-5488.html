			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Sceptics purr over Major's strategy Mr John Major's Euro-sceptic election strategy was strongly backed by the Tory right yesterday as ministers launched a fierce attack on the patriotism of opposition leaders. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said the concept of a multi-speed European Union was 'a coherent policy around which the Conservative party can unite with enthusiasm'. Mr Howard is the first cabinet rightwinger to comment publicly on the multi-speed concept since it was launched last month by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. His backing follows earlier endorsement of the strategy by Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, the leading cabinet pro-Europeans. Cabinet support for the strategy reflects the judgment of Conservative Central Office that attacks on Europe offer the best hope of avoiding electoral disaster on Thursday. However, there is considerable unease among backbench pro-Europeans about the extent to which the prime minister has adopted the tone of the party's Euro-sceptic wing. Speaking to Conservatives in Hythe, Kent, Mr Howard combined support for the prime minister's call for a multi-speed Europe, one with 'variable geometry', with a coruscating attack on opposition plans for a 'European superstate'. He said the opposition parties had 'lost confidence in the British people to pass their own laws and to govern themselves. Nothing else can explain their newly found enthusiasm to rush headlong into a federal European state'. Mr Hurd yesterday defended the prime minister's vision of a multi-speed Europe, saying that Britain would take the lead on some issues while opting out on others. The reaction of opposition parties showed that they were thinking 'in terms of a single European blueprint in which nation states give up their individual powers and identity to an anonymous centralising force.' Mr Jack Straw, Labour's campaign manager, said the Conservatives were 'telling ever greater lies'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the prime minister was trying to appeal to the 'rabid' right.</p>

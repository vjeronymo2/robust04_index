			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Aluminium returns to 1991 level Aluminium started the week determined to burst through Dollars 1,600 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange, a price not seen since January 1991 and a level at which nearly every smelter in the world is profitable. It took time, but yesterday, aluminium for delivery in three months broke through resistance and closed last night at Dollars 1,608.50 a tonne, up Dollars 32 on the day and Dollars 21.75 from Friday's close last week. Sentiment yesterday was helped by another substantial fall in LME warehouse stocks. Since stocks peaked at a record 2.65m tonnes in June this year, they have fallen by 270,000 tonnes or nearly 10 per cent. Earlier in the week, the market paused for breath after an unexpected rise in producer stocks was reported by the International Primary Aluminium Institute. Traders are now looking for aluminium to reach Dollars 1,650 a tonne. However, there were words of caution from some observers. Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, said the price was getting ahead of itself. 'There are still huge stocks overhanding the market  -about 14 weeks of consumption - and eventually the market will realise this and settle down to sideways trading. Things are often overdone in the early stages of a recovery and the first-quarter rise in (aluminium) prices is not sustainable to the year-end.' The output cuts made by aluminium producers so far this year were 'having an impact beyond their wildest dreams'. As long as the producers stuck to their guns, there would be a supply deficit of about 400,000 tonnes this year and one of 1m tonnes in 1995, he said. Consequently, Mr MacMillan is forecasting aluminium prices averaging 65 cents a lb this year (Dollars 1,433 a tonne) and 75 cents (Dollars 1,653) in 1995. Meanwhile, the coffee market this week was dogged by uncertainty about the Brazilian government's plans for auctioning off its stockpile. After a dramatic rise a week ago on news that the auction would be cancelled, traders believed the government could be close to changing its mind. Rainfall forecasts for the coffee-growing regions of Brazil also affected prices. The frost-damaged trees have been suffering from a shortage of rainfall, but need a heavy downpour to do them any benefit. Light rain which was forecast for mid-week could be worse than none at all as it could encourage the trees to produce flowers which would later die. The big drop in the market occurred on Wednesday when prices lost Dollars 153 a tonne - declining at one stage by more than Dollars 200 a tonne - on news that Brazilian coffee growers were trying to persuade the government to restart the auctions. The price of the November futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange dropped from Dollars 3,993 a tonne to Dollars 3,840 a tonne. But the confusion was cleared up again on Thursday when Brasilia announced that, for the time being, the auctions remain off. With 5m bags of coffee still to sell in its stockpile, this could keep international supplies tight. However, the market reaction was modest with prices rising only Dollars 37 a tonne in quiet trading. The market remained quiet yesterday, although prices gained ground in late trading as dealers expressed concern over weather conditions in Brazil at the weekend. The London market closed Dollars 53 higher at Dollars 3,931 a tonne.  -------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  -------------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------------- Aluminium        -18,500   to 2,383,050 Aluminium alloy     no change at 42,200 Copper            -1,250   to   368,825 Lead                +200   to   368,375 Nickel              +660   to   142,274 Zinc              -1,550   to 1,235,350 Tin                 +525   to    32,405  --------------------------------------</p>

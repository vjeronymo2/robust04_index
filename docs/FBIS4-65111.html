			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Political Leaders Oppose Referendum </F> on Employment"]    [Text] The proposal put forward last week by National  Assembly Speaker Philippe Seguin to hold a referendum on the  fight against unemployment is still giving rise to numerous  reactions. Seguin seems to have found further support in the  person of Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the chairman of the Citizens'  Movement.    As a guest of France-2 television's "Hour of Truth" talk  show  on Sunday 8 May, Chevenement subscribed to the idea, provided  that "the question is properly worded." In his opinion, this  was not the case in the proposals currently being advanced by  Mr. Seguin. According to the former defense minister, the  question the French should be asked is the following: "Do you  agree with the plan to compel companies, within a three-year  period, to hire 1.5 million unemployed, who will continue to be  payed by the Assedic [Association for Employment in Industry and  Commerce] and will benefit from a number of training schemes?"    All other political leaders have rejected the idea of  holding  a referendum on employment. When asked for his opinion during  the "Grand Jury RTL-LE MONDE" program, Budget Minister and  Government Spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy flatly rejected the  proposal: "We will not succeed in strengthening the  intermediary organizations by acting over their heads." He also  attacked those who wanted to reduce the "passive costs  associated with unemployment," that is to say, the benefits  payed to the unemployed.    For his part, Industry Minister Gerard Longuet expressed his  reservations in an interview with NOUVELLE REPUBLIQUE published  on Monday, 9 May: "Let us not lead the French people to believe  that genuine reforms can only be carried out via a referendum.  I am still convinced...that a government and a parliamentary  majority have all the necessary legitimacy to carry out  far-reaching reforms, including reforms in such sensitive areas  as education, employment, and health," Mr. Longuet said.    Finally, former Socialist Employment Minister Martine Aubry  made fun at Mr. Seguin's proposal. "I thought it was a joke.  If the intention is to ask the French people whether  unemployment is their number-one concern, it is rather worrying  that a referendum should be needed for this," she remarked. On  Friday, 6 May, Francis Wurtz, who is heading the Communist lists  in the European elections, told FORUM RMC-L'EXPRESS that,  although he "favored consulting the people," he believed that  Mr. Seguin's proposal "is a trap," aimed at "making the French  ratify an austerity policy which, as is well known, they do not  want."</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POLICE SEEKING OWNERS OF RECOVERED ITEMS  </P> <P> Torrance police are looking for Bill West, Tracy, D. B. J. and others whose  homes have been burglarized in the last two years in cities throughout Southern  California.  </P> <P> West's name was found inscribed on a 1962 class ring from USC. Tracy is missing  a charm bracelet and D. B. J. a gold pocket watch. The items are part of a huge  cache of stolen merchandise collecting dust at the Torrance Police Department.  </P> <P> All of the items, which have an estimated value of $50,000, are at Torrance  police headquarters, 3300 Civic Center Drive, where they can be seen by people  who believe they may be the rightful owners.  </P> <P> Police say they recovered the items after arresting John Wesley Milligan, 27,  last month on burglary charges. Milligan, dressed in a blue suit and tie, was  spotted climbing into a window of a Torrance home, police said.  </P> <P> A search of Milligan's home in Carson uncovered thousands of dollars' worth of  property that police say was taken from residences throughout Los Angeles and  Orange counties.  </P> <P> Milligan, who has pleaded guilty to two burglary charges, is in the custody of  the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, police said. Four additional burglary  charges against him are being filed, police said.  </P> <P> Property has already been returned to victims in Rancho Palos Verdes, Long  Beach, Huntington Beach and Torrance. But the police still have a Yamaha  keyboard, a gold-colored locket with the initials EML on one side, a pair of  pewter Indian scout statuettes and other valuables.  </P> <P> Police sa they will ask those claiming the merchandise to describe their  missing items and show police reports documenting a burglary at their home.  Items that are not claimed may be sold at the next police auction.  </P> <P> "We'll screen people before they see the stuff so that they don't come up and  just say, 'Yes, that's mine,' " Sgt. Ronald Traber said.  </P> <P> Police are confident that the owner of one item is sure to show up if the  message gets out.  </P> <P> "The strangest thing we have is a three-quarter-length hooded coat made of  skunk fur," Detective Pete Velis said. "It has to be the ugliest thing I've  ever seen in my life. It's one of a kind."  </P></p>

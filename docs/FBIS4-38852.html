			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Gorlov report: "Ruble Will Replace Voucher"] </F>   [Text] "There is a possibility of a fundamental change in  the macroeconomic situation," Russian Federation Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin said yesterday at a conference of  administration heads at the Russian Federation Government. The  Constitution itself and the packages of presidential economic  edicts that were signed last week provide the legislative  preconditions for this.    "The crisis has peaked," V. Chernomyrdin pointed out. The  government's task in 1995-1997 should be to definitively improve  the economic situation; that is, bring reform into the sphere of  production. However, a base for this has already been prepared.  This is illustrated by the figures for the growth in production  and the emergent stabilization of the ruble (in particular, the  gradual reduction in inflation rates and the reduction in  Central Bank refinancing rates, the prime minister said.    According to V. Chernomyrdin, Russia's regions have always  acted as the motive force of reform. That is why the conference  with their leaders is devoted to examining such issues as  measures to complete check privatization and also to discussing  the Program for the Privatization of State and Municipal  Enterprises After 1 July 1994 and the new Russian Federation  Land Code.    The voucher as a means of payment will disappear into  oblivion after 30 June this year -- the end of the first phase  of check privatization -- Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed.    Despite some complacency at local level, the prime minister  noted in his speech, privatization checks' period of validity  will not be extended. Today it is necessary to structure work  in the localities so as to ensure that there are as few checks  left as possible -- as souvenirs.    During the new post-check phase, the head of the Russian  Government noted, investment will resolve everything. Viktor  Chernomyrdin described as unviable some regions' requests for  special rules of privatization for themselves. The transfer of  Russian state property into private hands will proceed within a  single, indivisible legislative area. What is more, in order to  prevent possible abuse, state bodies' supervision of  privatization for money will be stepped up, Viktor Chernomyrdin  stressed in particular.    It was noted at the conference that the check phase of  privatization has by and large been successful. There have  generally been no problems in those areas where the local  authorities have taken a serious approach to the work. However,  there are regions where the population still has a considerable  number of unredeemed privatization checks on its hands. In some  areas there are objective difficulties, for instance, in the  North Caucasus. In Moscow privatization has effectively been  suspended by decision of the local government. Leaders in  Kemerovo, Ulyanovsk, and a number of other oblasts and  Khabarovsk and Maritime Krays hoped that the government would  ultimately find a way of "soaking up" citizens' privatization  checks that have not been redeemed through the fault of the  local administrations. These leaders will have to resolve the  possible ensuing social conflicts themselves. At the same time  those regions where privatization has been protracted for  objective reasons will be offered assistance in the final stage,  primarily by broadening opportunities for vouchers to be  exchanged for investment fund shares.    The conference also discussed the program for the next phase  of privatization. It has been formulated with consideration for  proposals from the regions and has absorbed all the best of what  has been tested at local level. In this respect Moscow, Nizhniy  Novgorod, Sverdlovsk, Chelyabinsk, and Yaroslavl Oblasts are  working creatively. People there are not waiting for  instructions from the center on everything but are seeking their  own solutions on questions pertaining to the management of  property, the allocation of funds from privatization, and the  acceleration of privatization processes.    The new program takes into consideration the regions' main  complaints. They related primarily to understated property  valuations, low revenue from privatization, overly large  concessions for labor collectives. During the second phase  privatization will be implemented solely in return for money.  The estimated cost of facilities undergoing privatization will  rise tens of times.    In terms of the amount of property to be privatized the  second phase of privatization is comparable to the first. The  fate of both major industrial enterprises and facilities in  municipal ownership will be decided during this phase.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Sweden Yesterday's emergency package from the Swedish government seems to have impressed the markets rather more than last week's effort. The cut in private-sector payroll taxes will help make Swedish companies more competitive without resorting to devaluation. The government's determination to tackle its fiscal problems has allowed a cut in interest rates, easing pressure on the economy and the financial system. But it would be wrong to conclude that Sweden is out of the wood. The tax changes will add only 2 or 3 per cent to international corporate competitiveness. Purchasing power estimates suggest the krona is overvalued by 10 to 15 per cent. Added to that, Finland, which competes with Sweden in forest products, has devalued the markka by around a quarter in the last year. The fiscal problems are still enormous: the 1992-93 budget deficit is likely to reach 12 per cent of GDP as the economy slows. Indeed, in the short term, action to slim the bloated public sector may make matters worse. Part of the pressure on the krona has come from the belief that Sweden cannot maintain high interest rates for long because the economy is so weak. Cuts in government spending will deepen the recession. Ultimately, however, the fate of the krona will be decided elsewhere. If pressure on the ERM as a whole subsides, the Swedes may get time to sort out their long term structural problems. If not, they will suffer a similar humiliation to Britain at the hands of the market.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Brazil): US provides clues for Latin America Sao Paulo retreated from earlier highs to end at 15,516, up 1,313, or 9.25 per cent, adding to Friday's 10.6 per cent advance. The market was boosted by a slight drop in US interest rates and by Wall Street's performance. Volume was thin at Crz251bn and traders said this reflected uncertainty over the country's constitutional reforms. In the absence of domestic news, the market looked to New York for direction. However, the market was also keeping an eye on Brasilia where congressmen could vote on the Provisional Measure 457 which details the specifics of the government's anti-inflation plan. This will pave the way for a new currency to be introduced.</p>

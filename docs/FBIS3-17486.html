Here is  our correspondent Andrey Kondrashov:    Delegations of four border oblasts of Kazakhstan and Russia  took part in the talks -- Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk, Omsk, and  Pavlodar. A package of economic issues was discussed. Every  year 24 million tonnes of Ekibastuz coal are supplied to  Siberian power stations from Kazakhstan. According to the  Kazakhstan newspaper PANORAMA, the Russian energy sector's  arrears reached around 80 billion rubles, 17 billion of which  have already been paid. The remainder of the debt is to be paid  in April.    Agreement was reached at the meeting to set up a joint  Russian-Kazakh joint-stock company of the open type, founded by  the power, coal and machine-building sectors of the two  countries. It is intended that the draft agreement among the  administrations of the four oblasts will be submitted to a  forthcoming meeting of leaders and heads of state of Russia and  Kazakhstan.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Letter: Squaring up to reality Sir, Samuel Brittan argues that a one-vote majority is enough to confirm French ratification of the Maastricht treaty ('Waiting for the 'D' word', September 21). Yet he goes on to suggest that the Danes have to be 'squared'. Several thousand more Danes said No than said Yes and the treaty has to be ratified by all 12 nations or it does not go ahead. Surely it is the politicians who have to 'square' up to the reality that No means No in a democracy. Ian Harrison, Chipstead Street, London SW6</p>

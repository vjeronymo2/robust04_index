			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Feb 4 SAPA -- Sasol [South African  Coal, Oil, and Gas Corporation] and Hyundai of Korea said on  Friday [4 February] they had recently signed a contract for the  manufacture and erection of the reactor module and steam drum of  the R[rand]123-million Sasol advanced synthol (SAS) reactor  project.    Babcock Construction contractors will assist Hyundai with  on-site construction. At the signing Hannes Botha, managing  director of Sasol synthetic fuels, said the installation of this  reactor was a step toward producing synthetic oil more cost  effectively than at present. "The new technology used in the  SAS reactor is more energy efficient, requires lower capital  investment and needs less maintenance than the proven synthol  technology. Sasol is always looking for ways to improve its cost  competitiveness and it is foreseen that this new addition will  contribute toward this purpose," Mr Botha said.    Mr N. K. Kim, regional director of Hyuandai in South Africa,  said his company accepted the challenge for the manufacture of  the SAS reactor, which uses the latest technology for the  production of oil from gas. The reactor will weigh 840 [metric]  tons and is too large to be transported as a unit from Korea to  Sasol Two. Parts of the reactor, some of them weighing 300  [metric] tons, will be shipped to Richards Bay and transported  by road from there to Secunda. Assembly will take place at the  construction site. Sophisticated welding techniques will be used  for the closing seams under difficult site conditions.    A set of complex steam coils weighing 240 [metric] tons will  be installed inside the reactor. The coils will be shipped from  Korea in sections and will be assembled on site. When  construction is complete a hydro test will be done requiring  1.7-million litres of water.    The commissioning of the plant is planned in September 1995  and will increase the gas utilisation at the Secunda complex.  The reactor will have a capacity greater than each of the  existing circulating fluid bed reactors and requires much less  capital to erect.    Sastech was appointed as managing contractor after  completion  of a research and development project to establish an  alternative reactor technology. In 1991 the team of Sastech  scientists and process engineers was awarded the Bille Neale-May  gold medal by the South African Institute of Chemical Engineers  as well as the national award of the Associated Scientific and  Technical Societies of South Africa for developing, designing  and commissioning the prototype of the new reactor.    The contract for the detail engineering and design was  awarded to Raytheon engineers and constructors of Boston, USA.</p>

On the 100th Anniversary of the Birth of Mao Zedong"]    [Text] This subject is a very large one, but we don't have  to go into it at great length. At first glance, it seems that we  are talking about the achievements and faults of Mao Zedong, but  actually we are discussing our predicament as Chinese people,  and the causes. To use the oft-repeated formula, currently  popular among the masses on the mainland, we can speak of "the  inveterate evil-mindedness" and the "vileness" of the Chinese.    For the last hundred years, or since even more remote times,  our several hundreds of millions of fellow countrymen definitely  have been living in hellish misery. Not only has food and  clothing been a problem, but even minimal human rights could not  be guaranteed. To describe it in colloquial language, "the rich  and powerful didn't treat us poor folks like human beings"; but,  in fact, were the rich and powerful treated like human beings?  They themselves had no such expectation, so slavish formulas  like "I wish to labor like a dog or a horse" were fashionable  politenesses, and remained in common use for a long time. In a  country as large as China, were there no men?    There is more. Starting two thousand years ago, with the  first time that a totalitarian and despotic dynasty was  overthrown, wise men have continually appeared in China, and  sounded the clarion call of human rights. Their slogans and  ideals were of various kinds, but they had one thing in common,  and that was the demand that farmers and convicts, who were at  the lowest strata of society, be treated as equals. "Are there  any noblemen, or generals or great officials, who are worth  anything?" The problem of food and clothing was of secondary  importance. They were not things to be received as a matter of  course; they had to be won through the effort of each  individual. Only under the system of slavery, under feudalism,  did people receive food and clothing, or get treated like human  beings, as a matter of course. But people are not ordinary  animals. What they demand first is to be treated like human  beings, by others, and by themselves. To use the expression that  is in vogue right now, they demand, first of all, that their  human rights be guaranteed, not that they be treated merely as  "domestic animals that can talk" or as "tame implements" to be  cared for and ordered about.    Therefore, it was only the clarion calls of the wise and  brave men of successive ages that enabled the people to unite in  vast numbers and achieve great things. Mao Zedong and his  comrades (or at least a considerable portion of them) were wise  and brave men of just this kind. Their slogans combined many  foreign ideals and were the most alluring promises in history.  How could the people, so crushed under the weight of suffering  that they could not draw a breath, and muddled into bewilderment  for generations by their rules, not revere him as a living  bodhisattva? This is why a great savior comes to be; not because  he does good things for the people, but because the people  impatiently expected him to do good things for them. Placing  hopes in a great savior is an ignorant fantasy, but still it  cannot be called "the inveterate evil-mindedness" of a  "villain." Everyone has the right to struggle for, and then to  achieve, a happy life. This is also a fundamental human right.    If there is any "vileness," then it lies in the pervasive  conditioning, of several thousand years of despotic culture, and  in the psychological tendency of small producers toward  narrowness and short-sighted greed, which makes them content to  accept, and be satisfied with, a "great savior." They do not  want to think about "different political views" anymore, nor do  they want to apply themselves anymore, to thought or action;  they don't want to take risks, and think "cunningly" that, after  nature has grown the fruit for them, they can then sit idle and  enjoy the harvest. Therefore, they instinctively assist the  "great savior" to seize power, and consolidate his dictatorial,  despotic regime; in reality, they are solely responsible for  building the despotic regime that oppresses and exploits them.  The so-called "new authoritarianism" and "old Fascism," are  nothing more than a modern version of small farmer ideology.    Not only Mao Zedong, but all the great saviors of successive  dynasties and eras, naturally acted out the ugly side of human  nature in full measure, as soon as they were raised to be  dictators. Selfishness, greed, cruelty -- these evils of human  nature, that show up even in children, but are restrained by the  social environment, reach almost their extreme limit in every  dictator. This is because dictators are not subject to the  restraint of the social environment, and possess omnipotent  power offered up to them by the people in their delusion. It is  just like plants and animals, that, once freed of environmental  constraints, will multiply to the extreme, leading to an  ecological disturbance. Once the social ecology is disturbed  this will lead to an extreme expansion of government power and a  pernicious growth in bureaucratism. Therefore, once the attempt  is made to realize in practice, in society, the blessings of  despotism under "great saviors and just rulers," as fantasized  in small-farmer socialism, then small farmers themselves will  become its greatest victims, and it will also bring disaster to  all other strata of society.    Small farmers and small producers (including  "intellectuals"), are of all groups the most powerless to  protect their members in society. All they can do, in the face  of heavy oppression, is to beg the oppressors to take pity on  them, or else, in addition to that, to betray others who are  also oppressed, in return for "rights" under an ever-worsening  state of life. Moreover, from this is produced a "vileness with  Chinese characteristics:" They give their most revolting  flattery to those who oppress and exploit them most fiercely,  but they break the head of anyone who is brave enough to come  forward on their behalf, and cry out against the wrongs done to  them. In this way, they ingratiate themselves with those who are  sucking their blood. This curious and outlandish trait of their  character came out, in its most typical form, and most plainly,  during the Mao Zedong era, and especially during the Cultural  Revolution. This is the greatest tragedy of a great people, and  it is also a tragedy for the dictators themselves. If the  people, in their delusion, had not raised them up to be gods,  would they not have become better people? The life of Mao Zedong  is a tragedy of this kind, that will make a person wring his  hands and sigh.    Nowadays, some people are nostalgic about Mao Zedong.  Actually, they are nostalgic for the honest government of that  time (which at least proves that Mao sincerely tried to be a  good person). They absolutely are not nostalgic for the excesses  and poverty of that time, and still less do they "ardently love  despotic socialism." When some people in official positions  seize on this subject, to put over their own ideas, it means  they have an ulterior motive. Don't they envy that god-like,  absolute power? At least, it gave quicker results than the "new  authoritarianism." It is not impossible that they might take  advantage of the prevailing climate to launch a new deification  movement. But, regrettably, history does not retrace its steps,  and circumstances change as time goes by. A new deification  movement might end in a farce, and the gods might turn into  buffoons. Let us wait and see.</p>

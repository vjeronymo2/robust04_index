			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions A GROWING band of directors appears to be prepared to buy shares. Allied Colloids, the speciality chemical group, announced final results at the beginning of June. Following an up-beat statement, six directors  - including the chairman, managing director and finance director - bought a total of 12,000 shares at 163p. The shares have been as high as 220p in May this year and are trading now at about 166p. The food retailing sector has maintained a fairly steady performance over the past year. At William Low, Dundee-based superstore operator and food retailer, four directors bought a total of 26,000 shares at prices between 176p and 180p. Results from Excalibur Group in July reflected the problems of companies trading in luxury and giftware items. The company makes and wholesales high quality jewellery. Despite pre-tax profits down from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 1.1m, its precision engineering division was reported to be doing well. Three directors - the chairman, managing director and finance director - bought a total of 1,784,000 shares at 8p. JA Fooks, the chairman of East Surrey Holdings, a statutory water company, sold 506,470 shares at 222.5p. The shares have performed strongly since coming to the market in March 1990. Fooks still holds 1,256,850.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            No of Company                       Sector    Shares    Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES East Surrey                   Watr     506,470    1,127       1 Morland &amp; Co                  Brew      15,000       57       1 Plysu                         Chem      25,000       67       1 Sainsbury J                   FdRe       3,000       14       1 Smith (WH) B Shrs             Stor      92,192       70       1 Stanley Leisure               Hotl      10,000       20       1 Wickes                        BdMa      30,000       21       1 PURCHASES Allied Colloids               Chem      12,000       20       6 Bedford (Wm)                   n/a     225,000       23       1 Brabant Resources              O&amp;G      50,000       13       1 Excalibur                     Misc   1,784,800      143       3 Gt Portland (CULS)            Prop         110      100       1 Holmes &amp; Marchant              Med     760,000       61       2 Low (Wm)                      FdRe      26,000       46       4 Molynx                        Elec      35,000       13       1 MS Intl                       EngG      50,000       12       1 TR Property IT                InTr     200,000       30       1 Transatlantic CnvP            InsL     275,000      186       1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

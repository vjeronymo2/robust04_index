			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;G rules out early statement over court's ban on Pounds 1.8bn bid The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society yesterday ruled out making any announcement for 'several weeks' on its response to a High Court ruling on Wed-nesday barring the terms of Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn bid. The statement appeared to contradict signals from Lloyds that it would like to be able to say something concrete by the end of next week. Bankers said Lloyds was confident that it would be able to come up with a proposal that both satisfied the court and would be true to the spirit of the original cash offer to the society's members. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester ruled out suggestions that it would consider issuing preference shares to customers in lieu of a cash payment. However, it refused to speculate on alternative ways of getting around the judgment, such as providing a payment to customers who agreed to transfer their savings to non-voting deposit accounts. In a letter sent to its 1.4m customers yesterday, the society advised that no-one should close any of their mortgage or investment accounts for fear of jeopardising a potential payment under a revised offer. It expressed 'great disappointment' in the judgment and said the ruling came in spite of 'strong legal advice' that the offer was permitted under the act from two QCs - Mr Jonathan Sumption and Mr Richard Sykes. The society stressed that its delay at least into July of an announcement on any revisions to the Lloyds offer was unrelated to its short-term decision to prevent any new customers from opening accounts.

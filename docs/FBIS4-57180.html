			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments carried by Cuban media in  Spanish between 9 and 13 May:    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 9 May reports that a small gold  mine in Pinar del Rio is expected to yield approximately 300 kg  of gold this year. The mining complex uses Brazilian technology  and employs over 100 workers.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 10 May reports that 1,630  caballerias of tobacco in Pinar del Rio will be financed by the  Spanish Tobacco Company. The southern part of Pinar del Rio  Province, including San Luis and Consolacion del Sur  Municipalities, was chosen by the Spanish Tobacco Company for  financing in a project that will bring in hard currency. The  financing is excellent because Cuba can use the money however it  deems necessary -- e.g., for fertilizers, herbicides, shoes, or  clothing -- so as to ensure that the land produces maximally. A  local official said the financing will be repaid in tobacco.    Radio Reloj at 1400 GMT on 11 May reports that workers from  the Sergio Soto Refinery in Cabaiguan, Sancti Spiritus Province,  have produced, experimentally, the first few tons of oil for  electric transformers. This will mean a substantial contribution  to the national economy. This oil, produced from crude extracted  from deposits in the vicinity of Cristales and Pina, is  essential for electric transformers. The Sergio Soto Refinery  also produces other important petroleum by-products, such as  basic oil.    Havana Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on  12 May report that following significant improvements, the  Hermanos Diaz Oil Refinery in Santiago de Cuba has attained a  production capability that allows this refinery to take up the  slack while the Nico Lopez Oil Refinery in Havana undergoes  general maintenance.    Radio Reloj at 1930 GMT on 11 May reports that potato  production in Pinar del Rio Province increased by 30,000  quintals in 1994 as compared to 1993. More than 203,000 quintals  have been harvested. According to the Pinar del Rio Province  Agriculture Ministry office, the country's cold-storage  facilities contain enough potatoes to supply the population for  the rest of the year.    Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 12 May reports that there are  approximately 10,000 self-employed people in Matanzas Province,  or 15 percent of the national total. "Of these 10,000 people, 60  percent are men; 2,000 are women; 2,000 are retirees. Some 1,500  of the women are housewives, and almost 5,000 people are current  job-holders." There are approximately 100 applications for self-  employment permits weekly.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 13 May reports that since its  reorganization, Cubanacan Incorporated has a new transport  company called (Veracuba). The report adds that the transport  management in 1993 obtained an income of more than $13 million  and projects an income between $16 and $17 million in 1994. This  will represent an increase of between 20 and 25 percent over the  same period the previous year. Thus, after six years of work,  the company has achieved an increase of between 30 and 40  percent. The new company is prepared to provide more and better  services with a very young, efficient, and trained personnel who  can speak several languages.    In the same newscast Radio Rebelde reports that 140 houses  have been built in Holguin to shelter agricultural and livestock  workers. These are the first of 1,000 houses to be built in the  province this year. The report adds that tobacco production is  expected to increase by approximately 40,000 quintals in Pinar  del Rio. In Camaguey sugarcane workers intend to plant 1,765  caballerias during May. The report concludes by announcing a  plan for the construction of seven small hydroelectric plants in  Granma Province to increase current generating capacity by 11.6  megawatts/hour.</p>

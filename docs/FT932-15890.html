			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Stylo losses down to Pounds 746,000 STYLO, the footwear group, yesterday announced a sharp reduction in pre-tax losses from Pounds 9.06m to Pounds 746,000 for the year to January 30. The improvement was achieved following the closure of the heavily loss-making US operations. Pre-tax profits from continuing businesses were Pounds 674,000 against a deficit of Pounds 7.4m. Sales rose 15 per cent to Pounds 105.5m, while the operating loss of Pounds 4.2m in 1992 was transformed to a profit of Pounds 3.5m. Mr Arnold Ziff, chairman, said the profits improvement had been achieved in spite of even more difficult conditions for the shoe trade. The outlook for the UK retail division was encouraging, with turnover continuing to increase. Prospects for the wholesale sports division, selling golf and equestrian footwear and clothing, were also better, he said. Losses per share was substantially reduced from 42p to 4.01p. The dividend on limited voting and management shares is lifted to 3p (2.5p).</p>

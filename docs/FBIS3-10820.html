			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This is the first reaction to the results of the  Liberal Party internal primary. This result, which the Caracol  Network has predicted, coincides with figures provided by the  National Advisory Center after an opinion poll was taken among  35,000 people.    Humberto de la Calle Lombana, with a remarkable improvement,  received 14.77 percent of the vote. Ernesto Samper Pizano,  56.75 percent. This result has not accounted for blank votes;  had these been considered, de la Calle would have received 14  percent versus Samper Pizano's 53.8 percent.    [Begin recording] [Announcer Dario Arizmendi] Dr. de la  Calle, good afternoon.    [De la Calle] Good afternoon, Dario; glad to greet you.    [Arizmendi] Same to you. Congratulations for the result,  which is considerably higher than that predicted by the week's  earlier opinion polls.    [De la Calle] Undoubtedly. I am happy and want to tell you  this is a good result. I have been in public life for only one  year and think this has been a success, particularly for  independent voters. I will write soon a paper that I intend to  send to Dr. Samper accepting his victory and saying it was a  clean and democratic victory. I will add, however, we are  undoubtedly the second largest liberal force, that we will be  present in 1998, that in that year I expect to take my ideas of  constitutional development, renewal, and change to the  Presidency, and that the message for me is one of optimism,  gladness, and recognition of the people who have believed in our  political proposals.    [Arizmendi] Considering this high percentage of votes in the  second round, as you said, the fact that you have been in  political work for barely one year and [words indistinct], what  do you expect in the new liberal organization that Samper Pizano  had announced previously? Do you think you can rightfully claim  the chance to run for the position of vice president of the  Republic?    [De la Calle] As I have said many, many times, I have ruled  out the possibility of running for vice president. I am sure I  must keep after ideals; this is based on principles, ideas, and  the renewal process I helped push forward in 1991.    I will keep on working. I thank my voters; they can rest  assured I will run for president in 1998. Meanwhile, all I want  is to recognize Samper Pizano's triumph. All of us liberals  should sit down and make a sustained effort to update the party,  to push it forward, and to strengthen the liberal platform with  the various political inclinations expressed today.    My immediate invitation is for Dr. Samper to study these  various shades of liberalism, to create a platform incorporating  all of them despite their differences, admitting opinion polls  have been useful, that there is a process to reinforce the  Liberal Party's unity. This unity, as I have said many times, is  programmatic rather than arithmetical. I am open to discuss  programs and platforms to consolidate a triumphant Liberal Party  program.    [Arizmendi] Do you intend to work with the same fervor and  zest as before, now that you have attained the second highest  percentage of votes in the Liberal Party?    [De la Calle] I intend to sit down soon with Dr. Samper to  discuss this new and revived Liberal Party program, which must  include and revolve around renewal, change, participative  democracy, and social policy. I think the moment demands a  programmatic and ideological process of discussion, which should  be the true basis for a true Liberal Party unity. I recognize  his victory, but I think it is necessary to go one step beyond  the figures. In a few minutes, I will invite Dr. Samper to make  this programmatic effort to unify liberalism in depth where the  unity is genuine; that is, ideas.    [Arizmendi] Very clearly, Dr. de la Calle has admitted Dr.  Samper's victory and announced he will address a note to him in  a few hours. De la Calle expects to meet with Dr. Samper in a  few days to discuss the Liberal Party's future. De la Calle  also announced he will run for president in 1998 and that he  would never run for vice president on a single ballot with  Samper, who came out a clear winner in the Liberal Party primary.    Carlos Lleras de la Fuente expresses his opinion on this  result. He only participated in the campaign for three weeks but  received 7.8 percent of the vote, without accounting for blanks,  and 8.22 percent considering blank votes, after the primary was  held with 35,862 interviews conducted by the National Advisory  Center. Dr. LLeras de la Fuente, good afternoon and welcome to  the Caracol Network.    [Lleras] Good afternoon; how are you all?    [Arizmendi] Very well, Sir. Are you happy and satisfied?  Did the result take you by surprise?    [Lleras] I am very happy. Although the campaign lasted  barely 20 days, I received 8.22 percent of the overall vote;  this is more than a success, a success which I believe has never  been seen before in Colombian elections.    [Arizmendi] Did you expect a percentage this high?    [Lleras] I have always been optimistic; so I expected to  obtain very good results. The figures confirm the people  responded to the call to vote according to their consciences.    [Arizmendi] With this result in mind, do you intend to run  for the 1998 elections, as de la Calle just announced? Or will  you initiate some political exercises of a spiritual nature  before making any decision?    [Lleras] I think you still remember my spiritual exercises  in  parks. Beginning tomorrow, I will do spiritual exercises until  the Liberal Party convention, when I will make a final decision.  This result is very encouraging for anything I may have in mind  for the future.    [Arizmendi] Will you support Dr. Samper's presidential  candidacy for now?    [Lleras] Of course. This is the pledge I made when I entered  the Liberal Party primary. As I have always said, a gentleman's  pledge must be complied with, regardless.    [Arizmendi] If Dr. Samper asks you, will you tell him your  profile of the candidate for vice president?    [Lleras] I do not know what Dr. Samper will ask me. I talked  with him last night. I intend to phone him in a while to  congratulate him for his victory and reiterate something that  had already been said by Dr. de la Calle and that I had already  proposed. I am referring to the need to create a permanent  ideological platform for the Liberal Party, not one created  every time there are elections, rather, one that can be a guide  for the next government and the party's future.

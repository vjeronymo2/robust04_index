			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanchang, April 7 (XINHUA) -- Farmers in east  China's Jiangxi Province who have developed agriculture with  funds from the World Bank are paying off the loans ahead of  schedule.    A provincial government official in charge of agriculture  said that the Jihu project, with a total investment of 445  million yuan including 60 million U.S. dollars loaned by the  World Bank, began four years ago. It was aimed at setting up  production bases for domestic animals, poultry and forestry and  developing the processing industry for farm and sideline  products.    To ensure the smooth operation of the project, local  governments have offered a package of  production-supply-marketing services for farmers.    One who has benefited from the arrangement is Wang Doubin, a  farmer in Zhangshu City who borrowed 95,000 yuan in loans to set  up a pig farm in late 1990.    By the end of 1992, he had sold 828 lean meat pigs and had  38  breeding hogs and 277 meat pigs in stock. His net income that  year amounted to 42,000 yuan.    The farmer paid off all the loans within three years.    Wang is a typical example of 1,800 households that have  begun  to pay off loans ahead of schedule.    A survey shows that the project has enabled local farmers to  create an annual output value of more than 600 million yuan and  generate profits and taxes totalling 150 million yuan.    The annual income of farmers involved in the project  averages  3,000 yuan per participant, about five times that of local  farmers.    By the end of last year, the project had recovered 3.134  million yuan to go toward retiring World Bank loans.</p>

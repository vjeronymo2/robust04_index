The Agrarian Crisis Will Continue Unless the Government Attitude  Toward Rural Areas Changes"]    [Text] Agrarian reforms have been under way for three years  in Russia. It is now possible to sum up certain results and look  to the future. But first--about their initial base.    It is known that the Russian Federation had exaggerated  specialization of the national economy. By 1989 the branches of  group A here (the military-industrial, fuel-energy,  metallurgical, machine building, and chemical-timber complexes)  accounted for more than 70 percent of the gross national  product. Immense quantities of their output went to other  republics and CEMA countries, and also to the West. The share of  the agro-industrial complex was only 15.2 percent. For  comparison: in the Baltic countries it exceeded 50 percent. And  about two-thirds of what was produced was consumed locally.    The center did not devote the proper attention to Russian  agriculture. Farms of Russia received less in capital  investments, fertilizers, technical equipment, manufactured  concentrated feeds, construction materials, and energy resources  per 100 hectares of arable land. The capital availability for  agriculture in Russia, for example, was 12 times less than in  the Baltic region. The disparity was just as great in the levels  of land reclamation (88.5 percent in Lithuania and 6.2 percent  in the RSFSR), the provision of natural gas, and social  structuring of the rural areas. For this reason there were more  and more ghost towns that had lost their able-bodied population.  The demographic crisis became irreversible in a number of  regions. And the demand for food products in Russia was covered  through three sources: its own production, deliveries from Union  republics, and imports. The last two items provided for more  than a third of all the consumption.    Such were the starting conditions for the agrarian reforms.  It seems that because of these, the collapse of the Union and  previous ties dealt an especially painful blow to the food  supply for Russians. Well, one learns from one's mistakes. Of  course it would be better to learn from others'. But since this  is the way it has turned out....    In other words, it is necessary to restructure the entire  economy, assigning a larger role in it to the agro-industrial  complex. But it seems that once again life has not taught us a  thing. The share of the agro-industrial complex in the national  economy not only is not growing, but is rapidly decreasing. And  it is not difficult to guess the result: a rapid collapse of  production. In terms of per capita consumption of meat and milk,  we have dropped back to the 1965 level. The number of Russians  is decreasing. In 1992 the natural attrition amounted to only  200,000 people, while the preliminary estimate for this year was  about 600,000.    And still today there is not even the smallest significant  social group of the population that would be against the  reforms. Debates about how to conduct them are another matter.  Throughout the year, over 500 days, or according to the Stolypin  method: "Leave me alone for 20 years and I will make Russia  prosperous"?    During three years of reforms, about 170 million hectares of  arable land have been turned over to the ownership of  agricultural commodity producers. A multiple-system economy is  being created. Hundreds of thousands of peasant farms have been  registered. Millions of city dwellers have received garden plots  and orchards, and land is being allotted for residential  buildings. The system of administration is changing. There is no  longer the previous dictatorship from the center. What to plant,  what production structure to have, how to use profit--these  things are being decided by the people themselves. This is good.    The only problem is that the rural areas are continuing to  decline from day to day. And one cannot agree with those who  justify this rapid collapse. They say that it is necessary to  pay for the reforms. The experience of other countries does not  confirm this. In China during 12 years of reforms, the gross  agricultural output increased 2.2-fold, meat  production--3.7-fold, fish production--2.8-fold, and sugar  production--3.5-fold. These reforms were based not on  ideological but on economic principles. The Chinese say: "The  color of the cat makes no difference as long as it catches mice."    Instead of having a clear-cut concept of our own, we are  inclined to borrow others' models. Hastiness in the development  of legislative and normative documents and standard formulas for  reform of all of the immense area of Russia without preliminary  checking in various regions has led to mistakes and pro forma  actions.    One of them was the attempt to solve the food problem solely  through deep reformation and change in the forms of ownership  and management. We must be realistic. This alone will not  stabilize production or increase its effectiveness. Especially  when deliveries of technical equipment, fertilizers, and  construction materials to agriculture are being catastrophically  reduced. When procurement prices for agricultural products are  growing much more slowly than the prices of industrial products  for rural areas. Because of the lack of equivalence in exchange,  rural areas are failing to receive hundreds of billions of  rubles.    With the destruction of the state procurement system,  numerous middlemen and speculators attach themselves to rural  commodity producers like barnacles on an old ship. Rural  residents sell their goods for three to five times less than we  buy them for in the stores. As we can see, it is by no means the  agricultural workers who are to blame for the high retail prices.    Because of the impoverishment of the masses, even the  significantly curtailed production remains largely unconsumed.  In many regions of Russia, an immense quantity of butter, meat,  grain, and potatoes has accumulated in the warehouses. At the  same time, the state continues to buy them abroad at higher  prices.    The government is ripping off the rural residents, forcing  them to sell grain at prices set from above without paying for  it. At the same time, peasants today have to pay in advance for  every nail, while for products that are produced the prime  minister is promising that by the new year a maximum of 80  percent of the debt of more than 2 trillion will be paid. By  that time the ruble will be worth even less.    In the past the peasantry took on the job of accelerated  industrialization and restoration of the national economy  destroyed by the war. Today an attempt is being made to make it  responsible for emerging from the financial crisis. But even  Adam Smith said that the country gives the city exactly the same  amount as the city gives the country. High prices of industrial  goods and high taxes have sharply reduced investment activity  and have blocked structural changes in the agro-industrial  complex which are necessary for the formation of a market. And  this predetermines the long-term tendencies toward decline of  production.    The already weak social sphere of the rural areas is being  destroyed. But perhaps the most terrible thing is the  degradation of the production and scientific-technical potential  and the fertility of the soil. The gene pool of the animals,  breeding work, and seed growing are being destroyed, and  production construction has been reduced many times over. Fixed  capital is aging, and the load per tractor and combine is  increasing. Capacities and work force are engaged in repair of  machines and equipment just as they are in agricultural machine  building. A process of physical disintegration of productive  forces has begun, and the demand for scientific and technical  products is decreasing.    Nonetheless, the state refuses to grant subsidies to  agriculture. Although in the West, even with a surplus of  foodstuffs, the governments grant immense subsidies to the  farmers. Incidentally, in developed countries, approximately  half of the increase in production of food products comes  through technical progress.    Government leaders justify their policy with respect to  agriculture by saying that the state has no funds. Although it  is known that the enterprises and citizens pay immense taxes.  Prices, apartment rents, and the costs of other services have  increased many times over. Energy resources, timber, and metal  are being exported in considerable quantities to nearby and  distant foreign countries.    There are many holes. They include the bloated state  apparatus, which has occupied not only all republic buildings,  but also the buildings of the former Union ministries and  departments. Numerous bureaucrats of the state apparatus are  receiving wages that are several times higher than those of  world-renowned scientists.    Today a large proportion of the members of government,  especially deputy prime ministers, are bending over  backwards--they travel through foreign countries trying to scare  up a billion and a half or two billion dollars in credit. At the  same time, with the help of their own government, funds of  Russian entrepreneurs amounting to more than $20 billion a year  are sitting in Western banks. Creating an economic mechanism  that would make it possible to motivate our entrepreneurs to  invest this money in Russia's economy--this is what our  government should be working on.    And another large financial source would be to demand  repayment of debts from republics of the former Union. After the  proclamation of sovereignty by the parliament of Russia in 1990,  there was the hope that we would become the masters of our own  wealth, that we would develop the economy on the basis of our  own advantage and determine an efficient specialization. Then  the peoples of the former Union would know who is who. Because  relations among independent states should be arranged on an  equivalent basis and their well-being should be made directly  dependent on labor productivity and the generation of capital as  the basis of social justice. After all, it is known that of all  the republics of the former USSR, only Russia previously had a  positive balance in interrepublic exchange, and in 1989 it was  more than $50 billion.    Alas, Russia is continuing to supply its neighbors with  energy sources, raw materials, and processed materials at  extremely low prices. Because of the differences in prices  (world and transfer) it annually loses $17 billion.    With this kind of state foreign economic policy, where are  we  supposed to get the money to repay our debts to rural workers?  Here it is necessary to resort to deception or, rather, get  involved in the state rackets with respect to our peasants.  Because we are not used to paying them their due. At the end of  the 1920's, Stalin spoke about tribute from the rural areas as a  temporary measure. Today this is considered to be an ordinary  phenomenon: the peasant can be patient a little longer for the  sake of the reforms. He has already been patient for 75 years!    The agrarian crisis will continue unless the attitude toward  it changes.    Do not neglect the disease, esteemed state leaders!</p>

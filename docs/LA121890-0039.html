			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL STARTS IN MURDER THAT SHOCKED PALISADES;  </P> <P> COURTS: TEEN-AGER WAS KILLED JUST DAYS BEFORE HER GRADUATION. A PRIVATE  SECURITY GUARD IS ACCUSED OF THE CRIME.  </P> <P> At dawn on the eve of her high school graduation, the battered body of  18-year-old Teak Dyer was found on the floor of a Pacific Palisades bathroom.  </P> <P> Before day's end, a security guard who told police he had "stumbled upon" the  bloody scene was arrested and later charged with the murder of the young woman.  </P> <P> Now, more than two years after the crime that shocked Westsiders and sparked  efforts to tighten controls on the private security guard industry, Rodney  Darnell Garmanian -- also charged with soliciting the murders of a judge,  prosecutor and investigator while in custody -- is on trial for his life.  </P> <P> The emotion-laden proceedings, which began last week and are expected to last  well into next year, offer a glimpse into the less-than-storybook lifestyles of  affluent teen-agers, the workings of an unregulated cadre of gun-toting  security guards, and the private anguish of two sets of parents seated on  opposite sides of the Santa Monica courtroom.  </P> <P> The tone of the trial was set by Deputy Dist. Atty. Lauren Weis, who told the  six-man, six-woman jury that the victim's last night -- June 21, 1988 -- began  as "a night of joyous celebration," capped by a Palisades High graduation party  at the Santa Monica Pier carousel.  </P> <P> "They toasted to life and their futures," the prosecutor said, as the girl's  parents wept in the front row. "No one could know that Teak Dyer had no  future."  </P> <P> Her father, Rod Dyer, is a noted graphics artist; her mother, Jackie Dyer,  worked as comptroller for film producer Steve Tisch before moving to Northern  California.  </P> <P> Weis said the evidence will show that the former MacGuard night patrolman  accosted the girl while on duty, attempted to rape her in the locked bathroom  of the Topa Building in the Palisades village, handcuffed and beat her when she  rebuffed his advances, and killed her with three shots from his service  revolver to avoid arrest.  </P> <P> Garmanian is charged separately with trying to arrange the contract killings of  Los Angeles Municipal Judge David Horwitz, Deputy Dist. Atty. Harvey Giss and  Los Angeles Police Detective John Rockwood in the fall of 1988, again, said  Weis, "to save his own head."  </P> <P> Tapes of radio transmissions on the night of the murder, and testimony from  Garmanian's supervisor and other guards, show that he failed to maintain  contact with his office at about the time witnesses said they heard noises  similar to gunshots. The defendant reported finding the victim's partially nude  body on his routine early-morning rounds by radioing, "I've got, uh, I guess, a  187 here," a reference to state Penal Code Section 187 -- murder.  </P> <P> Fingerprints of the Brentwood teen-ager were found on the passenger-side door  of Garmanian's patrol car, a .38-caliber bullet found beneath her body was  linked to the defendant's handgun, and several fellow guards testified to  uncharacteristic behavior by the usually reliable man on the night of the  murder. The co-workers added that they had noticed scratches on Garmanian's  face and arms -- "like fingernails leave" -- after the incident.  </P> <P> During the trial's first week, a heavy scratch reappeared on Garmanian's nose  in exactly the same place shown in his booking photographs. The scratch  worsened as the week wore on, prompting Weis to comment that the defendant's  scratching of the spot "shows a consciousness of guilt" akin to Lady MacBeth's  repeated attempts to wash away her "damned spot" in Shakespeare's drama.  </P> <P> According to testimony from the last person to see the victim alive, her  friend, Nicole Rabin, Teak Dyer began the summer night at her mother's home,  preparing food for the party. She and friends later drank champagne and each  did a line of cocaine before leaving for the pier, where police broke up the  festivities two hours later because of alcohol on the premises.  </P> <P> Rabin, now 20, testified under a grant of immunity from prosecution for perjury  and providing drugs. She said she had lied at Garmanian's preliminary hearing,  when she said her friend had not been drinking or taking drugs, because she did  not want to besmirch the victim's name.  </P> <P> An autopsy found that Dyer was legally drunk and had traces of cocaine in her  system. Defense attorneys fought to introduce that as evidence, arguing that  the girl may have gone willingly with Garmanian because people on coke often do  things they would not ordinarily do, to get more drugs.  </P> <P> "Getting shot three times is not one of those," snapped Superior Court Judge  Jacqueline Weisberg.  </P> <P> Rabin said Dyer remained in the car when they stopped briefly at a friend's  home en route to Rustic Canyon Park, where the party was to resume. It was just  after midnight when she returned to find an empty car, and assumed that Dyer  had left with another friend.  </P> <P> The incident sparked fear and distrust among many residents of the Palisades,  which averages less than one murder a year, and caused many to switch security  firms or eliminate such services. Some parents began teaching their children  how to distinguish a "real" policeman from a security guard. MacGuard Security  Services was sold to Westec Security Inc.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys Ezekiel Perlo and Paul Takakjian made no opening statement  and declined to disclose their strategy. At sidebar conferences outside the  presence of the jury, they have indicated that they may follow the lead of  Garmanian's previous attorney, Melvin Belli, who attempted to point the finger  at another security guard who had access to the same building.  </P> <P> Jackie Dyer, often beside her ex-husband, sat in the front row of the  courtroom, hiding her eyes when blowups of her daughter's bloody body are held  up. Like family members of many crime victims, she has found herself  reluctantly thrust into an activist role, fighting -- unsuccessfully so far --  for state reforms in the screening, monitoring and accountability of security  guards.  </P> <P> A MacGuard security guard testified that the firm offered little training and  that Garmanian worked there for six months, despite complaints that he behaved  inappropriately toward women. Earlier, the Dyer family won a $1-million  settlement in a wrongful death suit against MacGuard and its owner.  </P> <P> Across the courtroom sit the defendant's mother, Jane Garmanian of Chicago, his  sister and his infant nephew.  </P> <P> The mothers, brought together by a murder that has ruined both families' lives,  do not acknowledge each other's presence.  </P></p>

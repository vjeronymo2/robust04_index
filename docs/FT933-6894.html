			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Business and the Environment: Suchard grazes on green pastures - A 'feel good' factor that counts Tree planting and chocolate may not seem to have any obvious connection. Yet Jacobs Suchard, the Zurich-based chocolate and coffee group, was delighted three years ago to accept sponsorship of reforestation projects in the Alps. 'The idea could have been invented for us,' says Walter Anderau, head of corporate affairs. The connection is supplied by the lilac Milka cow, a symbol of one of Jacobs Suchard's most popular chocolate brands. By protecting the habitat of the Milka cow - a Simmental cow painted lilac for Suchard's packaging - the message that the chocolate is made from healthy Alpine milk is made more credible, he argues. Jacobs Suchard's main markets are Germany, France, Switzerland and Austria, all with Alpine regions. Since 1991, Jacobs Suchard - part of US products conglomerate Philip Morris  -has sponsored the planting of 300,000 trees in five countries as part of its collaboration with Alp Action in the 'Green Roof for Europe' campaign. This is the biggest of the 30 projects launched by Alp Action, founded by Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan to mobilise corporate funding for environmental protection in the Alps. The project, which has cost Jacobs Suchard more than SFr1m (Pounds 444,000), has involved thousands of children and plays a key role in its marketing strategy. Last week, Alp Action and Jacobs Suchard staged a tree planting event at Lenk, home of the Milka cow, to mark plans to continue their 'Green Roof for Europe' partnership. Reforestation projects are scheduled for Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Slovenia and Switzerland over the next two years. Jacobs Suchard's concern for the environment does not stop with tree planting. Since 1986, it has sought to 'green' its activities across the board. It started with a rethink of packaging requirements, necessitated by the need to streamline packaging inherited from acquired companies. The group has since extended its environmental concerns to production, transport and its housekeeping. Jacobs Suchard uses a recyclable plastic monofoil for its Milka Lila Pause chocolate bar which is cheaper, 'greener' and attractive to consumers. Its redesigned chocolate boxes have saved up to 50 per cent on packaging and dispensed with polyvinyl chloride. Similarly, coffee in Germany is sold in vacuum packs containing practically no aluminium. With the same product protection, Jacobs Suchard claims to have reduced waste by 47 per cent, energy use by 37 per cent and water consumption by 48 per cent. The company plans to extend monopacks to all markets. Further down the chain, the group uses multi-entry pallets of recyclable materials for shop deliveries. These pallets are later collected and re-used. In this way, Jacobs Suchard has cut the total amount of primary and secondary packaging by 5 per cent - 10,000 tonnes - in three years. Fuel use per cubic metre transported by the company has been more than halved from 1987 levels. Packaging has been redesigned and standardised with efficient packing and transport in mind. Cocoa and coffee beans are increasingly shifted by rail in special bulk containers; half the tonnage moved by Jacobs Suchard last year went by train against 5 per cent in 1987. All this greenery is, says Anderau, more a 'feel good' factor than a big money saver. Financial costs and benefits are often difficult to identify. Environmental objectives are just one factor in the investment in new packaging or factory modernisation. The company has invested directly about Dollars 23m (Pounds 15m) since 1977 on environmental protection measures. This includes Dollars 4m on its new chocolate factory in Berlin and Dollars 3m (with Dollars 10m more planned) on its Lorrach facility near Basle. Anderau reckons these costs probably offset a large part of the savings from pro-environment activities. However, the 'feel good' factor counts, for Jacobs Suchard's workers and its consumers. At Lenk, Jacobs Suchard launched a programme to plant a tree for every baby born to an employee's family, an Alpine farming tradition.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, "vice </F> chairman of the Presidential Council"; place and date not given]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The refusal by the Sanaa regime  to accept all the resolutions and appeals of the world has been  accompanied by moves on the battlefronts to launch successive  attacks on our brave forces who are defending Aden, its vital  installations, and the civilians from among the sons of our  people in a foolish and amazing insistence they [Sanaa regime]  continue to attempt impossible advances aiming to occupy the  steadfast city.    As I announce this to the world I would like to stress that  the government of the Democratic Republic of Yemen has been  asking for the necessity of convening an urgent meeting of the  UN Security Council so that steps may be taken to put an end to  the Sanaa regime's defiance of the resolutions of the Security  Council and the appeals of the international community.    I also appeal to the fraternal Arab and Muslim countries and  the friendly countries, as well as the five permanent members of  the Security Council, to take decisive measures with regard to  the Sanaa regime which is rejecting everything and insisting on  the logic of force, particularly after this has been  demonstrated to everyone.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of  the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) published  an open letter on April 30 exposing the anti-national and  inhumanitarian development of chemical weapons by the South  Korean authorities, according to the Seoul-based radio Voice of  National Salvation.    The letter says:    It was in the late 1960s and the early 1970s that the South  Korean military fascist group made the development of chemical  weapons its policy.    When Nixon made public the "Guam Declaration" in 1969, the  military fascist regime defined it as the keynote policy of the  dictatorial regime to develop chemical weapons along with  nuclear weapons under the pretext of "filling up the blanket  caused by the reduction of the U.S. Forces." This policy was  pursued by the traitor Pak Chong-hui and then in the days of  Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u and is now being stepped up by Kim  Yong-sam.    South Korea has produced large quantities of chemical  weapons.    The authorities have introduced many chemical weapon  factories. There are eleven companies producing MIC (methyl  isocyanate) in South Korea, all of them brought from the United  States.    In an Asian country, this poison gas leaked from a chemical  factory for 12 hours to leave some 4,000 people dead, 20,000  blind and 200,000 poisoned within the radius of 40 kilometres.    The authorities are building by themselves many factories of  awfully deadly poison gas. Factories producing such kind of  toxic gas number ten or more, among them the TDI (toluene  diisocyanate) in the Imhae complex, Kunsan, the Inchon factory  of the oriental chemical industrial company, the Korea Pacific  Chemical Corporation and the Sam Yang Chemical Company. They  produce chemical weapons under the cover of production of  chemicals for civil use, and deliver them to the military.    TDI and phosgene, chlorine and other materials used in it  are  strong poisonous substances which are themselves chemical  weapons.    The annual production of phosgene is 96,000 tons in South  Korea (SEOUL SINMUN January 12, 1993) and gaseous chlorine  stockpiled amounts to thousands of tons.    Producers of poisonous chemical materials used for the  production of chemical weapons number more than 30 and the scale  of the annual production of materials liable to control has  exceeded 120,000 tons (SEOUL SINMUN, January 12, 1993.)    The ruling group of traitors has developed and stockpiled  nerve gas, suffocative toxicant and other kinds of chemical  weapons designed for attack, killing of domestic animals and  destruction of forests in military areas and densely populated  areas in the rear.    Deployed in the whole frontline areas are 15 chemical attack  units including chemical depot No. 31 of the second logistic  command of the Army, chemical depot No. 12 of the third Army  support command, the 16th chemical support battalion under the  sixth Army and the chemical battalion under the third Army. The  chemical units continue tests of exploding, throwing and  launching handgrenades, mines, bombs, shells, rockets, warheads  of missile and other firing or launched and jet-propelled  weapons which are charged with various kinds of chemical  materials.    The Korean nation may suffer not only from poison gas made  by  South Korea but also from gas bombs of the U.S. Forces.    The United States, which had brought a large quantity of  chemical weapons into South Korea, has deployed many binary  chemical weapons in main military operational areas according to  the decision of the 18th "South Korea-U.S. Annual Security  Meeting" in 1986.    The United States and the South Korean traitors have  steadily  cultivated the tactics of using chemical weapons together with  nuclear weapons in the Team Spirit manoeuvres directed against  the North, regarding chemical weapons as "one of the main  elements of military potentials."    The open letter concludes with the following words:    The criminal production and deployment of chemical weapons  by  the South Korean authorities are not only a total challenge to  the September, 1992, international accord prohibiting the  development, production, stockpile and use of chemical weapons  but also a hostile act going against the North-South agreement  on nonaggression.    The United States and the Kim Yong-sam group are now crying  over "the issue of chemical weapons" of the North. This is a  premeditated ruse to cover up their criminal preparations for  chemical warfare. Our people must rise up resolutely in the  massive struggle for removing the danger of a nuclear war on the  Korean peninsula and, at the same time, checking the production  and use of chemical weapons, the most heinous, brutal,  anti-national and anti-human act, by the South Korean  authorities.</p>

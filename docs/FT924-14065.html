			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / International Company News: CRA restates accounts and ends ASC dispute CRA, the Australian resources group, has restated its 1990/91 accounts after settling a long-running dispute with the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) over accounting practices. The ASC queried CRA's treatment of several items as extraordinary rather than abnormal, including a ADollars 134m (USDollars 95.7m) writedown of downstream aluminium businesses and a ADollars 159m transfer of surplus pension contributions. CRA said it believed the treatment was acceptable under Australian accounting standard AASB 1018. However, the group has accepted the ASC's view that the standard 'is capable of other interpretations'. The effect of the restatement is to increase CRA's net profits after abnormal items to ADollars 396m from ADollars 350m. However, the bottom-line losses after extraordinary items remains unchanged at ADollars 34m. CRA also released restated results for Comalco, its 67 per cent-controlled aluminium subsidiary. Comalco's net profits, after abnormals of ADollars 27m, become net losses of ADollars 67m, but the bottom-line losses remain unchanged at ADollars 67m.</p>

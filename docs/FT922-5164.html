			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Moratorium by Walbrook Ins Walbrook Insurance, a subsidiary of London United Investment, has imposed a moratorium on all claims from May 29, writes Richard Lapper. Directors said they believed the company would be able to develop plans, in co-operation with its policyholders, to ensure its long-term solvency. Discussions had begun and it was intended to invite policyholders to receive proposals before the end of this month. Southwark Run-Off Services will continue to service its policies and agree claims in the normal course of business.</p>

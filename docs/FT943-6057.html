			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / European Profile: German in EU hierarchy - Helmut Kohl's nominee moves into a top job in Brussels Dr Jurgen Trumpf is hardly a household name. But today in Brussels, Mr Trumpf, formerly the top civil servant at the German foreign ministry in Bonn, moves into one of the most powerful jobs in the EU hierarchy. The post of secretary-general of the European Council cannot compare with the president of the European Commission, a job which Mr Jacques Delors has transformed over the past 10 years into the public face of Europe. But its attractions are no less real. The selection of Mr Trumpf reveals much about the discreet manner in which Germany prefers to wield influence in the EU; but it also reflects a shift in the balance of power away from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament. The secretary-general serves as chief adviser to the Council of Ministers, the leading decision-making body in Brussels; and as counsellor to the rotating EU presidency. Supported by a modest but slowly expanding secretariat, he is also a high-level diplomatic intermediary between the member states, particularly ahead of EU summits which set the broad direction and policy of the Union every six months. In this capacity, the secretary-general serves as the guardian of the EU's institutional memory. He is charged with reminding member states of the commitments and obligations which they have undertaken. Thus, what looks like an innocuous bureaucratic function is, in fact, a powerful constraint on the (often misplaced) ambitions of incoming EU presidencies and a guarantor of continuity in EU policy- and decision-making. Under Mr Niels Ersboll, Mr Trumpf's long-serving Danish predecessor, the influence of the Council secretariat expanded. Its legal team - headed by Mr Jean-Claude Piris - was instrumental in drawing up the compromise which allowed Denmark to resubmit the Maastricht treaty to a second referendum after voters had thrown out the first version in June 1992. It also has a nascent foreign policy co-ordination unit headed by Mr Brian Crowe, a senior British diplomat. The question is whether the decline in influence of the Commission will continue once Mr Delors hands over to Mr Jacques Santer, the outgoing prime minister of Luxembourg. Mr Trumpf, 63, a classical philologist by training, studied in Athens in the mid-1950s. An avowed Anglophile, he entered the German foreign service in 1958 - the date when France, Germany, Benelux and Italy concluded the treaty of Rome which created the (then) European Community. Coincidentally, Mr Trumpf's career has been built on making the ideal of European integration a reality. He has worked exclusively on EU affairs since 1970, latterly as EU ambassador in Brussels. Like many of his generation, Mr Trumpf shares Chancellor Helmut Kohl's determination to bind Germany into an integrated Europe. Though mild of manner and usually sporting a friendly smile, Mr Trumpf has a stubborn streak when it comes to defending Germany's commitments to Europe. He is a staunch advocate of European monetary union and the imperative of the Franco-German alliance. He understands public opposition in Germany to giving up the D-Mark, but insists that Germany sticks to its treaty commitment. The temporary crisis in Anglo-German relations in September 1992 caused by the forced withdrawal of sterling from the Exchange Rate Mechanism pained him. He was less than comfortable with the presentation of the Bundesbank's case against a premature lowering of German interest rates. During his five-year term, Mr Trumpf will deal with the 1996 inter-governmental conference, as well as preparations for future EU membership for the east Europeans, Cyprus and Malta. It is widely predicted that an expansion of the EU beyond its present planned membership of 16 will require a further dilution of national sovereignty, mainly through streamlined decision-making. The appointment of Mr Trumpf followed pressure from Chancellor Kohl who made it known in Brussels that Germany was under-represented at the highest levels of the EU bureaucracy. Germany has also taken a close interest in the development of the European Parliament, where Mr Klaus Hansch has just been voted president.</p>

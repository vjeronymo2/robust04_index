			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / IMF reaches agreements on loans The International Monetary Fund has reached preliminary agreements with Belarus, Kazakhstan and Slovakia on loans under its new systemic transformation facility, and is at work on a similar agreement with Ukraine, Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director said yesterday, writes George Graham in Washington. The IMF board approved on Wednesday a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) loan for Russia under the facility, which was created earlier this year as a way of speeding up the flow of aid to the former Soviet bloc. But Mr Camdessus insisted he would not be rushed by pressure from the US and other members of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries into concluding negotiations on the second Dollars 1.5bn tranche to which Russia would be entitled under the facility.</p>

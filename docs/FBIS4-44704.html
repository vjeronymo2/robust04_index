			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Mutant Rabbits in the Year 2000, the </F> Future of Human Medicine"]    [Text] Paris--Thanks to new animal-genetics techniques,  researchers are about to manufacture mutant rabbits and pigs  capable of producing molecules that will cure human diseases, or  whose organs can be transplanted in man.    The key to this research is transgenesis, a leading-edge  technique used by INRA [National Institute for Agronomic  Research] researchers for some 12 years to transfer genes from  one species to another. One of the principal objectives of gene  transfer is to cause mutant animals to produce some valuable  molecules that will cure human diseases such as AIDS,  arteriosclerosis, or the lack of red blood cells, or to be able  to transplant animal organs in man.    Thus, in recent months the INRA researchers have managed to  implant some human genes into rabbits by micro-injections, so  that the rabbits' milk will produce factor 8 which is used to  treat hemophiliacs, Louis-Marie Houdebine, a specialist working  at the Jouy-en-Josas INRA, explained.    It is precisely to get this molecule, which is present in  human blood and very hard to manufacture artificially, that  hemophiliacs were getting human blood transfusions, and were  occasionally contaminated with the AIDS virus. Another  application about to be achieved is to have rabbit's milk  manufacture the hormone that causes red blood cell to multiply.    To the great excitement of the international scientific  community, three months ago the Strasbourg INRA, in  collaboration with the pharmaceutical division of the  Rhone-Poulenc group, managed to create rabbits resistant to  arteriosclerosis by implanting in them the human genes that  confer resistance to the disease.    The INRA is also researching the implantation of certain  human genes on pigs, in order to make the pigs' organs "human"  enough to be transplanted in man without being rejected; the  organs include the heart, liver, kidneys, and some  insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. This research is in the  in-vitro stage, but the concept is working, Mr. Houdebine  emphasized.    Researchers also managed to implant the AIDS receptor gene  (CD4) into rabbits, thus creating rabbits that can be infected  by the human AIDS virus. This type of application is of course  precious for medical research.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Eli Lilly to settle FTC charges over Dollars 4bn deal The US Federal Trade Commission said Eli Lilly had agreed to settle charges that its Dollars 4bn acquisition of McKesson and its prescription management business, PCS Health Systems, would substantially lessen competition in the pharmaceuticals industry, potentially causing higher prices and reduced quality, AP-DJ reports from Washington. The settlement would require Lilly to ensure that its drugs were not given unwarranted preference over competitors in connection with the pharmacy-benefit management services Lilly will provide as a result of the acquisition. Lilly also agreed to build a 'fire wall' between its pharmaceutical sales business and PCS's pharmacy benefits management business to ensure that any Lilly division does not gain access to sensitive information about competitors' drugs from another division, the FTC said. The FTC said the proposed consent agreement would require Lilly to ensure that PCS maintains an 'open formulary' - one that includes any drug approved by a 'pharmacy and therapeutics committee'. The settlement would require Lilly to appoint an independent committee of healthcare professionals, most of whom not affiliated with PCS or Lilly, to evaluate drugs for inclusion in the PCS open formulary. The proposed settlement prohibits PCS and Lilly from sharing proprietary or other non-public information - such as price data - from competitors whose drugs are eligible for the PCS formulary. It also requires Lilly over the next five years to obtain FTC approval before acquiring an interest in any firm providing formulary services to more than 2m people in the US. The requirement also applies to any distribution pact between Lilly and McKesson, and/or any other wholesaler distributing Lilly products.</p>

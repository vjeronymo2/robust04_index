			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Bosnian map 'disappoints' mediators LORD Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, international mediators, yesterday put their compromise map on the table, expressing 'disappointment' that Serb and Croat leaders had not given more land to Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic, their Moslem foe. The leaders of the three warring parties will now return to their capitals to consider the map before the deadline of August 20. Mr Izetbegovic indicated that he may reject the map for rewarding military gain by the Serbs. Lord Owen, the EC envoy, said the proposed map did not represent an 'ideal solution', but was the best deal he could salvage for Bosnia's Moslems, who comprised 44 per cent of the republic's pre-war population of 4.35m. The division gives Moslems 30 per cent, Serbs control 52 plus, and Croats 17 per cent. The district of Sarajevo will be made a virtual UN protectorate for a period of up to two years while Mostar, the regional capital of Hercegovina, was proposed to be placed under EC governance. Mr Izetbegovic will be disappointed by the results of the eastern Bosnian enclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa, two of the six UN-proclaimed 'safe areas', which are joined to Gorazde, another safe area, by a Moslem-controlled road but remain cut off from the Bosnian republic. The map meets leaves Mr Izetbegovic a land-locked republic, only giving Bosnia access to the northern River Sava at Brcko.</p>

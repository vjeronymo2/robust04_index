			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbean sugar producers seek compensation Caribbean sugar producers are seeking compensation from the European Union for losses which they say they will incur because of a European Commission proposal that the EU's existing sugar regime be extended for two years to June, 1995. The Sugar Association of the Caribbean, a producers' lobby, said this week that the region's exports, and those of others in the African, Caribbean and Pacific group, which has a trade treaty with the EU, would be 'damaged' by the two-year postponement of the sugar marketing protocol. Producers should be compensated through the sugar protocol, in the way that EU's beet sugar producers are compensated for declines in their income, the association said. ACP producers have a guaranteed market for 1.3m tonnes (raw value) per year, with their earnings linked to the intervention price paid by the EU to its domestic sugar producers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At the invitation of the Armed Forces, and in  cooperation with the Information Ministry, a media team  comprising representatives of the local media and newspapers  yesterday started a two-day tour of the armistice line with  Israel. The tour aims at briefing the media on the Israeli  encroachments on Jordanian territory and waters in various areas  along the armistice line, from al-Yarmuk River in the north to  the Gulf of Aqaba in the south.    Our correspondent Jawad al-'Umari was part of the media team  and will present us with the following report:    [Begin recording] [Al-'Umari] The media team set out  yesterday from the Information Ministry to Ghawr al-Safi area,  via al-Karak. In the Jordan Valley area, the team visited a  Jordanian Armed Forces unit and was briefed by the head of the  Operations Branch on the duties of the units and formations of  the Southern Military Region, which extends from the southern  part of the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba, and the projects  executed by the Armed Forces in these areas, including schools,  earth dams, and population surveys. The team was also briefed  by the unit commander on the duties and tasks of his unit.    Throughout yesterday and last night, the media team visited  a  number of points opposite the occupied Jordanian lands and the  waters that are being encroached upon in the Dead Sea and in  water basins. They saw from a distance the position of the  Jordanian borders before the repeated Israeli attacks, which  started in 1952.    The media team stopped at the southern part of the Dead Sea,  Ghawr Sifa, and al-Salmani Police Post area, to the west of  which the major Israeli encroachment on Jordanian territory  starts and extends south, for various distances, to the Gulf of  Aqaba. The team also stopped at 'Ayn Hasab area, where the  Israeli encroachments reach their maximum, up to 8 km inside the  Jordanian territory. Israel utilized that area for agriculture.  It also utilized the ground water reservoir by drilling  artesian wells to irrigate crops.    The team also saw the Wadi al-Ghuwayb area, a tributary to  the Wadi al-'Arabah resources and the 'Ayn Daha area, where the  Israeli encroachment reaches between 5 to 6 km. Waters and  lands in the area were also utilized for agriculture by Israel.    The team also visited al-Rishah area, the point of water  distribution, that is, the highest point in Wadi al-'Arabah.  Waters flow from that point to the Dead Sea in the north and to  the Red Sea in the south.    In the Gharandal area, the media team visited a Southern  Military Region unit. The unit commander gave a briefing on the  area's nature and the battles that occurred there throughout  history, as well as the battles fought by the Jordanian Armed  Forces in defense of Palestine and Jordanian territory. The  team also saw the remnants of some of the battles fought by the  Armed Forces and the airfield in the area which was used by the  British mandate forces during World War I.    The media team then left for the Gulf of Aqaba via the Qa'at  Tabah area, which was proposed by Israel as the venue for  negotiations on border demarcation. The media team was briefed  by the commander of al-'Aqabah Military Region on the border  dispute in that area and Israeli encroachments on Jordanian  lands and waters, as specified by the Mandate Document in 1928.    During the tour, Brigadier General Mansur Abu-Rashid, head  of  the joint Jordanian truce committee, gave a detailed explanation  of the Israeli encroachments inside Jordanian territory. Brig.  Gen. Abu-Rashid spoke to our radio at the Gulf of Aqaba area:    [Brig. Gen Abu-Rashid] The encroachments start in the area  south of the Dead Sea, al-Safi, and Sifa areas. These  encroachments extended to the southern area. In Gharandal area  there were encroachments. Let me say that along the borders  down to the Red Sea, there were encroachments. Sometimes these  encroachments are deep, and, at others there are encroachments  inside only a few hundreds of meters from the international  borders defined by the British Mandate Document, which  stipulates that the middle of Wadi al-'Arabah is the  international borderline between Palestine and Jordan in the  mandate era.    [Al-'Umari] Dr. Mundhir Haddadin, member of the Jordanian  delegation to the peace talks, head of the Jordanian team to the  waters working group in the multilateral conference, and member  of the tripartite economic committee, accompanied the media team  on this tour. Dr. Haddadin spoke to our radio on the  negotiating situation of Jordanian territory within the context  of the Jordanian-Israeli track and the projects planned to be  executed to develop the Jordan Valley region after reaching a  just, lasting, and comprehensive peace. Dr. Haddadin said:    [Haddadin] Jordanian territory occupied by Israel in the  southern area is about 360 square km in area. In the fifth  clause of the joint agenda, which we reached with Israel in  September 1993, the two parties agreed that borders between  Israel and Jordan should be delineated on the basis of the  borders stipulated by the document of British mandate over  Palestine and Trans-Jordan in the early 1920's.

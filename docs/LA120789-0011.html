			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRAGUE'S REVOLUTIONARIES FIND A HOME;  </P> <P> CZECHOSLOVAKIA: CIVIC FORUM TAKES OVER A BUILDING THAT HAD HOUSED THE SOVIET  FRIENDSHIP SOCIETY.  </P> <P> Civic Forum activist Jaroslav Koran's eyes sparkled as he stood in Wenceslas  Square and admired "his" building. He described the way he sees it in his  imagination.  </P> <P> Near the second-floor windows is a big television screen with a loudspeaker  broadcasting history in the making. From a balcony above, Civic Forum leaders  are addressing the crowd, and they can be seen half a mile away.  </P> <P> Koran envisions a simple sign on the building: "Just two letters, 'O' and 'F' "  -- Civic Forum's initials in Czechoslovak.  </P> <P> "I wanted this building," he said. "I decided on it, and I got it. I think it's  the best building we could get."  </P> <P> Thanks to Koran, the organization that has led the "polite revolution" moved  Tuesday from borrowed quarters in the basement of a downtown theater into what  had been the offices of the Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship Society.  </P> <P> It was an often-chaotic scene, with students lugging stacks of newspapers and  society membership certificates out of the building as volunteers moved  partitions and furniture in.  </P> <P> "I feel they need me," a young woman munching a sandwich said as she tried to  direct traffic. "And it's so exciting!"  </P> <P> Rita Klimova, the former wife of a former Communist Party official who now acts  as official English-language interpreter at Civic Forum press conferences,  said: "We're hassling over who gets what room. We made up a beautiful  organization chart, but the rooms don't seem to be built that way."  </P> <P> Koran said the building on Wenceslas Square -- "a kind of showcase for the  whole Civic Forum" -- is the first of two the city is turning over to the  mushrooming democratic movement.  </P> <P> It will get another in January, he said, and this one, in a quiet neighborhood  near the British Embassy, "will be the place for the brain trust of Civic  Forum, probably a place to deal with some foreign visitors as well."  </P> <P> The six-story building on Wenceslas Square has about 50 offices, and the other  building is about the same size, Koran said. And there may be a third for a  press center.  </P> <P> Tuesday's move was a symbolic watershed, the day this loose collection of  armchair revolutionaries took on the trappings of permanence.  </P> <P> "Everybody is working for free so far," Klimova said. "All we've gotten is free  sandwiches. Within the next few days we hope to establish a clearer situation:  Who gets paid and how much, or if it's necessary to pay."  </P> <P> Koran exemplifies the way Civic Forum has been run. He was chosen to negotiate  with city officials for property not because of any special expertise -- he  translates books for a living -- but because there was a job that needed doing  and he was free at the moment.  </P> <P> One of his previous tasks was negotiating the return to Czechoslovakia of  Jaroslav Hutka, the exiled singer and songwriter. Next, Koran said, he may be a  delegate to a meeting with the premier of the Czechoslovak republic.  </P> <P> In the course of the 50 hours of negotiations over a building for the movement,  Koran needed to retrieve some information from a Civic Forum computer, but he  was not familiar with the process. A volunteer came to his aid.  </P> <P> "Are you Koran the translator," he asked?  </P> <P> "Yes," Koran replied, "and what's your profession?"  </P> <P> "I'm a janitor."  </P> <P> Koran said the negotiations were complicated by Civic Forum's pressing need to  leave the theater, where rehearsals for a new production are about to begin.  </P> <P> Koran skirted questions about how he managed to get the offices of the  Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship Society, which is reputed to be the haven of  some of this country's most conservative and dogmatic Communist Party members.  </P></p>

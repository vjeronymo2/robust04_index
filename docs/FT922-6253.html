			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / MPs press Bank chief over Maxwell pensions THE all-party group of MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners is likely to seek a meeting with Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, when it meets next week. The prospect of further pressure on the Bank comes as the government faces renewed calls to compensate thousands of elderly pensioners who belong to collapsed pension schemes of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's companies. The 100-plus MPs are unhappy about the Bank's apparently relaxed view of its supervisory role and believe that recent comments by Mr Leigh-Pemberton have been unhelpful. These complaints were raised last week by Mr Richard Page and Mr Frank Field, representing the group, with Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, who 'willingly' undertook to pass them on to the Bank. The group has no powers to compel attendance, as cross-party select committees do, but the large number of MPs, including at least one minister, who are taking an active interest in the issue mean that Mr Leigh-Pemberton would come under considerable pressure to explain the Bank's approach to the group. Ministers are said to be pressing the pension-fund industry to devise a scheme which could compensate the Maxwell pensioners. Some of the MPs campaigning on behalf of the pensioners also believe that an industry scheme offers the best way forward. The government is unwilling to bear the cost of replacing the Pounds 400m said to be missing from the Maxwell schemes, fearing that it could set a precedent. Ministers have repeatedly ruled out the idea of a government compensation scheme. However, campaigners have been encouraged by what they believe is a more positive approach from the government, which may be more sympathetic because of a report from the Securities and Investments Board to be published soon. The report may point to failings by Imro, the regulatory body for the fund-management industry, in supervising and authorising Bishopsgate Investment Management, which managed assets of all the Maxwell companies' pension schemes. The pensioners believe that they are entitled to government compensation because, they say, government departments mishandled the supervision of Bishopsgate. The National Association of Pension Funds is considering an industry-funded scheme but opinion is divided. Mr Brian McMahon, association chairman, said that letters to him show little support for a compensation scheme.</p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH FILE: SMELLING TROUBLE AFTER RADIATION TREATMENTS  </P> <P> Question: The husband of a friend of mine had radiation treatments, and now my  friend says that things don't smell the same to him any more. Could this have  been caused by the treatments, or is it just a coincidence? Does this usually  happen in such cases?  </P> <P> Answer: The use of radiation in cancers of the head and neck has been reported  to affect the sense of smell. Many patients experience some improvement a few  months after treatment, but some residual impairment is often the rule.  </P> <P> Q: Two of my friends have had to have hysterectomies, and their reactions to it  have been as different as night and day. One of them is acting as if the world  has come to an end, while the other one has told me that she looks on it as if  she had to have a tooth extracted. How can you account for this difference in  attitude?  </P> <P> A: A number of factors may help determine a woman's reaction to the need for a  hysterectomy. For example, a 25-year-old childless woman may be more concerned  about having a hysterectomy than a 55-year-old mother. The reason for the  procedure and any complications associated with it may also influence the  woman's attitude and reaction.  </P> <P> Cultural factors also appear to play a role. The results of various studies  have shown that women from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds show  different degrees of anxiety and depression both before and after surgery. In  addition, women who were better educated appeared to tolerate the procedure  better than did less well educated women.  </P></p>

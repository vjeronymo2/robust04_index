			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SATURN, A SMALL CAR WITH A BIG MISSION, HITS THE ROAD  </P> <P> By its own admission, General Motors Corp. has only one more chance to prove  that it can design and build a small car that can compete credibly with the  Japanese.  </P> <P> On Thursday, the first shipments of Saturns, the small car carrying those big  hopes for GM, left a sprawling new assembly plant here en route to dealers in  California and elsewhere.  </P> <P> Saturn is GM's first new auto division since Chevrolet in 1918. Three versions  of the car, a hybrid subcompact-compact with a starting price of $7,995, were  displayed by workers who snatched away the vehicles' covers while their  colleagues and state and local dignitaries cheered wildly. The cars were then  driven to waiting tractor trailers.  </P> <P> "Ship those cars to California. That's what we're here for," a Saturn executive  ordered, referring to the most critical market for the vehicle.  </P> <P> Notably absent from the ceremonies were executives from GM headquarters in  Detroit, who deferred to officers of the subsidiary -- Saturn Corp. -- which  the company created five years ago to design the new car from scratch. The  public distance GM has maintained from the $3.5-billion project illustrates the  marketplace burden that GM's name has become among buyers of imported cars.  </P> <P> The Saturn leadership itself is a departure from the norm. In what the Saturn  "team members" describe as a full-blown system of consensus decision-making,  the venture is jointly managed by Saturn President Richard G. (Skip) LeFauve  and a United Auto Workers officer, Richard Hoalcraft, who introduced themselves  Thursday as "the Skip and Dick show," to the delight of 2,800 union members  looking on.  </P> <P> Whether Saturn can rise above its own cosmic hype, not to mention the  formidable competition of about 30 established high-quality small cars, remains  to be seen. Also, the car is being launched in an apparent recession  accompanied by sharply rising gasoline prices, not the climate a car maker  would choose.  </P> <P> The importance of the venture goes beyond GM's own fortunes. It is also seen as  a test of America's ability to rebound from the beating its manufacturing  sector has taken at the hand of foreign competition.  </P> <P> The Saturn officially goes on sale on Oct. 25 to a fledgling group of 30  blue-chip dealers who invested up to $5 million apiece for the privilege of  selling nothing but Saturns, although most have separate import franchises.  Eight of these early dealers are in California, including five in the  Southland. The number of outlets is to reach 130 by spring, building to 800.  </P> <P> Russell Hand, a Toyota, Honda and Ford dealer who will shortly have Saturn  dealerships in Torrance and near Los Angeles International Airport, describes  interest in the car since an advertising campaign for it began as  "extraordinary."  </P> <P> Seventy callers to a Saturn toll-free number listed obscurely in print ads were  referred to him in the last 24 hours alone, he said Thursday. Saturn says  14,000 such calls were received nationally in the last five weeks.  </P> <P> Shortages seem inevitable as the assembly plant increases production more  slowly than expected. The company will not say how many cars it is building,  but dealers and workers say that UAW members have more than once halted early  production out of concern for quality. Donald Hudler, Saturn's marketing vice  president, concedes that there will be "fewer cars than we would like to have"  by Oct. 25. He indicated that dealers, whom Saturn prefers to call retailers,  would have 30 to 35 cars apiece.  </P> <P> In the past, some car dealers faced with heavy demand have charged whatever the  market would bear, angering customers expecting to pay no more than the posted  prices. In Saturn's case, executives concede, the practice would send the wrong  signal from a venture that bills itself in its ads as "a different kind of car  company." Hand said: "If a black market doesn't develop, my inclination is to  sell at the sticker price."  </P> <P> The car itself -- a four-door sedan and two-door coupe, to be followed in the  next couple of years by a station wagon, convertible and other versions -- has  generally received good reviews. Test drives suggest that it is above what are  perceived to be Detroit's standards.  </P> <P> "For a first effort, they've done a good job," said Chris Cedergren, analyst at  J. D. Power &amp; Associates, the Agoura Hills, Calif., consulting firm whose  auto quality surveys have for years documented the inferior quality of domestic  cars and, more recently, Detroit's improvements. Some enthusiasts' magazines  have described Saturn as generally comparable to the better Japanese cars.  </P> <P> In concept, the Saturn venture bears little resemblance to the long trail of  wreckage that represents GM's previous small-car efforts: the Corvairs, Vegas,  Citations and sister cars whose notorious problems helped opened the door for  Japan's little-known auto makers to triumph in this country in the 1970s.  </P> <P> GM began working on the project eight years ago, envisioning it from the start  as a clean-sheet approach. The project was staffed with volunteers attracted to  the idea of cutting through some 80 years' worth of corporate insularity,  acrimonious labor relations and other ills that have made the domestic auto  industry vulnerable to foreign competition.  </P> <P> The creation of a separate subsidiary, LeFauve said, gave GM, the union and a  few key dealers the legal freedom to write a new labor agreement and overhaul  the retail distribution system, thus attacking two of the industry's most  intractable problems.  </P> <P> Saturn then chose the Tennessee hills, after a nationwide bidding war by  hundreds of communities, for a massive manufacturing complex that not only  assembles the car but casts its aluminum engine blocks and cylinder heads and  builds its engine and transmission. This gave Saturn ground-up control over the  heart of the car.  </P> <P> The car shares just 2% of its parts with other GM divisions, chief engineer Jay  Wetzel said. Everything else was designed exclusively for Saturn, although  various GM component manufacturing units supply about 70% of the car.  </P> <P> The size and cost of the project were cut sharply from the $5 billion and  500,000 cars a year first envisioned by recently retired GM Chairman Roger B.  Smith, who came up with the Saturn idea. But it is still a massive undertaking,  and its scope -- when GM already had more plants and less money than it needed  -- continues to raise doubts in and out of GM.  </P> <P> Some saw it as an indulgence of Smith that drained money from elsewhere in the  corporation. The reported delays in certain GM new car projects for the early  1990s, said analyst Daniel Luria of the Industrial Technology Institute in Ann  Arbor, Mich., is GM's way of "making room" for Saturn in the market at the  expense of other GM divisions.  </P> <P> "There was a lot of resentment at first, especially at Chevy and Pontiac," said  a mid-level Saturn executive. "But I think that's subsiding."  </P> <P> Analyst Maryann Keller, in a 1989 book called "Rude Awakening," which some  company executives privately recommend as a good primer on GM, said progress in  quality and labor relations elsewhere in GM -- notably at "Buick City" and a  joint venture plant with Toyota in Fremont, Calif. -- made Saturn "almost  redundant."  </P> <P> But to LeFauve, a career GM engineer, that sounds more like a compliment to GM  than a complaint. He said Saturn stands apart from the myriad of joint ventures  with Japanese firms that GM and the other U.S. auto firms have entered in to,  using Japanese designs and components. Saturn is home-grown.  </P> <P> "Here's GM out there laying itself on the line and getting beat up for it," he  said. "It's hard for me to see why. I think GM deserves a hell of a lot of  credit. Saturn is an absolute statement by GM that we think there's need for  change."  </P> <P> The Saturn is aimed at such premier small cars as the subcompact Toyota Corolla  and Honda Civic, although in size it straddles the compact and subcompact  markets. Those categories of cars account for 4 million sales a year. Saturn  hopes to be building 240,000 cars annually within a year, which would put it in  the same sales league as Civic and Corolla and make it one of the top 15  selling cars overall.  </P> <P> But the big question is whether those sales are made to current import  customers or are simply stolen from other domestic auto companies and, worst of  all, from GM itself. Although some "cannibalization" from Chevrolet, Pontiac  and other GM divisions is expected, Hudler said the new car won't be considered  a success unless 80% of its sales ultimately come from non-GM customers.  </P> <P> Such inroads are vital to GM, whose future has been slipping away as first-time  car buyers opt for other makes. It is bad enough that the company's share of  total U.S. sales has tumbled from 45% to 35% in recent years, but, among those  under 45 years of age, GM has dropped to a paltry 25% of sales.  </P> <P> Even GM's small cars have old owners. The average buyer of a Chevrolet  Cavalier, which outsells the Civic and Corolla, is over 50, a Saturn marketing  executive noted. Saturn aims at those aged 25 to 45, 60% of whom have gone to  college, who make $5,000 to $15,000 more a year than buyers of domestic cars.  </P> <P> Saturn alone is unlikely to dramatically change that picture, nor is it likely  to cause sales problems for the Civic and Corolla, market analysts say. More  likely, sales will come from what one dealer called the "marginal" imports,  such as Isuzu, Subaru, Hyundai, among others, as well as domestic makes.  </P> <P> A case can be made that the actual sales results of Saturn are less important  than the deep changes that this project is trying to make in the GM system.  </P> <P> The attempt to create a partnership across Saturn goes beyond the work force to  its dealers, who helped create a unique distribution system that gives them  large exclusive territories and lets them add their own sales outlets within  their market areas as demand warrants. Typically, auto makers add nearby  competing franchises when there are sales to justify it.  </P> <P> "It's a whole new world," said Mike Smith, vice president and general manager  of a Saturn agency in Santa Ana run by megadealer John Campbell III of Irvine,  whose GM, Nissan, Ford, Mazda and Porsche franchises generate sales of more  than $150 million a year. "Everything Saturn does is different."  </P> <P> Dealer Hand said that the market-area plan was one of two factors that  persuaded him to invest $5 million. The other, he said, "was when I realized  just how serious the UAW was about producing quality cars."  </P> <P> "I never knew a UAW guy before. Now, I'm on a first-name basis with several of  them. I've been involved at a level in Saturn I never dreamed of. I mean, I sit  there and approve the ads with Hudler and a UAW guy. Who'd have thought it?"  </P> <P> The prospect of spreading such fundamental changes throughout GM has led to  speculation that the auto maker is prepared to lose money on Saturn almost  indefinitely, a notion that was fueled by the car's unexpectedly low prices.  The $7,995 bottom price for a relatively well-equipped version of Saturn won a  standing ovation from dealers when it was announced last week.  </P> <P> When asked about profits on the car, analyst Cedergren said, "Who cares? We've  been criticizing the Big Three for years for being short-term oriented. If 80%  of Saturn's sales are new to GM, I don't care if it loses money for 30 years,  it's a success."  </P> <P> Saturn's executives guffaw at such talk but won't say when the subsidiary hopes  to go in the black.  </P> <P> "As soon as we can get there without screwing everything up," Hudler said.  </P></p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Chairman retires with BTP ahead at Pounds 18.1m BTP, the speciality chemicals group, reported a 39 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 13m to Pounds 18.1m as it announced the retirement of chairman Mr Frank Buckley after 27 years with the company. Mr Buckley steps down at a time when the group is riding high following last year's Pounds 107m acquisition of most of MTM's assets. On the back of the deal BTP's earnings per share rose from 7.04p to 9p in the six months to September 30, on turnover 23 per cent higher at Pounds 161m, compared with Pounds 131m last time. Mr Stephen Hannam, who moves up from managing director to chief executive, said there was more to come. 'What we got was a fantastic set of assets which will be the base for organic growth for many years,' he said. Along with other speciality chemicals companies BTP has seen a sharp increase in raw material costs over the last few months. But Mr Hannam said it would be pushing through price rises ranging from '5 per cent to well into double figures' next month and was confident that it would pas on all its increased costs by the end of the financial year. Demand in most of BTP's main markets is improving. Its adhesives and textile coatings division, which was hardest hit by the recession, saw operating profits recover to Pounds 3.43m (Pounds 2.79m) while performance chemicals rose to Pounds 4.23m (Pounds 3.29m). Boosted by the MTM deal, biocides and fine chemicals jumped to Pounds 8.62m (Pounds 4.43m), while the industrial division held at Pounds 3.34m (Pounds 3.41m) after last year's strong growth. The dividend rises 8.7 per cent from 3.45p to 3.75p. The shares firmed 1p to 283p, valuing the company at Pounds 382m. When Mr Buckley, now 66, joined what was then British Tar Products in 1967 it was valued at just Pounds 137,000. Mr Buckley became chairman and chief executive in 1978 and dropped the chief executive role only last year. He will receive Pounds 393,000 for the rest of his two-year rolling contract and has been invited to become honorary president. The new non-executive chairman is Mr John Ketteley, 55, who has been non-executive deputy chairman since 1979.</p>

In his view, Russia forced  Shevardnadze to change his Western orientation.    According to Chanturia, there is a big difference between  Eduard Shevardnadze as he was at the time of the expulsion of  Zviad Gamsakhurdia and now as head of state. The head of state  is conducting non-Georgian policies today. If anyone should  fear the return of Gamsakhurdia, it is his family. However, the  return of the ex-president would have been preferable to the  partial destruction of his supporters and to Samegrelo's  [Mingrelia] abandonment as a zone under virtual Russian  occupation as, in these conditions, everything would have been  given its proper name. In our case, Western countries gave a  very negative assessment of the use of Russian troops against  Zviad Gamsakhurdia's supporters in western Georgia. As a result  of this decision, Shevardnadze has permanently distanced himself  from the West.    Giorgi Chanturia believes that Interior Minister Igor  Giorgadze has been sent to Georgia by the Russian special  services in order to neutralize the head of state himself.    In the view of the NDP leader, the NDP is the only real  force  in Georgia today that supports Georgian statehood. Chanturia  did not participate in the 11 October elections as he did not  consider it was necessary at that time to become head of state.  However, he now fears that, in spite of his reluctance, he will  have to participate in the elections that are expected to be  held in the spring. In the event of his victory, Giorgi  Chanturia has promised us that he will establish order in one  month but he does not know how to deal with the economy.    So, the National-Democrats have finally distanced themselves  from the former [Soviet] foreign minister whom they brought to  Georgia. It is interesting to know who will follow their example  next year.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (27): Divided we still stand - The obstacles to a single law for companies THE European Company Statute (ECS) is nearly a quarter of a century old, but it has not yet been born. The proposal, dreamed up by the European Commission in 1970, was supposed to provide a single corporate structure for multinationals in the EC. Instead of having to find their way around different national systems and set up a network of PLCs, SAs, NVs, AGs and SpAs, multinationals would be able to establish a single SE - 'Societas Europaea' - under Community law. Lawyers' fees would be slashed, administrative nightmares banished and large European companies could get on with making money. But what seemed a smart idea - or just plain common sense - has repeatedly stumbled on the very national differences it hoped to eliminate. Twice revived since 1970, ECS was even added to the fast-track single market programme only to suffer the indignity of being overtaken by newly-minted directives in other fields. As 1993 begins, and despite member states' efforts over the past 18 months, the ECS is still under negotiation. The ECS would be voluntary, but the principal obstacle to agreement has been the proposal's detailed requirements for employee participation in the management of SEs. Britain is particularly opposed to such obligations, while Germany, which already has strong rules on worker participation, is in favour. 'In theory, people are interested in the idea of incorporating as a European company and that's an attractive prospect,' comments one British official. 'But when they see what's on the table they are less impressed.' At the most recent ministerial discussion of the ECS - under British chairmanship last November - it was agreed that any company seeking to register would have initial subscribed capital of Ecu120,000, and would conform to the definition of public limited companies in the member state of registration. But the ministers made no headway on the question of worker participation and will have to return to the ECS during the next six months, under the Danish presidency. Yet the plight of the European Company Statute is as nothing compared to the fate of its company law siblings in the original 1985 single market programme. Indeed, this is the principal area where the ambitions of Lord Cockfield, then internal market commissioner, have not been realised. Early on, member states adopted measures which allow loose collaboration between companies, under the clumsy-sounding title of a European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG). This initiative has enjoyed a modicum of success since it came into force in July 1989 - some 350 EEIGs have been created - but, as the Commission itself makes clear, 'it is an instrument for economic co-operation, not for integration'. Member states have also adopted measures on disclosure requirements for company branches set up in another Community country, a directive enabling sole individuals to operate as a private limited company, and amendments to earlier directives on the content, auditing and publication of accounts. But there has been stalemate in the principal areas for harmonisation of company law: Fifth company law directive. This is a measure which goes back nearly as far as the ECS, and covers roughly the same ground. The difference is that it would establish a compulsory European statute for virtually all public limited companies. As a result, it has been attacked by the same member states which oppose the ECS. For months it has been regarded as a 'low priority', even by Brussels, which has chosen to concentrate on the ECS; Tenth directive on cross-border mergers. Another low priority for the Commission, this measure has also fallen foul of British objections to worker participation because it allows member states to prevent cross-border exchanges of shares if employees are deprived of rights of representation as a result of the deal. Thirteenth directive on takeover bids. This directive is backed, among others, by liberal economists, who believe there will be no genuine free movement of capital in the Community until corporate predators can hunt across borders following a single EC takeover code. But its potentially far-reaching proposals for a single threshold - above which bids would have to be launched - and harmonised rules on the content and publication of offer documents may never see the light of day. At the Edinburgh summit last month, EC leaders agreed that the controversial measure went into 'excessive detail'. If it survives at all, the takeover directive will be replaced by a list of 'general principles' which would then be fleshed out by individual member states. But in Brussels and beyond, there are few tears being shed about the apparent failure of the single market company law programme. The main reason for this is that neither Commission nor member states any longer regard the measures as essential to the operation of the single market. For one thing, much of the nitty-gritty of EC corporate law had already been adopted by the time the single market programme was launched. The series of unnamed company law directives are numbered one to 13. Some of those measures have sunk without trace, but others have been operating since the 1970s. The first company law directive - which lays out harmonised publication requirements for the incorporation and winding-up of companies - was adopted as early as 1968. In addition, other single market measures, aimed, for example, at eliminating double taxation for companies with subsidiaries in other EC countries, have helped ease the burden for genuinely European corporations. More importantly, much of the corporate restructuring and economic boom predicted by advocates of the single market has already happened - largely without the aid of a harmonised European company law and well ahead of the 1993 deadline. As a recent upbeat Commission assessment of the programme points out, mergers and acquisitions involving companies from different EC countries increased threefold between 1984 and 1989 - while the value of such deals rose by 700 per cent. 'All the available evidence points to one inescapable conclusion - EC business has moved swiftly to make the most of these new possibilities,' says the report. There is a third reason why proposals to harmonise company law now appear to be merely the icing on the single market cake, and therefore dispensable: the current recession has taken the edge off corporate deal-makers' appetites, reducing the pressure for a single European company statute, or a single takeover code. But assuming that recession lifts and the single market takes off, the ECS may yet get the chance to prove its worth.</p>

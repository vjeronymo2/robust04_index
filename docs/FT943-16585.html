			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Sport: Downside of the hero's return I suppose I should have been sorry that Nigel Mansell left the French Grand Prix with only two thirds of it completed. But there was, to me, something unseemly in the atmosphere permeating in the build up to yesterday's race. I know there is no reason why Nigel Mansell should not have taken a day out from IndyCar racing, in order to drive the Williams-Renault car. Nobody can blame the team for wanting to borrow so good a driver, or for Mansell for wanting to make such a well choreographed appearance, or the motor racing fans for wanting one of their familiar heroes to return to their sport's depleted stage. But did nobody feel just a little uneasy with the whole episode? Those lovers of the sport who were following events with such fascination - were they the same people who, nine weeks earlier, had mourned so assiduously the man whose place Mansell was now filling? Of course the Williams team could not let the loss of Ayrton Senna bring its season to an end. It had a business to run, one which deals, however reluctantly, in death. By giving Senna's place to Damon Hill and bringing in a young unknown, David Coulthard, to drive the number two car, Williams handled the tragedy in the most decent way possible. Yet the temptation to lure a big name to the team was very strong (stronger according to press reports, for Renault than for Williams); and I shall hate to sound as if I believe myself to have finer feelings than those who orchestrated so popular a manoeuvre. But yesterday's Grand Prix produced the sense that Senna's death, had, however obscurely, led to an event which was a cause for celebration. Necessity decreed that the empty place on the Williams team must be filled. Yet should it have been filled with so much publicity, so great an eagerness to forget motor racing's terrible recent past? Perhaps it is hypocritical to say that it should not. But the tone in which the race was previewed felt strange to me; and doubly strange for the fact that all this excitement had been disseminated by Nigel Mansell. When Mansell was a fixture in Formula One, who, apart from his army of flag-waving fans, would have believed that he could ever have commanded such a reaction? Who, apart from those same fans, would have thought that this graceless figure would, one day, be regarded as the natural replacement for the aristocratic Senna? By leaving Formula One, Mansell finally achieved what he had never been able to do when he was part of it: he made it want him. When he was on the Grand Prix circuit, he maintained an air of being hard done by which was hugely irritating in a multi-millionaire. Yet there was a genuine sense of being under-appreciated, which was proved to have some foundation when Mansell was virtually forced to make way for Alain Prost on the Williams team, despite the fact that he had just won the world championship. This incident - the truth of which has never come out - finally compelled Mansell to do what he had threatened to do several times before: retire from Formula One. Nobody believed that he would do it, thinking instead that this was another one of his uncharismatic shows of temperament. But he left, and he made a success in IndyCar racing, and ever since then Formula One has wanted him back. Why? One cannot help wondering. Even though Mansell's performance itself was a non-event, the build up to the French Grand Prix created an image of a conquering hero returning to his people. This image would certainly be re-created if Mansell decided to make appearances at subsequent races. Hype, of course, has helped; but it is not all hype. Formula One wanted Mansell back because it thought that he could help to salvage an almost ruined season. Strange as it may seem, this resolutely unprepossessing man is popular enough to do it. I have never heard anyone say a good word for Nigel Mansell; and yet people seem to like him. They criticise him for his demeanour, while, at the same time, almost admiring his refusal to be charming, or aspire towards the more gracious life that celebrity status can bring, or be anything other than a richer version of the man he has always been. It may be that, in some unconscious way, people connect these traits with Mansell's refusal to give up on a race. Ayrton Senna was equally obdurate but his determination had an other-worldly quality, which alienated people because they could not understand it. Mansell's is absolutely of this world; gritty, grubby, gutsy. It is the determination of the nobody who will not be done down by the somebodys. People see themselves - or part of themselves - in this. And they responded when Mansell made his comeback. They know that he doesn't need the money and that Dollars 1m is far too much for a few days of unsuccessful work. But they sensed that he wanted to prove a point; that he wanted Formula One to want him. They know that he will want to go on proving points all his life, whatever the cost might be. The exotic, mysterious Ayrton Senna had little in common with the dour, unglamorous Nigel Mansell. But Senna, too, dared all whatever the cost, and for this reason it is not, after all, so inappropriate that Mansell should have been driving in his place yesterday. Perhaps Senna would have seen the fitness of it, behind all the misplaced celebrations. To me he was the dominant figure at the French Grand Prix, his sombre brown stare gazing at the events he had set in motion and at Michael Schumacher, the smiling young man that neither he nor Mansell could catch.</p>

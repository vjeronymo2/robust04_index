			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Currency Markets: Focus on US labour market statistics Foreign exchange markets this week will watch closely the release on Friday of February labour market data for an indicator of the likely course of US monetary policy. It was the tightening of policy earlier this month, after the release of the January labour data, which threw international financial markets into disarray, from which they have yet to emerge. The Humphrey-Hawkins testimony last week of Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Fed, signally failed to quell market fears about resurgent US inflation. Friday's data will offer a concrete basis to either confirm or confound market pessimism about US inflation prospects. The logical beneficiary of fears about higher US interest rates should be the dollar. Last week, though, the US currency was generally weaker as fears of a stronger yen dragged it down against other currencies. In Europe, attention will revert to Germany. Today the Bundesbank will announce the terms of its weekly repo, while the policy-making council meets on Thursday. Commentators believe the US may well have used the weekend meeting of G7 finance ministers in Frankfurt to urge the case for lower German interest rates. Although the Bundesbank cut its discount rate by 50 basis points at the last council meeting, it did not lower the repo rate - the main instrument for influencing money market rates. There is speculation that the central bank may this week announce a variable rate repo. This would indicate a willingness to see lower rates. These factors might be outweighed by the unresolved labour dispute in the engineering industry, and rumours that the January M3 number could be as high as 13 per cent. There are also indications that the Bundesbank is more concerned with steadying market expectations than outright monetary easing. Weakness last week in the bund market can only have encouraged further caution. In the UK attention will be focused on Wednesday's monthly monetary policy meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. Their last meeting resulted in a quarter-point cut in rates. Subsequent economic data has left a definite impression that the UK economic recovery is weaker than previously thought. Commentators also believe that an easing of monetary policy is likely ahead of the fiscal tightening in April when new tax increases come into effect.</p>

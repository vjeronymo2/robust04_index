			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / (CORRECTED) Italy's Corruption Scandal: Debt mountain still unclimbed amid turmoil Correction (published 18th March 1993) appended to this article. THE URGENT economic problems facing Italy are being shunted to one side as a result of the political turmoil. The greatest burden is the extremely high level of government debt. Italy's debt mountain currently accounts for around 107 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, and the government's deficit forecast of L155,000bn (Pounds 67.6bn) in 1993 is believed to be on the conservative side. Even if the referendum on electoral reform on April 18 paves the way for a more stable government, the reform process is likely to take several months. Meanwhile, hopes generated by the deficit reduction package agreed last autumn have faded, as the political storm clouds have cast doubt over its implementation. Italy is trapped in a vicious circle: its problem is not only the size of its debt, but the enormous burden of interest payments, due to high interest rates. Unlike the UK, Italy has not benefited from withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism by cutting interest rates because, without high interest rates, it will not be able to fund its government deficit. However, unless interest rates fall, servicing of the public debt will continue to eat up a large part of government revenues. 'If you took away the cost of servicing the debt mountain, Italy would actually be running a surplus,' said Mr Andrew Roberts, Italian bond analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. In 1990 10-year Italian government bonds yielded 4 percentage points more than German government bonds, the same margin as existed between the inflation rates of both economies, so real returns were comparable. Currently, 10-year Italian bonds are yielding 12.85 per cent gross, 6.3 percentage points more than comparable German bond yields, despite the fact that inflation in Germany and Italy is now running at the same rate. As a result of the political turmoil, Italian bonds have largely failed to benefit from the recent rally in European bond prices, even underperforming bond markets such as Spain, which is also suffering from economic problems. 'If interest rates were close to where they are in Germany, that would cut the total deficit of L160,000bn by about 50 per cent,' estimates Mr Steve Major, a bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities. 'A 1 per cent cut in interest rates is worth about L15,000bn a year, while 1 per cent economic growth is worth about L10,000bn.' Of course, while interest rates remain high, the prospects of economy recovery will also be depressed. Italy's debt financing costs have been increased further by the fall in its credit ratings from the top level of triple-A to double A by Standard &amp; Poor's and double-A 3 by Moody's, which is considering a further downgrade. Although these ratings apply only to the country's foreign currency debt, the impact of repeated downgradings has helped push up Italy's financing costs across the board. Even though the cost of foreign borrowing has increased, the Italian government is likely to continue to borrow in foreign currencies, with lower interest rates, when such financing is available. Most recently, Italy raised DM5bn (Pounds 2.1bn) in the Eurobond market. However, the appetite of international investors for Italian paper will remain limited during the political upheaval. Meanwhile, a recent Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.6bn) loan by the European Community provides little more than temporary respite. CORRECTION STANDARD &amp; Poor's has asked us to point out that it has never accorded a triple-A rating to Italy, as was implied in a report on March 16, 'Debt mountain still unclimbed amid turmoil'. It rated Italy double-A plus until March 2 1983, when the rating was lowered to double-A.</p>

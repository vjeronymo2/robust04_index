			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: First-term profit of Dollars 39m at Blockbuster BLOCKBUSTER, the Florida-based video rental chain, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 39.2m in the first quarter of 1993, compared with Dollars 25.7m in the same period of 1992. Revenues rose to Dollars 608.7m from Dollars 446.4m a year earlier, and earnings per share, on a fully-diluted basis, increased to 20 cents from 15 cents. Part of the increase came from Blockbuster's aggressive expansion - including a push into music retailing, in an effort to build a more broadly-based home entertainment group. However, same-store revenues advanced by 6.8 per cent, and the company gained share in the home video market. During the quarter, Blockbuster bought an interest of about 35 per cent in Republic Pictures, an independent producer and distributor of filmed entertainment with a library of feature films and TV movies. The company also recently acquired a significant interest in Spelling Entertainment Group. In January 1992, Blockbuster acquired the Cityvision group of the UK, which owns the Ritz video-rental chain.</p>

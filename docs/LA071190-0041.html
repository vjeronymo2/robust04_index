			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> DOW SLUMPS 23.27 IN LATE PROGRAM TRADING  </P> <P> Stock prices tumbled in the final hour of trading Tuesday as weakness in the  bond market and a lower dollar triggered a flurry of computer-driven sell  programs.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrial stocks fell 23.27 to 2,890.84.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by nearly two to one in nationwide  trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 529 up, 969 down and 498  unchanged. Big Board volume came to 147.63 million shares, up from 119.39  million Monday.  </P> <P> Michael Metz, market strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said the dollar's  steep drop against the Japanese yen and weak bond prices scared stock traders  by prompting concern that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten  monetary policy to boost the dollar.  </P> <P> Tighter policy would drive the cost of money higher, hurting businesses and, in  turn, stock and bond prices.  </P> <P> While the market treaded water most of the day, sell programs kicked in late in  the session. "We suddenly got whipped with a real heady amount of program  selling, and the market of course has been running quite thin," said Gene Jay  Seagle, analyst at Gruntal &amp; Co.  </P> <P> The sell programs accelerated profit taking that already was under way, said  Peter Vandenberg, a trader with Shearson Lehman Hutton.  </P> <P> Stock highlights:  </P> <P> * Pitney Bowes tumbled 6 3/8 to 43 1/2. The office machine company announced  that analysts' earnings expectations for the second quarter were too  optimistic.  </P> <P> * On the other side of the earnings outlook, International Paper rose 1 1/8 to  52 3/4 after reporting second-quarter earnings of $1.70 a share, better than  expected.  </P> <P> * Many high-tech stocks continued to advance, despite the market's jitters.  Investors are betting on strong second-quarter earnings from most tech  companies. Tandem rose 1 to 23 1/4, Autodesk rose 1/2 to 57 and Western Digital  added 1/4 to 13 1/4. But Tandon Corp. tumbled 1/2 to 3 1/8. It had run up  sharply recently.  </P> <P> * Chatsworth-based Software Toolworks rose 1/2 to 19 1/4. The company sold 3.8  million new shares at $18.50 apiece.  </P> <P> * Pathe fell 3/8 to 2 3/8, a new low, on continued pessimism about its efforts  to acquire MGM/UA. MGM lost 1/4 to 17 1/8.  </P> <P> * Litton Industries rose 7/8 to 73 3/8. Goldman Sachs traded a 490,000-share  block of the stock, though it wasn't revealed for whom.  </P> <P> Tokyo stocks closed lower as concern that Japanese interest rates may climb  drove investors to the sidelines. The key 225-share Nikkei index was down  385.85 points to 32,152.43.  </P> <P> In London, stocks closed lower despite the pound's surge. The Financial Times  100-share index closed down 10 points at 2,327.5. In Frankfurt, West Germany,  the 30-share DAX ended 14.23 points lower at 1,909.63 after earlier dipping as  low as 1,899.43.  </P></p>

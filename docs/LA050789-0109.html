			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FICTION IN BRIEF: THE SHOPLIFTER'S APPRENTICE BY ELLEN LESSER (SIMON &amp;  SCHUSTER: $16.95; 127 PP.)  </P> <P> Did he find her "lovely"? one of Ellen Lesser's protagonists wonders while  posing nude for a painter. "When he looked at her shoulder, delicately  rendered, was he thinking of her?" Lesser's sensitive characters often cast  about this way for signs of who they are and what they want. Rather than  experiencing the sudden epiphanies that lend drama to the lives of many fiction  characters, however, they, like real people, must make do with only glimpses of  self-discovery.  </P> <P> These glimpses (also as in real life) are often taken reluctantly. Rachel's  feelings are ambivalent, for instance, when the husband of her old college  friend Susan enters the room just as Rachel was about to tell her how "so much  of herself was suspended, how she seemed still to be only paying her dues . . .  while other people were actually living." "She greeted the sight of him with a  mixture of indignation and relief," Lesser writes. "She felt strangely  vulnerable, precarious, as though she'd come to the brink of something and  wasn't sure whether she was being held back or saved."  </P> <P> Lesser affirms her character's indecision as natural and necessary in these  gentle stories, subtly illustrating how a certain degree of reserve can help  bind us to the human community. In the title story, for example, Rachel sees a  "strangely handsome" man filch a champagne bottle from a store. More nervous  than he, she flees the store, but after sleeping with him that night, she comes  to envy his wealth of stolen amenities. Eventually, that "fine veil" separating  her hands from the merchandise falls away, allowing her to take at will and  stimulating a "rush of chemicals (that) wasn't only fear, it was a terrible  freedom. Anything could happen now." By becoming so strong-headed, Lesser  implies, the woman also has become isolated, unable to show vulnerability and  thus, unable to receive love.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GRUMBLING GREETS PROHIBITION ON BEACH  </P> <P> Prohibition came to San Diego beaches Wednesday, a day so warm and sun-kissed  that by noon beach-goers were already thinking of ways to beat the alcohol ban.  </P> <P> Suggestions included disguising the beer in paper cups, plastic jugs and  beverage insulators, even staging a surfers' keg party offshore.  </P> <P> "Yeah, man, I think we'll get a pontoon and anchor it a few yards offshore and  party on the water," said surfer Miley Alaniz. "That's not the beach, so they  can't stop us from having a beer there."  </P> <P> The City Council in June imposed the six-month alcohol ban at La Jolla Shores  Beach, next to Kellogg Beach and North Park Community Park, to determine if  alcohol is linked to crime and drunkenness at public beaches and parks.  </P> <P> The trial ban lasts until Feb. 1. Signs have been posted along the beachfront  and in the parks; additional signs will be posted. The police beach team will  be patrolling the shores as usual, but no additional officers will be assigned  to the area.  </P> <P> San Diego has some of the few beaches in Southern California where drinking  alcohol is legal, but restrictions have been imposed gradually in public parks  as drunkenness and alcohol-related crime have escalated. Drinking is prohibited  from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. at beaches north of the Mission Bay channel entrance.  </P> <P> The trial ban has generated controversy among beach-goers, beach community  residents and City Council members. All sides seem to agree that the  alcohol-related problems are caused by a small percentage of drinkers and  teen-agers who hang out at the beach parking lots after dark.  </P> <P> Reaching a solution, however, has been difficult.  </P> <P> The city outlawed drinking in its beach parking lots in 1987 and last year  ordered that parking lots at South Mission Beach be closed at 10 p.m. in a move  to curtail alcohol-related problems there.  </P> <P> The six-month ban was adopted after the council reversed a decision in December  to adopt a citywide ban of alcohol at public beaches.  </P> <P> Councilman John Hartley, who has voiced support for a citywide beach ban, said  he still wants alcohol banned from all public beaches but understands the need  for the public to be heard before such a decision is adopted.  </P> <P> "Drinking on the beach is a privilege, not a right, and it often leads to  rowdiness and obnoxious behavior," Hartley said. "Most major counties in  Southern California already ban alcohol on the beaches, and San Diego has to  take appropriate measures to protect itself from this type of behavior."  </P> <P> Mayor Maureen O'Connor remains opposed to the ban and, instead, favors  increased enforcement of existing laws against public drunkenness, urination  and unruly behavior to combat problems on the beach, said her press secretary,  Paul Downey.  </P> <P> "The mayor feels that most people who have beer at a family picnic or some wine  while they watch the sunset are responsible drinkers, and that it's not fair to  punish the law-abiding citizens," Downey said.  </P> <P> For the next two weeks, police will issue verbal and written warnings to  violators before police begin enforcing the ban with $25 and $50 citations. All  alcoholic beverages will be dumped out or confiscated. Police are empowered to  search coolers if circumstances warrant it, officials said.  </P> <P> San Diego lifeguards also will issue warnings.  </P> <P> "I think the word is out -- we haven't been seeing as much beer on the beach  lately, and people have been asking us about the ban," said lifeguard Jay  Hilton. "We'll keep our eyes open and answer questions, but we'll leave the  ticketing to the police."  </P> <P> Once ticketing begins, tourists and others who claim ignorance of the law might  still escape with a warning, but repeat offenders will be cited until they get  the message, police said.  </P> <P> "The first two weeks will be an informational and educational process where  officers will warn people and explain the rules," said Sgt. Rick O'Hanlon of  the San Diego police's beach team.  </P> <P> On the ban's first day, police and lifeguards issued some warnings and dumped  out a few cans of beer, but most beach-goers seemed aware of the ban, officials  said.  </P> <P> "We have already seen some tapering off in the number of people getting drunk  in these areas," O'Hanlon said. "We think people are getting the message."  </P> <P> Few people at the beach Wednesday, however, were pleased even with the trial  ban.  </P> <P> "It stinks," said surfer Alaniz of Pacific Beach. "The surfers come back from  the water and like to have a beer or two. Why should everybody get screwed  because a few people cause all the problems?"  </P> <P> "It's a political move," added surfer Dave Garcia of La Jolla Shores, saying  "big-bucks" La Jolla Shores residents got the measure approved over the  sentiments of the majority. "We're going to fight this" in February, he said,  when the council will review the ban and vote on whether to make it permanent.  </P> <P> Added surfer Donnie Iverson of La Jolla Shores: "And this ban is going to ruin  it for the local stores that sell beer and wine and the aluminum can  collectors. The whole thing is ridiculous."  </P> <P> Members of the La Jolla Shores Assn., a local residents organization,  disagreed.  </P> <P> "We favor a permanent ban for all the city's beaches," said Sue Oxley. "Many  people start drinking in the afternoon, and by dark they are a menace on the  beach and the road."  </P> <P> "It's out of control," said Carl Dustin Jr., a La Jolla Shores native who said  he moved to Encinitas to escape the beach problems. "Loud parties, broken  glass, fights, stabbings, rapes. It's ruined the beach."  </P> <P> Beach patrol officers said they expect no major problem until the weekend, when  the large crowds arrive.  </P> <P> "This is a small isolated beach so it's a good test area," said officer Sandy  Scharnberg. "During the week, the crowds are not that big, mostly families and  tourists. But the weekends are usually when the problems occur."  </P> <P> "We're going to be very polite in reminding people of the ban, but the law is  the law," said her partner, officer Ken Brown. "It's a shame that 5% of the  drinkers have to ruin it for everyone."  </P> <P> Many beach-goers agreed.  </P> <P> "It sucks," said Jon Jaggard of San Diego as he lugged his beach chair along  the boardwalk. "It infringes on our rights. The next step is banning alcohol at  tailgate parties at the stadium. This is just the tip of the iceberg."  </P> <P> The trial ban has an exemption allowing groups to obtain a city permit to drink  alcohol.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / SENATE;  </P> <P> UP FOR 2 SEATS, LAWMAKER HITS THE GARAMENDIS  </P> <P> Assemblyman Patrick Johnston, no stranger to the turbulence of legislative  campaigns, finds himself in the awkward spot of asking constituents to vote for  him twice on Nov. 6 -- once for the Assembly and again for the state Senate.  </P> <P> Is he greedy? Power hungry? No, says the five-term Stockton Democrat.  </P> <P> Johnston complains that he was forced into seeking two offices simultaneously  because of a maneuver by a Democratic "power couple" -- former state Sen. John  Garamendi and his wife, Patti -- that was skillfully timed to give her an  election advantage to succeed her husband.  </P> <P> John Garamendi, heavily favored to win his own race as California's first  elected insurance commissioner, was so confident that he resigned his Senate  seat on Labor Day instead of waiting until after the election or until he took  the new office next year.  </P> <P> In doing so, Garamendi gave his wife a campaign boost in her attempt to win his  old seat, says Johnston. He is now forced to try to explain to the  Stockton-area constituents he has represented for a decade why his name appears  on the regular ballot for reelection to the Assembly and on the special  election ballot for the state Senate.  </P> <P> "Some people say, 'Oh yeah, I get it.' But I'm not sure they always do,"  Johnston said of the voters. "It didn't have to be this way, but it was a  calculated decision by John to benefit Patti."  </P> <P> Along with Johnston appearing on two ballots, Garamendi's early resignation  gave his wife valuable time to organize her campaign.  </P> <P> Although seeking public office for the first time, Patti Garamendi -- a law  school graduate and mother of six children ages 4 to 22 -- for years has been  enmeshed in her husband's ambitious political career.  </P> <P> Married for 25 years, the Garamendis were sweethearts during the 1960s at UC  Berkeley, where John was a football star. Later, they served together in the  Peace Corps and ranched in the Northern California Gold Rush country near  Mokelumne Hill.  </P> <P> From her husband's first race for the state Assembly in 1974, Patti Garamendi  has been considered a full partner in his many campaigns for legislative and  statewide offices.  </P> <P> She acquired a reputation as the spark plug of his political ambitions, a  notion she rejects. "I think that is really untrue and unfair," she said. "I  think that is a way of taking a cheap shot at John. He's brilliant. There are  not too many men I could have stayed in the semi-shadow for."  </P> <P> Patti Garamendi argues that Johnston has overblown the voter confusion issue  and asserts that after 16 years of working with her husband, "I now have this  window of opportunity in my life to serve. I may never have that opportunity  again."  </P> <P> Patti Garamendi, 46, and Johnston, 44, an expert on insurance, banking and  savings and loan issues, are the best known of 10 candidates in the Nov. 6  special election to fill the two-year unexpired term.  </P> <P> If no one wins outright, a runoff will be held in January for the sprawling  district that includes parts of the picturesque Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta,  the historic Mother Lode in the Sierra and vast expanses of farmland in the  Central Valley.  </P> <P> Some Republican strategists foresee a runoff as offering the GOP its best hope  in decades of seizing the Senate seat.  </P> <P> John Garamendi emerged from the June primary as the odds-on favorite to become  insurance commissioner. And Johnston and Patti Garamendi began in earnest to  organize their campaigns to succeed him.  </P> <P> But Johnston, who said John Garamendi had tried to persuade him not to run,  said he had expected to run in a special election for Garamendi's seat next  year -- not next month.  </P> <P> Johnston's name was already on the November ballot in his Assembly district,  which is wholly contained in the Senate district. "I can't get off the Assembly  ballot even if I die," Johnston said.  </P> <P> Johnston asserts that timing of the resignation was designed to create  confusion among Johnston's core constituents in his Assembly district, whom he  counts on heavily to return him to the Assembly and send him to the Senate.  </P> <P> "I ask them to vote for me twice," said Johnston. "If I am elected to both, I  will resign from the Assembly."  </P> <P> But the Garamendis contend that their timing saved taxpayers the $500,000 cost  of a special election next year and assures constituents that they will be  represented when the new Legislature convenes in December.  </P> <P> Claiming she had no insider information, Patti Garamendi maintains that she did  not know until the night of Labor Day that her husband had actually submitted a  letter of resignation that she said he had mulled over for three days.  </P> <P> "He came home and I said, 'Well, did you do it or not?' He said, 'Yeah, I  stopped by the Capitol on my way back from the airport.' So, immediately, I  think we've got to get his state car cleaned up and returned. I've got to get  health insurance for six kids and it's all . . . go on my television (spots)."  </P> <P> Besides taking heat about her candidacy creating the possibility of a Garamendi  "dynasty," Patti Garamendi said she is also up against entrenched alliances.  She charges that Johnston and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown tried to stake out  the Senate seat as Johnston's political property.  </P> <P> She recounted that she got into a shouting match with Brown over the issue. As  she recalled the exchange, she informed Brown:  </P> <P> "I'm going to run for John's seat.' He told me, 'That's Pat Johnston's seat.' I  said, 'That's my seat.' His voice rose, 'No way, no way.' 'Just watch me,' "  she said.  </P> <P> Johnston, married and the father of two, first won election to the Assembly in  1980 by only 25 votes after a recount. Low key, he is known for doing his  homework on insurance and finance issues and has been discussed as a contender  to succeed Brown as Assembly Speaker.  </P> <P> Johnston, an aide to John Garamendi for six years, and Patti Garamendi are both  philosophically moderate Democrats with few differences on issues, except the  death penalty. She supports capital punishment and he does not.  </P> <P> In the short nine-week campaign that is heavily dependent on television spots  to reach the sprawling district, Johnston has sought in one commercial to  explain his races for two offices. "John and Patti Garamendi have manipulated  the date of the Senate election to hurt my chances of winning," he says.  </P> <P> A "generic" Johnston commercial cites neither office. This tactic gets him  exposure for each and also allows his separate Assembly and Senate campaign  committees to split the high cost of broadcast time.  </P> <P> Patti Garamendi's TV spots feature her recalling her Peace Corps experiences in  Ethiopia and her familiarity with tightly knit rural communities of the  district. Her low-key campaign also points out "16 years of legislative  experience working with Sen. John Garamendi."  </P> <P> The biggest single contributor to her campaign has been Patti Garamendi.  Recently filed public records show contributions of $182,500 -- including  $106,000 she loaned the campaign herself -- most of it for television  advertising.  </P> <P> Johnston, meanwhile, has collected $252,350 for his Assembly campaign and  $131,010 for his Senate race, most of it from organizations with business  before the Legislature -- labor, physicians, teachers, hospitals, insurance  companies and developers.  </P></p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Boscher to be wound up BOSCHER, the 53 per cent-owned stockbroking unit of French state-owned bank Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), is to be wound up, Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Georges Chodron de Courcel, BNP finance director, yesterday said BNP and Alain Boscher, representing minority shareholders of Boscher, would sign the 'friendly' wind-up of the company shortly. Mr Alain Boscher, who wants to continue in the business, will be given first right of refusal on the repurchase of the company's assets after a value has been set. If he declines, other buyers will be sought, Mr Chodron de Courcel said. The company manages assets of some 4,000 clients, which total about FFr2.5bn (Dollars 500m). Mr Chodron de Courcel said the company could be valued at FFr5m to FFr50m. Boscher, which employs 72 people, has made an operating loss of around FFr4m since the start of this year after a net profit of FFr10m in 1991.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / People: British Telecom Colin Browne, 48, director of corporate relations at British Telecom since 1986, has been appointed as director of corporate affairs at the BBC. He replaces Pamela Taylor, who has left for the World Health Organisation after little more than a year in the job. Browne's decision to exchange the comparative calm of Britain's biggest company for the sometimes turbulent internal politics of the BBC management team comes as a bit of a surprise. Taylor, who replaced Howell James in November 1992, was brought in as part of BBC director general John Birt's radical management shake-up. Browne, a career BT man was director of BT Vision, responsible for developing BT's interests in cable TV and satellite TV programming, before moving into corporate affairs. He has been replaced by Ian Ash, 51, a former IBM executive who joined BT in 1989 and was until recently director of marketing in BT's personal communications division.</p>

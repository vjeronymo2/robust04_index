			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA commentator Serhiy Zhurets under </F> the rubric "Details on the Fact": "It is Called the An-70"]    [Text] NARODNA ARMIYA has already reported that the family  of airliners developed at the aviation scientific and technical  complex imeni Oleg Antonov has been supplemented with a new  aircraft. Its name is the An-70. Three countries--Ukraine,  Russia and Kazakhstan--are planning to build this beauty. That  is why the national colors of those countries adorn the fuselage  of the first, and as yet sole, specimen of the An-70 transport  aircraft. The chief customers are the ministries of defense of  Ukraine and Russia, whose cooperation in the development and  production of the new transport aircraft is based on an  international agreement signed by representatives of the  governments of Russia and Ukraine. It is thus understandable  that those military agencies have a vested interest in having in  the arsenal of their military-transport aviation an aircraft  that conforms entirely to all contemporary requirements. So even  though the first models of the new military-transport aircraft  will appear in the air regiments at best in 1996-97, it is worth  becoming acquainted with the An-70 more closely.    The An-70 was created to ship cargo and vehicles, and the  need for such an aircraft in the armed forces of Ukraine is  explained by the fact that the principal military-transport  aircraft today, the An-12, has already become outmoded and is in  essence awaiting replacement. The An-70 could indeed become that  reliable replacement.    In order to understand better why it is this aircraft that  specialists consider an achievement in the field of aircraft  construction, we turn to the American [as published] weekly  JANE'S DEFENSE WEEKLY, which had publicized the characteristics  of the aircraft and commented on them professionally long before  the ceremony to roll out the first An-70 had taken place in  Kiev. They equated the characteristics of the An-70 with the  capabilities of the C-130 base military-transport aircraft of  the NATO countries.    American experts feel that creation of the design for a  transport aircraft for the VPS [Air Forces] is not a  particularly difficult task. It is, however, considerably more  difficult to embody in the plans tactical performance  characteristics that would fully take into account the  contemporary requirements of the troops in the area of  transporting personnel and hardware from their permanent base  locations to a conflict zone. Effectiveness in the performance  of rapid troop movements or their redeployment is defined by the  quantity of cargo shipped over a certain time. And it is better  in that case to have, for example, two aircraft of smaller  dimensions than one large aircraft, since that provides an  opportunity to utilize twice as many loading and unloading areas.    Such characteristics as the length of the runway and the  capability of the aircraft to perform maneuvers outside the  boundaries of it, as well as the overall cost of the aircraft,  are important requirements among those posed toward  military-transport aircraft. Proceeding from that, foreign  specialists indicate that all of those requirements have been  well balanced in the design of the An-70. It does not exceed any  of the now-existing similar aircraft in dimensions, speed or  flight range, but the sum of the characteristics embodied in the  An-70 is almost ideal compared to other military-transport  aircraft. The An-70, created based on the use of not very  complex technologies, will possibly be quite advantageous from  the standpoint of acquisition and utilization. Any other  aircraft would require additional funds for its production, but  the An-70 is able to make the greatest contribution to the state  of the world aviation market among other developments of  military aircraft.    I would remind you that these conclusions are being drawn by  foreign aviation specialists, who can scarcely be suspected of  sympathy toward the achievements of Ukrainian aviation designers  and aircraft builders.    Now, the characteristics of the An-70 in more concrete  detail:    The aircraft can ship cargo weighing up to 30-35 tonnes  distances of 4,000-5,000 kilometers at a speed of 750 km/hr.    The aircraft, depending on the missions, has a takeoff  weight  between 100 and 130 tonnes, and can be based either at permanent  concrete airfields with runways as long as 1,800-2,200 meters,  or on short unimproved landing zones as long as 600-800 meters.  This means that the An-70 can be utilized on 80 percent of the  airfields in the CIS, while foreign aircraft in this class can  use only half of all existing airfields. The capability of the  An-70 to take off and land on short unimproved landing areas  provides an opportunity to deliver cargo directly to its  intended destination, which is exceedingly important when one  takes into account the requirements of wartime.    The dimensions of the cargo bay of the An-70 medium  transport  aircraft are of great significance. Its volume is a third larger  than that of the Il-76 aircraft, and three times larger than the  An-12, Hercules and Transall aircraft.    "The cargo bay of the An-70 makes it possible to transport  all of the military hardware and weaponry of the CIS and NATO  countries," the advertising prospectus states. In describing the  An-70 in more detail, however. I will give the data that were  cited by the American specialists evaluating it: "The aircraft  can hold an M2/M3 Bradley in non-dismantled form, an M-109  howitzer (the equivalent of our 2S3), a towed howitzer with  prime mover, and the PVO-2S6 mobile system with the Sa-11 SAM  launcher."    The cargo bay of the An-70, unlike the An-12, Il-76,  Hercules  and Transall domestic and foreign aircraft, can hold cargo in  two rows.    A whole series of innovations were employed in the  development and construction of the new medium transport  aircraft. I will dwell only on those that have a direct bearing  on the operation of the An-70.    A power plant with propfan engines has been installed on a  transport aircraft for the first time. The engines were  developed and built by the engine builders of Zaporizhzhya, and  the propfans by the Russian design bureau in the city of  Stupino. Taking into account the growing requirements for fuel  expenditure, it should be pointed out that it is only 160 grams  per tonne-kilometer for the An-70. By way of comparison, the  An-12 required three times as much fuel, and the Il-76 twice as  much, as the An-70 for the shipment of 20 tonnes of cargo 3,000  km during their use as the standard medium cargo-transport  aircraft.    A system of control of the aircraft equipment that automates  the performance of piloting tasks was also used on the An-70  aircraft for the first time in the CIS; this has made it  possible to reduce the number of control panels and the demands  on the crew. The information-display system was built on the  basis of full-color screen indicators that bring up everything  the pilots need -- piloting and navigational data, information  on the functioning, failure and defectiveness of on-board  systems and aircraft equipment, reference information and  recommendations. Thus, I expect it will be an utter pleasure for  the crew of three individuals to fly the An-70.</p>

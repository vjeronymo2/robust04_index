			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "G.N.": "Franco-African Conclave in Paris"] </F>   [Text] The finance ministers of the 14 African countries  of the CFA franc area are meeting in Paris today to assess the  situation three months after the 50-percent devaluation of the  CFA [African Financial Community] franc with French Economy  Minister Edmond Alphandery and Cooperation Minister Michel  Roussin.    This summit was preceded yesterday by a meeting of experts.  The main subjects discussed were the continuation of the  reorganization of public finances and economic recovery.    One source of optimism for the participants is that the  international prices of raw materials, and especially cocoa,  coffee, and rubber which are exported by these countries, have  considerably strengthened since the beginning of the year.    "The franc area's financial backers will pay a total of  around 24 billion French francs [Fr] this year -- including Fr5  billion from France -- to help bring about economic recovery in  these countries following the devaluation of the CFA franc," a  senior French official said. This is a way of stating that  France and the big international institutions are moving in the  same direction.  <H5>  Loans in CFA Francs </H5>   Some people in Africa and France have openly condemned the  attitude of the IMF and the World Bank, regarded as too strict  because excessively theoretical.    Jean-Pierre Thomas (UDF [Union for French  Democracy]-Vosges),  keynote speaker on cooperation funds in the National Assembly's  Finance Commission, thinks in particular that "a moratorium must  be established on these countries' debts. They cannot do  everything at once."    The keynote speaker also protested "the rumor that there  might be a second devaluation." (Footnote) (A UN report  published last January expressed the view that the effects of  this devaluation would rapidly be canceled out by the resulting  inflation.) To "halt" these rumors and to avoid discouraging  the capital "which is starting to return to Africa," Mr. Thomas  proposes that the loans of the French Development Fund (formerly  the Central Fund for Economic Cooperation) to countries of the  franc area should henceforth be paid in CFA francs.    The cooperation minister is in favor of that and could even  suggest it today.</p>

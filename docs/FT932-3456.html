			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Hanson softens on voting rights HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, said it may be prepared to give in to pressure from shareholders and retract proposals limiting their ability to influence annual meetings. Mr Martin Taylor, deputy chairman, said it was too late to remove the proposals from the ballot for an extraordinary meeting to be held on June 25. He said, however: 'When we come to review our articles next year we will see if they need to be changed.' Mr John Rogers, secretary to the investment committee of the National Association of Pension Funds, said the group had received similar assurances from Hanson. The proposals have provoked a storm of protest from two investor groups, the NAPF and Pensions Investment Research Consultants, which advises shareholders on corporate governance issues. Ms Anne Simpson, PIRC managing director, is urging investors to vote against the proposals. 'Companies should be finding ways to improve their accountability to shareholders, not restricting their existing rights. We consider it extremely important that Hanson does not set a precedent on this issue.' Some shareholders have complained that not only do the proposals severely curtail their legitimate voting rights, but that Hanson has proposed them in a fashion which makes voting against them difficult. The offending proposals are contained in general amendments which seek shareholder approval of a scrip issue - supported by investors - as well as providing for some board changes deemed to improve the group's corporate governance. The new rules, which shareholders will vote on at an EGM, will eliminate the right of shareholders to nominate a director to the board unless backers represent at least 10 per cent of the vote. Also, shareholders will lose the right to propose amendments to resolutions at the meeting unless they represent 5 per cent of the share capital. In addition, the chairman will have an explicit power to refuse to call for a poll on any item by shareholders which in his opinion is 'irrelevant' or 'vexatious'.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ulster parties move on talks agenda NORTHERN Ireland Unionists and the Irish government are expected today to take a first tentative step towards formal discussions on relations between the north and south of the island. Sir Ninian Stephen, the former governor-general of Australia, is to chair a private meeting in London that will start to draw up an agenda for 'strand two' of a talks process that started seven weeks ago. Other participants will include the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party and the British government. 'Strand two' is the point at which the Irish government enters. It would be the first time Unionist leaders and the Irish government have met formally to discuss Northern Ireland's future since the 1973 Sunningdale conference. However, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has yet to announce a formal start to the strand - a decision that will require the careful balancing of Unionists' and nationalists' sensitivities. Today's meeting is part of a complex compromise allowing talks to continue without agreement in 'strand one' - on devolution in the province. The final strand, involving just the two governments, begins preliminary work next week. Officials will represent the two governments while MPs or senior party figures, rather than leaders, will stand in for the political parties. During a debate yesterday on renewing 'direct rule' from Westminster, Sir Patrick said that the talks 'are following a constructive pattern'. During the debate there were Unionist protests when the SDLP's Mr Seamus Mallon intervened in a speech by Ulster Unionist party MP for Upper Bann Mr David Trimble to demand what his view would be if 'anyone involved in confidential discussions . . might meet with leaders of paramilitary organisations to keep them informed of what is happening'. Junior minister Mr Jeremy Hanley later denied that either he or Sir Patrick had 'any evidence' of the matter raised by Mr Mallon. A question mark still hangs over the extent of the support the IRA is receiving from Libya, Mr John Major, the prime minister, indicated in the Commons yesterday. He confirmed that at a meeting in Geneva last week Libya had provided some information to Britain about its relationship with the provisional IRA. Mr Major said preliminary assessment had shown that the information was incomplete and unsatisfactory, but it did contain some positive elements that might well prove useful.</p>

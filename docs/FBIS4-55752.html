			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by CTK and "(stk)": "Baudys Supports Russia and </F> Defends Its Role in the `Euro-Asian Balance'"]    [Text] Prague--Defense Minister Antonin Baudys declared  yesterday that it is necessary to respect Russia's special  interests with regard to the North Atlantic Alliance. Russia is  still, apparently, a superpower and has always been an important  element of the Euro-Asian balance. "It is in the interest of  the whole of Europe to ensure that this continues to be the  case," said Baudys.    Baudys made this statement at yesterday's seminar on  "Security in Central Europe--The Public's Views." The three-day  seminar, which is being held in Prague, is organized by the  North Atlantic Assembly in cooperation with the Czech Chamber of  Deputies. The defense minister also said that it is most  important for European security to ensure that cooperation  between the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) and the former  socialist bloc develops not only on a military basis, but, first  and foremost, on an economic one. The foundation stone for  peace apparently is economic prosperity. According to Baudys,  the Visegrad Group should not be perceived as a political  instrument for exerting pressure on NATO because Visegrad cannot  be an alternative to or preparation for membership in the pact.  "The issue of entry into NATO is so important that  comprehensive economic, political, and social reforms within the  state must be given precedence in dealing with it," said Baudys.  In connection with the Partnership for Peace plan, the minister  referred to the Czech presentation document, which contains  offers of exercise areas, training, and so on. According to  Baudys, the first step in this was the joint exercises with the  Dutch marines.    According to Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Bratinka, who  also  took part in the conference, a Russian policy offensive is, on  the other hand, now under way. "The possible renewal of  Russia's influence in Europe can only be confronted by a  consistent policy from NATO and the Western European Union,"  added Bratinka.</p>

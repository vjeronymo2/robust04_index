			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> LOTTERY TO CELEBRATE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY  </P> <P> The California Lottery said it will start celebrating its fifth anniversary  next week by turning 20 people into instant millionaires for matching three of  six winning numbers in the Lotto 6/53 game. Normally, the prize for picking  three winning numbers is $5.  </P> <P> Ten people who select three of six numbers in the Sept. 19 drawing will be  awarded $1 million apiece, and 10 more will get $1 million each in the Sept. 22  drawing, lottery marketing director Susan Clark said. Winners of the "3 for a  Million" anniversary bonus will be picked at random from the pool of all  gamblers who match three of the six winning numbers in the two drawings. On  average, 185,000 people match three of six numbers in each Lotto drawing. The  bonus prizes will be awarded in addition to the regular Lotto 6/53 jackpots. A  winning ticket will be worth $1 million if the ticket's validation number  matches one of the 10 validation numbers that will be randomly selected by  computer.  </P></p>

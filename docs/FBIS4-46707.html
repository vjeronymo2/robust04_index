			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Hopes--Fewer and Fewer"] </F>   [Text] Citizens of Armenia have in 1994 come to have  less faith in their own powers and in the development of  democracy in this state.    "The data of sociological research undertaken on the  initiative of the European Union and carried out by the  Sociology Department of the Yerevan State University testify to  this," Lyudmila Arutyunyan, head of the department, told a  correspondent of the NOYAN TALAN Agency. The analysis was  conducted on the basis of the responses to 10 questions, which  affords an opportunity to draw a conclusion as to the extent to  which democratic principles are observed in this country.  Whereas in 1993 some 30 percent of those polled in Armenia  responded to the question: "With which country do you link your  hopes?" that they were counting "on themselves," more than 30,  on Russia, and fewer than 30 percent, on Europe, in 1994,  according to the results of the poll, 72 percent link their  hopes with the Russian Federation, and only 4 percent are, as  before, counting on themselves. To the question as to whether  human rights are respected in the country, 19 percent answered  in the affirmative, 81 percent, negative. On the whole,  affection for the United States has diminished, having come to  be replaced by a positive attitude toward the European Community.    The sociological research undertaken by the European Union  ("Eurobarometer") has been carried out in all countries of East  Europe, and of the CIS countries, in Ukraine, the European part  of Russia, Belarus, and Armenia.</p>

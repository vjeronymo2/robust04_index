			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Philip Webster and Jill Sherman: "Major Attacks </F> Deadly Sins of Europe"]    [Text] John Major last night issued an impassioned plea to  Conservative voters to turn out for tomorrow's European  elections as he used the final hours of campaigning to repeat  his demand for a multi-speed Community.    The Prime Minister gave several stark warnings that the  European Union would fall apart unless it became more flexible  and he cautioned stay-at-home Tory voters that they could be  letting in socialists who wanted a centralised federal state.    Success for Labour or the Liberal Democrats would be a  ticket  to disaster, he said, since the opposition parties supported the  "seven deadly sins" of Europe. They wanted more powers to be  transferred from Britain to Brussels, the social chapter, a  single currency, taxes to be levelled up, EU [European Union]  spending raised the veto weakened and Britain's rebate to be  renegotiated.    "Don't stay at home and let others choose the destiny of the  continent," Mr Major told a rally in London. "Don't stay at home  and complain when you hear, as you inevitably would, that a  socialist majority at Strasbourg is calling for more spending,  more tax, more interference by Brussels in the nooks and  crannies of your lives."    Mr Major's appeal came as an ICM [International  Communications and Marketing Research] opinion poll for the  DAILY EXPRESS suggested the Tories could win between 15 and 20  seats -- more than some recent polls have suggested. The survey  put Labour on 45 per cent, the Conservatives on 27 and the  Liberal Democrats 22 per cent.    Yesterday Mr Major repeatedly returned to the multitrack  theme, which Conservative strategists believe may pay dividends,  brushing aside suggestions that the Cabinet was split over his  approach.    By the turn of the century, the Union could have 20 members,  he said: "It is a different sort of Community, we have to deal  with it in a different way. It is bound to be more flexible. If  it is not more flexible it will break." Later he told LBC that  people were uneasy at the direction they believed Europe had  been going, that it was too prescriptive and centralised and had  taken too many powers from Westminster. It was to combat that  feeling that he was pressing for a multi-speed Europe.    Mr Major's decision to keep playing the multi-speed card, in  spite of reservations among Cabinet ministers such as John  Gummer, reflects the support Tory canvassers are detecting for  it among traditional core voters. Even among Conservative MPs  not known as strong supporters of the Prime Minister, there is a  view that he has struck a chord and there is praise, too, for  the energetic campaign he has fought in sharp contrast to  Margaret Thatcher's low-key efforts five years ago.    Yesterday, Mr Major seized on an international jobs study by  the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as  evidence that Britain's approach to unemployment was being  adopted by other countries. But the report sparked an angry row  as Labour, too, claimed it vindicated the party's policies.    The study sets out the case for a compromise between an  over-regulated and a deregulated jobs market, pointing to the  dangers of both. Although it leans towards Conservative policy,  it does not come out against a minimum wage. It does, however,  call for more flexible working hours, wage and labour costs to  reflect local conditions and skills. It also spells out the  need for a highly skilled workforce.    Mr Major and Kenneth Clarke insisted yesterday that the  report was an outright endorsement of their campaign to cut red  tape and Brussels interference. Mr Major said its  recommendations had been the core of every Conservative  manifesto of his political career, while the Chancellor said:  "It suggests that not only was Britain right to get out of the  social chapter, but that other countries should get out of it  too."    But Labour's John Prescott accused the Conservatives of  twisting the word "flexibility" to mean low pay, poor conditions  and fewer rights. The report had, he said, endorsed Labour  proposals to impose a training levy on firms, to link education  to skills training and to create new jobs through improved  productivity, innovation and technology.    Margaret Beckett, Labour's acting leader, meanwhile alleged  that the Government was so divided over Europe that it could not  govern effectively. "Mr Major has been trying to play to his  Eurosceptics to try to placate them, to keep the party  together," she said. ``There is no substantive rift over Europe  in the Labour Party. We all agree that the way to do it is to  put Britain at the top of the heap in Europe while Mr Major  wants us in the bicycle lane.    ``One of the things we have to do is to maintain Britain's  influence in Europe. Part of the Governments incompetence in  Europe is that they are depriving Britain of a voice and of  influence.''    While Mr Major insisted yesterday that the European  elections  were not a referendum on his domestic performance, Paddy Ashdown  again urged voters to use the polls to deliver their verdict on  a Tory campaign that had broken promises and betrayed hopes.    The Liberal Democrat leader told a rally in Plymouth: "The  Conservatives persuaded people to vote for lies once. I believe  most people in this country are not prepared to let the  Conservatives make mugs of them twice. Every Conservative vote  will be a vote to say that you don't mind broken promises about  taxation ... to say that honesty doesn't matter. Every  Conservative vote will be a vote to say to the Government:  `You're doing a great job, please carry on.'"</p>

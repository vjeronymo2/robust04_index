			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: POEM IN HIS HEART -- AND A BIG PAYCHECK  </P> <P> One of the things that seems to have gotten Sen. Tower into so much trouble is  the fact that he worked as a consultant on defense contracts. He is supposed to  have made $775,000 at this job. What does someone have to deliver to earn this  kind of dough? I couldn't guess, so I asked another defense consultant, Roy  Chardonnay, to tell me exactly what people like him did for that sort of money.  </P> <P> "It's too complicated to explain," he said. "You would be much better off if  you came with me on my rounds. My first stop is the office of Flatwing  Aviation, which keeps me on a $250,000 retainer. Whenever they have a problem,  I come running."  </P> <P> An hour later we were in the offices of Scotty Hoopster, CEO of Flatwing. He  was pacing up and down.  </P> <P> "I don't understand those SOBs in the Pentagon. We gave them the finest plane  that money could buy, and now they want a rebate because there are cracks in  the wings. Roy, should we go public and attack them for this?"  </P> <P> Chardonnay referred to a loose-leaf book he was carrying. He read:  </P> <P> "There is so much good in the worst of us / And so much bad in the best of us /  It hardly becomes any of us / To talk about the rest of us."  </P> <P> Hoopster looked at Chardonnay as if he couldn't believe his ears.  </P> <P> "Is that your advice?"  </P> <P> "Yessir. I'll fax it to you tomorrow."  </P> <P> Hoopster continued, "We're not just talking about money, Roy. We're talking  about criminal charges. The Pentagon said we kept two sets of books on the job.  If the attorney general goes after us, we're sitting ducks. What should I do  about that?"  </P> <P> Roy opened his notebook again: "If you can keep your head when all about you  others are losing theirs and blaming it on you / If you can trust yourself when  all men doubt you / but make allowance for their doubting too / Or being lied  about don't deal in lies, or being hated, don't give way to hating / And don't  look too good or talk too wise. If. . . ."  </P> <P> Hoopster shouted, "Will you shut up and give me a game plan! We've got two  weeks before the grand jury convenes. Now, Roy, you know how things operate in  this town. Do we stonewall like Ollie North, and use the national security  defense ploy, or do we make a deal with the Justice Department? I don't think  we've got a prayer to beat this one."  </P> <P> To my amazement, Roy went back to the loose-leaf book once more. He read aloud,  "Somebody said that it couldn't be done / But he with a chuckle replied / That  'maybe it couldn't' but he would be one who wouldn't say so 'til he tried / So  he buckled right in with a trace of a grin, on his face / If he worried he hid  it / He started to sing as he tackled the thing / That couldn't be done and he  did it."  </P> <P> "What the hell does that mean?" Scotty wanted to know.  </P> <P> "I'm only here to give you advice. I'm not going to tell you what to do. If you  want me to go further, it will cost you another $100,000."  </P> <P> "I do want you to tell me what to do. Here's a check."  </P> <P> Roy stood up and looked directly at Hoopster, "If you can't be a pine on the  top of the hill / Be a scrub in the valley -- but be / The best little scrub by  the side of the rill / Be a bush if you can't be a tree / If you can't be a  bush be a bit of the grass, and some highway happier make / If you can't be a  muskie then just be a bass / But the liveliest bass in the lake."  </P> <P> Hoopster was deeply moved. "I don't know how I'll ever be able to thank you,  Roy. Nobody in my organization has had the guts to tell me what you just did."  </P> <P> "You need someone from outside who isn't emotionally involved," Roy told him.  </P> <P> When we got out of the building, I said to Roy, "You really helped him by  giving him the big picture. Now I can see why you get paid so well."  </P> <P> He shrugged his shoulders, "The only thing you have to sell when you're a  consultant is your brains."  </P></p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Belgian socialists may be probed Belgium's French-speaking socialists are bracing themselves for a troubled new year, after a magistrate asked for parliamentary immunity of three socialist ministers to be lifted so she could pursue her investigation into a political scandal. Mrs Veronique Ancia, an investigating magistrate from Liege, is following up allegations that francophone socialists were bribed to award a 1988 contract for military helicopters to Agusta, the Italian aircraft manufacturer. On Monday, she asked the Belgian parliament and the assemblies of the Walloon region and French-speaking community to lift the immunity of Mr Guy Coeme, Belgian communications minister, Mr Guy Spitaels, minister-president of Wallonia, and Mr Guy Mathot, Walloon minister of internal affairs. The request - which should be answered by the end of January - was not unexpected. But it could herald a new phase in the complex inquiry, which has been hampered by lack of resources. Parliament officials said the case did not imply that the trio were under suspicion themselves. The officials said if immunity was not lifted, the Liege authorities would be restricted in use of evidence supplied by the ministers. Mrs Ancia's inquiries have already taken her to Italy, where she questioned Mr Bettino Craxi, former Italian socialist leader. She also spoke to Mr Roberto d'Alessandro, chairman of Agusta, who was imprisoned earlier this year in connection with separate bribery allegations. Mrs Ancia is also examining links with the unsolved murder in 1991 of Mr Andre Cools, a prominent Liege socialist politician. The ministers will only be asked about the Agusta dossier. At the time, Mr Coeme was Belgium's defence minister, and Mr Spitaels was head of the French-speaking socialist party. Mr Mathot was described in a 1988 fax sent from Agusta Belgium to the company's headquarters in Italy as 'one of the levers' in award of the contract. Mr Spitaels said on Monday he and senior party officials were not involved in the Agusta decision. Mr Mathot has also denied involvement. Mr Coeme claims 'not one centime' was incorrectly spent on the helicopter deal. The Agusta contract was for 46 helicopters, the last of which should be delivered to the Belgian army next month. Agusta has repeatedly declared it was 'completely unconnected with any financial dealings directly or indirectly aimed at illegal purposes'.</p>

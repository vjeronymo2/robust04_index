			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar squeezed higher A SHORT-squeeze pushed the dollar sharply higher against the yen in late London trade, writes Conner Middelmann. Following several days of slippage against the Japanese currency, the dollar sank as low as Y105.50, where many traders had expected to see central bank intervention in support of the US currency. A substantial buy order from a large US bank and unsubstantiated rumours that the US Federal Reserve was buying dollars put an abrupt halt to the dollar's slide and caused it to rebound, hitting Y107.05 before closing at Y106.50. In New York it ended at Y106.68. Further buoying the dollar was a slew of strong data: capacity utilisation at the highest level since August 1990 at 82.4 per cent, as well as strong industrial production, business sales and inventory figures. However, dealers say the dollar/yen exchange rate is likely to remain volatile ahead of tomorrow's vote in the US congress over the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and Friday's meeting in Seattle between US President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The Nafta vote still looks a close call, and if the pact is rejected that would hit not only the currencies of the trading partners concerned - Mexico and Canada - but also the US dollar, since it would be seen as a major defeat for the Clinton administration. The weakness of the Canadian dollar prompted intervention by the Canadian central bank, which bought Canadian dollars for US dollars around CDollars 1.3245, dealers said. The Canadian dollar closed in London around CDollars 1.3240. The D-Mark weakened against the dollar and some European currencies on widespread expectations of a substantial reduction in the 15-day rate for securities repurchase agreements today. Most dealers expect the lowest accepted repo rate to ease by 8 to 10 basis points from last week's 6.38 per cent. The dollar closed at DM1.6900, but rose as high as DM1.6950 in late London interbank trading. It finished New York trading at DM1.6935. The Belgian franc received a small lift from widespread hopes that the government is close to agreeing a new austerity package. It closed at BFr21.35 per D-Mark, after BF21.37 on Friday. Sterling profited from D-Mark weakness and last week's stronger than expected trade data and ended a pfennig up at DM2.5175. Against the dollar, it advanced modestly to Dollars 1.4895, from Dollars 1.4830 on Friday. In Spain, a higher than expected October inflation number caused the currency to weaken as traders feared that higher prices would lead to tougher demands in the country's ongoing wage restraint talks. The peseta closed at Pta81.25 to the D-Mark, after Friday's Pta80.78. Meanwhile, the Italian lira remained beset by political worries ahead of Sunday's municipal elections. The lira ended at L984.5 against the D-Mark, after L979.5 on Friday.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NINE JAIL VISITORS BECOME 'GUESTS'  </P> <P> A trip to visit relatives and friends at Biscailuz Center Jail in East Los  Angeles turned out to be a one-way trip for nine visitors Saturday when a  random search by authorities uncovered various weapons and drugs in their  possession.  </P> <P> Those arrested were among 131 visitors who were searched during a six-hour  period. Trained dogs were used to check their vehicles for narcotics while  officers frisked passengers.  </P> <P> Searches of visitors and their vehicles are conducted randomly at jails  throughout Los Angeles County in an effort to deter visitors from furnishing  contraband to prisoners, said Sheriff's Department spokesman Dean Scoville. He  added that signs posted on jail premises state that visitors are subject to  such searches.  </P> <P> Five men and four women were arrested on various narcotics and weapons charges,  including possession of brass knuckles and an 8-inch survival knife. Most of  the drugs were in small amounts. One of the men was arrested for violating his  parole, which requires that he not visit jail facilities, Scoville said.  </P></p>

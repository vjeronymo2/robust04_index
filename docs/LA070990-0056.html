			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMPASSE OVER STATE BUDGET STILL STANDS;  </P> <P> FUNDING: A MEETING BETWEEN DEUKMEJIAN AND LAWMAKERS GETS NOWHERE. THE GOVERNOR  WON'T ACCEPT PROPOSED TAX AND FEE HIKES.  </P> <P> Seven days into the new fiscal year and still without a budget or a plan to pay  the state's growing backlog of bills, Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative  leaders met Sunday and talked philosophy.  </P> <P> Seemingly no further along after their 10th meeting than they were when they  began serious talks in June about the budget crisis, lawmakers emerged from the  meeting in the governor's office echoing verses from the same record they have  been playing for five weeks.  </P> <P> On Saturday, Senate leaders had said they were hopeful that Sunday's meeting  would be productive.  </P> <P> The top Republican and Democratic leaders expected to be able to lay a  budget-balancing plan before the governor that involved cuts of $1 billion from  the proposed $56-billion state budget and revenue hikes of $1 billion in  assorted tax and fee increases. It was considered a plan that would allow both  Republicans and Democrats to save face, something considered essential to any  compromise.  </P> <P> But the plan never got off the ground.  </P> <P> Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who put together the  proposal with Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, said Sunday it was still  being fine-tuned.  </P> <P> But Roberti acknowledged that it didn't help when Deukmejian, even before they  had a chance to lay the deal out, indicated "he wasn't too excited about" about  the $1 billion in tax and fee increases.  </P> <P> With that out of the way, "the discussion was more philosophical," said  Deukmejian Chief of Staff Michael R. Frost. He added, "There is no change in  philosophy."  </P> <P> Later, both the Senate and Assembly held a rare Sunday floor session, but  little was accomplished.  </P> <P> Privately, some lawmakers were saying that the convening of the two houses had  more to do with fear of going home without working on the budget than with  actual efforts to pass a budget for the 1990-91 fiscal year that began July 1.  Last week, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) acknowledged as much  when he said lawmakers wouldn't "dare" take the weekend off until they passed a  budget.  </P> <P> There were indications that many of the 120 members of the Legislature were  just beginning to wake up to the fact that the state faces a severe budget  crisis.  </P> <P> Frost, who is part of the governor's lobbying effort with the Legislature, said  Sunday that "the members are just now getting to the point where they  understand the depth of the problem."  </P> <P> This is the way things stood Sunday:  </P> <P> The Republican governor still does not want tax increases, believing that the  state can and must live with budget reductions of $3.6 billion, since spending  would grow 7% to 8% even with cuts of that magnitude.  </P> <P> Democrats still claim that Deukmejian isn't living in the real world if he  thinks that the Democratic-controlled Legislature would go along with those  kinds of cuts, saying that Deukmejian's 7% growth is not nearly enough to keep  up with huge increases in welfare caseloads, public school enrollments and  state prisoner populations.  </P> <P> Aggravating the problem is the fact that the state officeholders, in facing the  funding crisis, have virtually been put in a straitjacket by a variety of legal  requirements, court decisions, voter-approved initiatives and federal laws.  </P> <P> This likely will be Deukmejian's last fight with his long-term adversaries,  Brown and Roberti. He is leaving office early next year, retiring to private  life. Rather than go quietly, the lame-duck governor has drawn the proverbial  line in the sand and refuses to yield.  </P> <P> Frost, when asked how far apart the two sides were, said, "$3.6 billion."  </P></p>

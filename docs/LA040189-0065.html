			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTWOOD RENAISSANCE?  </P> <P> Hooray for Armand Hammer's museum to be built in Westwood! ("A Museum Grows in  Westwood," by Suzanne Muchnic, March 13). As one who lives, works, walks and  patronizes the few services remaining in this once charming village, I am  appalled by the trashing of Westwood by every fast-food operation, sleazy  teeny-bopper clothing store and cut-rate electronic shop to come down the pike.  </P> <P> A museum may not restore the charm of Westwood, but it beats another yogurt  shop.  </P> <P> Now that we're finally on the right track, perhaps some foresighted  entrepreneurs will see the wisdom of opening restaurants, galleries and shops  that will attract the people who used to come to Westwood and have been shut  out by the proliferation of teen-oriented establishments.  </P> <P> PATRICIA L. MOORE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

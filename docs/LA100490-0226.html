			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> E. GERMAN JOBLESS RATE SOARED 25% AS REGIME WANED  </P> <P> East German unemployment shot up by 25% in September, the last month before the  country's battered and inefficient economy was absorbed into a unified Germany,  official statistics showed today.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the number of jobless in what was West Germany fell to 1.73 million  from 1.81 million in August, as companies hired more people to cope with the  extra demand for products from the East, the Federal Labor Office in Nuremberg  said.  </P> <P> Unemployment in the East, which had been officially non-existent under  Communist rule, jumped to nearly 450,000 in September.  </P> <P> Labor Office President Heinrich Francke said that the move from a planned to a  market economy in eastern Germany meant job losses would initially exceed the  creation of new jobs. "This painful process is unavoidable in view of the often  low productivity of the traditional jobs and the enormous shortcomings in the  range and quality of (East German) products under competitive conditions," he  said.  </P></p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Drive to give third world farmers fair deal - An assault on EC agricultural subsidies is launched today CHRISTIAN AID today launches a two-year campaign to encourage 'fair trade', with an assault on the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), support for a 'Fair Trade Mark' and a call for coffee-lovers to drink Cafedirect. The campaign will highlight how third world poverty is closely linked with entrenched and 'exploitative' trading relationships. Christian Aid, along with other leading UK charity groups, aims to persuade today's school-leavers to spend a bigger share of the Pounds 1m they are likely to earn in their working lifetimes on products that give third world producers a fair deal. It is backing the 'Fair Trade Mark', which from January next year will pinpoint such products. It aims to encourage shops, especially supermarkets, to stock fairly traded goods, and customers to use their shopping baskets to ease third world poverty. The perfect example of a 'fair trade' product is Cafedirect, a high-quality ground Arabica coffee bought directly from farmers in Mexico, Costa Rica and Peru. Instead of paying farmers the prevailing world market price for coffee, at present so low that it has swept many of the world's coffee producers into destitution, the charitable consortium, which has been selling Cafedirect since November last year, pays an agreed fair price. It commits itself to a long-term contract with democratically run farmers' organisations, and pays 60 per cent of the cost in advance, taking no more than 30 per cent of a farmer's harvest. A breakthrough is hoped for this autumn as the consortium negotiates for the Safeway supermarket chain to take Cafedirect nationwide. A trial currently involves 54 Safeway stores in Scotland. Monthly sales of about 11,000  1/4 lb packets, mostly through delicatessens, or health food and charity shops, would surge if this 'fair trade' coffee were available on supermarket shelves. Cafedirect campaigners model their hopes on the Max Havelaar Foundation in Holland, which has over three years made a significant impact on the country's ground-coffee market. Unlike Cafedirect, it does not provide a branded coffee, instead putting its 'fair trade' mark on coffees imported on fair trade terms. Today it accounts for 2,800 tonnes of imports, up from 200 tonnes in 1988. Coffee carrying its mark accounts for annual sales worth Fl 40m (Pounds 12.6m), about 2 per cent of the national market for ground coffee. It is available in 90 per cent of the country's supermarkets. Only Douwe Egbert, the national leader in the coffee market, accounting for 45 per cent of sales, has refused to collaborate with Max Havelaar by using its mark. Max Havelaar coffee has become a market leader in Switzerland, is sold in Belgium, and is soon to be launched in Germany and France. The foundation plans to extend its mark to cocoa and drinking chocolate in spring next year, according to Mr Bert Beekman, its spokesman. Few would claim that Max Havelaar can be any more than a niche product, mainly because it costs up to double the price of normal ground coffees. According to Mr Erich Muller, spokesman for Ahold, Holland's leading supermarket chain: 'It's a special part of the public that is interested in the problems of the third world. For most, price is the most important matter'. But according to Christian Aid's Peter Madden, Cafedirect, like coffees carrying the Max Havelaar mark, has an importance far beyond its sales figures: 'Cafedirect is not an answer to faults in the world trading system, but in campaigning terms it's a very effective way of getting people aware and interested.' Britain's leading third-world aid agencies have become increasingly aware in the past decade that aid alone can do limited good without reform to the trade system. The agencies note that Ethiopia received during the famine year of 1985 a total of Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.58bn) in aid. But in the same year, the collapse in world prices for raw materials such as coffee and copper meant rich countries paid Dollars 19bn less for what they bought from Africa. They blame CAP subsidies for impoverishing third world farmers, because these effectively shut the EC market to third world exporters, and because of the scale on which surplus EC farm products are dumped on the world markets, often depressing prices below the costs of production. Christian Aid will note today that a European cow receives twice as much in EC subsidies as the average income of a third world farmer. Of more immediate relevence to the average European shopper is the fact that each family spends about Pounds 16 a week through higher taxes and food prices because of the CAP, which alone consumes 60 per cent of the EC's budget. Christian Aid argues that fair trade will benefit all, not just because a wealthier third world would provide a market for goods and services from industrial countries, but because it would also lessen the global dangers of conflict, environmental catastrophe and mass migration.</p>

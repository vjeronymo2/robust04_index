			<p>BFN     [Text] [no dateline as received] On 25 May Ukraine's  President Leonid Kravchuk visited the manuscripts department of  the Taras Shevchenko Institute of Literature. During his  meeting with employees of the institute he said it has become  possible to split the solution of the Crimean issue into four  stages: The first three envisage the division of the Black Sea  Fleet, the determining of the sites for its bases, and the  solution of the social and economic problems facing the  peninsula. In the fourth and final stage, political  arrangements should be worked out for settling all the problems  around Crimea. "I always raise this question: Are we with  Russia or under Russia?" Leonid Kravchuk asserted.    Touching on today's political situation in Ukraine, Leonid  Kravchuk said that in political life, unfortunately, there is a  repetition of something that occurred in 1990.</p>

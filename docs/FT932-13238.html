			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Retail sales rise points to end of recession: PM pledges full support for industry and exporters THE THIRD successive monthly rise in high street spending all but confirmed the end of Britain's longest post-war recession yesterday. It gave new impetus to Mr John Major's drive to reassert the government's authority. The volume of retail sales rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent between February and March and was running 4.1 per cent above the levels of the same period last year. The figures, which follow news earlier in the week of another surprise fall in unemployment and a sharp rise in new-car sales, coincided with separate statistics pointing to a further revival in the housing market and exports. Official figures on Monday are expected to mark the end of the recession by reporting a clear increase in first-quarter gross domestic product. In the second of a series of speeches designed to put the crises of the past year behind him, the prime minister said the government would support 'heart and soul' the efforts of industry and exporters to sustain the recovery. Underlining the break with his predecessor's hands-off policy towards manufacturing during the 1980s, Mr Major said: 'The government has a duty to work with industry to help industry meet the challenge . . . Everything we do must be supportive of you.' Addressing businessmen in Manchester, he said Britain was now set for two years of 'solid growth'. The government, he continued, was determined to help industry to achieve the 'competitiveness' needed to expand Britain's industrial base. Anxiety in Whitehall that the present gentle recovery might develop into another consumer-led boom was reflected in repeated exhortations by the prime minister for business to increase its efforts in export markets. He agreed that 'the trade gap is still too wide'. Privately, senior ministers were also cautioning against euphoria, suggesting that they wanted to see increased consumer confidence matched by rises in output and investment. Mr Major told the businessmen: 'Winning back lost markets is the only long-term policy for British industry - for the whole economy. And manufacturing is the soldier in the front line of that struggle.' His optimistic assessment followed a decision to move on to the offensive against Tory opponents of the Maastricht treaty. Last night he repeated his determination to keep Britain at the centre of the debate on the shape of the European Community in the 1990s. The prime minister's message on the economy was echoed by Mr Norman Lamont. Campaigning in the Newbury by-election, the chancellor declared: 'Britain is on the up . . . The recovery is here in manufacturing, in retail sales, in exports and in confidence as well.' The 4.1 per cent increase in retail sales in the year to March was the sharpest year-on-year increase for four years. Compared with February, the volume of sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent in March, the third consecutive monthly rise. The latest trade figures showed that improving exports cut the UK's trade deficit with countries outside the EC to Pounds 918m in March from Pounds 1.25bn in February.

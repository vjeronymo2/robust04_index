			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All written submissions made pursuant to this notice will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division during regular business hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statement of Consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would suspend the ``dairy farmer for other markets'' provisions of the Texas milk order (Order 126). By suspending these provisions, the milk of dairy farmers who were not associated with the Texas market in September-November could be used to supply Order 126 distributing plants during the following months of February-July.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its letter requesting the suspension, Associated Milk Producers, Inc. (AMPI), stated that these provisions are now preventing the cooperative from marketing its milk supplies efficiently. Because of the limitation on which dairy farmers can be producers under the Texas order during the months of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February-July, AMPI was unable to pool more than two million pounds of milk it supplied to an Order 126 distributing plant in Little Rock, Arkansas, during February 1994. The milk of these dairy farmers, who are more favorably located with respect to the Little Rock plant than are the cooperative's Texas producers, was not eligible for pool status because the dairy farmers had not been associated with the Texas market to the extent necessary during the preceding months of September-November. If AMPI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplies the Arkansas plant with milk of eligible Texas producers, the cooperative suffers an economic pooling loss because the Little Rock plant is subject to a minus 39-cent location adjustment, proponent states.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proponent also claims that the market's supply/demand relationship has changed dramatically since these provisions were adopted. Because of these circumstances, AMPI asks that the ``dairy farmer for other markets'' provisions be suspended until the appropriateness of this and other pooling provisions for this market can be explored at a public hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1126  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Milk marketing orders. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The authority citation for 7 CFR part 1126 continues to read as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Secs. 1&hyph;19, 48 Stat. 31, as amended; 7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 6, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lon Hatamiya,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8858 Filed 4&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;02&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

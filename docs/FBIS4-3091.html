			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xiao Kan: "Moratorium on New Investment Funds"] </F>   [Text] The massive development of investment funds will be  suspended this year to ensure the country's financial situation  continues to improve.    The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, will  not give the green light for new funds at least in the first  half of this year, said an official with the bank.    He said the bank would probably approve one or two funds  after July if financial conditions improve.    But it is impossible to see a lot of new funds emerging this  year," he said.    The central bank has informed all provinces that no fund can  be issued or listed without approval from the bank's head office.    At present, about 200 funds involving 30 billion yuan ($3.45  billion) are applying for final approval from the central bank,  which supervises and regulates the country's investment funds.    The official said the funds were suspended to prevent too  much capital being drained away from treasury bonds and savings  deposits.    China plans to issue 100 billion yuan ($11.5 billion) worth  of bonds this year.    Starting this year, bonds will be the government's sole  method for paying off the national budget deficit--estimated at  60 billion yuan ($6.9 billion) for this year.    The country last year had planned to allot 3 billion yuan  ($345 million) to investment funds. However, the shortage of  capital forced authorities to postpone the quota plan to ensure  enough financing for the country's key construction projects.    But the suspension this year will not include  foreign-related  funds since they don't attract domestic capital, the official  said.    Many domestic institutions have co-operated with partners  abroad to set up overseas-based funds to invest in energy, power  and high-tech industries.    The official said China this year will concentrate on  standardizing existing investment funds to lay a firm foundation  for future development.    China's first investment fund was born in 1991. The country  now has 50 funds involving 4.5 billion yuan ($517 million), but  only four have been approved by the People's Bank of China.    Many of the funds have violated the State's policy of  strictly controlling investment in fixed assets, he said. In  addition, some capital raised by the funds are used in  filter-bank lending and speculation in real estate.    The official said the central bank will try to steer these  funds toward investing in treasury bonds.    The official said the central bank is drafting regulations  on  the management of funds and expects to issue them in the first  half of this year.    Chinese scholars have been urging the State to develop  investment funds as an important tool in stabilizing the stock  market, since most engage in long-term investment instead of  short-term speculation.    The funds also offer punters a new form of investment and  allow them to play the stock market more safely.</p>

They saw  President Hafiz al-Asad's Geneva declaration of insistence on a  comprehensive solution on all fronts and on the UN Security  Council resolutions as significant and positive for the peace  process.    Dawud al-Talhami, member of the Political Bureau of the  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] and its  official spokesman, has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the emphasis  on a comprehensive solution and rejection of partial and  separate solutions was a positive sign particularly as such  emphasis also came from the United States. He added that  although there were no details and we still do not know what  happened at the summit, for that will become clear in the  future, what was emphatically stated by President Hafiz al-Asad  calls for Palestinian satisfaction, particularly the insistence  on a comprehensive solution, implementation of Resolutions 242,  338, and 425, and the land-for-peace principle. Al-Talhami also  said that what was stated by President al-Asad and supported by  U.S. President Bill Clinton was positive and represented the  essence of the position we adopt and whose fulfillment we desire.</p>

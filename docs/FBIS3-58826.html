			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd: "The Answer Is </F> Yes"]    [Text] It might seem rather odd, in the midst of my visit  to the turmoil in Bosnia, to say that the world is a little bit  safer this week. However, that, I believe, is the outcome of  last week's NATO summit in Brussels.    Summits are odd creatures. An EC summit, however well  prepared, is always an occasion for some jousting between the  great ones on the second morning. NATO summits come less often,  and are even more intensively prepared: officials hope that in  this way the summit will be a stately dance with no trip-ups or  stumbles.    This last summit in Brussels was admirably prepared. But the  questions before the Alliance, quite apart from the essential  discussion of Bosnia, were so fundamental that they could not be  handled in a routine way. It came out well. The main decisions  are fundamental to the future security of Britain. Would the  idea of the Atlantic Alliance hold? Would the allies show the  imagination needed to extend security across our continent?  Could NATO adapt itself to the new disorders which have largely  replaced the old Armageddon scenario of East versus West?    The summit answered yes to all three questions.    Much depended on President Clinton. He reaffirmed  unequivocally the American commitment to Europe and the Atlantic  Alliance. He made clear that 100,000 American troops would  remain in Europe to buttress the peace and stability which we  have enjoyed for more than 40 years. Of course the United  States is hugely interested in Asia. But we can now have a truce  to the stories that interest in Asia means neglect of Europe.    It is a measure of NATO's success that we tend not to think  about it very much. NATO is just there, getting on with its  job. Few institutions do their job so confidently and  effectively. Without NATO, we could not have protected our  freedom from communist expansion.    American servicemen in Europe are the most tangible  expression of that commitment. The voices raised against that  presence are reassuringly few. Anti-Americanism is out of  fashion on the European Left. Isolationism in the U.S. is still  confined to small pockets within the Democratic and Republican  parties.    The European willingness confirmed at Maastricht, to build  up  the European pillar of the Alliance has shown sceptical  Americans that we are serious about sharing the burden of  collective defence. The closer French involvement in dialogue  with the Americans and in the new work of the Alliance is good  news for us all.    But there is another reason for America's renewed commitment  to the Alliance: it is the sight of new democracies knocking on  NATO's door. The United States will not invest money, troops  and political attention in the European continent simply to  protect rich West Europeans. During the Cold War it was NATO's  task to defend the line dividing freedom and communism against  encroachment from the East. It did that well; but now the line  has evaporated and the task has changed.    Since 1989, people have looked to NATO to extend security  and  stability to the new democracies of Central and East Europe.  That is in Britain's interests. If we want to reduce the risk  of war in West Europe we have to tackle the causes of insecurity  and instability in the East.    How, then, to respond? NATO has taken in new members before  -- Greece, Turkey, Germany and Spain. There is no bar in  principle to its enlarging again. But enlargement is a serious  undertaking -- more, perhaps, than some seem to realise. The  NATO treaty says an armed attack against one signatory should be  considered an attack against them all.    Britain has gone to war twice this century in Europe on  behalf of others. Through NATO we would be ready to do so again  if necessary. But a decision to extend NATO's territory and  commit our troops to the defence of new borders cannot be taken  lightly. We are not talking about membership of a social club.    Deep down we know NATO cannot remain closed. I do not see  how we could deny to other Europeans the benefits which NATO has  brought us. The summit recognised this. It took decisions  which opened the clear perspective of NATO's eventual  enlargement. We agreed it would require great care: the object,  after all, is to strengthen peace and stability in Europe.    Any hasty decision about who does and does not belong to  NATO risks creating a new division in Europe. We do not want to  set Russia's teeth dangerously on edge. Hence the idea of  Partnership for Peace, which everybody, including Russia, is  invited to join on the basis of shared democratic principles and  military co-operation.    The idea is simple: all members of the old Warsaw Pact will  have the chance to enter into individual partnership programmes  with NATO. Each country possesses different military assets and  different experience, so each will choose different dishes from  the NATO menu. Each will undertake, with NATO, to meet specific  political objectives.    These could include joining international treaties, civilian  control of the military, transparency in defence budgets. In  return, NATO will draw each partner into its mechanisms for  planning, training and consultation. If partners are ready to  participate, we would hope to involve them in NATO-led  peacekeeping operations.    This is a sensible and practical way forward. It means that  NATO is committed to the principle of enlargement, but we are  not determining in advance who or when or under what precise  conditions.    So the summit has left us much clearer about how to handle  our friends in Central and East Europe. Some of those friends  would have liked us to go further. All accept that we have  moved a good way. We also talked in a new way about how to  handle the threats we face. Most of the security threats we can  foresee will require a mobile and flexible response from NATO,  as the Gulf and Bosnian conflicts have shown. Peacekeeping and  humanitarian operations will become more frequent but not easier.    NATO should be able to deploy forces overseas on  international missions and involve non-allies if we wish. Not  all the NATO allies need be involved on every occasion. For  example, European forces within NATO could deploy with Alliance  support if the U.S. sees no immediate interest and it is agreed  that the Europeans should lead.    So the summit endorsed the idea of a Combined Joint Task  Force headquarters. These could run operations to be carried  out by NATO, or if that was what we all decided, by, for  example, the European members of NATO. This means that as the  new European common foreign and security policy gradually takes  shape, built brick by brick on particular decisions, there will  be means within NATO to carry out European decisions.    The Western European Union is the link between the two. It  sounds complicated because it is complicated, and much work  still needs to be done on the linkages. But the agreement in  Brussels last week means that there is no question of NATO being  sidelined. The Atlantic and European institutions grow side by  side.    One benefit is that France -- which for many years kept its  distance from NATO's military activities -- will now play a  larger role in Alliance operations, as she has in Yugoslavia. I  welcome this. Britain and France already both move effectively  together as substantial European military powers.    FinallY, we agreed that preventing the proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction is one of NATO's main aims. We want  to see an indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty. The Americans have notched up a great success in  bringing the Russian and Ukrainian governments to an agreement  on nuclear warheads in Ukraine.    It is easy enough to reaffirm faith in NATO with eloquent  speeches. Rhetoric is the bugbear of modern diplomacy. But  this summit did more than that. It took decisions which will  ensure that it remains supple. It showed that NATO is willing  to contribute to security throughout Europe. It showed that the  future of NATO can be as impressive as its past.</p>

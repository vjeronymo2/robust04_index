			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Union plea on pay comparisons UNION discord over pay bargaining may be fuelled this week when union leaders are asked to agree not to use increases for a proposed national minimum wage as a benchmark for other pay deals. The controversial suggestions for a scheme under a future Labour government comes in a heavily revised document on bargaining due to be discussed by the Trades Union Congress general council on Wednesday. Although a clause on the minimum wage has been changed, it says unions will be expected not to quote the agreed minimum pay rise in negotiations for other workers. This could cause difficulties for craft unions, which were concerned about a phrase in the first draft in which unions were asked to disregard the minimum wage rise in talks about more highly paid workers. The document will form the basis for wage bargaining policy which union leaders hope to adopt at September's congress. It provides a much tougher rejection of incomes policies than in the first draft. The issues discussed in the document are contentious because of fears by some unions that a national economic assessment (NEA), which is proposed by the Labour party in part to help determine a national minimum wage, could be a prelude to an incomes policy. Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEU engineers, had not seen the document yesterday but said his union would not accept an erosion of craft differentials. Some of the objections of other unions appeared to be answered, however. One left-wing union official expressed satisfaction that the document appeared to give a fuller commitment to the pursuit of full employment than the first draft. He also noted that it placed less emphasis on the effects of wage inflation and more on the effects on the British economy of productivity and training.</p>

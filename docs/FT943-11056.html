			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Juggernauts collide, parts-maker dented A privately owned US truck parts maker which has never exported to Japan has found itself side-swiped in the duel between the trade juggernauts of Tokyo and Washington, Gordon Cramb writes from Tokyo. Johnson Industries, based in Urbana, Ohio, was accused by Japanese media yesterday of pulling out at the last minute after 18 months of negotiations aimed at supplying Hino Motors, Japan's leading truck maker, with a component to make its vehicles lighter and thus more fuel-efficient. The reason for its withdrawal being put about in Tokyo was that the US economy was now so buoyant that Johnson felt able to reject Hino's order. The shipment would have been for some 10,000 units worth a total of perhaps Dollars 1m. Growth in the US has been running at a rather faster lick than in Japan. The implication of the disclosure was that US companies need no longer bother cutting deals with unfamiliar Japanese customers, because they have more than enough demand at home. Japan's record bilateral trade surplus would therefore remain undented by the pick-up in the US economy. Johnson, although it supplies three of the six biggest US truck makers, is a family-held company which had sales last year estimated at Dollars 25m and employs 250 people - more than one in every hundred in Urbana. Hino, an affiliate of Toyota, Japan's biggest car maker, has annual revenues of Y535.5bn (Dollars 5.4bn) and more than 9,000 staff. In Tokyo a Hino official confirmed yesterday that Johnson had withdrawn in May from negotiations to supply aluminium air reservoir tanks for braking systems, and that his company had turned to domestic suppliers instead. But he added that Hino had no hand in revealing the breakdown two months late. Mr Greg Moore, Johnson vice president, said the potential supplier had been working on an air tank design but that 'the product we were offering was not matching the specifications they were asking for, and there was a mismatch. Time ran out for us as a supplying manufacturer.' He added that his company 'couldn't reach a final contract' for a delivery which was due in November. 'The way we left it, we needed a new design,' he added, saying Johnson believed talks on possible future collaboration could continue. The saga of the failed talks between Hino and an unnamed Ohio supplier was aired on Sunday night by Japan's NHK public television network, and other news media in Tokyo yesterday fingered Johnson as the component maker which stood Hino up 'because of surging demand by US automakers' in a decision which came 'despite long-standing US pressure on Japan to buy more autos and auto parts' from American companies. Hino would suffer as a result, the reports suggested, because it would not be able to switch so soon away from the heavier steel reservoir tanks it had previously used. The Japanese company insisted yesterday, however, that it would not be adversely affected and had not sought to publicise the incident. Nor certainly had Johnson, which said merely that like many possible deals explored between companies across the world operating in the same sector, 'it had never reached the final specifications'.

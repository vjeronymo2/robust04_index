			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Some educators and parents have condemned youthful Bart Simpson, controversial  subject of those "Underachiever" T-shirts. So it came as something of a  surprise the other day when a Loyola Marymount University announcement said  that Simpson would deliver the school's commencement address.  </P> <P> The press release disclosed that Bart, the cartoon son on TV's "The Simpsons,"  would "receive an honorary junior high school diploma" because "he symbolizes  everything this University is all about."  </P> <P> Hold that mortarboard.  </P> <P> The press release was not the work of the university, but of Loyola student  Brian Gurwitz, who pasted the school letterhead on a fake release and sent out  200 copies.  </P> <P> "I wanted to find a humorous way to protest the fact that there was going to be  no commencement speaker," said Gurwitz, a member of the student Senate. "There  were rumors that a Cabinet official was going to be the speaker but had changed  his mind, so the university decided to go without one."  </P> <P> The hoax spurred debate on the subject, and the university finally announced  that Loyola basketball coach Paul Westhead would speak at Saturday's  commencement.  </P> <P> Gurwitz, incidentally, will be among those achievers graduating.  </P> <P> "That's why I was able to do this (hoax)," he admitted.  </P> <P> It could be the next Civil Service position: Trash cop.  </P> <P> A consultant to the county has completed a "Feasibility Study for a Uniform  Recycling Program" that includes a recommendation for such a class of officers.  Their duties would be to "randomly select a floor or section and check who is  actively recycling by looking in individual trash bins at the end of the day."  </P> <P> While several publishers continue negotiations with us for the rights to "The  Golden Treasury of Malathion Poems," we are now planning a second volume, "The  Malathion Song Book."  </P> <P> Randy Larscheid of Westwood contributed three ditties, including "Clean Acres"  (sung to the tune of "Green Acres"):  </P> <P>  Californy is the place to be.  </P> <P>  L.A. living is the life for me.  </P> <P>  Smog spreading out so far and wide.  </P> <P>  Spray malathion -- just watch us run and hide.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Soon to be available on cassette or CD.  </P> <P> Two years ago to the day, followers of the 16th-Century French seer Nostradamus  predicted that disaster would strike L.A.  </P> <P> They were correct.  </P> <P> The disaster was a Caltrans promotion designed to encourage car-pooling.  </P> <P> Guest star Rick Dees, the KIIS radio disc jockey, stationed himself on an  overpass of the Ventura Freeway, offering $100 prizes to the driver of any  passing vehicle that he described on the air -- if the driver exited and  reported to the deejay's mobile unit.  </P> <P> Money-hungry drivers were observed cutting across several lanes to get to Dees.  Traffic was gridlocked for 15 miles.  </P> <P> How could Nostradamus have known?  </P> <P> In the L.A. Tall Tales Contest sponsored by Toastmasters International in San  Pedro, Ivan Gerson recounted how he fell down a cavern into hell after an  earthquake and stumbled upon a weight-loss seminar being taught by Elvis  Presley. Gerson finished third. Maybe one of the judges found the story  plausible.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LAny:  </P> <P> The Original Pantry Cafe, which is open 24 hours a day, claims never to have  been without a customer during its 66-year history. Even when it moved to  Figueroa Street several years ago, meals were served at its old and new  locations simultaneously.  </P></p>

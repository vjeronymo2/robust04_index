			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Observer: Sporting chancer Would you run a mile for a burger? No, neither would Observer. But Steve Cram is hoping that his athletic exploits will inspire fast food fans to cram into Heroes of Sport, a chain of family restaurants he is about to launch. Hard on the heels of the Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood, Cram's cafes will feature sporting memorabilia, rather than the film and pop souvenirs normally associated with such places. While Cram eventually plans to satisfy the appetites of Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield, Coventry and central London, his first venue will open in Newport, south Wales, in October. Let's hope it proves more successful than Newport County Football Club which went belly-up and dropped out of the league in 1988.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> MORE DOCTORS CUT MEDICARE CHARGES  </P> <P> More physicians are agreeing to limit their charges for Medicare patients,  although it is harder to find such a doctor in some states than in others, the  government said today.  </P> <P> The Health Care Financing Administration reported that 283,475 physicians --  40.7% of the 696,848 doctors who bill Medicare -- have signed agreements for  this year to charge Medicare patients no more than the government-approved  amount.  </P> <P> That's an increase from 37.3% in 1988 and 30.6% in 1987, and accounts for more  than 60% of the total Medicare spending on physicians' services, said Louis B.  Hays, acting administrator of HFCA.  </P> <P> In Alabama, 76% of the physicians have agreed to charge only the  Medicare-approved rate for all their Medicare patients, but in Idaho, only 16%  have agreed to participate fully in the program.  </P></p>

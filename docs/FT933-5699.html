			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Fowler to quit as Group 4 director SIR Norman Fowler, chairman of the Conservative party, is to resign as a non-executive director of Group 4 Securitas, the international group of security businesses, from 1 October to spend more time with his party, Alison Smith writes. Sir Norman, who left Mrs Thatcher's cabinet early in 1990 in order to spend more time with his family, said yesterday that since becoming party chairman after the election last year 'my time has become increasingly limited and therefore I have decided, with great regret, to stand down'. He has been a non-executive director for more than three years. In the general election campaign Sir Norman acted as Mr John Major's 'minder', signalling a return to full-time active politics, and for more than a year he has combined the party chairmanship with five non-executive directorships. Group 4 hit the headlines in April when, soon after it had begun work as the first private-sector company to run the service escorting prisoners between prisons and courts, four men escaped or were wrongly released within as many days. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is today to set out the government's plans for further involvement of private-sector companies in managing the prison system. Late last month Judge Stephen Tumim, the chief inspector of prisons, said that inmates at the Wolds, the remand prison run by Group 4, lazed about for much of the day, though he praised the staff and the facilities at the jail. While there is no direct management link between the Group 4 organisations running these services and the parent company which Sir Norman is a director of, the connection was enough to give opposition MPs plenty of scope for humour at his expense. Conservative central office said that Sir Norman had no immediate plans to resign from his other posts. Even so, his decision will raise speculation that he hopes for a return to ministerial office, with a senior post in the cabinet.</p>

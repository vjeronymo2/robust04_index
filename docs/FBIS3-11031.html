			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" Newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] You have probably already heard about this next  report, although yesterday it was only a rumor. Nevertheless,  the National Bank of Mexico [Banamex] confirmed the news at  about 2315 on 14 March. I am referring to the kidnapping of  Alfredo Harp Helu, president of the Banamex Stock and Securities  Co. He is the president of the Administration Council of this  important financial group, which is also known as Banamex  Accival. Harp was kidnapped on 14 March in Coyoacan  neighborhood just before 0800.    The Grand Marquis in which Harp and his chauffeur, Eliseo  Ortiz, were traveling was apparently intercepted by three  people; another report says as many as seven individuals may  have been involved. The car was stopped at the intersection of  Caballo Calco Street and Hidalgo Avenue across from Hidalgo  Park, a few meters from the Coyoacan council building.    According to reports, Eliseo Ortiz was drugged and  handcuffed  by the criminals. Alfredo Harp, according to Banamex sources,  did not resist the kidnappers. Harp was heading for his office  on Madero Street in the historic center of Mexico City at 0800  on 14 March, where he was scheduled to have breakfast with other  Banamex stockholders.    After the kidnapping, chauffeur Eliseo Ortiz received  medical  treatment at Angeles Hospital. The vehicle in which Harp was  traveling, the Grand Marquis, was found at El Rosedal  neighborhood, very close to where the crime was committed. The  chauffeur, after receiving treatment at Angeles Hospital, was  taken to Banamex headquarters on Madero Street, Mexico City,  where he was interrogated by officials from the Attorney  General's Office.    Other sources reported that there was a shoot-out with the  kidnappers in El Rosedal neighborhood and that one of them was  reportedly arrested. Isidoro Resa Valdes, director of the  Federal District Judicial Police, telephoned Harp's residence at  1430 on 14 March. At that time, Harp's family denied Harp had  been kidnapped, saying that he was in Acapulco. Harp, however,  failed to attend the official unveiling of the Mexico Red  Devils, a baseball team he had just purchased along with other  stockholders of the Banamex Accival financial group.    Roberto Mansur, president of the Red Devils and one of  Harp's  partners, has commented on the kidnapping. Mansur said this  incident has affected his partners and the Red Devils' owners so  much that there will be changes in Mexican baseball's opening  day ceremonies. We will have Mansur's statements later.    As of last night, the kidnappers had not contacted Harp's  relatives or representatives of the Banamex Accival financial  group. Officials from various agencies requested that  information not be disseminated because Harp's safety is at  stake.    Stock market analysts who were consulted said they believe  that the drop in the Mexican Stock Exchange's price index on 14  March was strongly influenced by reports of Harp's kidnapping.  A Banamex news release states that the kidnapping has not yet  been confirmed. Meanwhile, the Mexican Stock Exchange suffered  another sharp decline today.

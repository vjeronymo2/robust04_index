			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (10): Protectionism and suspicion of equities - A genuinely open market for pensions in Europe is still some way off THE CURTAIN on a single European market formally goes up in less than eight months' time. But so far as pension funds and their managers are concerned, the long anticipated drama will take rather longer to unfold. It is not just that the draft EC directive on pension fund freedoms - likely to be adopted by member states later this year - will not be implemented in many national legal systems until the mid-1990s. The challenge of securing a genuinely open market for pensions will only be achieved when cultural barriers, local protectionism, and continental suspicion of equities as a suitable investment medium are finally overcome. Major UK groups, such as Morgan Grenfell Investment Management (part of Deutsche Bank), Warburg Asset Management and the merchant bank Robert Fleming, are all chipping away. It seems, however, that some of the UK investment management industry's earlier expectations of picking up mainland European business were overdone. 'The European marketing chaps are the ones with the big expense accounts and glamour lifestyles,' observes an employee in one leading fund management business, a touch irreverently. 'The amount of money which they have brought in is pitiful compared with what we can pick up in the UK.' Signs that the French government, for one, may introduce tax-efficient money-purchase schemes to take pressure off the state - notwithstanding recent opposition from unions and others - is one good reason not to lose heart over Europe. Others are the EC pension fund directive, and pressure which continues to be exerted on Brussels by multinational companies seeking a more efficient way of organising their employees' pension arrangements. Ironically, last October's draft EC pensions directive omitted the freedom which the likes of IBM would most dearly appreciate, namely cross-border membership of funds. The Commission insists that it has not abandoned this principle for the longer term, but acknowledges that the inherent tax complications could hold up progress on the other morestraightforward issues. These are the freedom for pension funds to choose an investment manager anywhere in the Community, and the removal of national restrictions on where and how funds should invest their money. Neither of these will fundamentally alter the UK market per se, but they are highly relevant in countries such as Belgium and Portugal. One question constantly raised by the approaching single market and the reduced currency risk of the exchange rate mechanism is whether the EC should be seen by pension funds as a single area for investment purposes. At the end of last year, however, the split of UK to continental European investments was roughly 6:1, suggesting that old preconceptions die hard. One measure of the appropriate split, for instance, might be individual stock market capitalisations, which showed the UK as 42 per cent of total European stock markets at the end of December 1991. It is not as though historic performance justifies UK pension funds' bias in favour of their domestic territory. Another consideration is whether multinational employers will ultimately want to take advantage of the possibilities for consolidating the pension fund assets of their various European subsidiaries. IBM and Digital Equipment Corporation are among those looking at the options, but Ford Motor company is among those adopting a more cautious approach. The companies which are pursuing consolidation plans clearly think that they will be in a strong position to negotiate a competitive fee structure and reap the advantages of economies of scale. Within the EC, there are signs that some pension funds are beginning to look beyond traditional boundaries for new opportunities - the Dollars 90bn Dutch civil servants pension fund ABP being one cited by the leading consulting group Watsons. Wells Fargo Nikko was a beneficiary to the tune of a Dollars 600m account, but generally the sums involved tend to be much smaller as companies put their toes in the water. Many managers admit that their continental fees are smaller, not least because of competing local banks' ability to take advantage of dealing spreads. The Netherlands is the one market which is recognisable from an Anglo-Saxon point of view. As Mr Patrick Gifford, a director of Fleming Investment Management, puts it: 'Everyone in Holland has a funded pension, and the country is open to non-resident managers.' At this stage, though, it looks as though Europe's big banks and insurers are fiercely protecting their patches from the incoming hordes. Another problem is that the cult of the equity is only slowly catching on, while the saga of employees dependent for their pensions on companies controlled by the late Robert Maxwell has hardly advanced the cause. Some have not been slow to point out that the German system of accounting for pensions on a company's balance sheet has its advantages after all. Reaching clients, meanwhile, is not easy, given that the UK's consultant-led marketing structure is not familiar in continental Europe. Firms such as Watson and Wyatt have blazed a trail, but they are not retained by companies in the same way as in the US and the UK.</p>

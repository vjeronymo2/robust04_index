			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Private banking bad debts rise to Pounds 21m LLOYDS Bank disclosed yesterday that provisions against bad and doubtful debts in private banking increased from Pounds 5m to Pounds 21m largely because of a single bad debt provision in its international private banking operations, writes John Gapper. About Pounds 12m of the provision is believed to relate to an incident involving an employee at its Geneva branch, who disappeared last year following the discovery of Pounds 11.6m in losses on unauthorised foreign exchange dealings. Geneva police put out a warrant for the arrest of the Lloyds' employee in August, and Lloyds said at the time that clients' money was not involved. The branch specialises in portfolio management for wealthy clients. Sir Robin Ibbs, Lloyds' chairman, said yesterday that the bank could make no comment on the Pounds 21m provision beyond the fact that it largely related to a single incident in its private banking operations overseas. The Lloyds' incident was one of two irregularities disclosed in a British-owned bank in Switzerland last year. Rothschild Bank, an affiliate of NM Rothschild &amp; Sons in London, had to shore up its equity base after large loan losses. Investigators in Geneva said in August that the Lloyds employee, who was believed to have fled to Egypt, was a portfolio manager for some of Lloyds' Middle East clients. Some clients instructed him to put their money into foreign exchange futures and instruments only offering the possibility of capital gain because they wanted to comply with the Koran's prohibition of interest-bearing investments.</p>

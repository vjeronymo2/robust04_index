			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Personal View: EC merger control - no soft touch A few months away from its third birthday, the first stage of the European Community's system of merger control has come to an end. So too, perhaps, has its honeymoon period as recent comment in this paper and others has shown. This response is nevertheless useful and welcome at a time when the Commission and in particular its competition minister, Karel Van Miert, is preparing a review of some specific issues, such as whether the turnover thresholds determining jurisdiction are set at the right level to capture most mergers with a cross-border, Community interest. To put some of the recent criticism into perspective, there are some obvious points which need to be made. For example, the Commission's practice on mergers cases is unique among competition agencies in that all cases falling under the merger regulation are the subject of a reasoned decision which is published. This unique level of openness in decision-making does, however, lead to an equally unique degree of exposure to comment. The most important concerns relate to the level of transparency in decision-making and its susceptibility to lobbying; a perceived need for a separation of the powers of investigation and decision; a failure to adopt a more quantitative approach to economic analysis; and the alleged narrowness of the market definitions adopted. Taking the last of these first, it is true that the Commission had indeed been rigorous and conservative in defining the markets affected by a merger, particularly where national and regional differences may still be crucial. But in its subsequent assessment of the market power of the undertakings concerned, it has incorporated wider considerations of potential competition, imperfect substitution of products or the supply characteristics of a market. The Commission is also not closed to a use of econometric methods and quantitative tests, especially in market definition. None the less, they can never be a determinant since some aspects of a competitive situation will always resist quantification. Calls for greater transparency have focused on the idea of separating the responsibility for investigation of mergers from the power of negotiation and decision. This proposal, most frequently expressed as a call for an independent European cartel office, has to be assessed carefully on its merits. The fact that such an office could adopt conclusions based on an independent competition investigation does not settle the question as to the criteria upon which merger would ultimately be authorised or prohibited, nor the thorny issue of which body would have the task of doing so (the Commission, the Council?). A European cartel office would also, like the Commission, have to be made up of representatives of all member states. Until there is greater convergence on the scope, objectives and methodology of competition policy, the work of any competition agency at European level will inevitably lead to some controversy. Such issues would have to be looked at before any changes were proposed to EC treaties and institutions. Meanwhile, the existing merger regulation must be regarded as something of an achievement in that it has identified grounds - strictly competition issues - on which the Commission is empowered to act with respect to mergers of a Community dimension. A lot can also be done to reduce the general concern about the objectivity of investigations and decisions if there is greater transparency in procedures and working methods. Moves to increase transparency would need to be balanced against the risk that they could impose a fresh procedural burden, particularly on unproblematic cases. The Commission is examining possible improvements to see whether they require amendments to the Council regulation or can be made with a more flexible interpretation of the existing provisions. The Commission has received plaudits from businesses for the speed, flexibility and business-minded approach of its Merger Task Force. But it would be wrong to see this as a sign that the Commission is a 'soft touch' for companies. The MTF listens to what they say and tries to avoid unnecessary delay. But it nevertheless is firm in its dealings with the parties and carries out consultations of competitors, customers and other third parties. It has imposed conditions on companies in 15 cases to date and blocked one transaction outright. Groups such as Nestle, De Havilland, Fiat and Alcatel which have been involved in these cases would not describe the Commission as easily dissuaded from its task.

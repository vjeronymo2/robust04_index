			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / TSB to shed 150 senior managers TSB Group is to shed about 150 senior managers as part of a restructuring of its branch network, it announced yesterday. The bank has been slimming its staff by integrating its formerly separate banking and insurance operations. TSB, which cut about 1,000 jobs in the first half of the year, said the management jobs would be lost because it was consolidating three regions into a single national structure and cutting the areas within it from 22 to 10. The banking union Bifu said it had been told as many as 600 clerical jobs were also threatened. TSB said that although it expected more job losses in the second half of the year, Bifu's figure might be exaggerated.</p>

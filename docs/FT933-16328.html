			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / International Company News: Chrysler to sell its stake in Mitsubishi Motors CHRYSLER, the US car manufacturer, will sell its 2.72 per cent stake in Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, ending a 20-year capital link. The timing of the sale, scheduled to take place during the week beginning July 19, comes as the value on its holdings has risen due to the yen's sharp appreciation against the dollar. Under current exchange rates, the stake is worth some Dollars 164m. Mitsubishi officials said the sale would not affect the industrial ties between the two companies. However, it represents a change in the relationship, which has created little synergy. Ties between the companies have become strained as friction between US and Japanese car makers has mounted due to Japan's increasing trade surplus. Chrysler has been one of the most strident critics of Japanese policies. Mitsubishi executives had been angered by Mr Lee Iacocca, former Chrysler chairman, who had demanded limits on Japanese vehicle sales in the US. Earlier this year, Japanese car makers raised prices in the US to avoid protectionist pressure, after the big three US manufacturers - Ford, General Motors and Chrysler - threatened to file an anti-dumping complaint against Japanese makers. Chrysler invested in Mitsubishi Motors in 1971, and the company was run for 15 years as a joint venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. In 1985, when Mitsubishi Motors was listed, Chrysler had a 24 per cent stake, which was reduced to 10.99 per cent in September 1989. Although the crash on the Tokyo stock exchange in 1990 forced the US company to halt its sell-off temporarily, last year resumed its stock sales. In 1991 Chrysler sold to Mitsubishi its 50 per cent stake in Diamond Star Motors, the companies' production joint venture in the US, raising Dollars 100m. The venture was formed in 1985, but Chrysler's investment could not keep pace with Mitsubishi's ambitious expansion plans. Last year, sales of Mitsubishi and Diamond Star cars by Chrysler totalled 128,764 units, down 20.5 per cent from 1989, while Mitsubishi's shipments of its engines to Chrysler fell to 402,000 units, down 21.6 per cent. Nikko Securities will lead the public subscription of the 23.25m shares. Investor demand will be assessed from July 8 to July 14, with the sales price likely to be determined on July 15. Mitsubishi's share price yesterday fell 1.4 per cent to Y760 on the Tokyo stock exchange due to jitters that Chrysler's sale would add negative pressure to the share price.</p>

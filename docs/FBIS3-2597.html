			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China editor, in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Chinese President and Communist Party chief Jiang  Zemin has called for a tough crackdown on elements causing chaos  as the nation faces serious potential instability following  sweeping reforms. The appeal to the army, military police,  public security, and state security organs across the country is  believed to be the prime cause of the authorities' detentions  and arrests of dissidents before the annual session of the  National People's Congress, to be opened today.    Mr Jiang's remarks, followed by the crackdown on leading  dissidents, indicate that China may adopt a tough stance in the  talks on human rights issues with U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, who starts his to Beijing visit tomorrow. "Any  unstable element should be wiped out when it is in the embryonic  stage and any issue should be dealt with properly and thoroughly  before it sprouts and grows roots," Chinese sources yesterday  quoted Mr Jiang as saying to law and order enforcers.    During recent visits to the provinces, Mr Jiang, who is also  the chairman of the Central Military Commission, summoned  regional army, armed police, public security, and state security  officers to make his points. Mr Jiang's speeches have been  compiled into a document which is now being circulated to the  army and all other law enforcement departments nationwide.    Chinese sources quoted Mr Jiang as telling senior public  security and armed police officers in Xian, the capital of the  northwestern Shanxi Province, on 2 February, that: "We must be  determined to crack down on any troublemakers, wipe out any  unstable elements, and solve any social problems that may spur  instability in society at the earliest stage. And the earlier  we solve these problems, the less we will suffer."    Mr Jiang, General Secretary of the Communist Party Central  Committee, also called on the army and law enforcers to stay  alert in the current situation at home and abroad. "We,  especially those responsible for safeguarding our nation, should  have a strong sense of 'suffering and misery' in this historical  moment as our nation is undergoing unprecedented fundamental  changes," Mr Jiang said. He urged the army and law enforcers to  try their best to ensure a stable social environment and law and  order by suppressing dissidents and criminals. "Law enforcement  departments should do their best to safeguard the achievements  in development and reform and ensure that this endeavor by the  Chinese Communist Party and the people should not suffer  overnight because of the negligence of our comrades," Mr Jiang  said.    The party chief explained that the sense of "suffering and  misery" required every comrade in the enforcement departments to  stay alert at all times. He said enemies at home and abroad had  never abandoned their plots to undermine China's national unity  and sabotage China's reform and development cause -- adding that  the human rights row was one such case. However, Mr Jiang said  the domestic and world political and economic situation was very  good and favoured China's ruling party and the people.</p>

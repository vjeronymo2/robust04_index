			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Solvency of pensions is a decision for government Sir, Norma Cohen's article, 'Actuaries attack plan on pension solvency standards' (November 18), and Lex ('Solvency standards', November 21) refer to the proposed minimum solvency requirement (MSR) which will be introduced in this year's pensions bill. The articles rightly identify a debate which has gone on since the Goode Committee published its report, on the basis for the MSR and, in particular, the extent to which equity returns are reflected in it. The fundamental issue at stake is the choice between two definitions of a minimum solvency requirement. One is an MSR which provides a very high degree of security for the members' benefits covered. This implies a relatively high proportion of gilts and, for some schemes, could have potentially costly implications, as in a significant number of cases they will need either to increase funding targets or adjust the investment strategy which they would otherwise have followed, or both. The other is an MSR which includes a more significant equity element. This will cause fewer problems for schemes, but somewhat less certainty about the benefits being secured for the members has to be accepted. It is about this choice that there has been so much debate within the actuarial profession. This debate has been lively, but I am glad to say not acrimonious. We have worked closely with the government officials concerned to investigate the alternatives, but in the end we have made it clear that we believe the job of striking the right balance is one for government and not for the actuarial profession.

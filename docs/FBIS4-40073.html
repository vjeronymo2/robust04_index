			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 14 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev opposed any unilateral steps in Bosnia and said  the US intention to lift arms embargo against Bosnian Muslims  can throw the world back to the times of the "Cold War".    "Russia will not resort to unilateral steps in its policy in  the region which are not connected with the peaceful settlement  and may destroy the basics of international peace and security.  Such measures would be contrary to the Russian national  interests, contrary to the basic interests of the people of  Yugoslavia", he told Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic on  Tuesday.    Kozyrev urged other countries to refrain from unilateral  actions and expressed hope that the US Administration will not  support the intention of the Congress to unilaterally lift the  arms embagro on Bosnian Muslims.    "Otherwise a violation of the (UN) Security Council  resolutions, the UN Charter will be evident which would create a  new political situation. If any of the powers begins to  unilaterally support those `under its wardship', the world will  return to the worst times of the `Cold War'", he said.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Rao offers hand of peace to Pakistan MR P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, yesterday offered to hold 'wide-ranging and sustained bilateral discussions' with Pakistan on issues including Kashmir. In a message to Ms Benazir Bhutto, the newly elected prime minister, Mr Rao said New Delhi looked forward to working with Pakistan to promote peace and stability in the region and normalise relations between the two countries. An Indian official said later senior diplomats from both countries would hold discussions in Cyprus, where they will be attending the Commonwealth conference. Earlier, violence erupted on the streets of Srinagar, capital of Kashmir, after talks on ending the siege of the city's holiest shrine collapsed. At least 40 people were injured as security forces used tear gas and batons to disperse hundreds of demonstrators marching in support of militants who have taken control of the shrine and are surrounded by troops. Meanwhile, Pakistan expelled an Indian diplomat and three staff for 'indulging in espionage'. This follows India's demand that four Pakistani diplomats leave.</p>

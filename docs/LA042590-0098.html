			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANAHEIM MAN SLAIN EXECUTION-STYLE IN GEORGIA RESTAURANT  </P> <P> An Anaheim accountant was killed execution-style as he sat in the bar of a  crowded Savannah, Ga., restaurant, authorities said.  </P> <P> Jon Berry Bragg, 52, died after being shot once at close range by an  unidentified assailant, Savannah Police Officer Joseph Hill said.  </P> <P> The bullet entered behind Bragg's ear, he said.  </P> <P> According to police, the gunman walked into Bennigan's restaurant, approached  Bragg from behind and fired a small-caliber pistol at his head.  </P> <P> The gunman then ran out of the restaurant, Hill said.  </P> <P> Police have identified no motive or suspects. Investigators, however, are  looking into the possibility that the shooting was by a professional killer.  </P> <P> A Bennigan's spokesman declined comment, but police said restaurant employees  told them Bragg was a regular customer. Hill said Bragg was a native of  Savannah.  </P> <P> "He apparently commuted between here and California frequently," Hill said.  </P></p>

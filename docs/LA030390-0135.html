			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY TO GET $250,000 TOWARD PIER PROJECT  </P> <P> Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder on Monday is scheduled to donate a  $250,000 county matching grant to help the city rebuild its municipal pier.  </P> <P> Wieder, whose district includes Huntington Beach, expects that the contribution  will be the first of several county donations toward the pier project, said  Barbara Foster, an executive assistant to the supervisor.  </P> <P> In order to collect the grant, the city must raise an additional $55,000,  Deputy City Administrator Richard Barnard said. The city's Pier Committee and  advisory board, established to raise money for the project, have already  collected $180,000 in private donations and has another $15,000 available to  reconstruct the city landmark, Barnard said.  </P> <P> The pier project is listed as a priority issue on the county budget proposed  for 1990-91, Foster said. If the budget is approved, the city could receive as  much as $1 million more in county funds during the next year, she said.  </P> <P> The county's financial help could prove crucial to the project. City officials  estimate it will cost at least $10.5 million to rebuild the pier. The Pier  Committee has reported that its efforts to raise money thus far have been well  below expectations.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, city officials say that the new pier will be completed by its  target opening date of Labor Day, 1991.

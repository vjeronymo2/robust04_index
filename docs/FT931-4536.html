			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (8): Rat-catcher syndrome - Andrew Jack on debt-chasers' image problem TIMES MAY be tough for companies and individuals who owe money, but the debt collection industry claims that they are no more pleasant for it either as a result of the UK's prolonged recession. 'We had a record year,' says Mr David Baber, chairman and managing director of Credit Protection Association. Turnover in 1992 was up 40 per cent to Pounds 7m, and profits stood at Pounds 3.2m. Intrum Justitia, the Swedish-based debt collection group which claims to be the biggest in Europe and possibly the world, says profits rose by more than a third last year to Pounds 11.6m, on turnover up by nearly a half to Pounds 75m. Mr Baber says that his company has more than 4,000 regular customers on its books seeking to recover unpaid bills, and a further 6,000 who pay on an ad hoc basis. 'On any day we could be sending out 1,500 letters,' he says. 'We have about 2,000 cases at some stage of legal action with a solicitor retained.' Yet the industry claims that the recession has not been good news. 'There's a lot less meat on the bone,' says Mr Larry Lewis, chairman and joint managing director of the Lewis Group. 'We have to work harder in a recession.' That is in spite of his company's 1992 increase in profits to Pounds 720,000 from Pounds 243,000 in the previous year. The argument is that both consumers and companies have become much more reluctant to pay their debts during the recession. Consumer spending has declined in response to the downturn, reducing the size of the market. At the same time, companies which are owed money have increasingly brought their debt recovery work in-house rather than contracting it out. They have turned to other solutions to outstanding debts such as factoring. There has also been a sharp increase in competition. Traditionally, solicitors did not want to be associated with debt recovery. Now, some argue, the collapse of the conveyancing monopoly and of the housing market has forced firms to turn to new areas. They have been aided by new computer systems and the relaxation of restrictions of advertising. Indeed, one recent survey showed that lawyers accounted for four-fifths of the advertisements in a trade journal for debt collection services. The hard-nosed attitudes and the stigmatised image of the industry remain. Call many of the UK's debt collection groups and it is difficult to get past the tenacious operator who answers the phone, let alone get through to speak to the managing director. 'The general reputation in the UK is appalling,' says Mr Jan Erik Paulden, group communications manager at Intrum Justitia. 'You only have to go to a party and tell people what you do and see the reaction.' The negative attitudes are partly a function of the many hundreds of localised door-to-door collectors around the country, who are often paid on commission and may apply less than scrupulous methods to help aid recoveries. There are also the scare stories of knee-cappers with even more ruthless means. 'Some probably does go on,' says Mr Baber. 'Some very large people certainly come round to our offices from time to time offering their services.' New causes for concern include access to sensitive personal data, which the collectors can use to make assessments of individuals' and companies' ability to pay. Generally, the negativity relates to the perceived profits derived from an unpleasant act, of course. Mr Mike Scully, secretary of the Credit Services Association, says: 'There is still this negative image. There are people on the fringes but this is quite a sophisticated business. I think we are necessary - evil is too strong a word - but we are necessary, like rat catchers. We are really like doctors faced with the plague. You can't cure all the patients.' Mr Scully says that his association does have the power to dismiss or reprimand members, although it has never done so. He says he receives about two to three calls of complaint a month, many of which are trivial and many which refer to allegations against firms which are not members. Intrum would like to see more government-inspired regulation of the industry. It helped support the association, and has its own strict code of ethics. It has also embarked on an ambitious marketing campaign with the themes of prompt payment and civility, using the slogan 'Pay fair  .. please.' In common with a number of the larger agencies, many of its staff are women, who are seen to be less confrontational. One of practitioners' biggest gripes is the slowness of the county court system for pursuing actions to recover debt. That helps explain why it is negotiating with the Lord Chancellor's Office for its members to be able to represent clients directly in court. The structure and future shape of debt collection is changing fast. Mr Lewis points particularly to the expanding use of technology. His company is about to begin using sophisticated 'predictive dialling' equipment. This automatically makes telephone calls to those being pursued, and filters out those whose numbers are unobtainable. He says that leaves his staff far more time to speak to those who are contactable, and estimates that it helps increase the response rate from six to nine calls an hour up to about 35. Computer equipment is also boosting the ease of issuing summonses through the courts. Now more advanced software is helping in a wide variety of ways including credit-rating, gathering information and tracking down people and companies. Clients are able to shift bulk bad debt information rapidly and directly between their own computers and those of the debt collection agencies. Meanwhile, the debt recoverers are increasingly trying to encourage clients to employ them at an earlier stage. That has substantial cash flow advantages and offers a more regular all-in fee rather than a commission-based structure.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     TRADE CREDIT INSURANCE (1992 %)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Market Shares              Domestic       Export        Total  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- NCM Credit                  2             70            23 Trade Indemnity            82             20            63 ECGD                       10                            3 Panfinancial                9                            6 Namur                       7                            5 Total                      100            100           100 Size of Market             pounds140m     pounds85m     pounds225m  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Datamonitor Research  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

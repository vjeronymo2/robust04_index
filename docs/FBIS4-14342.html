			<p>BFN     [Text] Trilateral talks among Christopher, Peres, and  'Arafat began in Cairo today. The three sides discussed the  resumption of the Middle East peace talks and the implementation  of the Gaza-Ariha Accord.    According to most observers, before being effective in  overcoming the present differences, the meeting has merely been  a show for indicating the three sides' interest in reaching an  agreement. The analysts say that the main goal being pursued by  Mr. Christopher during his Middle East tour, which began on  Wednesday, is nothing except persuading the Arabs to resume  compromise talks with Israel. Despite this, in view of the  outcome of Christopher's Wednesday meeting in Riyadh, Saudi  Arabia, with the foreign ministers of the southern Persian Gulf  countries, some political observers say that, as before, the  U.S. secretary of state, during his meetings with the foreign  ministers of the regional countries, besides increasing the  interregional countries' differences, is persuading the Arab  countries of the Middle East to lift economic sanctions against  Israel. The United States has been basically pursuing the same  very goal for the past year, which is also part of its strategy  that, on the one hand, the pro-U.S. Arab countries are brought  closer to Israel and, on the other, on various pretexts, any  country opposing the U.S. imperialist policies in the Middle  East is projected as a new enemy of the Arabs instead of Israel  and their old enemy, that is Israel itself, is projected as the  apparent friend of the Arabs.    However, during his Middle East tour, Mr. Christopher while  continuing his strategy, is seeking to remove the factors that  have halted the compromise talks. But it is already evident  that he will have no success in this goal because Arab states  have now discerned that the Zionist regime is trying to get  maximum concessions while giving minimum concessions in return.  Therefore any plan being pursued by the Americans eventually  falls within this framework. This matter has already been  established over the past three years when the compromise talks  opened in Madrid.    Some Arab allies of America in the region, without paying  any  attention to the events taking place behind the scene, are  adopting their political stance as agents of Washington and Tel  Aviv solely for the sake of holding on to their rule for some  more time. This has prevented the Arab states to form a united  front in the face of the Zionist regime. It is even more  painful to note that these Arab states are distancing themselves  further from their own Muslim masses. Under such conditions,  Washington and Tel Aviv, without any concern about the future,  are trying to gain maximum concessions from the governments  which are a party to negotiations with the Zionist regime by  exploiting the differences among them and through creating a  rift among the Arab and non-Arab Islamic states.</p>

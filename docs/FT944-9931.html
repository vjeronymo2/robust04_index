			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / US move to ease Bosnia arms ban strains Nato unity: France calls for emergency meeting on embargo Britain and France yesterday voiced strong concern at President Bill Clinton's decision to end US participation in enforcing the United Nations arms embargo against the Bosnian government. The protests prompted the US to move quickly to reassure its allies, insisting the measures did 'not amount to a unilateral end of the Bosnian arms embargo'. Nato, meanwhile, said it would still enforce the arms ban. Mr Willy Claes, Nato secretary-general, said the alliance would 'continue to enforce fully and totally all UN security council resolutions which form the basis of our involvement in former Yugoslavia'. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, told Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, that France was 'deeply worried' by Mr Clinton's decision that 'we can only regret'. Mr Juppe called for an emergency meeting of the international contact group on Bosnia, which consists of the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, also described the unilateral policy change by the US as worrying. But his spokesman said British fears were eased after a telephone conversation with Mr Christopher. The US secretary of state told Mr Hurd that although US ships and aircraft would be withdrawn from efforts to enforce the embargo, US officers assigned to Nato - which oversees the operation - would continue their duties. Britain and France have criticised US efforts to end the embargo, saying they will lead to increased fighting in Bosnia and jeopardise peacekeeping troops. However, the Clinton administration hopes the latest measure will signal US opposition to the Bosnia arms embargo and increase pressure on Serbs to accept a peace settlement. US officials said the immediate effect of the measure would be small as only three ships out of 42,000 challenged since the embargo began 17 months ago have been caught carrying arms to Bosnia. Mr Clinton's decision means US aircraft and the three ships in the 19-warship flotilla patrolling the Adriatic Sea will not intercept vessels carrying weapons bound for Bosnia from early tomorrow. However, US ships will remain in the region to enforce the blockade against Montenegro, an ally of Serbia. Mr Clinton's order also means US forces will be prohibited from sharing with allies any intelligence they gain on arms shipments bound for Bosnia. But a defence official said the US would not supply arms to Bosnia and would still bar US citizens from doing so in compliance with UN resolutions. Mr Clinton's decision was required by Congress, which ordered a cut-off of funds for the Bosnia embargo by November 15 if Bosnian Serbs did not accept an international peace plan. It comes in the wake of the Republican party's sweeping victory in Tuesday's congressional elections. In Moscow, the Russian parliament criticised the US move and said it 'would lead to chaos and arbitrary behaviour in international relations'.

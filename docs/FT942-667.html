			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Zeneca signs Dollars 100m Chinese venture deal Zeneca, the agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals group, is to invest Dollars 100m (Pounds 65.7m) in China in the next five years after signing two framework agreements with government organisations. These included a memorandum of understanding with the Chinese government covering the company's involvement in agrochemicals production and a joint venture consultancy contract with Sino-Pharm, the foreign trade corporation of the State Pharmaceutical Corporation of China. Mr David Barnes, Zeneca's chief executive, said in Beijing that the group was close to finalising arrangements with a joint venture partner to build a Dollars 60m plant producing paraquat, the active ingredient in its Gramoxone herbicide. The plant, in which Zeneca would have at least a 75 per cent stake, would be located in the Yangtze River Delta near Shanghai. Capacity would be 15m litres of paraquat annually. Zeneca, which was floated in London and New York in June last year following its demerger from ICI, plans to use its Yangtze Delta plant as a base for developing the market for its agrochemicals products throughout China.</p>

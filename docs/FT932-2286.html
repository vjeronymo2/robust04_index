			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Fluoridation of water may rise THE PROSPECT of govern-ment action to extend the fluoridation of water supplies was raised by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday. She will meet representatives of the Water Companies Association on July 7 and is expected to urge action to increase the number of people receiving fluoridated water beyond the present 6m who are mainly around Birmingham. Mrs Bottomley gave an indication of her intentions at the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts conference in Bournemouth yesterday, when she said the time had come to look again at some of the obstructions and difficulties. She said in reply to a question that she would personally be outraged if she did not have fluoridated water. Next month's meeting will coincide with the first anniversary of the government's Health of the Nation strategy, aimed at improving overall health standards. Mrs Bottomley said the anniversary might be an appropriate time to carry forward the fluoride issue. Dental care is not one of the priority areas covered by the Health of the Nation strategy. Mrs Bottomley might be tempted to make it one, using a measure relating improved dental health to fluoridation. Previous attempts to fluoridate water supplies have been fraught with political and moral divisions over whether it is acceptable to medicate a basic natural resource. Supporters argue that there is no evidence of risk and that the policy should be pursued for its dental benefits. Opponents say fluoridation denies individuals freedom of choice. Mrs Bottomley's meeting will coincide with a programme in the BBC TV Nature series in which Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, will question Labour's traditional pro-fluoride position. He will say that mass medication of water supplies is a 'very dangerous move to make'.</p>

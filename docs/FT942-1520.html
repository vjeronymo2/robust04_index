			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: MEPC to buy Belfast shopping centre MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, has agreed to buy the Castlecourt shopping centre in Belfast from John Laing, the construction and housebuilding group, for initial and deferred payments expected to exceed Pounds 80.5m. The deal is in line with MEPC's strategy of increasing the retail component of its portfolio. John Laing is selling the property because it does not wish to be a long term holder of developed investment properties. John Laing intends to use the proceeds from the disposal to expand existing activities, particularly projects in the Pacific Rim, and in private infrastructure in the UK. MEPC has agreed to pay an initial sum of not less than Pounds 72.5m next month, and a further minimum amount of Pounds 1.65m next February. There will be additional payments up to 1998, based on the capitalised value of rents achieved on further lettings and the outcome of rent reviews. The deal is subject to shareholders' approval. The 320,000 sq ft shopping centre opened in April 1990. Rental income in 1993 was Pounds 5.2m. It has been valued on an open market basis at Pounds 80.5m. The net book value of Castlecourt at the end of last year was Pounds 60m. The disposal will generate an extra Pounds 7.1m of pre-tax profits for Laing's full year and will realise net cash of Pounds 30m, after the deduction of costs and repayment of Pounds 40m of bank borrowings. Laing has also agreed to sell Churchgate in Peterborough for Pounds 2.5m, payable on completion and a minimum further consideration of Pounds 2.5m, payable within five years. Laing said trading conditions remained difficult in its UK construction activities and margins remained under pressure. However, work intake compared favourably with this time last year.</p>

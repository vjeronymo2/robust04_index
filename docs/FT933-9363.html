			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Performance pay deal could give top civil servants 3.5% TOP CIVIL servants could win pay increases this year averaging 3.5 per cent  -more than double the government's 1.5 per cent public sector pay limit - under a performance pay arrangement offered by the Treasury. Members of the Association of First Division Civil Servants (FDA) are currently being balloted on the offer, which affects more than 10,000 civil servants in grades seven to five (principals to assistant secretaries). The offer is similar to the deal agreed earlier this year with more than 100,000 white-collar civil servants. Such deals do not formally breach the government's public sector pay ceiling because the Treasury agreed last year that money previously used for annual increments would in the future be used for performance-related pay. Annual increments, which are enjoyed by a large percentage of public sector workers, including civil servants and nurses, are excluded from the 1.5 per cent pay limit. However, Unison, the new 1.4m-strong public sector union, which represents large numbers of workers who do not get an-nual increments, said it was 'inconsistent and unfair' that civil servants were treated differently from other public sector workers. A spokeswoman for the union, formed from a merger of the Nalgo, Nupe and Cohse public service unions in June, said that workers such as firefighters and ambulance workers, who are balloting on strike action in protest at the 1.5 per cent limit, had not been offered a similar deal. Senior civil servants have been offered a 1.25 per cent increase for inflation plus a further 2.25 per cent which in the past would have been used for annual increments. If the offer is accepted, government departments will be free to decide whether to award a total of 3.5 per cent for performance or to provide a standard increase of 1.25 per cent, with the rest used to reward performance. The FDA said that the total pay bill for their members would only increase by 1.25 per cent because the increments were traditionally self fin-ancing. The government has indicated that while there must be no 'catch-up' on public sector pay after this year's 1.5 per cent limit, there will be a more flexible approach in 1994-95.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The problem of unprofitable enterprises and  enterprises which have completely or partially suspended  production is a problem which has always concerned the  provincial party committee and government.    Li Changchun, secretary of the provincial party committee,  held separate discussions with officers of unprofitable  enterprises, officers of enterprises which have had to  completely or partially suspend production, and with the  competent departments in charge of textile enterprises in  Zhengzhou at the offices of the provincial party committee on 12  and 13 April to help enterprises find solutions to their  problems and offer suggestions for enterprises to recover as  soon as possible.    During the discussions, Li Changchun frequently chipped in,  giving his views on the questions raised by meeting  participants. Comrade Li Changchun pointed out: Enterprises  suffering losses and are having to suspend production is, in the  final analysis, an inevitable phenomenon as the old structure is  being replaced by the new, and is the result of the failure of  enterprises to change operational mechanisms and manage  themselves well. The solution to the problem lies in deepening  reform. For this purpose, he made three suggestions:    1. First, to intensify reform and speed up the pace of  changing enterprises' operational mechanisms, we should  emancipate our minds, upgrade our concepts, make bold  explorations, and enhance our sense of urgency and  responsibility. Enterprise operators and employees must  conscientiously study the decision of the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the theory of the  socialist market economy and clearly understand in both theory  and practice the urgency of changing enterprise operational  mechanisms so that everybody will willingly get involved in the  reform. Second, we should intensify reform by starting with the  property rights relationship and modes of asset operation. Some  enterprises must backtrack from the old structure characterized  by large size and a higher degree of public ownership and  restore the shareholding cooperative system at an accelerated  pace. Various contract systems can be introduced such as [word  indistinct]. Third, we should intensify reform in the selection  of enterprise operators and appropriately introduce the  competitive mechanism. In selecting enterprise operators, we  should adopt the method of "choosing horses at the horse track"  instead of letting those removed from the enterprise decide, set  operational goals, and let the best candidates distinguish  themselves through competition and take up their posts. We  should introduce a democratic election mechanism in an organized  way, under which a factory director is elected democratically so  that he can share ups and downs with his employees. We should  devote efforts to the reform of the three systems in enterprises  and really ensure that employees can be both hired and  dismissed, cadres can be promoted and demoted, and people can be  assigned to higher or lower jobs. We should deeply cut the  administrative structure and reduce the number of nonproductive  personnel. As far as enterprises suffering losses and  suspending production completely or partially, no units or  individuals should interfere in their internal structural setups.    2. We should expedite the readjustment of the product mix in  accordance with market demands. While changing enterprise  operational mechanisms, we should promptly readjust the product  mix, gear to market needs, and develop the products which are  marketable and promise high efficiency.    3. We should strengthen ideological and political work among  enterprise employees and maintain social stability. In  difficult times, enterprise operators should share ups and downs  with their employees. In regard to major expenditures,  enterprises should follow the mass line and talk with the masses  of employees. Enterprises should find ways to help the employees  who have special financial difficulties to solve their  difficulties.    Li Changchun urged leaders of economic departments and  competent departments in charge of enterprises at all levels to  correct their guidance, help enterprises suffering losses and  enterprises suspending production, try every possible means to  eliminate trouble and solve difficulties for them, and earnestly  create conditions for them to turn losses into profits.    Fan Qinchen, standing committee member of the provincial  party committee and vice governor, and Vice Governor Yu Jiahua  attended and spoke at the meeting which was held on the  afternoon of 13 April.</p>

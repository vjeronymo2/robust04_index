			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Sotheby's achieves 22% rise to Dollars 23.3m Sotheby's Holdings, the parent company of Sotheby's, the New York-based auction, finance and real estate operation, reported improved second-quarter and first-half results, helped by the continuing recovery in the international art market. For the six months ended June 30 pre-tax income rose by 22 per cent to Dollars 23.3m (Pounds 15m) against Dollars 19.1m. Auction revenue rose from Dollars 114.5m to Dollars 122.3m as overall revenues rose by Dollars 8.45m to Dollars 132.4m. Net income per share increased from 21 to 25 cents. Auction sales for the second quarter increased 5 per cent to Dollars 530.8m, while over the six months they rose 9 per cent from Dollars 635.2m to Dollars 692.1m. The figures confirm the slow improvement in the international art market highlighted last month when Sotheby's announced sales 15 per cent up at Dollars 1.38bn in the 1993-94 season. Rival Christie's reported an 11 per cent increase in turnover to Dollars 1.17bn. Two smaller London-based houses also registered improvements last month, Phillips gaining 12.5 per cent to Pounds 88m and Bonhams 21 per cent to Pounds 33.9m. Ms Diana Brooks, Sotheby's Holdings president and chief executive, said: 'Our auction sales for the six-month period increased 9 per cent and reflect a pattern of broad-based growth in many collecting categories, principally due to strong results for a number of single-owner sales.'</p>

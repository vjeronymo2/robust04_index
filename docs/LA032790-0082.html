			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REALITY SETS IN: LIFE IN THE ECONOMIC FAST LANE MAY BE OVER  </P> <P> Earlier this year, John P. LaWare visited his old stamping grounds in Boston,  where economic gloom is thicker than a March fog on Boston Harbor.  </P> <P> LaWare, who left his job as chairman of Shawmut Bank two years ago to become a  member of the Federal Reserve Board, gently chided some of his friends for  having lost their perspective.  </P> <P> "I know most of you have had the sometimes hair-raising experience of driving  on the Mass Pike," he said in a speech to the Chamber of Commerce. "Although  the posted speed limit is 55, most of the traffic whirs along at 65 to 70.  After you have been traveling with the crowd, well over the limit, if you have  to slow down to 55, you have the feeling you are just crawling along. Travel in  the fast lane is exhilarating, and when you have to slow down there is a sense  of disappointment and frustration."  </P> <P> In Massachusetts and other parts of the Northeast there is plenty of  disappointment and frustration with a regional economy that clearly is lagging  after years in which, as LaWare put it, "we were on a roll, and it didn't look  like it would ever stop."  </P> <P> That same sense of moving out of the fast lane is hardly confined to the  Northeast. It has hit Washington and some other metropolitan areas, and in a  way, the United States as a whole.  </P> <P> Booms have not turned to busts, either locally or nationally. Even in  Massachusetts the unemployment rate has only risen to match the national  average of 5.3%. Rather, what has happened is that some key ingredients for  rapid growth, especially unemployed labor, have disappeared.  </P> <P> Nationally, after six years of expansion during which unemployment was cut in  half, economic growth has slowed enough that the jobless rate has been  virtually unchanged for nearly a year and a half.  </P> <P> Like it or not, such a slowdown was inevitable at some point. Just like  highways, economies have speed limits, and they cannot readily be changed by  governments.  </P> <P> As the president's Council of Economic Advisers put it in its annual report  last month, "The nation's productive capacity depends on the level of  technology, the supply and quality of capital, and the number and skills of  workers."  </P> <P> After recessions, stepped-up use of readily available labor and capital --  unemployed workers and shuttered factories -- translates quickly into growth in  the output of goods and services. "As in most economic expansions, much of the  relatively rapid growth since the recovery began in 1982 can be attributed to  increases in the employment and utilization of existing resources." the report  said.  </P> <P> In many parts of the country, the extended expansion created a sense that such  fast growth was "normal" and raised expectations to unrealistic levels. With  relatively few idle workers, factories or machines in the United States today,  the CEA cautioned that "fewer opportunities to increase utilization of  available resources remain."  </P> <P> CEA Chairman Michael J. Boskin and his two colleagues project in their report  that productivity gains -- increases in the goods and services produced during  each hour worked -- will become a more important source of economic growth than  increases in the size of the labor force during the 1990s. That would be a  reversal from the past two decades.  </P> <P> Even though the Bush CEA is somewhat less cautious about the risk of higher  inflation than a number of other economists and policy-makers, including most  of those at the Federal Reserve, the report's long-term economic projections  indicate that the council does not think that the unemployment rate should be  pushed below 5%. Doing so could spur faster growth in wages and benefits, which  would lead to higher inflation.  </P> <P> If faster growth added to the demand for labor only in states such as Michigan,  Louisiana and West Virginia, all of which have unemployment rates of 7% or  more, perhaps the national rate could be lowered without putting added pressure  on wages in those areas in which unemployment was average or below.  </P> <P> To some extent, market forces work in that direction as employers seeking to  expand or reduce costs shift operations to areas in which labor is more  plentiful. But there is little that any government policy can do to encourage  job creation in a particular spot -- except by making choices for where it  spends its own money, such as for military bases or the planned $8-billion  superconducting supercollider slated for Texas. Certainly the Federal Reserve  does not know how to do it.  </P> <P> At a hearing recently, Rep. Olympia Snowe, D-Maine, sought some words of  reassurance from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan about the problems in her state  and region. "Do you look at the regions in determining our monetary policy, or  do you think it's just unique to that particularly region?" she asked.  </P> <P> Replied Greenspan, "Unfortunately, our monetary policy can only be national  because we are dealing with a national interest rate, a national currency and  basically national prices."  </P> <P> Snowe described the results of the shock from dashed expectations. In Maine,  she said, "people are retrenching in terms of their spending. I mean they just  lack the confidence.  </P> <P> "Even though they have a job and the unemployment rate hasn't increased  significantly to indicate that there is something seriously wrong in that area,  people are nevertheless hesitant about spending because of the decline in the  value of real estate and whatever else has happened."  </P> <P> This confrontation with reality became inescapable when the Northeast  effectively ran out of available labor. In coming years, economists studying  regional patterns believe, above-average growth will come in states in the  South and West, where labor will be available because of relatively high  population gains.  </P> <P> When labor markets get tighter than average, wages tend to rise faster than  average. At least that has been true in the Northeast, according to the Labor  Department's employment cost index.  </P> <P> More detailed estimates for individual metropolitan areas by regional  economists at Data Resources Inc. showed that the seven cities with the largest  increases were all in the Northeast. Figures for the seven ranged from 8% in  Newark to 9.2% in Bridgeport, Conn., compared with a national average of 5.6%.  </P> <P> Nor did this just begin last year. With labor markets so tight, compensation  has been rising more rapidly in the Northeast than nationally for some time,  and that is one of the major reasons economic growth has slowed sharply.  </P> <P> If companies know the only way to find workers is to raise pay high enough to  take them away from other employers, they think twice about expanding.  </P> <P> But the impact of tight labor markets and rapid wage increases doesn't stop  there. With more money to spend, buyers have been able to bid up the price of  goods and services not set in national markets, especially the price of  housing.  </P> <P> The natural reaction of developers and lenders was to flood these booming  markets with expensive new single-family homes, condominiums and vacation  houses. A large amount of new commercial office space was built, too.  </P> <P> As fast as incomes were rising, however, they were not doubling in three years,  as house prices did in some areas. At some point, home prices had to stop  rising so fast, and they finally did so abruptly last year.  </P> <P> Now thousands of new condominiums stand unsold, some developers are out of  business and several major lenders -- most prominently the Bank of New England,  which lost $1.11 billion in 1989 -- have a lot of nonperforming loans on their  books.  </P> <P> In the face of all the unsold homes and unoccupied offices, new construction, a  major source of growth, has been slashed drastically and is now a drag on the  economy.  </P> <P> Other such cyclical forces are at work in the American economy, too.  Manufacturing firms have spent considerable money modernizing their plants in  the past couple of years. In industries such as paper and chemicals that ran  short of production capacity at the end of 1988, part of the capital spending  has increased capacity as well as efficiency. Now most forecasters expect  smaller increases in investment.  </P> <P> Even the dollar is doing its part, rising in value compared with several key  foreign currencies and making U.S. goods more expensive in other countries.  This leads economists to expect smaller increases in exports this year --  another development that will tend to hold down economic growth.  </P> <P> But the key question not just for 1990 but the rest of the decade is what  resources the nation will have available to put into the growth pot. For  example, every American who will enter the labor force during the 1990s has  already been born.  </P> <P> An unknown number of immigrants will swell that total but not change the  essential picture, which is one of slower labor force growth than during the  1970s or 1980s.  </P> <P> The CEA noted in its report that "many observers now worry about the  availability of workers -- especially skilled workers. Some have even argued  that labor shortages will dominate the 1990s and may slow economic growth."  </P> <P> Boskin and his colleagues nevertheless are optimistic that market forces will  mitigate some of the impact from slower growth of the work force.  </P> <P> "Those who argue that labor shortages will stall the economy in the next decade  ignore the flexibility and adaptability of U.S. firms, workers and  governments," they said.  </P> <P> Stalling the economy is not necessarily the issue, however. The U.S. labor  force is likely to grow only about 1.3% a year in the first half of this decade  and production of goods and services by those added workers will raise national  output.  </P> <P> But increases in the work force averaging 1.3% will be lower than the 1.7% rate  of most of the 1980s and lower still than the 2.4% annual increase between 1973  and 1981.  </P> <P> The civilian labor force stood at 124.4 million at the beginning of this year.  Therefore, a 1.3% annual increase would mean about 1.6 million more workers a  year. Providing employment for those additional workers would require roughly  135,000 new jobs per month.  </P> <P> Those figures are not understood in some quarters. For example, when the  monthly figures on payroll employment hit the news, financial market analysts  routinely describe anything less than a gain of 175,000 to 200,000 as evidence  of significant economic weakness.  </P> <P> Like all those residents of the Northeast with unreasonable expectations about  what is "normal" growth, some analysts seem to have an exaggerated sense of how  fast the labor force and thus the overall economy is likely to grow.  </P> <P> A few, such as Richard Rahn, chief economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  understand the numbers but believe the economy still has plenty of room to  expand because they think the unemployment rate could fall to 4% and perhaps to  3% without causing inflation to worsen.  </P> <P> Rahn argues that if the Federal Reserve pursued a steady, predictable policy of  money growth and the unemployment rate fell slowly over a period of years,  inflation problems would be avoided.  </P> <P> But that is a minority opinion. "When you've used up your unused resources to a  degree that you see inflation creeping up, as I think was the case in 1988 and  1989, you have to shift the burden of risk and be more concerned about  inflation," declared Marvin Kosters of the American Enterprise Institute in  Washington.  </P> <P> "The good news today is continuing growth but moderate growth. It would not be  good news to see growth rates shoot up. Then policy would have to turn more  restrictive," probably pushing the economy into a recession, Kosters said.  </P> <P> Kosters' view is widely held, and certainly is the basis of the Fed policy that  shifted in the spring of 1988 to seeking to slow economic growth to head off a  surge in inflation.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY SPORTS;  </P> <P> CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> FOR MURPHY, EVEN A SHORT ROAD TRIP TO FRESNO IS WELCOME RELIEF  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton football Coach Gene Murphy likes to refer to his traveling  band of Titans as the road warriors, but these days, they're just road weary.  </P> <P> In the past three weekends, Fullerton has logged more than 12,000 air miles,  about 1,000 road miles and has spent at least a dozen hours waiting in  airports.  </P> <P> Not to mention three defeats, to Auburn (38-17), Mississippi State (27-13) and  Akron (48-17).  </P> <P> "All the travel could be catching up to us," Murphy admitted Monday. "There are  a lot of things I'd like to say that I'm not going to say, but you can read  into that."  </P> <P> We can? Let's give it a try.  </P> <P>  Gee, we're just tickled to death that our athletic department changed  Saturday's Fresno State game from a home game to an away game so we could make  more money.  </P> <P>  Now, we get to spend even more time on buses, another night in a hotel and  play another game in a hostile environment. Now, we'll have five consecutive  away games instead of three.  </P> <P>  OK, bad read.  </P> <P> Murphy doesn't like playing games he has virtually no chance of winning, like  the one Sept. 8 against Auburn. And he doesn't like playing five consecutive  road games, like he will by the time the Oct. 6 game at Nevada Las Vegas rolls  around.  </P> <P> But he has learned to bite his tongue when it comes to criticizing the athletic  administration for its scheduling philosophy. That will only get him in hot  water.  </P> <P> So instead, he tries to find something positive in the situation and focus on  that. Here's Murphy's upbeat outlook for this week:  </P> <P> "It would have been great to play a home game, but we don't have to leave too  early Friday, the bus ride to Fresno isn't that long, and we should get plenty  of rest before the game. In the past, players have told me they'd rather play  at Fresno because they attract big crowds, it's big-time football, and it's  first-class all the way."  </P> <P> Murphy was very pleased with his team's effort against Auburn and Mississippi  State, but he couldn't say the same about Saturday's game, in which Fullerton  blew a 10-0 first-quarter lead and was badly outplayed by Akron from the second  quarter on.  </P> <P> "Some played hard and some didn't -- it was a matter of inconsistency," Murphy  said. "We didn't match the effort of the previous two games."  </P> <P> One player, quarterback Paul Schulte, might have given too much effort, Murphy  said. Schulte passed for 183 yards in the first quarter but went on to throw  five interceptions and complete just one more pass in the second and third  quarters.  </P> <P> "He's a competitive son of a buck, but he may have done something against his  nature by trying to make big plays by himself," Murphy said. "There are very  few athletes in our conference who can do that, but when we fell behind, he  tried to do too much."  </P> <P> Murphy said the players were emotionally fatigued and physically exhausted  after the Akron game, but he believes they'll bounce back this week.  </P> <P> "The positive thing about this week is we play a conference game, and our kids  get excited about those," Murphy said. "So from an emotional standpoint, we  should be ready to play."  </P> <P> Titan baseball Coach Augie Garrido, who returned to Fullerton in August after  three seasons at Illinois, held his first fall practice Monday, and his wasn't  the only new face on the field.  </P> <P> Garrido and first-year assistant George Horton have recruited nine more  players, including former Cerritos College all-state pitcher Dan Naulty, to  join the 10 returning players and the five players recruited by former Coach  Larry Cochell.  </P> <P> Naulty, a former Ocean View High School pitcher, is a hard-throwing, 6-foot-5  right-hander who has a sidearm motion. He had signed with Miami last spring but  wasn't accepted to the school. He has been admitted to Fullerton, Horton said.  </P> <P> Garrido has also added community college pitchers Yusef Ford (Laney), Paco  Chavez (Cerritos) and Darin Pometta (Merced), and outfielders Chris Powell  (Cerritos), Craig Fairbrother (Cerritos) and Jeff Manship (Fullerton).  </P> <P> Two Illinois players, infielder Jason Moler, a former Esperanza standout, and  outfielder Vic Boyd, a former Mater Dei standout, have transferred to  Fullerton, but neither has received a release yet from Illinois Athletic  Director John Mackovic. Moler and Boyd will redshirt this season and become  eligible next year. If they don't get releases, Moler will have two years of  eligibility remaining and Boyd three.  </P> <P> Jack Bailey, a former Mission Viejo High and Rancho Santiago College pitcher  who was academically ineligible last spring, will join the Titans this season.  </P> <P> However, former Golden West College pitcher Jason Hutchins, who signed with  Fullerton last spring and said he would honor his commitment if Garrido became  coach, has enrolled at Texas A &amp; M, Horton said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Titan Notes  </P> <P> Football Coach Gene Murphy said there's an "outside chance" that injured  starters Terry Tramble (safety), Michael Jones (rover) and Kerry Reed  (receiver) will return for Saturday's game at Fresno State. Tramble broke his  left forearm against Auburn, Jones broke a finger in the season opener against  Sonoma State, and Reed damaged knee ligaments against Sonoma State. Offensive  guard Shannon Illingworth, who injured his knee in practice after the Sonoma  State game, will miss at least one more game. Offensive tackle Mike Simmons,  who missed the Akron game because of a sprained ankle, is questionable for the  Fresno State game, as is reserve tackle Jim DeFelippo, who started Saturday in  place of Simmons and suffered shoulder and knee injuries. . . . Including the  1983 California Bowl game, this will be Murphy's ninth game at Fresno in 11  years. Under Murphy, the Titans are 2-6 at Bulldog Stadium. . . . The 7 p.m.  game will be televised live on SportsChannel with Greg Papa and Jack Snow  calling the action. . . . The two-time defending Big West Conference champion  Bulldogs are 4-0 with victories over Eastern Michigan, New Mexico, Utah and New  Mexico. They are averaging 34.5 points and 485 total yards per game.  </P> <P> The Titan baseball team will play 10 games this fall, beginning with an Oct. 25  contest at Chaffey College. Nine of the games are against community college  teams. . . . According to American Volleyball Coaches Assn. statistics, Titan  junior middle blocker Stephanie Scofield is ranked 16th in the nation in digs  per game with an average of 4.35. The Fullerton volleyball team fell to 3-10,  0-2 in conference with losses to Cal State Long Beach and UC Irvine last  weekend.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: WEEKEND TRIP TO DESERT PROVES PRIORITIES ARE IN ORDER  </P> <P> In keeping with our new policy of taking mini-vacations of one or two days,  instead of arduous global treks, my wife and I drove up to the high desert on a  recent weekend.  </P> <P> I had been invited to talk to the Friends of Copper Mountain College at Yucca  Valley, in the Little San Bernardino Mountains above the Coachella Valley.  </P> <P> On a Saturday morning the San Bernardino Freeway was easy going. We stopped for  lunch at the Farm House in Beaumont. It turned out to be an excellent  restaurant full of farm house implements and charm. I had a forbidden chili  dog. When one is on holiday one is entitled to break a few rules.  </P> <P> Turning north on the Twentynine Palms Highway (California 62) we began to climb  a desert valley between hills that were covered with thousands of  power-generating windmills, their silver tri-blades turning in the wind. There  is something eerie about the sight of these machines working silently to reward  investors, though I'm told they haven't reduced power bills in the area yet. It  would take a thousand Don Quixotes to vanquish them.  </P> <P> Morongo Valley was the first settlement. A wide place in the road. As I  remember, it didn't even have a stop sign. It soon vanished in the desert.  Eight miles farther on we came to Yucca Valley. Forty years ago Yucca Valley  was a gas station and a bar. It is still hardly more than a wide place in the  road -- a five-mile stretch of highway with houses and other structures making  an urban corridor of about a quarter mile on either side.  </P> <P> Within those five miles Yucca Valley offers most of the institutions that  sustain life. Doctors', lawyers' and real estate offices, hardware stores,  liquor stores, shoe stores, a K mart, a McDonald's, a Taco Bell, Vons, Home  Savings, Pomona First Federal, Carl's Jr., Bank of America, World Savings, a  Sizzler, Bob's Big Boy, Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Denny's, Pic 'n  Save, American Savings and a motel (one of several) called Oasis of Eden.  </P> <P> The residential structures spread out on either side of this lifeline and are  sustained by it as the settlements of the Egyptian desert are sustained by the  Nile. The housing frenzy that has seized the coastal towns has not reached  these high desert communities. Residences are modest, and I saw no signs of  massive new construction.  </P> <P> Nine miles beyond Yucca Valley, Joshua Tree also clings to the highway. It is  only a mile long, and its biggest enterprise is a K mart. All of a sudden  Joshua Tree ends, and the land beyond the last street reverts to desert brush  and Joshua trees.  </P> <P> We took the last street and drove to the home of our hostess, Leota Bell, in  whose guest house we were to spend the night. Her friend, photographer Harry  Laugharn, drove us three miles farther on to the Copper Mountain College.  </P> <P> The college is a campus of College of the Desert, a community college at Palm  Desert in the Coachella Valley. It stands on a rise below Copper Mountain,  utterly isolated in the desert.  </P> <P> It is a handsome group of low, dark brown block buildings surrounding grass  courtyards planted with sycamore trees. It is an educational and geographic  oasis.  </P> <P> We were given a tour by Owen Gillick, executive director of development, and  Jim Pulliam, provost of the college. (While technically it is a campus of the  mother college, everybody in the valley calls it Copper Mountain College.)  </P> <P> Their pride is understandable. Against every kind of odds, including the  devasting effect of Proposition 13, the people of the high desert towns,  including Twentynine Palms, 12 miles farther east, got the college built. At  the outset, they raised $1 million in gifts and pledges for the initial  construction in 1983. A second classroom unit was built in 1988; a library and  student center are on the drawing board.  </P> <P> The supporting communities number only about 45,000 people, but the college has  3,600 students. Many are older people who have returned to complete their  educations. Many are Marines from the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center at  Twentynine Palms. Marines graded the 120-acre site free. (The transfer of 4,000  Marines to Saudi Arabia has hurt business in the desert towns.)  </P> <P> The college offers not only a liberal arts program but also Registered Nursing  and automobile technology programs that are among the best in the state.  (Graduate nurses are recruited like star athletes.)  </P> <P> The building of this college, especially in times like these when funds are  scarce and 60 million Americans are illiterate, seems to me to be an  inspirational accomplishment. It sustains my faith that the American spirit  still lives, and that some of us still have our priorities right. Education  should be a primary goal of a democracy.  </P> <P> On Sunday morning we had breakfast with some locals at Joshua Tree's finest --  the Bull 'n Spear -- and drove back to the metropolis past thousands of new  houses that looked as multitudinous as windmills.  </P></p>

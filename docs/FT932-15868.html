			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Mid-States Against a depressed market background, Mid-States, the wholesaler and distributor of motor parts in the US, raised pre-tax profits by 13 per cent from Pounds 3.73m to Pounds 4.21m in 1992. Turnover edged ahead from Pounds 48.9m to Pounds 50.1m. As already announced, the company has appointed Bear Stearnsto investigate ways of maximising shareholder value. The review, however, is still in progress. The company said that in view of the wide ranging nature of the strategic alternatives being considered, it believed it inappropriate to declare a final dividend and so the interim of 0.75p compares with the previous year's total of 3p. A special interim, however, will be declared when the outcome of the strategic review is known. Earnings per share rose by 1p to 7.3p.</p>

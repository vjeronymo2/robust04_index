			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Text of government communique issued in Santa Fe de Bogota </F> on 18 May]    [Text] Aware of the reasons which led the Constitutional  Court to declare unconstitutional provisions which penalize the  possession and consumption of personal doses of drugs, the  national government reasserts that it will obey the judicial  decision. Not only does the government not agree with the  decision, it believes that its effect will be serious.  Consumption of substances that create addiction cannot be part  of the behavior condoned as part of the free development of  personality. Legislators must be given the option to ban and  punish this, according to his criteria.    The government does not share the court's extremely  individualistic interpretation of the Constitution in matters  related not only to individual autonomy but also to obligations  established in the Constitution, in this case Articles 49 and 95.    The government considers it its duty to promote the  necessary  decisions to fill the void and mistakes that might result from  the court's decision. Immediately, using authority derived from  laws now in effect, the government will issue decrees to  prohibit and to confirm prohibitions on the possession and  consumption of drugs and psychotropic and hallucinatory  substances in at least the following places and events: public  places, places open to the public, schools, and workplaces.  Drugs will be banned among minors, pregnant women; drivers of  vehicles, ships, or airplanes; those who bear firearms; and  those who exercise certain professions, such as doctors and  dentists.    Likewise, we intend to establish penalties for violations of  some of the preceding prohibitions, according to each case and  the seriousness of the misdemeanor. The penalties will range  from arrest, closure of public places, suspension of flight  licenses, cancellation of work contracts, suspension or firing  of public workers, deportation of foreigners, cancellation of  firearm permits, and the suspension of licenses or professional  cards.    The government reiterates that topics of such importance  must  take into account what the people have to say, thus the  government calls on all Colombian society--political parties,  churches, economic associations, workers, peasants, social and  community organizations, the academic community, parents and  youths--to present together with the government a draft bill  with popular initiative, to call a referendum to modify the  Constitution to clearly establish the prevalence of the general  interest, the possibility of penalizing citizens for not  fulfilling their duties, and clearly stating the legislators'  prerogative to ban and prohibit the consumption of drugs and  psychotropic substances.    In the next few weeks the president will call on  representatives of the various mentioned institutions and  organizations to form promotional committees and begin the  necessary formalities for a popular legislative initiative.  Given the reaction in the last few days, the national government  is certain that it is correctly interpreting the feelings of all  Colombians in support of the fight against drug trafficking and  preventing youths from Colombia and the rest of the world from  falling into the claws of today's most damaging perversity--drug  consumption.</p>

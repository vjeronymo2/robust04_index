			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / World Trade News: US and Japan extend deadline on glass talks Japanese and US trade officials yesterday said that few outstanding issues remained over measures to improve foreign access to Japan's market for flat glass, despite the failure of talks to secure an accord. Japanese officials were confident that an accord could be reached after further negotiations, since the two sides have already agreed the basic principles for opening Japan's flat glass market to imports. 'The calendar has just been extended,' said Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's minister for international trade and industry, who said the negotiations would continue later. 'We made some progress but . . . some technical and practical problems remain,' the trade minister added. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, also put a positive spin on the failure to reach agreement within the 30-day deadline which expired on Monday. Discussions, he said, would continue 'for a limited period of time.' Progress had been made, and only a few technical and substantive issues remained outstanding. Japan has agreed to promote the use of foreign-made glass in some government-funded facilities which would serve as model projects. There is also broad agreement on the use of objective criteria to measure progress in import penetration. Differences remain, however, over whether the objective criteria should be forward-looking, as the US hopes, or should only measure past developments, as the Japanese insist. Japanese officials are concerned that forward-looking measures could turn into restrictive targets aimed at ensuring a specific market share for foreign products in the domestic glass market. Mr Steve Farrar of Guardian Glass said the US glass industry was 'disappointed' in the failure to reach agreement in the month but urged continuing talks over the next few weeks. If agreement is not reached soon, however, Mr Farrar urged the bringing of a Section 301 case, which provides for sanctions at the end of a year of investigation and negotiation. US officials have been concerned about the slow pace of negotiations since agreement was reached in principle on October 1. In announcing the agreement, Mr Kantor said he expected 'three-quarters of the 100 largest Japanese wholesalers and glaziers would obtain 30 to 40 per cent of their flat glass from non-traditional sources, a mixture of both foreign and domestic'. Mr Hashimoto subsequently wrote to Mr Kantor challenging this. 'I hope this is some sort of misinterpretation of your remarks,' he wrote. 'But I would like to urge you to refrain from making such remarks which could be interpreted in effect as requesting numerical targets. Such a comment clearly makes our future talks more difficult.' While the latest round of talks did not produce results, Japanese officials remained optimistic that agreement could be reached. Trade in glass products is not an emotive issue and it is unlikely that US trade officials would risk aggravating tensions with Japan over a sector in which it usually has a bilateral trade surplus, a trade official said. Last year Japan bought Y3.4bn (Dollars 34m) more flat glass from the US than it exported there, according to Japanese government trade statistics. The situation was less promising in the parallel talks on vehicles and vehicle parts. Negotiations have not been resumed since the US cited Japan's vehicle parts after-sales market as being characterised by 'unfair and discriminatory trade practices' and unilaterally began an investigation under Section 301 of its trade act. Mr Hashimoto yesterday reiterated that the use of Section 301 remained a major obstacle to resuming negotiations on these markets. 'Section 301 is still in effect. It is difficult to know what to believe when on the one hand they are saying 'we are going to hit you' and on the other they expect friendly talks,' he said.</p>

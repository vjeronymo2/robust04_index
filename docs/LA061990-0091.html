			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPEAKING OF: QUALITY OF LIFE  </P> <P> Narrowing the Gap  </P> <P> While there are still horrendous gaps in the level of development between the  First and Third Worlds, some gaps have closed during the last four decades.  </P> <P> The Infant Mortality Rate:  </P> <P> Deaths per 1,000 live births  </P> <P> 1950: 200  </P> <P> 1985: 79  </P> <P> The Literacy Gap:  </P> <P> In percentage points  </P> <P> 1970: 54  </P> <P> 1985: 40  </P> <P> The Life Expectancy Gap:  </P> <P> In years  </P> <P> 1960: 23  </P> <P> 1987: 12  </P> <P> 1.  </P> <P> The United Nation's development program's new Human Development Index is a  composite derived from the performance of each country in three areas: life  expectancy at birth, the rate of adult literacy, and income for a decent living  standard. The higher the number, the more desirable the level of human  development.  </P> <P> 2. While economic performance is intimately tied to levels of social  development, it is equally important how a country uses its wealth. Some  countries with modest levels of per capita income have achieved high levels of  human development, while others with rapid growth and comparatively high income  levels have not shown commensurate improvement in fulfilling basic human needs.  </P> <P> 3. Here's a look at some of the countries with the greatest disparity between  their level of wealth and their human development performance. With 130  countries evaluated, these figures are based on each nation's ranking in terms  of gross national product per capita, less its ranking according to the U.N.'s  Human Development Index. (see below) The lower the rating, the worse the  country's record of translating its wealth into a comparable level of human  development.  </P> <P> Source: United Nations Development Program  </P></p>

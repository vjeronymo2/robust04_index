			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: IBM delays release of two updated PC models International Business Machines is delaying the release of two upgraded PS/2 personal computer models due to technical problems, Reuter reports from New York. 'We are informing customers that our PS/2 76 and 77 models will be severely constrained in January and February due to technical problems,' a spokesman said. IBM said that during final stress tests, the new models did not meet its guidelines for reliability. The company added that the problems stemmed from a specialised chip that handles complicated memory tasks. The models were intended to be launched in January and February. The company would not estimate when the upgraded models would be ready. However, this is the second delay for the launch which was previously stalled last autumn. IBM said it was increasing production of the 76 and 77 models to meet demand. A spokesman confirmed industry estimates that IBM has sold about 14m of the models since the PS/2 came out in 1987.</p>

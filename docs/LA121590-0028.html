			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO FILE: MEASURE WOULD REQUIRE PUBLIC COMMENT BEFORE A BOARD VOTE  </P> <P> Under legislation introduced in the state Senate, city councils and county  boards of supervisors would be required to give the public a chance to comment  on agenda items before official consideration or a vote can be taken.  </P> <P> Although state law presently requires an opportunity for public comment, it  does not specify whether it should come before, during or after a public body  considers an item.  </P> <P> "Several of my constituents have expressed outrage that some public bodies take  comment only after voting on an item," said Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), the  author of the measure (SB 100). "This bill makes it clear that such comment  must come before consideration of an item."  </P> <P> Lockyer's legislation was prompted by a recent decision of an advisory  committee of the East Bay Regional Park District to use pregnant deer for an  experiment on Lyme disease. The committee allowed public comment only after it  had voted on the proposal, the Northern California lawmaker said.  </P> <P> GOVERNOR  </P> <P> Bills Signed  </P> <P> Oil Spills: SB 7 by Sen.

George Deukmejian's press secretary, Bob Gore, has been appointed  vice president of communications for the Assn. of California Insurance Cos. A  former Times reporter, Gore, 40, also served as press spokesman for the  departments of Transportation and Corrections during the Deukmejian years.  </P> <P> Capital Fact  </P> <P> The official state reptile is the desert tortoise.  </P></p>

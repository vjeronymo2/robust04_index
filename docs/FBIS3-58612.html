			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Paris, Jan 13 (AFP) -- President Francois  Mitterrand waded into France's "war of the schools" on Thursday  [13 January], attacking conservative Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur and cheering on the left ahead of a massive  demonstration planned for Sunday.    The socialist president condemned Balladur's "unfortunate  initiative" in rushing a bill through the senate that granted  unlimited use of public funds to the country's private, mainly  Catholic, schools.    In an interview with the socialist weekly VENDREDI,  Mitterrand said the state education system felt unfairly treated  and that he "understood" the anger of teachers and parents.    Teachers unions and parents associations as well as  left-wing  organisations are planning a big demonstration against the new  legislation on Sunday and hope to draw 300,000 people on to the  Paris boulevards.

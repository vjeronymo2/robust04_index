			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Soft drink may toast hardliners An official suggestion that Coca-Cola might sponsor the celebrations of the 20th anniversary of Portugal's 'Revolution of the Flowers' has plunged the country into an emotional debate on the brand name's symbolism. Banned for half a century by the right-wing dictator Antonio de Salazar as 'a drug', Coca-Cola is seen by many as an apt symbol of the end of Portugal's international isolation and its return to the fold of western democracy. But the young left-wing army officers who led the revolution in April, 1974, themselves scorned the drink as 'the dirty water of imperialism' and now lament the idea that their socialist-inspired revolt should be associated with what they see as a leading symbol of capitalism.</p>

Finance Minister Cesar Robalino said: We must pay financial  organizations whether we have a crisis or not. Asked what will  happen to the debt with commercial banks, the minister said: We  will see what happens but at this moment, we are not paying the  commercial debt or its interest.    Ecuador has an overall foreign debt that surpasses $12.550  billion of which $6.5 billion are contracted with commercial  banks and the rest with Western governments and international  financial organizations. For the past year, Ecuador has been  negotiating a program to reduce and refinance the debt. It has  also been negotiating an adjustment agreement with the IMF, but  it has been unsuccessful in both cases. Meanwhile, government  officials predicted that the impending fiscal crisis prompted by  the drop in crude prices will not have grave effects on the  foreign debt negotiations.    On Wednesday, Finance Minister Robalino told reporters that  Ecuador will continue to pay what it owes international  financial organizations regardless of a crisis. Robalino, who  heads the debt negotiations team, added that one will have to  see what happens in the relations with the creditor banks.  However, he stressed, the suspension of debt payments that  became effective in May 1992, will remain in effect.    In addition, Central Bank Manager Augusto De la Torre said  that the government strategy is to avoid, at any expense, a  fiscal imbalance and the reactivation of inflation. He noted  that this will allow Ecuador to guarantee a good understanding  with creditors. De la Torre said that he hopes that the fiscal  crisis will not affect the debt negotiations. The government is  bent on avoiding a fiscal imbalance and in the wake of Congress'  approval of the budget, it will have to think of more profound  cuts in expenditures. He added that the government is firm in  its objective to avoid a fiscal imbalance and if this is  attained, and I hope it will be, he said, then we will get IMF  approval for our country's economic program.</p>

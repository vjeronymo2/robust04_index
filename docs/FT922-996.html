			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Munich summit lends impetus to farm talks CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl is in contact with both the US government and the European Commission in an urgent effort to break the deadlock in the Uruguay round of trade liberalisation talks, the German government spokesman said yesterday. 'He believes that all possible efforts must be made to reach a conclusion in the Uruguay round before the (Group of Seven economic) summit in Munich,' Mr Dieter Vogel said: 'He is not the only one making an effort, but he is perhaps a little more heavily involved than others.' Also in Bonn, Mr Joseph Connor, president of the International Chamber of Commerce, emerged from a pre-summit briefing with Mr Kohl claiming the German leader had responded positively to an urgent call for a breakthrough. Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the main German board member at the ICC, said world industry would be sent a negative signal by failure to make significant progress at the Munich summit: 'Business will conclude that we are entering a protectionist world. Every business will act as if that world already existed.' The ICC delegation said its concerns had 'hit a responsive chord'. The ICC told Mr Kohl that the credibility of the G7 leading industrial nations had been stretched to the limit by the Uruguay negotiations. Referring to the 'at best fragile condition' of the world economy, Mr Schimmelbusch, who also heads Metallgesell-schaft, the German industrial group, said a collapse of the Uruguay round would further retard international growth. In London, Mr Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), told world grain traders that the recent EC decision to reform the common agriculture policy (CAP) had enabled the Uruguay round 'to gain greater focus'. Remaining doggedly optimistic about a positive outcome, he noted: 'Courageous and wise political decisions are urgently needed.' He warned that a settlement of the EC-US farm trade dispute was only a first step to completing the round. Market access and services negotiations had been stalled by the farm trade dispute. Disagreements over 'bananas, shipping and financial services' remain unresolved, he said. In Bonn, Mr Vogel said that there had so far been no significant shift in EC positions on farm trade reform, but the German government was making 'very serious efforts to find at least a political agreement before the summit'. He said that it was unlikely - and undesirable - that either this week's EC summit in Lisbon, or the Group of Seven summit in Munich, should be turned into detailed negotiations on agricultural trade: 'There will not be any game of agricultural poker between the EC and the US in Munich,' he said. Instead, German and British negotiators hope to draft a compromise that can be accepted by France, and then presented to US negotiators perhaps in Washington next week. Reflecting the particular problems that France has in agreeing a farm trade settlement, the French trade and industry minister, Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, yesterday expressed doubts that the Gatt negotiations can be resolved before US presidential elections in November. Negotiators in the five-year Uruguay Round will continue to work on various, technical issues in the meantime, he said, during a presentation of French trade figures. France has been rocked by two weeks of protests by farmers who claim cuts in farm prices will put them out of business.</p>

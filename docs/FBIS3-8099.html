			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "The Issue of a Minority </F> Government"]    [Text] Recent events have made the fate of the current  government coalition really uncertain. Certainly, the PSM  [Socialist Party of Labor] and the PRM [Greater Romania Party]  referred in their public statements only to the issue of  freezing negotiations with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of  Romania] on forming a new government. They refrained from  commenting on their parliamentary alliance with the PDSR, an  alliance that resulted in the Nicolae Vacaroiu cabinet. As far  as the government party is concerned, it did not adopt a  categorical position regarding an alliance with the PSM and the  PRM. The response to the PRM letter is a declaration that,  although intended for the entire left wing on our political  spectrum, its conclusion merely refers to the issue of  negotiations aimed at establishing a government of the so called  red pentagon. At a first glance one might say that the current  signs that relations between the PDSR and the PSM-PRM have  cooled refer only to the plan for a PDSR-PSM-PRM-PUNR-PDAR  [Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania] government and will not  affect the current discreet alliance, an alliance through which  we have today in parliament a left-wing majority coalition.  Using a simple metaphor, we might say that the PDSR broke off  negotiations for a marriage with the PSM-PRM. However, the  engagement is still on. To think in this way strikes me as a  little risky. During the quarrel on the issue of negotiations,  enough curses were exchanged for not only the marriage but even  the engagement to be thrown into doubt. Just as in every  dispute, the sides reached a stage when they expressed exactly  what they thought about each other. However, in a love affair,  any separation starts from the first real quarrel. In that  moment, the two sides threw into each other's face everything  that they had kept hidden before. And even if they make up  later, the memory of that moment of sincerity will seriously  affect their relationship. A similar thing will also happen to  the government coalition. The controversy on the issue of  negotiations aimed at establishing the pentagon gave the  partners the opportunity to express what they thought about each  other. Not only they but also the public could notice that,  beneath the embraces and kisses that have been exchanged so far,  serious differences are hidden. At the same time, one should  remember something else. The bickering with the PSM-PRM  produced an opportunity for certain clarifications within the  PDSR. As is known, the PDSR is dominated by disputes between  its two groups, namely, the reformist and the conservative ones.  As long as the PSM-PRM had cast their eyes at the PDSR, the  reformist group did not have a chance firmly to put forward the  issue of separation from nationalist-communist forces. Every  time the conservative group invoked a reason -- which did not  lack common sense -- namely, that it is preferable to have a  stable alliance with the left wing than a hypothetical and  uncertain alliance with the right wing. The PRM letter gave the  opportunity to the reform group to take its revenge. The  hooligan and absolutely irresponsible behavior of [PRM leader]  Corneliu Vadim Tudor toward President Ion Iliescu was used by  the reformist group to demonstrate to the whole party how  dangerous an alliance with nationalist-communists is. Faced  with such a shattering argument, the conservative group was  compelled to give in. This can be seen in the style and content  of the PDSR declaration, which indicates the victory of the  position adopted by the reformist group. From this viewpoint,  there is no doubt that PRM Leader Corneliu Vadim Tudor has made  a decisive contribution to the victory of the reformist group in  the PDSR. With his stupid articles, he strengthened that group  of the ruling party that had been advocating for quite a long  time a break with the left-wing allies and an opening toward the  CD and the PD(FSN) [Democratic Party(National Salvation Front)].  Even if neither the PDSR nor the PSM-PRM could comment on the  current coalition, it is clear that under these circumstances,  its days are numbered. Does a possible break of the left-wing  coalition endanger the PDSR's government? Although it might  seem paradoxical, the answer is no. The PDSR has every chance  to form a government with a minority executive and rule for a  while. The fall of the government would depend on the success  of a censure motion. However, such a situation would mean early  elections. And such prospects frighten not only all the parties  but all the members of parliament as well. What member would  dare, at a secret ballot required by the censure motion, to vote  for the fall of the government and early elections? This would  mean to make his future status as a member uncertain. Thus, it  is not excluded that in the near future we are going to have a  minority PDSR government, supported by both the right and the  left wing.</p>

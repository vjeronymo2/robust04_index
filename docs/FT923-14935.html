			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Property: An international penthouse view WHEN property company Metropolitan &amp; County bought the 200 large Edwardian flats known as Bickenhall Mansions, in London's West End, it was unaware that planning permission existed for further flats in the roof. On examining that area it found there was enough room to build 35 penthouses with between three and five bedrooms. That was in 1986 and the last batch is nearing completion. They are on two floors, with galleries and small terraces. Not many companies have the luck to 'win' about 47,000 sq ft of space in this way - and this for penthouses which have a cachet of their own. These units are offered from Pounds 750,000 to Pounds 1.3m (tel. 071-935-8510). Penthouse prices vary with size and location but their pattern is similar across the world, as a selection from the register of Sotheby's International Realty shows. Most of these examples were built in the 1980s and all are being offered by Sotheby's (tel. London 071-408-5196). In central Athens, a penthouse occupying the whole ninth floor of its building has views of Mount Lycabettus and the Acropolis. The salon has glass walls and a wide balcony. There are three bedrooms and bathrooms and a staff flat. The price, Pounds 575,000, is modest by penthouse standards. In Charlottenburg, Berlin, a fifth-floor penthouse with four terraces is of angular, modern design. The living room has pillars and a gallery. Accommodation includes two bedrooms with bathrooms and a separate apartment. Price: Pounds 875,000. In Toronto, Canada, a penthouse condominium overlooking Balfour park and with views to the skyline, is 10 minutes from the financial district. There is a private lift to the 6,000 sq ft apartment which has silk wall-coverings, marble fireplaces, oak-panelled library and study. The formal area has a 600 sq ft entertaining room and a dining room with floor-to-ceiling windows. There are five to six bedrooms and eight bathrooms, plus a staff flat. Price: Pounds l97m. In New York City, a two-bedroom penthouse at United Nations Plaza has 'wraparound terraces' and a full range of services. It is Pounds 1.63m furnished. Another penthouse, on East End Avenue, has nearly as much terrace space (2,500 sq ft) as living space (2,800 sq ft) for just Pounds 1.5m. Washington Harbour in Washington DC, five minutes from the White House, is described as a 'fanciful post-modern structure.' A penthouse for sale there 'with the most spectacular panorama in all of Washington DC' has 5,423 sq ft of living space. The octagonal entrance is 'finished with a jewelbox ambience, with 17 coats of lacquer on its walls.' A gallery with windows overlooking the Potomac river has steps down to a circular living room with domed ceiling and glass walls. There is a master bedroom suite in one wing and a second suite in the opposite wing. Asking price: Pounds 2.93m. Equally lavish is a 25th-floor penthouse on the intra-coastal waterway at Miami Beach, Florida. Its 10,000 sq ft interior includes 14 principal rooms incorporating onyx, marble, Valverdi stone and ebony. The dining room can accommodate 75 for a formal dinner and there are three entertaining galleries. From the six terraces, there are views of the Atlantic, Biscayne bay or the city skyline. Price: Pounds 2.37m. So where did penthouses come from? Sotheby's Michael Bastian in New York says: 'The history of the penthouse is pretty much the history of high-rise  -an urban phenomenon.' The one on top was the best apartment with the least noise, best sunlight and best views. One of the most notable penthouses was built in New York in 1926. A woman agreed to sell her townhouse if the builder would recreate it on top of an apartment block. The result was a 54-room triplex (three floors) penthouse.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Management (Managing in Recession): How Wiggins built a future for itself - Property has been hard hit in today's straitened times. Vanessa Houlder reports on how different organisations coped As the property market continues to spiral into one of the steepest downturns ever seen in the UK, many debt-laden property companies are desperately seeking financial reconstructions. One of the first companies to do this in the current downturn was Wiggins, a Docklands-based housebuilder and developer. It has survived, but the protracted, complex negotiations that led to its refinancing illustrate the predicament of developers and their banks. Wiggins ran into trouble in late 1989, when the sale of a hotel it was building in the Isle of Dogs enterprise zone fell through. That left it over-extended and just a few months off a cash-flow crisis. Before starting negotiations with its bank, Wiggins wanted to formulate proposals of its own. It called in a firm of lawyers, D J Freeman, which helped it grapple with the complexities of its financial and legal situation. 'It was like going through a maze that had only one route through it,' according to Stephen Hayklan, the chairman. The inter-related nature of Wiggins' finances meant that the failure of the hotel project was jeopardising the whole group. 'Different banks held different forms of security, sometimes over the same assets and held different guarantees from other members of the group,' says Jonathan Lewis, head of corporate restructuring at D J Freeman. 'If any one demand were made and enforced, the whole group would collapse.' The aim of the restructuring was to protect the rest of the group from failure of the Docklands projects. It did this by 'ringfencing' each development, putting it into a separate single purpose company to stand or fall by its own merits. To do this, it had to renegotiate all the parent company's guarantees, a move which had to overcome the banks' instinctive desire for as much security as possible. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, were asked to scrutinise the proposals. 'We provided them with our plans and said be as tough as you want on our projections and anticipations,' says Hayklan. Meanwhile, the directors tried to sell as much as they could. Geoffrey Lansbury, the managing director, tried to sell the hotel while Paul Lewellen, the finance director, worked on the business units. Hayklan's task was to sell the group's French property - and to fetch takeaways when the team was working late at night. 'It was very fraught,' he says. 'Everybody forgot about their home life.' Construction work on a business unit complex in Docklands stopped but the rest of the group traded as normal. The group sold its projects in France, Spain and Florida, raising about Pounds 7m. The decision to sell sites, on which great hopes had been pinned, was not easy. 'It was heart-breaking,' says Hayklan. 'But had we been greedy or emotional about it we probably would not have survived.' Wiggins met its banks in early March. Thirty people - the bankers, the syndicate's lawyers, Wiggins' lawyers and Coopers &amp; Lybrand - sat around a symmetrically arranged square table. 'It was very formal,' recalls Lewis. Wiggins presented its proposals and answered questions. Its directors and advisers then withdrew to an antechamber. Eventually they were invited to return, to be told that the syndicate needed more time for deliberation. That was the start of several months of negotiations with the banks and contractors. The negotiations on the hotel were simplified by the fact that there was only one bank involved, Midland. On the business unit complex, however, it had to deal with a syndicate. Even a small syndicate presents problems in a restructuring. Each bank is likely to take a different attitude, given the differences in their lending books and financial muscle. The involvement of overseas banks can be complicated because of longer internal reporting lines, response times and less flexible insolvency practices. 'The problems arose in trying to persuade banks with different cultures to think along the same lines,' says Chris Day, a manager at Samuel Montagu which, as the agent, was responsible for co-ordinating the syndicate, reconciling difficulties and maintaining the timetable. It was a long, slow process. At every twist and turn, the banks had to go back to their credit committees which would demand modifications; these would prove controversial and lead to more negotiations. 'More than once the situation looked hopeless,' says Lewis. One low point was when South Quay Plaza, a large office development three doors down from Wiggins' office project, went into receivership. Another was when one of the overseas banks dropped out, disillusioned with the UK property market. Even though the bank took a co-operative stance and allowed its security to be diluted, its decision was a blow. 'One of the unwritten rules of syndicated banking is together we stand or together we fall,' says Ian Steer, a director at Samuel Montagu. Wiggins and its lawyers were picking their way through a legal minefield. If there had been 'no reasonable prospect' of avoiding collapse, the board would have been at risk of wrongful trading. The directors would also be in breach of their duties if they preferred one creditor over another for anything but sound business reasons. 'Just because someone is shouting at you for payment doesn't mean you pay them before someone who is more understanding of the situation,' says Lewellen. Transferring assets within the group was also hazardous, because every subsidiary is deemed to have a separate legal personality. Each deal had to be done on an arm's length basis and the new subsidiaries had to consider the obligations they were undertaking and their ability to honour them. If a court considered that the directors had slipped up in any way, the sanctions could be serious - 'a very real inducement to directors to be safe rather than brave,' according to Lewis. The directors could be held personally liable and their conduct would automatically be the subject of a report by the liquidator to the Department of Trade and Industry. If there was any misconduct, the board members could be disqualified from acting as a director for as long as 15 years. In addition to these risks, Wiggins had to face the possibility that negotiations would break down or an unsecured creditor might present a winding-up petition. As a contingency plan, Wiggins prepared to apply for an administration order. Over four months, they thrashed out a solution. 'The banks accepted it was the best way forward,' says Lewellen. 'The exit route showed that they had a good chance of coming out with their loans intact over less than two years.' The syndicate put in an extra Pounds 36m, which more than doubled its exposure and Wimpey, the management contractor, agreed to defer Pounds 5m owing to it. The interest varied with the eventual profit on the development. In addition, Wimpey and Robert McAlpine, a 20 per cent shareholder, gave guarantees. Hayklan also stepped into the breach when there was a shortfall and personally guaranteed Pounds 500,000. The hotel was refinanced on August 15 and sold in early November to Britannia Hotels, a Manchester-based group. Wiggins was unable to complete the construction as it had hoped, and the sale price was just Pounds 17.75m, resulting in a loss of Pounds 6m. In September, the Docklands business unit complex, called the Eurotrade Centre, resumed construction. In November, Wiggins' auditors signed an unqualified report. The suspension of the shares, which took place on March 16, was lifted on December 11. 'Your group, although bruised, lives to fight another day,' Hayklan told Wiggins' shareholders in its annual report.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Finnish chemicals group valued at up to FM5bn The international offering of shares in Kemira, the state-owned Finnish chemicals group, is expected to value the company at up to FM5.16bn (Dollars 1bn). The sale of 25 per cent of shares in the group is expected to raise between FM1.1bn and FM1.3bn, making it Finland's biggest initial public offering. Global co-ordinator and book-runner Merrill Lynch reports good interest. It has two teams marketing the deal to international investors, with final pricing due in November. Merrill has been involved in Finnish international equity offers from Outokumpu, the mining and metals group, Valmet, the paper machinery and engineering group, and Rautaruukki, the steel group, within the past year. The group, Finland's eighth largest by sales, will offer 30m shares, at between FM37 and FM44 each. Postipankki is handling the domestic and Nordic side, and the US tranche is being handled by Merrill Lynch with Goldman Sachs, UBS and SG Warburg. The rest of the world is being handled by Merrill with Indosuez, UBS, Postipankki, SG Warburg, ABN Amro, Dresdner, Daiwa, James Capel and Kleinwort Benson.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, 31 May (NOTIMEX) -- Cuba has sent to the  Belgian authorities a written commitment to respect the human  rights of the 113 Cubans who invaded that country's diplomatic  headquarters in Havana. The two parties agreed that there should  be a peaceful evacuation.    The Belgian Foreign Ministry, through its spokesman, told  NOTIMEX that it had received a message from Cuban authorities  committing themselves to not persecuting asylum seekers after  they leave the embassy. Belgium made it clear it had no  intention of receiving [recibir] the Cubans and called for a  "swift and humane" solution to the problem that would restore  tranquillity to the diplomatic headquarters in Havana, which is  made up of five officials.    One of the 114 refugees voluntarily left the Belgian  diplomatic headquarters on Sunday evening and the police did not  ask him to produce identification, the Spanish newspaper EL PAIS  reported today.    The spokesman said Belgium will continue giving humanitarian  aid to the asylum seekers, including 34 women and 24 children.  Belgian authorities sent additional drinks and food to the Cuban  refugees in the embassy.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS GRAFFITI ORDINANCE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council approved an ordinance today that would allow city  workers to remove graffiti from private property with the owner's consent at  city expense -- or else.  </P> <P> The council's 14-0 vote sent the ordinance to the mayor, who has 10 days to  sign the measure into law.  </P> <P> If a property owner should refuse permission and fail to remove the graffiti on  his own, the city could do the job and charge the owner for the work.  </P> <P> The ordinance is a revision of a measure considered last week that would have  cited owners with a misdemeanor for not complying.  </P> <P> The new ordinance means that if someone complains about graffiti on a privately  owned building, the city will contact the owner and ask permission to remove it  at city expense. If the owner refuses, the city will give him 15 days to remove  the graffiti on his own. If it remains after 15 days, the city will remove it  without consent and place a lien on the property.  </P></p>

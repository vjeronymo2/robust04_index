He said he is a witness to this labor union policy and that  he is not surprised at the lack of foundation for the charges  made by the Peruvian labor confederations' coordinating board  before several organizations like the International Labor  Organization (ILO).    Antonioli added that a hypothetical and improbable trade  sanction against Peru will not affect at all the leaders of the  CGTP [General Confederation of Peruvian Workers] or the CTP  [Confederation of Peruvian Workers] who have made these charges  because they are not wage earners like the rest of the country's  workers.    "The elimination of import tax exemptions by the United  States would affect Peruvian workers but not their union  leaders," he said.    It must be pointed out that alleged violations of labor  rights were not made only during the Clinton administration.  Such charges also were made during the last part of the  administration of former President Bush when Peruvian union  leaders sought to make the United States adopt repressive  measures against Peru, but they were never taken into  consideration.    The AFL-CIO used to represent to CGTP leaders a symbol of  oligarchy, of "Yankee imperialism," but now the CGTP wants this  organization to raise charges of alleged labor rights  violations. "All this is incredible," Antonioli said. [passage  omitted]    Regarding this attitude, Minister Antonioli said: "The  current CGTP leaders are not respecting the agreements made  between the government and deceased CGTP leader Pedro Huillca  Tecse. All the progress we made during the negotiations with him  is lost. I do not understand the current union leaders' policy."    As for the observations made by the ILO to the Peruvian  Government in the labor field, Antonioli said our country  already has given a sound explanation about Peruvian workers'  real situation and the labor policy implemented by the  administration of President Alberto Fujimori.    "Our labor law has 86 articles and seven complementary,  temporary, and final provisions. The ILO has observed 16  articles and some clauses, which means that the rest of the law  is correct. The articles that were questioned are exactly those  we explained with foundation, clearly establishing their scope,"  Minister Antonioli said.</p>

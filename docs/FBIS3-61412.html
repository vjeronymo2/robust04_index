It  has been demonstrated that heating a solution of neptunium (IV)  hydroxide in excess nitric acid results in 70 percent conversion  of neptunium to the colloidal state, depending on the  temperature and acidity. Also, preparation of uranium (IV) sols  by oxidation- peptization has been well established, and  therefore it is reasonable to assume that neptunium (IV) sols  may be prepared by an analogous method. In the present work  neptunium (IV) hydroxide was prepared by treating neptunium (IV)  oxalate with ammonia. The hydroxide had minimum oxalate ion  content and Np (V) impurity. It was then peptized with  hydrochloric, nitric, and acetic acids to yield Np (IV) sols in  2-2.5 mole/liter concentrations and not over 4 percent Np (V)  content. Absorption spectra are presented.

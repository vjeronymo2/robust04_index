			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / German vision of EU outlined The transfer of sovereignty away from member states to European Union institutions remains at the core of European unification, Mr Roman Herzog, the German president, told a group of Belgian businessmen yesterday. 'This conviction of the founding fathers . . . has lost none of its importance nor of its topicality,' he said, addressing the problem of how to fashion a union of 20 or more member states as more countries queue up to join. His forthright endorsement of a united Europe comes at a time when governments are playing down the emphasis on further integration and highlighting, to increasingly sceptical citizens, that national governments remain in charge of the European Union. But speaking to the Federation of Belgian Enterprise, Mr Herzog said the German presidency of the Union - which comes to an end in December  - had allowed a united Germany to show that it still subscribed wholeheartedly to a united Europe. 'The conclusion of the Maastricht treaty allowed the Union to take a big step forward,' he said. 'That is not to say that in the face of new challenges, the Union will not have to work to win the confidence of its citizens, and in some instances, win it back.' Addressing the principal theme of the German presidency - enlargement of the EU to take in the countries of east and central Europe - Mr Herzog pointed out that western Europe would not be able to continue to enjoy its current levels of wealth and security if east and central Europe remained poor and insecure. But he warned that 'adhesion cannot happen from one day to the next. Among the countries waiting to join, none has yet completely surmounted the profound crisis brought on by transformation that all of them face.' Last month France and Germany called upon the Commission to produce a white paper setting out a plan for enlargement to the east.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Arts (Openings): New York The Mostly Mozart Festival opens tomorrow at the Lincoln Center with a concert in which baritone Thomas Hampson will sing arias from Mozart operas and Shura Cherkassky will play Chopin. Guest conductors during the seven-week festival include Mark Elder, Jane Glover and Joshua Rifkin. One of the more unusual programmes is a concert on July 28 when three pianists of contrasting styles - Helene Grimaud, Robert Levin and Cecile Licad - will play three different Mozart concertos.</p>

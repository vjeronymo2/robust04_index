			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Selin Caglayan, Faruk Balikci, and Saban Sevinc report: </F> "The PKK Is Reluctant To Leave Zhalah"]    [Excerpt] A team from HURRIYET has succeeded in traveling  to the Zhalah Camp in northern Iraq, which was bombed by Turkey  last week. The Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] militants were  reluctant to show the current situation of their camp to the  correspondents. They claimed, however, that only seven of their  colleagues were killed in the air attacks and noted: "We are  not afraid of bombs. As you have observed, we are still here in  the camp."    We reached the vicinity of the camp with great difficulty.  We arrived in an area that had many craters created by  exploding bombs. That area was 500 meters from the Zhalah Camp.  One of the PKK militants who blocked our way identified himself  as the person in charge of the camp. He claimed the Turkish  newspapers are being used as an tool, and said we could not  enter their camp. The correspondents said: "If you claim the  Turkish Government is lying, then you should allow us to enter  to determine the true state of affairs." However, the PKK  militants were determined not to allow us into their camp, which  had been destroyed by the military aircraft.    Two buildings close to the entrance of the camp seemed to be  intact. However, the main camp was hidden deep in the canyon.  The PKK militants refused to show us the results of the bombing  raids.    Although the PKK militants claimed that no damage was caused  to the camp, a resident of Shele village, which is near the  Zhalah Camp, said: ``The Turkish aircraft dropped many bombs.  It was like hell. Even Saddam Husayn was not bombed by the  United States to that extent. I saw buildings collapse." He  also said he was in the camp when the Turkish aircraft attacked.    It has been ascertained that the bombing of the camp  frightened nearby villagers a lot. However, residential areas  and civilians around the camp were unharmed except for some  individuals who were smuggling contraband goods on mules. The  journalists did not observe any damage in the villages around  the camp.    The PKK militants claimed that the Turkish aircraft dropped  their bombs from an altitude of 20,000 meters [as published] to  stay out of range of their antiaircraft guns. They also claim  that they shot down two aircraft, but were unable to describe  exactly where they crashed or to provide any evidence to confirm  their claim.    Several Kurdish sources in northern Iraq have said: "The PKK  militants have not been completely evicted. Although  significant damage has been caused in the camp, the PKK  militants are still there. However, they are demoralized. The  air attack was a very serious deterrent measure."    It has been ascertained that one of the villagers who  transported goods from Iran to northern Iraq on mules was  injured. The air operation caused significant anxiety in  northern Iraq.

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / This Week: FT guide to curbing the car On Wednesday the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution publishes its report on the environmental impact of Britain's traffic. What can the motorist expect? The commission, a 16-strong team of scientists and environmental experts, will be making more than 100 recommendations. These will include a sharp rise in fuel duties, improvements in car technology to reduce exhaust emissions, and targets for air pollution, noise and the reduction of accidents. Although higher taxes are one of the areas on which the commission will concentrate, there are limits because of the impact of increased costs on the road haulage industry and ultimately the economy. Rural dwellers would also be severely disadvantaged. What has prompted this? The apparently unstoppable growth in car ownership. Car numbers rose from 2m in 1952 to 20m in 1992, and official studies forecast an increase of between 83 per cent and 142 per cent in car ownership by 2025. Cars accounted for 57 per cent of all journeys in 1989-91, up from 48 per cent in 1985-86. Is the car really so damaging to the environment? Evidence has been accumulating in recent years that car emissions are harmful to health. Leaded petrol has been identified as adversely affecting the IQ of children and there are now suggestions that car exhausts are behind the increased incidence of asthma. Vehicle emissions frequently push air pollution levels above World Health Organisation and European Union guidelines in some parts of Britain. Individual pollutants, such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide, are of great concern, but there are worries that taken together they create a 'cocktail effect' which is not yet fully understood. Apart from air pollution, cars cause noise, vibration and accidents while the roads needed to accommodate car use eat up large tracts of countryside. Motorists' organisations complain the car driver is already heavily taxed, but some estimates put the cost of pollution and accidents at between Pounds 10bn and Pounds 20bn a year. What is the government doing about this? It is gradually moving towards a more environmentally friendly transport policy, though its critics say there is still a long way to go. For example, last March it dropped or froze one-third of the 371 roads schemes pencilled in for completion over the next 10 years. Very few completely new roads will be built but existing ones will be widened and the by-pass programme will continue. The emphasis is now moving to managing the existing road network more effectively by means of in-car systems which provide advice on route-planning and avoiding congestion, and by more informative road signs linked to traffic control centres. An ambitious programme to install electronic tolls on Britain's 1,900-mile motorway network is under way for completion in 1998. Cynics say these moves have as much to do with reducing government spending as with improving the environment. Why is the government paying more attention to the environmental arguments? Partly because of a growing body of evidence from research and partly because political pressures are increasing. The government committed itself to working out an environmental policy at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and the results are now coming through. A broad coalition has been formed against the car and roads. This includes not just organisations such as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace but also the National Trust, the Council for the Protection of Rural England and professional bodies such as the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Conservative MPs whose constituencies lie in the path of road schemes are under pressure from their voters. So why does the government still spend Pounds 2bn a year on its roads programme - 60 per cent of its transport budget? Although people want to reduce car use generally, they still cling stubbornly to using their own cars because it provides convenience, safety and prestige. Company cars account for more than half of all cars sold in the UK, encouraging employees to drive rather than use the train. Meanwhile, 89 per cent of freight tonnage is moved by road. Couldn't drivers be persuaded to switch to more environmentally friendly means of transport, such as trains, buses or bicycles? Public transport is expensive by international standards, while low levels of spending mean it is often unattractive, inefficient or inappropriate to today's needs. A six-mile commuter trip in London costs Pounds 15.65p, compared with Pounds 12.24p in Berlin, Pounds 8.80p in Paris and a European average of Pounds 8.11p. Spending on railway infrastructure in Britain is just over Pounds 5 per head of population, compared with Pounds 48 in Sweden and Pounds 29 in the Netherlands. The cyclist is poorly provided for in most cities.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Dubovskiy of the Russian Academy of </F> Sciences Institute of Systemic Analysis: "State Ensnared by  Post-Shock Inflation" -- from the FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA section]    [Text] The government intends to lower the rate of price  increases from 20-25 percent per month to 8-9 percent per month  by the end of the year. Erstwhile ministers now in opposition  are casting doubt over the realism of these intentions. What,  then, are the real opportunities and reserves for cutting  inflation?    The January 1992 price leap not only brought the economic  system to the point of equilibrium between supply and demand  but, at the same time as destroying the population's savings, it  destroyed enterprises' circulating capital. The tax base  narrowed as the economy went into decline, and tax receipts  declined. At the same time, the government switched part of the  state's traditional revenue away from the banking system and  foreign trade into private structures -- commercial banks and  export-import firms.    After losing tax receipts and giving up revenue, the state  encountered an excess of expenditure over revenue, in other  words a state budget deficit which had to be covered with the  help of emissions. Owing to a lack of circulating capital,  enterprises could not pay each other for supplies, and thus  mutual offsetting of non-payments had to be implemented and  compensatory credits issued. This also required the issue of  additional means of payment.    Following the organization of the ruble zone, over a dozen  central banks began to compete in issuing completely unsecured  monies. Thus began the post-shock inflation which has persisted  for over two years. Why has it proved so stubborn?    The fact is that the amount of money in circulation and  prices are rising faster than enterprises' circulating capital,  for which reason the slump in production is continuing at a rate  of 18-20 percent per year. Accordingly, actual tax receipts  into the budget are falling, and the budget deficit is again  making it necessary to print "superfluous" money. The economy  has fallen into the trap of stubborn post-shock inflation and  decline.    Calculations indicate that the complete abolition of  compensatory credits will cut inflation to 10 percent per month,  but this will prompt a wholesale slump in production of over 30  percent a year. And if enterprises are compensated in full for  inflation, then the economic slump will halt, but rates of  inflation will rise to 50 percent per month.    It is impossible to stay in such a position for long,  insofar  as the tactics of taking the middle course merely postpone the  moment of the onset of an uncontrollable economic slump.    One such method is based on the use of an abnormally large  foreign trade surplus -- that is, the excess of Russia's exports  over its imports. In 1992, this surplus comprised roughly  one-third of GDP, while in 1993 it was approximately one-fourth.    This enormous, nonreturnable export of Russia's resources  derives from two streams -- aid donated to former USSR republics  and the flight of foreign capital to foreign commercial banks.  It is essential to find acceptable methods for halting these  streams, which are bleeding the country of material resources,  and the Central Bank of inflationary streams of money.    In the second half of 1993, a portion of the steps in this  direction had already been taken. The ruble zone was  demolished; donated aid to the republics had stopped in part;  and a modicum of control, albeit weak but control nevertheless,  had been introduced over currency exporters. This allowed the  country to stay afloat despite the unprecedented economic slump.  However, the flight of capital continues pretty much at the  former level. And tax reforms, which could close the way to  outward-bound streams and remove the pressure from commodity  producers, is slowing down.    Unless the chance given to Viktor Chernomyrdin's government  is exploited, then like it or not the country will be left with  just one more option -- to introduce an economic state of  emergency, to freeze wages and prices, and to return for a while  to state regulation -- in other words to go back to where it was  in December 1991, only this time with a semi-destroyed economy.</p>

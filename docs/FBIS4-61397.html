			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with opposition politician Sergey Baburin by Yan </F> Ulanskiy: "Sergey Baburin: We Shall Come to Power in the Fall"  -- place and date not given]    [Text] [Ulanskiy] Sergey Nikolayevich, the face of those  in power is always better seen from the opposition trenches.  What do you think of it?    [Baburin] A mafia has long come to power.    [Ulanskiy] ??? [as published]    [Baburin] I didn't think this up. Everybody has been  talking about this for more than a year. Today mafia-like  criminal structures have unleashed an unprecedented political  terror. They are killing deputies, torching their apartments.  There was no such thing in the Soviet Union. The Federal  Counterintelligence head has recently admitted the existence of  "Betar" Zionist armed formations.    [Ulanskiy] Do Betar men terrorize deputies?    [Baburin] I didn't say that. I don't think they are  involved. But they do exist.    [Ulanskiy] You spoke resolutely against the signing of the  Treaty on Social Accord. Has your attitude to this document  changed now?    [Baburin] It has not. I continue to think that it is the  highest degree of hypocrisy to sign something behind the  people's back. It doesn't even smack of accord so far.    [Ulanskiy] What guideposts would you set on the "Russian  road" [allusion to Baburin's group] to accord?    [Baburin] We will come to accord one generation from now at  best. One should not entertain any illusions here. As for  civil peace, we must come to it immediately. Because the only  possible alternative is war. Why do I say no accord is  possible? What sort of accord could there be between someone  who has been stealing and someone who has been made a pauper?  But their differences must be resolved without butchery.  Therefore, as the first guidepost, we should sit down and  decide what we regard as the first priority in the area of the  economy, which measures would rescue the economy and which enjoy  the support of all sensible political forces. All forces that  have influence in society. Such figures.... who have  discredited themselves as leaders should go, owing to the  failure of their economic and political policies.    There should also be accord in regard to individuals:  someone should quit, someone should come in. And there should  either a coalition government be formed, or it should be stated  flatly, who is going to form a one-party government. Today we  can see that no single party wishes to take over responsibility  for what is going on in the country. Not a single one. In our  parliament there are 10 factions, but I do not think you could  find even one that would call itself the ruling faction.    [Ulanskiy] What about Zhirinovskiy? He constantly trumpets  his victory in the elections.    [Baburin] No! He always underlines that they would come to  power only in the fall. Like hell! It is ourselves who will  come to power in the fall.    [Ulanskiy] We?    [Baburin] We, is the Russian pan-national union and state-  patriotic organizations. We have no use for either today's  ruiners or impostors who chant patriotic slogans while having  always supported the ruining of the country in practice.    [Ulanskiy] Power is wonderful. But who is after all going  to decide today on who is to quit the political stage and who is  to emerge onto it?    [Baburin] Parliament, among others. If it finds no common  language, well, early elections should be called both for  parliament and president. There's nothing awful about that.    [Ulanskiy] Do you agree with the slogans with which the  implacable opposition has defiled the White House environs:  "Prosecute Yeltsin's Gang," "Betar is the Guard of Bandit  Yeltsin," and so on?    [Baburin] I usually make use of terms I understand. This  topic is so far very painful for me, and I do not touch on it in  passing.    [Ulanskiy] Does this mean your stance is that of open  radicalism, that you do not call for violence, for the overthrow  of today's authority?    [Baburin] For resignation, yes; for overthrow, no. So far!  [Interview ends]    P.S. Baburin's last "so far" rang out like a tocsin. That  single short remark showed that the opposition has already  recovered from last October's concussion. It has rejected the  treaty on accord in society only because it needs no two-year or  even one-month truce. It is ready for spilling fresh blood now  to satisfy its own ambitions.</p>

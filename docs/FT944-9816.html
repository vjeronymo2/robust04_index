			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Observer: Training tips Things seem to be picking up for the family of the late Robert Maxwell, the disgraced media tycoon. Betty Maxwell, his widow, has started popping up everywhere giving her version of life with the megalomaniac. Her new biography - A Mind of My Own - can only increase sympathy for young Ian and Kevin Maxwell who are due to stand trial next year for their involvement in alleged fraud relating to their late father's media empire. However, it raises the question of whether the authorities acted correctly in banning Maxwell the Musical on the grounds that it might prejudice a fair trial for the Maxwell boys. Talking of fair trials, a young jock looking remarkably like Ian Maxwell was testing out the equipment last week at the Pounds 800-a-year Mecklenburgh Health Club, normally a favoured haunt of slim-line lawyers rather than recipients of legal aid. Perhaps he is getting in training for next year's big fight with the Serious Fraud Office?</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERPRETING ELECTION RESULTS  </P> <P> I wondered what explanations the fundamental liberal media elitists would  conjure up to save face after yet another attempt to brainwash the public into  thinking that a handful of "religious extremists" was all that was backing  passage of the repeal of special rights ordinances in Irvine, Concord and San  Francisco.  </P> <P> I thought the excuse for San Francisco was original: the earthquake. And I also  heard someone on a San Francisco talk show say that in off-year elections,  there's a more conservative turnout. I guess you could use that alibi for the  Irvine and Concord results as well. I have an explanation of my own. How about  this: The majority of voters in these cities (and they can't all be "religious  extremists") did not want the unequal special rights ordinances forced on them  by a few politicians.  </P> <P> BRENDA HESTER  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

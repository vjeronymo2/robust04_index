			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (22): Symbols are important - The Indians / The majority indigenous peoples Mr Victor Hugo Cardenas, Bolivia's vice-president, receives visitors in his ornate office in La Paz's legislative palace. Seating his guests around him, he indicates the most elaborate gilded chair and jokes: 'This is my throne'. Symbols are important for this first-ever Aymara to be elected to such high office. Every hour of the day since he was sworn in, Mr Cardenas has worn over his left shoulder a finely-woven scarf of vicuna hair - 'except when I'm in the shower,' says the Sorbonne-trained educator and leader of the indigenous MRTKL political party. 'A (native) priest gave it to me on behalf of the Bolivian people and told me never to take it off. It symbolises authority and social control.' Returning the scarf at the end of his term, Mr Cardenas will have to give account to priest and people of his actions in government. Mr Cardenas takes his symbolic role seriously. He aims to 'build in the political arena a genuinely democratic state where the indigenous, the peasants and the marginalised are not just guinea-pigs for experiments made by the government of the day.' Bolivia, like Peru and Ecuador, is a country in which indigenous peoples are in a majority. Quechua and Aymara are widely spoken. Whites, proportionately over-represented in formal business and government, are an absolute minority. 'We have a dream: that the political system which has always excluded the majority will accept us. Where does exclusion lead? Sooner or later to confrontation between Bolivians. Because when the excluded lack channels of expression within the political system, they seek other methods. Indigenous and non-indigenous must unite to transform the structure of our country.' Mr Cardenas has personal experience of exclusion, or discrimination. 'My father's name was Pedro Choquehuanca Pinto: because of his indigenous background he could not enter university. When he married, he changed his name to Cardenas so his children should not suffer the same fate. I can understand why he did that but, today, conditions have changed and I wouldn't do it.' His own wife's experience - she left the teaching profession because she was not permitted to hold classes wearing her traditional Indian clothes - has helped give education a high priority on the list of reforms. Bolivia is moving towards a bilingual educational syste where indigenous children will be taught first in their native language, adding Spanish later. Teachers will be permitted to wear traditional dress. Mr Cardenas hopes reforms such as these will help revert the depressing statistics: children on average take 12 years to complete a six-year course. Not surprisingly, the drop-out rate is extremely high. While Mr Cardenas is certainly a figure full of symbolism, he appears to have succeeded in escaping the historically non-influential and decorative role of a Bolivian vice-president. 'I don't just sell government policy; I hear the viewpoints and arguments of the excluded and I channel them to the appropriate area in the executive branch where they are dealt with. We want to bring state and society together.' Mr Cardenas argues that even though the state has ignored them, Bolivia's marginalised have notched up many business successes and pressed for a more economically liberal society. 'If many of us have survived, it's because of our strong shared and community ties, even among the migrants to the cities. Goni (President Sanchez de Lozada) has his traditions, his modernity, and I have mine. Together we want to create an alchemy - and so far, it's working.'</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: ANS improves to Pounds 1.82m ASSOCIATED Nursing Services, the nursing home specialist, announced pre-tax profits improved from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 1.82m in the year to end-March. Mr Nick Dhandsa, chief executive, said: 'The group continued to grow profitably, particularly in its core nursing home business.' He said the board proposed the resumption of dividends, passed since the 1991 interim, with a payment of 1p for the year. The company's decision not to comply with the new FRS 3 accounting standards meant that a Pounds 1.05m charge in the 1992 figures remained below the line. ANS said it had not yet adopted FRS 3 as it had already been forced to restate last year's figures to comply with the judgment of the Financial Reporting Review Panel. In 1992 the Panel expressed concern over ANS's capitalisation of interest costs on new homes for longer than the three-month norm. Profits were struck on turnover down to Pounds 17.8m compared with Pounds 18.5m last time, which included Pounds 3.44m from discontinued operations. Administrative expenses fell to Pounds 3.95m (Pounds 4.23m) and interest payments fell on the back of lower UK interest rates and reduced borrowings. The company raised Pounds 1.54m in a placing and secured Business Enterprise Scheme funding to operate 200 beds. Earnings per share fell to 16.6p (19p) diluted by the placing.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / S African budget tries to 'face facts' MR DEREK KEYS, the South African finance minister, yesterday presented a tough budget aimed at restoring fiscal discipline while boosting economic growth. Presenting his first budget, Mr Keys sharply cut the corporate tax rate, from 48 to 40 per cent, in an attempt to promote investment and spur growth after four years of recession. He clawed back part of the concession by imposing a 15 per cent tax on distributed profits. However, the net effect will be sharply to cut the effective tax rate for most companies, a key element of the economic restructuring plan published by Mr Keys last week. Companies which reinvest a large proportion of profits will enjoy a substantial tax incentive. Business leaders welcomed the attempt by Mr Keys, former chairman of the mining house Gencor, to balance the need for fiscal discipline with the imperative of promoting growth. Government current spending is to be cut substantially in real terms - another important element of the restructuring  -with the spending increase held to 6.5 per cent against projected inflation of 10 per cent. Defence spending is to fall by some 14 per cent in real terms, its fourth successive sharp annual decline. Total spending will rise to R114bn, an increase of 8.8 per cent on 1992-93, with revenue rising 16.5 per cent to R89bn, leaving a deficit equivalent to 6.8 per cent of gross domestic product. This remains high, but represents a substantial drop from last year's 8.6 per cent deficit. Consumers will suffer under the budget, which was delivered against a difficult political background as the transition to democracy fuels popular demands. VAT was increased from 10 to 14 per cent, which drew immediate criticism from the African National Congress, despite the fact that certain basic foodstuffs were zero-rated in an attempt to mitigate its impact on the poor. Dr Conrad Strauss, chairman of the Standard Bank group, commended the company tax initiative as 'very pyschologically important' and the curb placed on state spending. Retailers, however, expressed concern. Mr Raymond Ackerman, chairman of Pick 'n Pay, the country's largest supermarket group, said the consumer would be 'hit between the eyes', business confidence damaged and economic recovery delayed.</p>

Pavlov,  Russian Academy of Sciences, Saint Petersburg; UDC  615.214.21.032.813.2.036.076.9]    [Abstract] The effects of haloperidol administered via  repeated intraperitoneal [IP] injection (2 mg/kg) were compared  with those of haloperidol administered via bilateral injection  into the striatum (5 g) of male Wistar rats weighing 200 to  250 g each in two series of experiments that each involved two  groups of rats. In series 1, nine rats received 0.3-ml IP  injections. The animals in group 1 received haloperidol in a  dose of 2 mg/kg, and those in the control group were injected  with a physiological solution. In series 2, 10 rats were  injected with haloperidol bilaterally into the rostral region of  the neostriatum through cannulas that had been implanted in them  while they were anesthetized. The cannulas implanted into the  group 1 animals were filled with a 5 percent haloperidol  solution sufficient for several dozens of injections, whereas  the cannulas implanted in the group 2 animals were filled with a  physiological solution. Each injection had a volume of 1 l  (5  g haloperidol). The microinjections were begun 3 days after  the implantation operations and were continued daily for 3  weeks. The rats were tested for catalepsy 10 and then 30 minutes  after each injection, and their spontaneous motor activity was  evaluated between 20 and 25 minutes after injection. The 3-week  course of daily microinjections of 5 g of haloperidol into  the rats' neostriatum induced a set of Parkinsonism-like  symptoms in the form of rigidity and akinesia but not in  catalepsy. IP injection of haloperidol, on the other hand,  resulted in inhibition of conditioned avoidance reflexes and in  catalepsy. The effects of haloperidol began to appear on day 7  of the experiment, gradually increased, and persisted until  several days after the haloperidol was discontinued. The toxic  effects of haloperidol that are inevitable when the drug is  administered systemically for a prolonged period were completely  absent in the mice studied. Instead, the effects of the  haloperidol proved reversible and remained localized. Like other  researchers, the authors of this study were unable to achieve  parkinsonian syndrome in rats by system injection of  haloperidol. They attributed this fact to specific differences  between mice and humans and emphasized the fact that chronic  injection of haloperidol into the striatum did not result in  catalepsy, which appears to contradict thinking regarding the  involvement of the striatum and its dopaminergic system in the  pathogenesis of cataleptic rigidity. The authors explained this  phenomenon by stating that local injection results in different  pharmacologic loads that do not trigger catalepsy but that  instead induce akinesia similar to parkinsonian akinesia. They  further stated that consideration must be given to the fact that  in the case of systemic injection, neuroleptics exert a mediated  effect on the central nervous system through somatic systems  (for example, because of a change in the content of metals in  blood plasma, which in turn results in a whole set of  biochemical disorders).

			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HEARING POSTPONED ON LANDFILL EXPANSION  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Planning Commission has postponed a public hearing set for  Tuesday on plans to expand the Lopez Canyon Landfill in Lake View Terrace.  </P> <P> The hearing has been rescheduled for 9 a.m. Aug. 21 at the Airtel Plaza Hotel  in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> The hearing was postponed because the South Coast Air Quality Management  District is conducting hearings into alleged violations of state air pollution  laws at the landfill. Neighbors in the Kagel Canyon and Lake View Terrace areas  have asked the AQMD hearing board to close the dump.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation wants to almost double the capacity of the  city's only dump to 26 million tons, extending the landfill's life through the  year 2005.  </P> <P> Without the expansion, the landfill must close in 1992, and the city would have  to find another place to dump 4,000 tons of household trash collected each day.  The dump opened in 1974.  </P></p>

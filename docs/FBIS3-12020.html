Domestic savings are stagnant at 6.5 percent of GNP, that  is,  10 percent under the highest level reached in 1979. This has  become a serious structural obstacle to achieving self-financing  [financiamiento autonomo] of the economy. This will demand a  growing foreign debt to reach high growth rates as long as  financial reform does not mature.    Although investment as a ratio of GNP recovered slightly  between 1986 and 1993, it is still about 7 percent under the  1982 figure, according to information issued by the Bank of  Mexico and Nacional Financiera and the Fifth Government Report,  which EL FINANCIERO reviewed.    Jose Luis Calva, researcher for the Economic Research  Institute of the UNAM [National Autonomous University of  Mexico], thinks that the launching of the neo-liberal model was  based on the diagnosis that insufficient domestic savings was  among the "main causes" of the foreign debt crisis. This was  provoked by the so-called "financial repression" that limited  the expansion of investment, maintained negative real interest  rates, promoted the inefficiency of local intermediaries, and  restricted an efficient allocation of resources. It was argued  that domestic financial deregulation and the opening of foreign  markets would promote domestic savings and investment.    Calva thinks that the problem was that only financial  savings  (M4 minus bills and coins in circulation) grew while domestic  savings "collapsed" and investment, which has not managed to  return to the levels reached in the early 1980's despite a heavy  inflow of foreign capital. [sentence as published]. Thus, at  present there is heavy dependence on foreign savings [ahorro  externo] to maintain the rhythm of expansion with the risks that  financial dependence entail.    Financial savings increased from 32 to about 45 percent of  GNP between 1982 and 1993. This situation stemmed from the fact  that real interest rates were unusually higher than foreign  interests rates. This and increases in the value of assets in  the stock market afforded foreign investors significant profits  in the money market.    Financial savings, however, are not in line with domestic  savings and investment because -- paradoxically -- part of the  foreign capital has been used to increase the central bank's  international reserves, to increase the demand for imported  goods -- which was repressed for 80 years for affecting the  balance of payments on the current accounts -- and to increase  savings and financing of private investment abroad.    Domestic savings, however, have moved the opposite way.  Although they improved, relatively speaking, between 1988 and  1989, by 1993 they had dropped to 6.5 percent of GNP, the lowest  figure of any six-year period and 10 percent lower than the best  year, 1979. In fact, the expost effective domestic savings  [ahorro local efectivo expost] appears insensitive to the high  real passive rates [altas tasas pasivas reales] paid. The gap  between savings and investment has become a "bottleneck" for the  economy, especially for companies that have no access to foreign  financing and stay away from bank credit.    Bank savings (M2) also dropped between 1987 and 1993. They  went from 24.5 percent of GNP to about 20 percent in 1993. This  shows that the so-called "bank modernization" has not even come  close to the goals that justified it.    Even more serious is the fact that due to the shortage of  domestic savings, the potential for growth will continue to  increasingly depend on foreign savings and fluctuations of  foreign capital (direct financial investment) whose limits could  be reached anytime. After an apparent absence between 1982 and  1987, foreign savings as a ratio of GNP reached 6-7 percent in  1993.    Investment is not in line with financial savings either. It  was 27 percent of GNP in 1980. It was 20.4 percent of GNP in  1988, and will probably reach 20 percent of GNP in 1993. In  contrast, capital accumulation was a victim of stabilization  policies and structural adjustments.</p>

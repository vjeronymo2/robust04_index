			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Allianz Yesterday's 3 per cent fall in the share price of Europe's biggest insurer looked like a knee-jerk reaction to a well-trailed but still expensive underwriting loss of DM1.8bn. Although the performance of Allianz has not been out of line with the market this year, its shares now stand a full 15 per cent below their level of DM2,306 when the last rights issue was announced in February. The broader question is whether Allianz has frittered away shareholders' funds on overpriced acquisitions unlikely to offer a realistic return in the near term. After all, first-time consolidation of US and east German subsidiaries accounted for DM1.25bn of extraordinary underwriting losses. Conditions in the UK and French markets continued to deteriorate and the domestic market is hardly healthy, judging by a two-thirds fall in underwriting profit. With its shares yielding only a shade over 0.6 per cent, Allianz still has a low enough cost of equity capital to take a long-term view. But the patience of some shareholders is clearly being tested. The promise of extensive cost-cutting suggests Allianz is getting more serious about earnings. It may also be nearing the bottom of the underwriting cycle in most key markets - although it could be years before income matches costs in east Germany, in spite of a promise of sharply higher premiums. Moreover, while it remains difficult to pin a precise value on the investment portfolio through the cloudy medium of German accounting practice, stated earnings from investments reached DM3.56bn last year. Against this background, the group's first ever underwriting loss looks less threatening.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Jihad and the propagation of  virtue and prohibition of vice are designed to reform society.  Of course, reform of the individual man is the reform of  society but these things go in steps. Usually not all members  of a society are mature and pious. That would be an ideal  society. But maybe it is not our destiny to have such a  society. Even according to our religious documents there will  be wicked elements during the rule of the imam of time. Even  in a revolutionary society, even in a pious society, even in a  society where the majority of people are pious, jihad and the  propagation of virtue and prohibition of vice must continue to  exist. Domestically, public supervision which is the propagation  of virtue and prohibition of vice is constructive, while jihad  has greater meaning in facing foreign wickedness. Every society  faces threats domestically and from outside. Today has been  named the day of prayer after the factors that will guard the  revolution. They will strengthen the very factors that brought  about the revolution. Prayers are a necessity for humans;  without praying, remembering God, and paying attention to  spirituality, and without analyzing one's own actions, there  will be no development of human character. Brothers and sisters,  pay attention to your prayers. [passage omitted]    The Koran has always emphasized that we must look at both  sides: the material and the spiritual. Our imams have said that  those who forget either the material or the spiritual are not  one of us. Extremism is condemned whichever way it may go. If  we do not pray, fast, read the Koran, visit the shrines, or go  on the hajj, and if we think that worshipping of the divine is  limited to serving the people -- even if we spend all our life  serving the people -- but fail to pay attention to spiritual  matters, we will move toward destruction. But also if we think  to the contrary and believe that the material life should be  abandoned, then our society will be poor, we will be poor, the  enemy will overcome us, we shall fall from honor, we will fall  prey to the enemy, and we will be in chains. It is necessary to  maintain interest in both.    The jihad for the propagation of virtue and prohibition of  vice is an issue of public supervision. We should be like  mirrors to each other, reminding others -- according to  religious laws -- of their weaknesses, and in order to show the  wrong and the right path. We should look after each other. This  is the essence of piety. These are the manifestations of a pious  society. Those who think that it is possible to have a  prosperous society without these spiritual elements are wrong.    What better evidence than the situation in the advanced  western countries? The condition that they face, their spirit  of aggression, their selfishness, and the great and dangerous  injustice that prevails in the world, are all due to the fact  that spiritual matters are not taken into account. Things that  you now see in Bosnia and things that are happening in the  Balkans are the best evidence for the brutality of arrogant  powers. Over there there is great injustice and great  treachery. The latest unfortunate event is that the Croatian  Government's military force which was earlier the target of  aggression and had thousands of men killed fighting against the  Serbs, has now crossed the borders and is attacking the innocent  Bosnian Muslim people, who are being attacked by the Serbs at  the same time. The world has yet not taken a correct step in  this case, although the Security Council has issued a warning  and given a two-week deadline for sanctions. We expected the  Security Council to take a serious view of this. It would be a  terrible precedent for a neighboring country officially and  militarily to er another country which is facing a so-called  civil war, and in order to support a group of people who are of  the same race -- and to massacre an innocent people in such way.  God willing, at least the neighboring countries and the  effective powers of the Security Council will remain vigilant  and will not tolerate this disgusting new suppression.    In today's Friday prayers we have some dear Muslim guests  from the friendly Muslim country of Brunei. The sultan and his  entourage are participating in our prayer ceremony. The fact  that a national leader, despite his usual program when visiting  another country, should remember the Friday prayers is a source  of great satisfaction. They have come to the prayers and we  welcome them and thank them. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- The Japanese  Government must, though belatedly, admit to Japan's  responsibility for the crime in drafting "comfort women for the  Army" in view of the international law, enact a domestic law of  its own accord and hold trials to bring criminal charges against  those responsible for the criminal case and manifest its  intention to restore the damaged honour of the victims and  international justice, says NODONG SINMUN today in a by-lined  article.    The Japanese Government authorities' act of avoiding full  investigation into the crime in drafting "comfort women for the  Army" and publication of its results is to duck their  responsibility for the anti-human arch crime under the  international law, the article says, and goes on:    The crime in drafting "comfort women for the Army" committed  by the Japanese imperialists is the most despicable and  diabolic, inhumane criminal act ever known in human history. It  is typical of the "crime against humanity" under the  international law.    Because it is, above all, a grave human rights abuse, in the  form of enslavement of women.    It falls under the "crime against humanity" according to  Subparagraph C of Paragraph 6 of the regulations of the  Nuremberg International Military Tribunal and Article 5 of the  Regulations of the Tokyo International Far Eastern Military  Tribunal.    The crime in drafting "comfort women for the Army" committed  by the Japanese Government and military was a forcible sexual  enslavement of women.    They deprived the "comfort women" of all their freedom and  rights, treated and murdered them like slaves.    This criminal case comes under the "crime against humanity"  also because it was committed as part of their scheme to  obliterate another nation.    The "imperial Army's" brutal cruelties against the "comfort  women for the Army" were praised as "qualities" of the "imperial  Army" because they were based on Japan's policy aimed at  obliterating the Korean nation itself.    This notwithstanding, the Japanese authorities are trying by  hook or by crook to avoid their responsibility for the criminal  case under the international law. They describe the publication  of "Results of Two Rounds of Investigation" as a fulfilment of  their duty and are intending to evade compensation with an offer  of something like "fund".    If the Japanese Government continually refuse to admit their  responsibility for the criminal case under the international  law, to probe the truth and make compensations, it will bump  into stronger condemnations from the international community.</p>

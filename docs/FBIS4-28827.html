			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry plans  to liberalize interest rates on housing loans charged by  commercial banks in July at the earliest, ministry sources said  Monday [13 June].    The sources said the decontrol will be incorporated in an  economic deregulation package to be worked out by the government  at the end of June.    They said banks would be accused of violating the  antimonopoly law if they manipulate interest rates on housing  loans through behind-the-scenes negotiations.    Fixed and variable interest rates on housing loans,  introduced in 1983, have been linked to movements of the  long-term prime lending rate charged by commercial banks on  loans to creditworthy customers.    The sources said commercial banks are studying the  possibility of linking housing loan interest with the short-term  prime rate, which reflects interest movements on the money  market.</p>

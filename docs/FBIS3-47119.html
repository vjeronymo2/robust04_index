The two sides also held  cordial talks.    After the meeting, ACM Woranat briefed correspondents on the  results of his talks with Liu Huaqing. He said that Liu Huaqing  had told him that China is willing to sell weapons to Thailand.  On this issue, ACM Woranat told the Chinese side that the Thai  military units have to stick to their plans when it comes to  procuring any weapons and cannot buy weapons at will. Warships  ordered by the Navy are now under construction in China.    ACM Woranat also said that Thailand has no policy of setting  up refugee holding centers along the border.

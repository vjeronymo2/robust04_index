			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- Deputies attending the  Second Session of the 12th National People's Congress [NPC]  continued group discussions of Premier Li Peng's "Government  Work Report" today, expressing their in-depth views on ways to  deal with relations among reform, development, and stability;  and to ensure that the three will promote each other and develop  in coordination.    This year is crucial to China's reform and development  process. Many deputies explained from both theoretical and  practical perspectives, the great significance of handling  relations among reform, develop, and stability well. Deputies  who are leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee and State  Council took part in the discussions and deliberations of their  respective delegations. Speaking at a meeting of the Sichuan  delegation, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua pointed out that each  country and region has its own laws governing economic  development, and it is necessary to guide our work according to  economic laws and to uncover the path to sustained, rapid, and  healthy development of the economy. He noted that  contradictions will emerge if economic development goes beyond  the available conditions and foundation. He emphasized the need  to control inflation to safeguard social stability. Speaking at  the Henan delegation's group discussion, Vice Premier Li Lanqing  also expressed deep concern about the impact of reform on  commodity prices. He called for using laws and regulations as  well as economic and administrative measures to carry out the  work of controlling commodity prices within ranges tolerable to  the masses. State Councillor Li Tieying took party in the Jilin  delegation's discussion. He said: This year is crucial to  reform. Reform will inevitably generate new developments and  problems. We must follow closely, investigate and study, and  earnestly review our experiences. Fundamentally speaking,  reform represents the interests of the masses of people. We  must trust and rely on the masses, and successfully guide and  protect their reform initiatives. Comrade Ding Guangen took part  in the Shaanxi delegation's discussion and deliberation.    Deputies from the People's Liberation Army delegation  indicated: The "Government Work Report" explains the relations  among reform, development, and stability in a way that shows our  party and government understands more profoundly the laws  governing socialist construction, possesses clearer ideas about  deepening reform, and will formulate more prudent principles and  policies.    Jia Qinglin, as a deputy from Fujian, said: The course of  reform and opening up in the last decade and more shows that our  cause advances whenever relations among reform, development, and  stability are handled well, and tumbles or even suffers setbacks  when relations are handled incorrectly. Properly grasping the  "extent" of reform, development, and stability, and handling  their relations well by using a little more dialectics,  leadership arts, and by exercising high-standards of leadership,  are a major task and severe test facing leaders at various  levels in the new situation.    Deputies discussed how, on the basis of unified  understanding  and in light of reality in various regions and departments, to  proceed from the general interests of party and state work to  maintain a balance and mutual promotion among reform,  development, and stability. Xie Fei, as a deputy from  Guangdong, said: In practical work, first we must seize the  opportunity to deepen reform, open ourselves wider to the  outside world, and exert efforts to implement the series of  reform measures adopted by the state well. At the same time, we  must make full use of Guangdong's advantages to raise the level  and increase the scope of opening. Second, we must seize the  opportunity to develop the economy, put emphasis on developing  high and new technology industries, and maintain a steady growth  in agriculture. Third, we must strengthen unity, maintain  stability, keep ourselves sober-minded, and carry out our work  before problems occur, and promptly remove destabilizing factors.    Zhao Zhihao, as a deputy from Shandong, pointed out: The  reform measures announced this year will fairly significantly  change the interest distribution pattern in society. On top of  this, the operation of the new structure requires a link-up and  coordination process. As a result, the impact on the entire  economic operation will be greater than in past years. By the  same token, its effect and demand on social stability are more  salient than in the past. This requires us not to set  excessively high targets in the pace of development to avoid  over-strained relations between various economic sectors, and  thereby affect reform and stability. In announcing reform  measures, we must pay close attention to timing, intensity, and  supportability to avoid affecting the normal operation of the  economy and creating shockwaves in society. With respect to  social stability, we must emphasize integration between control  in accordance with the law and education to resolve all kinds of  contradictions and eliminate destabilizing factors.    Mao Zhiyong, as a deputy from Hunan, said: To correctly  handle relations among reform, develop, and stability, we must  grasp four key points in our work: First, we must further  emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, and use new ideas  and measures compatible with the new situation of a socialist  market economy to create a new phase in our work. Second, we  must enhance our awareness of storming heavily fortified  positions in reform and fight a successful battle to build a  socialist market economy. Third, we must earnestly seize the  development opportunity and promote development through improved  economic returns. Four, we must foster both material, and  cultural and ideological progress, attaching equal importance to  both, and work hard to advance the building of socialist  spiritual civilization.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Mubarak may undertake visit to Israel PRESIDENT Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said yesterday he was ready to visit Israel, but indicated further, substantial progress towards Middle East peace was needed before he travelled to the Jewish state. Opening a new chapter in relations with Israel, Mr Mubarak met the recently elected Israeli prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, and said the two were committed to advancing peace efforts. The Egyptian leader has previously said he was prepared to travel to Israel when the time was right. 'Mr Rabin invited me but frankly speaking, I need no invitation,' Mr Mubarak said. 'My response is positive to Mr Rabin.' But Mr Mubarak made it clear that Egypt was expecting 'much more' from Israel towards halting settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Asked about the Rabin government's moves to freeze temporarily settlement activity, Mr Mubarak declared, with the Israel leader seated next to him: 'It is a good step on the right track and we appreciate it, yet we need much more. But we leave it to him now.' Neither leader mentioned any specific agreements about joint efforts to revitalise the peace process, but it seems likely the two will co-ordinate closely in the weeks ahead. Mr Rabin welcomed an Egyptian offer to host bilateral talks between Israel and her Arab neighbours, including Syria, Lebanon and a Jordanian-Palestinian team. But he indicated that the negotiations launched in Madrid last October would resume in Rome and may move to Cairo later. Mr Rabin, who is on his first trip abroad since being sworn in earlier this month, called on other Arab states to follow Egypt's example and make peace with Israel. 'I believe the time has arrived ..for other countries, for other peoples, to divert from war, from the course of confrontation, and embark on the course of peace,' he said. The Israeli Prime Minister laid a wreath at the tomb of the late President Anwar Sadat whose 1977 visit to Jerusalem opened the way to Egypt's peace with Israel in 1979. Mr Sadat, whose mission set off a firestorm of criticism in Arab capitals, was assassinated by Moslem extremists in 1981. The US Secretary of State, Mr James Baker, meanwhile, was exerting strong pressure on Arab states to make compromise gestures towards Israel as he continued his latest Middle East shuttle. Speaking in Jerusalem yesterday before leaving for visits to Arab capitals, Mr Baker said he would be 'carrying a message that in my view there is a new opportunity to move forward.' The Secretary of State, on visits to Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia in the next few days, seems likely to press the Arabs to consider lifting their economic boycott against Israel, among other goodwill gestures. His visit to Syria has been complicated by the death of President Hafez al-Assad's mother. His talks with the Syrian president have been put off until today - after Mr Baker has made a quick shuttle to Cairo for talks with President Mubarak. Mr Baker's return to the Middle East days after the installation of the new Rabin government indicates Washington's desire for swift progress towards a resumption of Middle East peace efforts. The Bush administration wants to smooth relations with the American-Jewish community before the November presidential elections by re-establishing warm ties with Israel, and achieving progress in Middle East peacemaking to add lustre to its foreign policy record.</p>

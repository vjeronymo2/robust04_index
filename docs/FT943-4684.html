			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil sees 3.8% rebound Sao Paulo rebounded 3.8 per cent as a new opinion poll showed that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso had retained his lead in the presidential race, and might even win at the first round of voting on October 3. The market had plunged by 10.5 per cent on Monday amid worries that Mr Cardoso's candidature would be damaged in the wake of the resignation of Mr Rubens Ricupero as the economy minister. The Bovespa index ended 1,846 up at 49,886 after publication of the poll, conducted after Mr Ricupero's resignation. In New York, however, Goldman Sachs lowered its weighting in Brazilian stocks to neutral from overweight, on the view that Mr Cardoso was unlikely to succeed in the election in the first round, although it still expected him to win the presidency. The financial markets will be closed today as the country celebrates Independence Day.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / World Trade News: EC on US priority watch list in broadcasting row THE US has for the first time put the EC on its 'priority watch list' under the Special 301 provision of its Trade Act, because of barriers to entry of US TV programming embodied in EC broadcasting legislation. It has begun a separate action under Title 7 of the Act which could theoretically end in a ban on public procurement from EC sources. This is because of alleged EC discrimination against US suppliers in its public contracts policy. These moves are seen by Commission officials as pouring fuel on an EC-US trade relationship already heated by the Uruguay Round transatlantic farm subsidy row. The row over the broadcasting directive, which comes into effect on October 3, has been long and vexed. The legislation originally proposed limiting transmission of non-EC programming to under half, but now merely suggests this as a guideline. The alleged discrimination, and the margin of discretion for member states to implement it, has angered the US. Washington says this will not provide a single market for US broadcasting exports. The Special 301 move is seen here as a sign the US wants its complaints 'taken very seriously', a Commission official said. The EC has been moved from the 'watch' list to 'priority watch' for the first time. Germany, Italy, Greece and Spain have separately been on this list, kept for the most 'onerous' alleged intellectual property infringements. Brussels officials say the dispute should be handled within the Uruguay Round. They say that while the broadcasting directive is not yet law, the US has failed to implement a 1989 Gatt panel ruling requiring it to cease discriminating against imports accused of infringing patents. US products similarly accused got more favourable treatment, Gatt found. Officials claim the procurement dispute should be settled within the Round, since the 'buy Europe' provisions the US is attacking are not yet in force. These would, from 1993, allow buyers for government-regulated utilities to prefer bids from EC suppliers, if they are no more than 3 per cent dearer than the best bid from a third country. If no agreement is reached with the EC in 45 days, the US could hit back with a ban on procurement from European suppliers.</p>

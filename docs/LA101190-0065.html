			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN GETS 13 YEARS, THEN GETS MARRIED  </P> <P> A San Fernando gang member who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter was  sentenced to 13 years in prison Wednesday -- and then got married.  </P> <P> Hours after San Fernando Superior Court Judge John H. Major sentenced Alfonso  Tapia, 20, he officiated at Tapia's wedding to the man's girlfriend of eight  years.  </P> <P> In a plea bargain last month, Tapia pleaded no contest to charges stemming from  the Jan. 20, 1989, death of Miguel Jiminez, 15, of San Fernando. Prosecutors  had charged Tapia with murder, but agreed to the reduced charge because Jiminez  may have started the fight that resulted in his death.  </P> <P> The case had a curious beginning when a frantic witness reported the fight to  the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department station in Santa Clarita but his  call was not taken seriously. Deputy Jim Greene told caller Jim Finilla to  "have a nice day" before hanging up on him. The handling of the call triggered  criticism from Sheriff Sherman Block and led to a series of safeguards to  prevent similar mistakes.  </P></p>

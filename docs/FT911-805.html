			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of The Food Industry (4): Carnivores lose ground - Vegetarianism loses its 'cranky' image VEGETARIAN food is losing its 'cranky' image in the UK, up to a point. As more Britons eat less meat, food manufacturers and supermarkets are expanding their vegetarian ranges. But their marketing strategy demonstrates conclusively that the target audience is not so much professed vegetarians, although their numbers continue to grow, as the much larger number of omnivores seeking a healthier, more varied diet. In most cases, manufacturers whisper rather than shout the vegetarian nature of their food. Vegetarians, after all, are accustomed to checking labels carefully, while the biggest potential for growth is among consumers whose eating habits may have evolved more quickly than their self-image. Marketing Strategies for Industry estimates that 5.6m Britons, or 10 per cent of the population, now at least have eliminated red meat from their diets. Of these, 2.2m are believed to be lacto-ovo-vegetarians (eating dairy products and eggs) or vegans (eating no animal products). According to Mr Nigel Phillips, marketing director of Haldane Food Group, one of the largest independent vegetarian food manufacturers with annual sales of Pounds 25m, 9m Britons eat vegetarian meals three or more times a week. It is no surprise that the restaurant menu without specified vegetarian options is now the exception. In 1990, MSI says, UK sales of specialist vegetarian foods, conservatively defined to include vegetarian grills, ready meals, quiches and flans and cheddar cheese, soya and tofu products, vegetable stock and free-range eggs, reached Pounds 335m. Broader definitions, including vegetarian staples such as vegetables, pulses, nuts, pasta and rice, would take the total to well over Pounds 1bn, but would distort the figures, says MSI. However, the most important pointer to the future is the fact that more children than adults are vegetarian. The slow extinction of the 'family meal' because of changing lifestyles and the microwave revolution means that children now often have more freedom to choose their food from an early age. 'The growth market by far is the younger generation,' says Mr Phillips. 'Virtually every family will have a vegetarian in it. Generally it's a teenager and it's a girl.' But young vegetarians often share tastes with meat-eating peers, and they do not necessarily want 'adult' food. This factor was central to the development of one of Haldane's newer products, the 'No Bull Burger', which looks and tastes like meat, according to Mr Phillips. It was launched, by coincidence, at the height of public concern about bovine spongiform encephalopathy, 'mad cow disease.' Haldane had planned a meat-less burger because burgers remained a growth market, and teenagers, the single largest vegetarian group, ate 80 per cent of burgers in Britain. The company also knew it had to appeal to eyes as well as appetites, so it consulted 35 discussion groups combining meat-eating and vegetarian teenagers about not only the product but also about the packaging. The appeal to teenagers is evidence of a perceived division between two categories of vegetarian consumers. 'Hardened' vegetarians, Mr Phillips says, do not want anything which looks or tastes of meat, but the growth market is in meat analogues, despite the memory of early 'cardboard-tasting' versions of textured vegetable protein (TVP). The highest profile meat subsitute is Quorn, a mycoprotein - distantly related to the mushroom - made by continuous fermentation and marketed by Marlow Foods, an Imperial Chemical Industries-Ranks Hovis McDougall joint venture. It is sold both in ready meals and, more recently, on its own. Mr Ralph Pickles, Marlow's managing director, argues that early TVP flopped because it was marketed, cheaply, as a meat extender, and failed to deliver its promise on taste. 'People don't want cheap food, they want good quality food at a sensible price. Repeat purchases depend on taste.' Two thirds of people who tried Quorn were buying it again. Quorn's packaging says 'suitable for vegetarians' only in small letters. 'Our market research tells us that if we make that too prominent', Mr Pickles explains, 'it labels it as a vegetarian product which for a large part of the population, marks it out as unsuitable', largely on taste expectations. Other manufacturers share this ambivalence, as illustrated by their lukewarm approach to the Vegetarian Society's green V seal of approval. To earn it, a product must meet various criteria and the maker pays a negotiated annual licence fee. Among the brands which carry the seal on some products are Heinz, Baxters, Marmite and Golden Wonder. However, other manufacturers, including vegetarian specialists, find it unnecessary or even counter-productive. Mr Phillips of Haldane, for example, says: 'It is very expensive to put a V symbol on everything.' The length of time required for approval also inhibits manufacturers who are trying to bring out new products in competitive markets. He believes Haldane's reputation is well enough established to obviate the need for the symbol. It may be more important for manufacturers associated with meat products to pay for the symbol to guarantee that a specific product is vegetarian. But Dalepak Foods, which made its name in formed-meat grillsteaks but diversified into chopped-vegetable-and-rice grills a few years ago, has not felt the need to emphasise the vegetarian nature of the latter. Marlow's Quorn would not qualify for the V symbol in any case, since it is not made with free-range eggs, although Mr Pickles says: 'We would be very happy to use free-range eggs in our product if they were available.' It appears certain that meat will play a decreasing role in the British diet  -at least as a routine fuel, it may still be associated with special occasions for many people. But the commitment required to become a vegetarian rather than just eating vegetarian much of the time means it will probably continue to be a quiet revolution. This explains why Mr Phillips and his counterparts pay so much attention to the younger generation. 'If you become vegetarian, 90 per cent of the time you remain vegetarian.'

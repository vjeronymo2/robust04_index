			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Cellular phone grouping for US Four US regional telephone companies are to form a partnership in cellular telephones across the US, with almost 4m customers. The partners - Bell Atlantic, Nynex, US West and AirTouch - will also bid jointly for personal communication service (PCS) licences being auctioned off later this year by the US government. Bell Atlantic and Nynex, which serve most of the US eastern seaboard, had already agreed to merge their cellular interests. Separately, so had US West and AirTouch, which cover the West Coast. The new arrangement would not be a merger, the partners said. However, it would launch a nationally branded cellular service, possibly in combination with a long-distance phone company as a further partner. Referring to rumours that the Bell Atlantic/Nynex consortium had previously been trying to do a deal with MCI, the second largest US long distance company, the partners denied that their agreement represented a second best option. The US telephone industry has been involved in a strenuous search for partners since the recently completed merger of AT&amp;T with McCaw, which puts together America's biggest long-distance company and biggest cellular company. 'Everybody has been talking to everybody, and we are still talking,' one of the partners said yesterday. 'But we feel we have the critical mass to go alone if necessary.' One of the attractions of merging with a long-distance partner, industry observers said, was that only long-distance telephone companies such as AT&amp;T or MCI had a nationally recognised brand name. The partners said the new entity, provisionally known as Tomco, would bid for PCS licences on the basis of filling in geographic areas where the partners were not represented.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos Vargas] </F>   [Text] Comptroller General Jose Chen Barria yesterday  rejected the possibility that the government would declare a  national foreign debt moratorium to face the consequences of the  1994 budget cuts totalling $198 million.    The comptroller general made his statement before the  legislature's Budget Commission after Christian Democratic Party  legislator Gabriel Arosemena asked him about the possibility  that the government would declare a national moratorium to delay  payments to the IFIS [international financial institutions] and  would use those funds to compensate for the budget cuts.    Chen Barria emphatically denied such steps would be taken  and  he warned a national moratorium declaration would result in  worse conditions than those trying to be resolved with the  budget cuts.    The comptroller general indicated that 37 cents of every  dollar that enters the public treasury is earmarked for IFIS  payments. Chen Barria warned that Panama is a country which  needs foreign credits to make investments because it cannot  accomplish much with its internal savings.    The comptroller general met with members of the legislative  commission to evaluate the consequences of the budget cuts that  were made as a result of the delay in disbursements by the IFIS.  The disbursements were delayed because Panama has not met the  IFI's demands.    After reaching an agreement with the comptroller general,  the  budget commission decided to suspend a move to reject the budget  cuts until a meeting with ministers and other cabinet members is  held.    Legislators will meet with members of the executive branch  to  seek alternatives to save some investment projects in the  districts, a sector which suffered a drastic $46.5 million  cutback.    Chen Barria said the legislators should first establish  which  district projects are most important and then meet with  ministers and agency directors to determine if they can make  adjustments within their remaining budget to carry out some of  these district projects.</p>

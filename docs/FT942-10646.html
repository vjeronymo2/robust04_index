			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Croydon set to clinch Pounds 58m property sales Croydon council in south London is today set to complete a deal which combines privatisation of its property management services with a Pounds 58m sale of commercial property. The sale of the property to Croydon Land and Estates, a new company financed by Montagu Private Equity, will reduce the council's debt and give it some Pounds 16m for new development. Croydon said it believed it was the first council to combine the privatisation of its estates and valuation department with the sale of commercial property. 'The deal is something of a market leader and meets government directives to dispose of surplus land wherever possible and to market-test defined professional services,' said Mr Mike Brakes, director of estates and valuation. Croydon Land and Estates submitted the lowest tender for the five-year property management contract and the highest bid for the property portfolio. More than 25 companies submitted bids. Twenty council staff will move to the new company. 'The transfer means that the service will not have to face the uncertainty of compulsory competitive tendering in deterioriating market conditions,' the council said. The deal follows the government directive that property management services should be included in the programme for compulsory competitive tendering by local authorities and a temporary moratorium on restrictions governing the use of capital receipts from property sales. The portfolio, which excludes all public buildings and civic offices, consists of 240 investment properties which generate more than Pounds 4m of rental income. The properties were acquired over many years as a result of building activities.</p>

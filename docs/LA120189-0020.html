			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MIRA COSTA'S VOLLEYBALL SUCCESS IS A LONG STORY;  </P> <P> PREPS: THE MUSTANG GIRLS TEAM WILL PLAY SAN JOSE LYNBROOK FOR THE STATE  CHAMPIONSHIP SATURDAY.  </P> <P> Mira Costa High formally began its volleyball season in September, but the  quest toward the California Division I girls state championship started long  ago.  </P> <P> For middle blocker Heidi Eick it began in the seventh grade when she watched  Mira Costa win the Southern Section 5-A championship.  </P> <P> For serving specialist Jennifer Streatfield it began last year when she joined  the team as a junior after spending a year at a Chicago high school.  </P> <P> For setter Piper Hahn it began four years ago when she was a reserve on the  varsity as a freshman.  </P> <P> For Eick, Streatfield, Hahn, Coach Dae Lea Aldrich and the rest of the players,  the season, and perhaps the long struggle for the state title, ends Saturday  night when Mira Costa, 27-0, plays San Jose Lynbrook at Cal State Fullerton at  7:30.  </P> <P> Lynbrook, 36-1 including abbreviated matches in tournaments, beat Corona Del  Mar, 15-9, 7-15, 15-10, 17-19, 15-12, to reach its first state final. Mira  Costa reached the championship by beating Livermore Granada, 15-4, 15-0, 15-13,  led by Eick's 13 kills and four solo blocks. Erika Lawson had 10 digs and seven  kills.  </P> <P> Most of Mira Costa's players expected to see Corona Del Mar for a fourth time  this year, but Aldrich said Lynbrook is a welcome change.  </P> <P> "We are emotionally glad we don't have to play Corona again," Aldrich said.  "Each time they got closer."  </P> <P> Corona came close to making the state final, but Lynbrook won the tight  semifinal match in five games.  </P> <P> Lynbrook is a big, strong team. The Vikings, Central Coast Section champions,  are led by 6-foot senior outside hitter Holly Racine and 5-11 sophomore middle  hitter Michelle Wagner. Junior setter Dawn Hill paces the Lynbrook offense.  </P> <P> Lynbrook is also hungry. It won the De Anza League, usually dominated by  Northern California powers Fremont and Los Altos, for the first time and also  the Central Coast Section for the first time. Now the Vikings are looking for  their first state title.  </P> <P> "We're excited to play somebody new," Aldrich said. "But I hope it doesn't  matter who we play. If we play our brand of volleyball, which is fast-paced, we  should be OK."  </P> <P> Aldrich said Lynbrook's offense moves slower than Mira Costa's but that the  experience of her players should allow them to adjust. Slower-paced teams have  caused Mira Costa problems in the past.  </P> <P> Mira Costa seemed to have problems in the last game of the state playoffs. In  each of the Mustangs' three playoff matches, Mira Costa has beaten its  opponents by an average of 15-3 in the first two games. In the third game of  those matches, they have won by 15-10, 15-10 and 15-13.  </P> <P> But all problems the Mustangs have faced on the court have been solved. No team  has won two games from Mira Costa, and only two -- Corona Del Mar and Laguna  Beach -- have taken the Mustangs to a four-game match.  </P> <P> Lynbrook needed four games to beat St. Francis of Mountain View in the  quarterfinal before its tough match with Corona, while Mira Costa rolled to the  final.  </P> <P> If Mira Costa's biggest problems are concentrating while blowing a team out and  not having played any five-game matches, then the Mustangs would appear to be  in good shape coming into the final.  </P> <P> "If we have to go to a fourth or fifth game, we're not going to panic," Aldrich  said. "That's why I like to see a team like Granada (in the state semifinal)  get 13 points. We came back and we won, it builds confidence." Mira Costa was  behind 10-5 at one point during the third game against Granada.  </P> <P> Aldrich said when Mira Costa does not face tough competition in a match, the  team practices hard against each other. In this way, reserves such as Jennifer  Smith, Allison Dean, Cindy De Garceau and Amy Banachowski play key roles.  </P> <P> "We're all together in practice; we mix our front lines," Aldrich said. "Our  reserves do a great job, our bench has improved so much this year."  </P> <P> Mira Costa is together in practice, but as a team they stand apart from other  high school programs. Saturday marks the end of a decade that has seen Mira  Costa win two CIF state titles and six Southern Section crowns. A victory would  give the Mustangs a record third state championship and, in all probability,  the mythical national championship, determined by USA Today and Volleyball  Monthly magazine.  </P> <P> The match also marks the last high school appearance for Mira Costa's nine  seniors.  </P> <P> "I've had a wonderful four years with them," Aldrich said. "I am going to  capitalize on every moment they're here."  </P> <P> The players echo Aldrich's feelings. Setter Hahn leads the team in assists,  smiles and having a good time. "We have so much fun, I haven't thought about it  ending; it's a strange feeling," Hahn said after the match against Granada.  "Tonight Heidi (Eick) came up to me and said this was the last game in our gym.  It hasn't hit me yet."  </P> <P> Streatfield had no time for sentimentality. "I'm not worried about that," she  said. "I won't be satisfied until we win the state championship."  </P> <P> Eick reflected on both the state title and the season ending: "We've worked so  hard for this. It has been my dream to win the state championship since the  seventh grade when I saw Piper's sister Lindsey play in the CIF final. That's  what got me into volleyball. I suppose we'll be sad when it ends, but we have  to win first, then we can be sad."  </P> <P> If Mira Costa manages to beat Lynbrook, however, look for Eick and company to  be shedding tears of happiness.  </P></p>

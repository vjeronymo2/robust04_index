			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Romanian carrier may opt for privatisation TAROM, Romania's state-owned airline, has become the latest east European carrier to opt for privatisation. It has appointed a team led by Samuel Montagu, the UK merchant bank, to draw up a feasibility study. Tarom is the largest company to be considered for privatisation so far under Romania's pilot privatisation scheme, launched last year. It joins a long list of east European airlines who have sought to modernise their operations through privatisation. A consortium led by Air France recently took a 40 per cent stake in CSA, the former Czechoslovak airline. It was followed by Alitalia, which bought a 35 per cent stake in Malev, the Hungarian airline. Tarom, which recently took delivery of two Airbus A310 aircraft, said it hopes to find a foreign partner to help finance the modernisation of its fleet but indicated the state was likely to retain a significant minority stake. Tarom has secured financing for five Boeing 737-300s due to be delivered by August and hopes to buy eight more by the end of 1994. It operates a fleet of 54 aircraft, nearly two-thirds of which are Russian-made. Tarom flies to 40 international locations and expects to make a profit of Dollars 4.3m for 1992. It registered a turnover of Dollars 47m over the first nine months of the year.</p>

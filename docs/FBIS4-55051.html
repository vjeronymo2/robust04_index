			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jolanta Koral: "Government Concentrates; </F> Ministers Debate in Lansk Forest"]    [Excerpt] Labor Minister Leszek Miller presented the  directions of social policy during yesterday's meeting of the  government in Lansk.    As we have learned unofficially, the government debated,  among other topics, a reform of the labor law and collective  labor agreements. Let us recall that a corrected version of the  Labor Law Code was recently submitted to the Sejm by the  government. The code is said to not regulate too many issues:  the length of annual leaves, working conditions, and a maximum  working time, among other things. The remaining issues would be  settled through collective agreements signed between employers  and employee representatives.    A draft law on collective agreements, which is part of the  Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises, is to be debated by the  Sejm very soon, as requested by the government. That was a  demand put forward by "Solidarity" and by other trade unions  which are negotiating over the "Solidarity" strike demands  within the trilateral commission.  <H5>  Tougher Position on Disability Pensions </H5>   The government most probably also debated reforms of social  insurance. Work on the reforms has been proceeding without much  vigor. Ministerial experts met to debate the issue as late as  27 April. The prime minister has announced that the direction of  reforms will be announced in June.    Among other things, the government intends to tighten the  criteria for awarding disability pensions, it also intends to  reform maternity, sick, and family benefits, and to introduce a  so-called social pension. Persons over 75 years of age would be  entitled to this kind of pension, and they would also have to be  illegible for a retirement or other kind of pension; the pension  would also cover disabled individuals over the age of 18 who are  completely incapable of working. Principles of awarding social  rent as well as its size, are currently being negotiated within  a government-trade union team (without the participation of  "Solidarity.")    Beginning with 1995, a new system for deciding on disability  would become effective, so as to avoid awarding disability  pensions to young and healthy people. The new system would  result in a 10-percent drop in the number of pensions being  awarded.  <H5>  Waging a War on Unemployment </H5>   The Central Planning Administration [CUP] has presented  "Principles of Socioeconomic Policies for the 1994-97 Period."  Among other things, those principles provide for the  introduction of insurance against unemployment beginning in  1997. But employees would begin paying premiums as early as  next year. The ratio would be as follows: Employers would pay  two-thirds of the premium and employees -- the remaining third.    For this year, CUP also predicts an increase in the level of  salaries for budget sector employees by at least 1.5 percent,  and also a 3.5-increase in retirement and other types of  pensions.    CUP wants to extend Social Insurance Agency premiums to all  income from work, including contracts for performance of  specific items and order contracts. Currently, one does not  have to pay premiums on order contracts signed for fewer than 30  days and on contracts for performance of a specific item.    According to CUP, the government's most important goals in  the social area are, among other things, to decrease the  unemployment rate among young people aged 19-24 (estimates are  that in four years, it will increase by 412,000 people), and  also increasing the number of jobs through a program to  construct roads, telecommunication lines, and gas pipelines, as  well as the development of low-income housing. Financial means  for an active campaign against unemployment would increase by 22  percent by 1997 compared with 1993, and would amount to about  7.5 trillion zlotys.  <H5>  Valorization and Inflation </H5>   CUP is in favor of changing the principles of valorization  of  retirement and other types of pensions, with the goal of making  valorization follow price rises instead of the current system,  where it shadows increases in average salaries. This would  allow for the real value of benefits to be retained. A change  in the principles of valorization is one of the strike demands  put forward by "Solidarity." Other trade unions also support it.    Finally, during its session in the Warmie resort, the  government will deal with protection of forests and a draft law  on reprivatization and reimbursements.

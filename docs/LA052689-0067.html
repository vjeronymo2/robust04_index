			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> It's obvious Kenny Scharf spent most of his youth in front of the TV set  watching cartoons and their rapid-fire commercial messages. His paintings have  always had the same kind of absurd innocence that tries to turn real-life scary  stuff into harmless, garish amusement. This time out Scharf steps into the  wheeling-dealing realm of consumerism. It's an area of hard sell idiocy that  seems well matched by the artist's surreal sense of fun and games.  </P> <P> These paintings are their own kind of hard sell. They couple simplified  drawings of comic book characters and consumer objects with English-Spanish  translations of key phrases such as "What is the price range?" and "I would  like to buy!" There is something so blatantly obvious about a painting  emblazoned with comments about its own marketability that the work gets giddy  about being self-referential. Somehow this whimsy in primary colors, airbrush  and finger paints doesn't feel funny, however. Scharf's cosmic comics don't  defuse the malaise this time around. (Michael Kohn Gallery, 313 N. Robertson  Blvd., to June 17.) SUVAN GEER  </P></p>

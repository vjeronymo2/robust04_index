			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Yeltsin 'will press ahead with poll' THE closest advisers of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, said yesterday that he would press ahead with his own poll - to run parallel with a referendum conducted under the control of the Congress of People's Deputies. This decision, and the intention of both sides to further their own understanding of their constitutional rights, means that the Russian power struggle continues unabated. Mr Sergei Filatov, the president's chief of staff, told the daily Izvestiya that 'the decisions of the ninth Congress will not stop Mr Yeltsin from carrying out his own simple and very democratic plan - to put to a popular vote the question of trust in the president. 'At the same time the draft for a new constitution will also be put to popular confirmation,' he said. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy prime minister and Mr Yeltsin's chief tactician during the Congress session, said that there would be a 'battle of the referendums' as the Congress outcome had left Mr Yeltsin 'probably only one choice: to hold a parallel poll to the referendum'. However, Mr Yeltsin himself seemed less certain, according to reports of comments made by the deputies who met him yesterday. Many of the deputies urged him not to hold his own poll. Mr Shakhrai said that the Congress, which ended four tumultuous days on Monday, had been a 'tragi-comic act'.</p>

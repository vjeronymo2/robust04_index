			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SANTA FE RAILWAY CUTTING STAFF; 450 NON-UNION WORKERS AFFECTED  </P> <P> Santa Fe Railway announced today that it is cutting its staff by about 450  people, from non-union clerical workers to upper-level management, as part of a  plan to streamline operations.  </P> <P> "In order to survive and prosper in today's transportation environment, it is  necessary that we provide high-quality service at competitive prices. We must  reduce our ongoing expenses if we are to accomplish that," Michael R. Haverty,  company president, said in a news release.  </P> <P> Haverty said that nearly all of the reductions would be made through voluntary  severance and early retirement, "although there will be a limited number of  involuntary separations."  </P> <P> All of the positions being eliminated are non-union jobs throughout the Santa  Fe system, spokeswoman Susan Metcalf said.  </P> <P> Santa Fe Railway is a subsidiary of Santa Fe Pacific Corp. It operates about  11,500 miles of mainline freight trackage linking Chicago with California and  about 10 other states, mostly in the Southwest.  </P> <P> The railway's total employment was 19,633 at the beginning of the year.  </P> <P> Metcalf said affected employees were given the option in June of leaving the  company through a buyout or early retirement. In the following weeks, most  picked one of those options, but several chose neither and were forced to quit,  she said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: WEST COVINA;  </P> <P> WOODGATE DRIVE BARRICADE  </P> <P> Woodgate Drive will be barricaded permanently just west of Greenborough Place,  the City Council decided.  </P> <P> The street was temporarily blocked last November, after residents complained  that motorists were speeding down Woodgate to avoid the intersection of Amar  Road and Azusa Avenue. Because the temporary blockade significantly reduced  traffic, residents asked for permanent closure.  </P> <P> About 100 people, most backing the closing, came to Monday's council hearing.  "Before I was living in a freeway, now I'm living in a neighborhood," Frank  Anselmini said.  </P> <P> But two people who live nearby said closing Woodgate would cause traffic  congestion on their streets.  </P> <P> Interim City Manager Harry Thomas estimated the cost of closing the street and  forming cul-de-sacs on both sides at $29,857.  </P></p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Clinton faces his first real test: Two Democrats in the race for presidential nomination have their best chance to shine in primaries tomorrow in Georgia and Maryland AFTER holding his own in the early primaries and caucuses of New England and the midwestern prairies, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas faces the first real test of his campaign in Georgia tomorrow. While he is widely regarded as the Democrats' frontrunner for the presidential nomination, Mr Clinton is the only one of the four major candidates who has not yet won a state. Expectations have been raised so high that he must now not only win in Georgia, but win convincingly if he is to shake off worries over how much his campaign has been damaged by questions about his marriage and his position during the Vietnam war. The ruddy and smiling governor begins with the advantage of long-standing ties to Georgia's top Democratic politicians, many of whom joined him on the Democratic Leadership Council, a moderate policy group which Mr Clinton chaired until last year. He has been endorsed by Senator Sam Nunn, Georgia's senior senator, as well as by Governor Zell Miller, Lieutenant Governor Pierre Howard and most of the state legislature. Mr Doug Teper, a Democratic state representative, warns that Mr Paul Tsongas, who won the New Hampshire primary ten days ago, and the other candidates are still unknown in Georgia. 'The truth is, this is Clinton territory,' he said. Mr Teper also notes that Mr Clinton's support among black politicians should ensure him the overwhelming majority of black votes, which could make up 27 to 30 per cent of the March 3 primary turnout. After ballots in four states where blacks make up barely 1 per cent of the population, Georgia and Maryland will be the first states with significant black populations to vote in this year's presidential nominating process. Mr Andrew Young, former US ambassador to the United Nations and mayor of Atlanta, agrees that Governor Clinton should win the support of most black voters. But Mr Ed Brown, executive director of the Voter Education Project, an Atlanta-based foundation, warns that none of the candidates has made the concerted effort to register black voters that marked the campaigns of the Rev Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988. 'Much of the black leadership has made its choice, but oftentimes there's a gulf between what the leadership says and what the masses do . . . it's not a matter of whether he garners the black vote, it's a question of how much,' he warns. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, fresh from his victory in this week's South Dakota primary, has now launched his Georgia campaign with a less than heroic assault on Governor Clinton's Vietnam draft history - an issue he said two weeks ago should not be relevant in the campaign. Some political commentators have suggested that these questions may resonate more in the socially conservative and militaristic south than they have done in the north, but voters encountered at random in Georgia showed little interest either in what Mr Clinton did during the Vietnam war, or in his marriage. 'People like my parents couldn't imagine someone not trying to get out of the war,' said Miss Megan Lee, a student in the university town of Athens. 'They can drop all that on him, that man ain't dead yet,' said Mr Ben Rutland, an unemployed maintenance man in Forsyth, a rural town south-east of Atlanta. Outside Atlanta, few Georgians have any awareness of the election campaign or any knowledge of the candidates. In this vacuum, the tabloid stories that have dogged Governor Clinton's campaign may be the only message that sticks in voters' minds. 'They pop up, these people that never existed before, and all you've got on them is the dirt the other side pulls up,' said Mr Clay Owens.</p>

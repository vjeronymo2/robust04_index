			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: BT lifted by AT&amp;T move THE dramatic news from across the Atlantic of AT&amp;T's new moves in its plan to buy McCaw Cellular Communications had repercussions throughout the telecoms sector on the London market yesterday. AT&amp;T, which was to buy a part-stake in McCaw last year, decided to change its takeover timetable, delaying the purchase of the 17 per cent shareholding held by BT, but paying a healthy premium for doing so to the UK company. BT will now take its settlement in AT&amp;T shares, receiving 35.8m shares in a one-for-one exchange with McCaw stock. At the current AT&amp;T share price of Dollars 62.375, BT's holding is valued at approximately Dollars 2.2bn. Under the previous agreement, BT would have received Dollars 1.75bn in cash. 'The increase in the amount that BT has raised is to a certain extent offset by the risk that AT&amp;T shares could fall. But on balance, this looks like a modest positive for BT,' said Mr Jim Ross at Hoare Govett. He added that he expected BT to sell its stake around November next year. With the total bid for McCaw valued at Dollars 12.4bn, excitement among London telecoms analysts centred on the price this now put on other cellular groups. Vodafone, which had seen its price fall sharply at the opening yesterday, recovered quickly after the early afternoon announcement and ended the day 9 ahead at 531p. Dealers said marketmakers were also caught short by the day's events. Rumours circulating the London market in recent weeks of a big bid in the telecoms sector were also given fresh currency. However, Cable and Wireless slipped back 8 to 834p on the contrary argument that AT&amp;T's extra payment to BT made a new bid in the sector unlikely. BT, which went ex-dividend by 9.45p yesterday, closed 6 up at 429p.</p>

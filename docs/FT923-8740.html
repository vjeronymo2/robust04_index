			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / International Company News: Airline workers in a spin over merger - The proposed link between two troubled Canadian carriers It takes a lot for unionised workers in Canada to admit that they would rather see their employer fall into the arms of a US company than another Canadian one. But the crew on a Canadian Airlines international flight from Vancouver to Toronto last week had no doubt that they would have preferred the deal which their carrier had just aborted with American Airlines than the merger which it is negotiating with its arch-rival, Air Canada. 'It's just terrible,' was the comment of one stewardess. The crew on that flight are not alone in fearing that the proposed merger of Canada's two main airlines will exact a high price. For the two carriers' entire 35,000-strong workforce, thousands of lay-offs are almost certain as a single airline moves to eliminate overlap and chop operating costs. Consumer groups are worried that a single national airline - which has been nicknamed Mapleflot - will result in stiffer fares and slacker service. Even shopkeepers at the country's main airports are nervous that fewer flights through fewer terminals could mean less business for them. The proposed merger, which in practice is likely to amount to a takeover by Air Canada, shows signs of inflaming ever-smouldering regional jealousies between western Canada and Quebec. Residents of Calgary, where PWA Corp, Canadian Airlines' parent company, has its head office, fret that their city will end up having to make a much bigger sacrifice in jobs than Montreal, Air Canada's home town. With such a variety of constituencies involved, the merger of two of the country's best-known businesses is turning into a highly charged political issue for prime minister Mr Brian Mulroney's government. Mr Jean Corbeil, the transport minister, blithely insisted earlier this week that Ottawa would not interfere in the negotiations. But whatever deal is struck will need to be approved by regulatory agencies, and the government is likely to end up taking much of the credit or blame for its consequences. The government nudged PWA into Air Canada's embrace last month when it refused to provide the financial backing which the Calgary company claimed that it needed to consumate the deal with American Airlines, or to continue flying on its own. The requests ranged from lower fuel taxes, a perennial complaint of Canadian carriers, to loan guarantees. It has been obvious since the recession started that Air Canada and Canadian Airlines could not survive in their present form. Although both have valuable domestic and international routes, neither is big enough to compete against the emerging behemoths of world aviation. Their costs, especially Air Canada's, are well above those of US airlines. Between the two of them, they ran up combined losses of CDollars 618m (USDollars 523.7m) in the 15 months to March 31 1992. PWA hoped to fly out of the clouds by forging an alliance with American Airlines. The US airline would have acquired a 25 per cent equity stake and, equally important, would have shared many of its facilities and funnelled Canadian's passengers into its US routes. Air Canada strenuously objected to its rival's strategy on the grounds that it would open the door of the domestic airline industry to a powerful, and unstoppable, US carrier. The Montreal-based airline vowed to do everything possible to block the Canadian-American link, even though it was having talks with US Air of Pittsburgh. (US Air last month agreed to a far more ambitious partnership with British Airways, which includes BA taking a 44 per cent shareholding.) Having failed to cement their proposed alliances with US carriers, both Air Canada and PWA are under the gun to cut a deal with each other. Canadian is losing an estimated CDollars 800,000 a day; at Air Canada, the losses are piling up at CDollars 1.8m a day. 'There's only so long you can continue sustaining this kind of loss,' says Mr Jack Lawless, PWA's chief spokesman. Air Canada, which was privatised at CDollars 12 a share three years ago, was trading at CDollars 5 on the Toronto Stock Exchange this week. PWA's share price has sunk in less than a year from almost CDollars 7 to CDollars 2.60. Analysts are advising investors to give both companies a wide berth for the time being. One reason is that the creation of Mapleflot will almost certainly not mark the end of the restructuring of the Canadian airline industry. Public opinion is expected to force the government to hold the new monopoly in check either by re-regulating the industry or encouraging the emergence of new competitors. The latter could include allowing foreigners to take a bigger stake than the current 25 per cent limit in smaller charter or regional airlines. Airline experts are virtually unanimous that the new national carrier will prosper only by participating in either a North American or international partnership. It would be a rich irony if the new airline, born of Air Canada's and PWA's frustrated deals with US carriers, finds itself falling into the lap of one of them.</p>

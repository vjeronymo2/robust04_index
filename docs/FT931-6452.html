			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Collapse of bribery edifice traps corporate Italy: As more construction company executives are caught in the investigation net, Robert Graham examines the impact A QUICK glance down the list of businessmen involved in Italy's ever expanding corruption scandal reveals a common thread: almost without exception they are connected with the construction business. This has been underscored by the latest batch of arrests that include Mr Giampiero Pesenti, the Italian cement baron, and Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, chief financial officer of Fiat, in his capacity as president of the group's civil engineering arm, Cogefar-Impresit. At least nine of the leading 15 construction groups in Italy are involved in the inquiries relating to illicit funding of political parties. Apart from Cogefar-Impresit, the country's largest private group, these include Ferruzzi's Calcestruzzi, Mr Salvatore Ligresti's Grassetto, and the family groups Lodigiani and Belelli. Nor is it a coincidence that Mr Giovanni Prandini, a former Christian Democrat minister of public works, has been caught in the corruption investigations. Tendering for public works contracts, worth more than L30,000bn (Pounds 13.7bn) a year, lies at the heart of the magistrates' countrywide investigations. The politicians have allegedly been taking kick-backs in return for either rigged contract bids or providing favoured treatment to the bidding consortia. But as more executives and owners are caught in the magistrates' investigative net, the impact is increasingly being felt on company decision-making processes, their balance sheets, and company reputations. 'We are particularly concerned about the impact this will have on the reputation of Italian contractors abroad,' commented a spokesman for Ance, the Italian construction association. In the case of state-run entities where management has been arrested or placed under investigation, the decision-making process has been especially slowed. At Anas, the state roads authority which accounts for 10 per cent of the annual value of public works contracts, the entire board has been decapitated by a corruption investigation. Another victim of closer judicial scrutiny is the prospective L30,000bn worth of contracts in prospect for the development of a high-speed rail network which was to be the mainstay for the contractors in the mid-1990s. But the main worry of company owners is the paralysis in public administration caused by the scandals. According to one building company proprietor: 'No decisions are being taken: everyone - from the local councils, through to the regional councils and ministries - is terrified of putting their signature to a document for fear of being accused of corruption.' If it is not a case of bureaucrats being afraid, public works contracts are being delayed because of the collapse of city administrations. Currently Italy's four main cities - Milan, Naples, Rome and Turin - have no councils, thanks to the scandals. Mr Francesco Merloni, the public works minister, readily admits that he himself has blocked a large number of contracts, especially road works, because the ministry he inherited eight months ago had awarded so many contracts by private tender. Almost two-thirds of all public works contracts, including those in transport, during the 1980s were awarded by private tender or by methods which ignored established guidelines, according to a recent report by Censis, the research institute. The minister has few illusions about the extent to which the contracting business was subject to abuse. Bidding was uncompetitive; cartels among different contractors were common, and contracts were frequently awarded to shell companies. It was also difficult for the government to keep tabs on the companies. Some 15,000 had the formal qualifications to bid for contracts and 12,000 public bodies could award construction contracts. Officials estimate that the real value of contracts was inflated by at least 15 per cent to accommodate 'commissions' and extra profits. Another tactic was to halt work in mid-contract to renegotiate the price. These practices help to explain why Italy spends 4 per cent of GDP - close to the EC average  -on infrastructure yet has comparatively poor networks of modern roads, railways, urban transit systems and ports. The paralysis in bureaucratic procedures affects not only public works contracts. Ance maintains the civil service's fear of being investigated for corruption is also holding up private sector activity, which accounts for 52 per cent of the construction business. The problems arising from corruption scandals are compounded for the construction business by the state of the economy. The economy moved into recession in the second half of 1992 and some 100,000 jobs were lost. Since last July the government of Mr Giuliano Amato has cut back pubic spending to hold down the public sector deficit. In the last half of 1992, the value of public works contracts put out to tender dropped 27 per cent in real terms compared with the same period the previous year. The 1993 budget has cut out L11,200bn of expenditure, a reduction of almost 30 per cent. The drop in spending has been accompanied by a corresponding rise in unpaid contracting debts. Contractors are currently owed a staggering L11,000bn which is being covered by short-term finance at punitive rates of 20 per cent. One positive development of the scandals has been the drafting of a new law governing tenders, subjecting them to greater transparency and scrutiny. Mr Merloni also believes Italy will in future be in a better position to comply with EC regulations on tenders and bidding. This in turn should guarantee greater competitiveness, both between domestic companies and with outsiders. Increased competition, combined with the bleak economic climate, is expected to encourage more mergers and force many small operators to disappear. The problems produced by the corruption scandal are also obliging conglomerates like Fiat or Ferruzzi to question whether they need to maintain a presence in the construction business. Fiat's Cogefar-Impresit is the largest private construction group, itself the product of a series of mergers, but it is not central to the core business of the automotive sector. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, recently claimed he had pulled out of the construction business more than a decade ago because it was too wrapped up with politics at all levels.</p>

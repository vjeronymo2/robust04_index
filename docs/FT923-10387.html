			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: A theory to tackle short-termism - Investors should manage their acquisitions American institutional investors should buy bigger stakes in fewer corporations and play major roles in the management of their acquisitions. So goes the new thinking on tackling the root causes of 'short-termism'  - the American business practice often cited as a key to declining US competitiveness. The latest exponent is Mr Michael Porter, a professor at Harvard Business School, who directed a study of US investment.* Mr Porter argues that investment behaviour of pension funds, mutual funds and insurance companies - which in 1990 held 60 per cent of total US equity  -produces a destructive emphasis on quarterly and annual returns. To minimise risk and maximise profit, institutions shift funds from one company to another, looking for the quick kill. They hold stocks on average for less than two years. This behaviour pressures corporate managers to produce measurable short-term returns. When budgeting projects for investment, too many overlook 'soft asset' investments, such as employee training and R &amp; D, whose benefits accrue slowly over time but are sorely needed to ensure a company's long-term competitive position. The process is self-defeating. Mr Porter says institutional investors 'are trapped in a system that undermines the long-term earning power of the American companies on which they must ultimately depend for the bulk of their portfolio investments'. The first step towards change is to make large investors active and informed owners: with board seats and access to 'inside' information, they would hold a stake in a company's future prosperity. At the same time, corporate managers must be encouraged to plan for the long term: one suggested reform ties incentive pay to improving a company's competitive position. Only then would the goals of owners and managers be aligned. Sounds good, but many practitioners doubt that either the government or investors will swallow such a strong palliative. Fund managers cherish the ability to 'get out the door fast in a messy situation', says Mr John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds. Active involvement in corporate governance is 'difficult, complicated and expensive'. At Boston's Fidelity Investments, America's largest mutual fund house which juggles Dollars 65bn of stock, the group's Dollars 19.75bn Fidelity Magellan fund's latest portfolio turnover rate was 132 per cent, ahead of the national average which, now at 93 per cent, has risen steadily over the decade. If it started buying larger stakes in fewer companies (and then had to monitor them) the company says it would be less safe and less liquid. Labour groups are worried that asking pension funds to make riskier investments - Mr Porter thinks they should be allowed to own up to 20 per cent of a company, against 10 per cent the law currently permits - could undermine the security of the pension fund members. 'Prudent investment policy requires diversified investment,' says Mr Howard Samuel, president of the Industrial Union Department at the AFL-CIO, the US trade union co-ordinating body. *Capital Choices: Changing the Way America Invests in Industry.

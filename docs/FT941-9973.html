			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Provision warning trims Dawson Intl share price Dawson International, the Edinburgh-based textile company, yesterday warned that difficult trading conditions in the US would lead to 'a very substantial exceptional provision' this year. The shares fell to a low of 123p before recovering to close at 134p, down 7p on the day. One analyst described the announcement as 'very disappointing and extremely unsatisfactory.' Estimates for the size of the provision ranged between Pounds 10m and Pounds 40m. Dawson promised a detailed announcement 'within the next few weeks when the size of the exceptional provision has been finally quantified.' Last December the group cut its interim dividend almost in half as problems in the US reduced pre-tax profits for the six months to September 25 by 41 per cent to Pounds 9.23m. The group commissioned an independent review of its troubled US businesses - Dawson Home Fashions, which makes items such as shower curtains and bath mats, and JE Morgan Apparel, which makes mainly T-shirts and sweatshirts for what is known as the fleece and jersey market. The board is now considering the most effective way of implementing the review. Sir Ronald Miller, chairman, said yesterday that Dawson Home Fashions had suffered from increased import penetration as US retailers fought for market share. The battle between US retailers had also squeezed the fleece and jersey market, said Sir Ronald. Margins were very tight, volumes were down and there was a lot of spare capacity. Dawson, which used to supply K - mart with fleece and jersey, has already closed four US plants. The two US problem sectors make up about half of Dawson's business in the US. The other half is taken up by thermal underwear manufacture, where the group has substantial market share.</p>

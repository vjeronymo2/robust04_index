			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Diplomatic Bluebook Reflects Political </F> Confusion"]    [Text] The Diplomatic Bluebook issued annually by the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] is a report to the people on  the state of Japanese diplomacy. At the same time, it also  outlines Japan's foreign policy for those both at home and  abroad. In this respect, it is our impression that the 1993  bluebook is rare for the character of its message.    Of course, several of the bluebook's descriptions of current  affairs do take on the tone of a message, and the following is  an example.    "An economic power second only to the United States, Japan  has now come into being as a nation with considerable influence  not only in the economic realm but also regarding fundamental  problems in all fields of international society, including  political aspects and problems of a global scale."    This was probably meant to ask people to focus on the way  Japan is viewed by other nations. Of late, much use has been  made of the expression "a small but shining nation" to describe  Japan but, in the eyes of the world, Japan is not a small  country at all.    "It is necessary for Japan to pursue a positive and an  abundantly creative diplomacy to provide direction for a new  international framework and to participate in its construction,"  according to the report. This could be an indication of Japan's  diplomatic position in dealing with an international situation  that "continues to be fluid and opaque."    However, the problem is that the annual report is abstract  and does not set forth Japan's position on individual issues in  concrete terms.    A representative example is the section on Japan's seeking  permanent membership in the UN Security Council [UNSC].    It is well known that for some time the MOFA has strongly  hoped Japan would attain a permanent seat on the UNSC. However,  the bluebook remains unnaturally vague on this score, making no  direct reference to the question. It just quotes indirect  references to reform of the United Nations from a speech former  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa delivered at the UN General  Assembly last September.    When the bluebook was written, the Hosokawa administration  was still in power and, with the governing coalition parties  having different basic policies, this may have affected the way  the report was compiled.    In putting the latest bluebook together, a new procedure  unknown during the era of Liberal Democratic Party rule was  introduced. The report was submitted to teams from the ruling  parties dealing with various ministries and agencies and to  policy executive boards for discussion before being presented to  a cabinet meeting for approval. Therefore, abstractions and  indirect expressions were no doubt unavoidable in light of  conflicting views within the coalition.    That was the background then and it is hardly surprising,  therefore, that a gap became apparent between the bluebook's  tone and Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's highly enthusiastic  approach to the issue of a permanent UNSC seat after taking over  from Hosokawa.    The aforementioned factors were no doubt reasons why the  bluebook failed to concretely spell out how Japan should cope  with North Korea's suspected development of nuclear arms and  Japan-U.S. trade friction.    The bluebook said that "national consciousness has not  necessarily caught up with the international community's  increased expectations for Japan." This section can be taken to  mean that the MOFA was exasperated by the political situation at  home.    We believe that the recent political disarray, which  affected  even the bluebook's content, must be brought to an end as soon  as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Developing a Fruitful Cooperation Away From </F> Slogans"]    [Text] Amidst the blizzard of the tempestuous political  events in our region these days, an important event like the  resumption of the Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Committee meetings  seems like a peaceful island in a turbulent sea. This picture  is strengthened by the fact that the meetings are being held in  Amman away from slogans, fancy promises, and pan-Arab programs.  Instead, these meetings are discussing and studying economic,  trade, scientific, and cultural issues, including the  establishment of joint ventures between the two fraternal  countries, in an atmosphere of seriousness and close examination  out of the limelight.    In fact, this kind of bilateral Arab cooperation, which  touches various parts of the economic and trade life, is not  receiving enough attention by Arab observers. It has always  been the practice, and our life is governed by practices, to  hail only political developments, without paying any attention  to events and developments that affect Arab citizens' daily  life, despite the fact that any meaningful political changes or  developments have economic contexts that affect the lives of  Arab citizens.    Within this context, the resumption of the Joint Jordanian-  Egyptian Committee meetings following a five-year hiatus is  truly an important development in relations between the two  fraternal countries and in inter-Arab affairs. Such a  development will naturally have a political impact resulting in  further rapprochement, cooperation, and coordination between  Amman and Cairo.    Although these meetings focused their discussion and study  on  economic, trade, scientific, and cultural cooperation issues,  political issues were not absent. This was made clear yesterday  in the two lengthy speeches by Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam  al- Majali and Jordan's great guest, Egyptian Prime Minister Dr.  'Atif Sidqi. The two speeches were marked with an objective  view of the Arab nation's reality and a sincere desire to  overcome the state of fragmentation, end differences, and direct  greater attention to the ties of bilateral cooperation between  the various Arab countries.    Although it is clear that both Jordan and Egypt are facing  difficult challenges and economic and political pressures here  and there, that reality in particular provides the motive to  develop bilateral ties, taking inspiration from the mutual  interest of the leaders of the two countries, His Majesty King  Husayn and His Excellency President Muhammad Husni Mubarak, to  bolster these ties within the context of mutual respect and to  develop the existing opportunities of cooperation and to explore  further opportunities.</p>

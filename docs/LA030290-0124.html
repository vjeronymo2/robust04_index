			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ECONOMY;  </P> <P> INCOME RISES AS CONSUMER SPENDING SLOWS  </P> <P> Americans started the 1990s with a healthy 0.8% rise in personal income in  January, while growth in consumer spending slowed and a trend toward greater  savings continued, the Commerce Department said Thursday.  </P> <P> Personal income, which includes wages, salaries, interest, dividends and other  items, rose a more modest 0.5% in December and stood at a $4.60-trillion annual  rate in January.  </P> <P> Consumer spending, meanwhile, rose more slowly than income, climbing 0.6% to a  $3.60-trillion annual rate after a 1.0% rise in December, the department said.  </P> <P> Most of the spending gain was for durable goods -- "big-ticket" items such as  cars and appliances -- which soared 5.2% in January, the department said.  Spending on services declined slightly.  </P> <P> Despite January's rise in spending, which was largely the result of a one-month  surge in car sales, economists said consumers appear to be curbing their  outlays, which could slow the economy. Consumer spending accounts for about  two-thirds of gross national product, the broadest measure of domestic economic  activity.  </P> <P> "I would expect weak GNP growth in the first quarter," said economist Kathryn  Kobe at Joel Popkin &amp; Co. in Washington.  </P> <P> Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan recently told Congress that the  worst of the economic slowdown was over.  </P> <P> But the National Assn. of Purchasing Management said Thursday that the  manufacturing sector of the economy continued to contract in February, though  not as steeply as in previous months.  </P> <P> Tax payments in January were reduced because of the annual "indexing" of  federal income tax rates to inflation.  </P> <P> But income was also held down by an $8.8-billion increase in social security  tax payments, reflecting a rate increase, said Lawrence Hunter, a U.S. Chamber  of Commerce economist.  </P> <P> "It may be a kinder, gentler, no-new-taxes world in the rhetoric of  politicians, but in the real world it is proving to be nasty and harsh on the  income of American taxpayers," he said.  </P> <P> With tax payments down and income up, consumers' disposable, or after-tax,  income rose 0.9% in January to a $3.93-trillion rate after a modest 0.4% gain  in December.  </P> <P> Consumers continued saving their money at an increasing rate, the department  said. They put 5.9% of their disposable income into savings in January after  saving 5.5% in December, it said.  </P> <P> The savings rate has been climbing steadily from a 40-year low of 3.2% in 1987  to 4.2% in 1988 and 5.5% last year.  </P> <P> Many economists say the rate must return to its long-term average of about 6%  to ease upward pressure on interest rates and stimulate business investment.  </P> <P> Economists said an increasingly cautious, aging population, startled by the  1987 stock market crash and declines in real estate values, is likely to  continue to put more of its money into savings.  </P> <P> "We are seeing an increase in the savings rate -- and one would have to say  it's about time," said Popkin's Kobe. "Baby boomers are moving into an age  group which tends to save more than younger people."  </P> <P> The January increase in personal income included an $11.3-billion rise in  private wages and salaries, all of which was in service and retail industries.  Manufacturing payrolls declined in January, while government payrolls  increased.  </P> <P> PERSONAL INCOME  </P> <P> Trillions of dollars seasonally adjusted  </P> <P> Jan., '90: 4.60  </P> <P> Dec., '89: 4.57  </P> <P> Jan., '89: 4.27  </P> <P> Source: Commerce Department  </P> <P> PERSONAL SPENDING, Los Angeles Times  </P> <P> Trillions of dollars seasonally adjusted  </P> <P> Jan., '90: 3.60  </P> <P> Dec., '89: 3.58  </P> <P> Jan., '89: 3.37  </P> <P> Source: Commerce Department  </P></p>

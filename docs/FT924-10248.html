			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Man In The News: Master of ceremonies - Helmut Kohl It was a good week for Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The great survivor of German politics, the great prevaricator, master of double-speak, and yet at the end of the day the one-and-only coalition leader, consensus-builder and unification chancellor, was in his element. He came to the annual conference of his ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Dusseldorf looking bruised and embattled. Only a month before, the German press was writing him off, openly speculating about the imminence of a palace putsch and a grand coalition government with the opposition Social Democrats (SPD). His popularity was on the floor, languishing behind the ratings of his greatest rivals such as Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of the SPD and Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister. Mr Kohl was accused of indecision and weak leadership, there was open grumbling in the party ranks, and deep divisions between the party barons from east and west Germany. Not to mention the gathering gloom on all sides of the German economy, as the hoped-for autumn revival slid towards a winter depression. The celebrations of his 10 years as German chancellor, on October 1, had a decidedly half-hearted air, even if he did promise to decorate his office with a montage of all the newspaper headlines predicting his imminent demise. Then he pulled a strange rabbit out of his conference hat, and it was enough to secure him re-election as party leader with acclamation, to see his proposals swept through, and his critics silenced. It all added up to a brilliant piece of party stage-management. It is not at all clear that the rabbit he produced will add up to any serious strategy to deal with the overwhelming problem in hand: how to pay for the soaring bill of German unification. Mr Kohl's proposal is to threaten in advance a tax rise in 1995 - conveniently after 1994, when the country faces no fewer than nine important elections - to bridge the spending gap. Yet that could well add up to the worst of all solutions. The threat of a future tax rise may be enough to damage business and consumer confidence, and at the same time to undermine the will to save on the part of the 16 federal states, and all the local authorities, which need to trim their budgets. The proposal was certainly not well received either by German industry, or by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the CDU's Bavaria-based sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). Moreover, the chancellor's tax plan does not look likely to satisfy the other side of the political spectrum - the SPD and the trade unions - which Mr Kohl wishes to woo into a 'solidarity pact' of wage and budget restraint to ease the pain of the coming years. In the smoke-filled corridors of German political power-broking, however, it was a brilliant move to buy the Chancellor time - and a comforting conference. For the tax proposal bought off the pressure of his eastern members, who have been demanding instant action to pump in more cash to their bankrupt councils and companies. And it reassured the western members, who are desperate that their electors should not feel more tax pain from unification in the immediate future. Mr Kohl is in his element at party conferences, recognising and fraternising with all the lowly ward chairmen and women from the grass roots, the old friends he has cultivated and stood by over the years. His easy bonhomie, elephantine memory for a face, and slightly mumbling man-of-the-people touch, together with a prodigious capacity to sink food and wine and reminiscences into the early hours, are what has reinforced his position as party leader since 1973. This time, however, he knew it was not the moment for a celebration. Mr Kohl has been seeking to extricate himself for some time from his initial excessive optimism that unification might be accomplished without real pain. 'Some conferences are the right place for a speech of jubilation,' he said afterwards. 'This was not one of them.' The trouble was that it was vintage Kohl. No sooner had he given an apparently clear indication of the way forward, than he proceeded to muddy the waters, and leave everyone confused again. He talked not of 'tax increases,' but of 'income improvements' - obviously referring to the income of the state, not of the benighted taxpayer. In the press bar, later, he insisted that 'a tax rise would be pure poison for the economy'. Two days later, he delivered an off-the-cuff closing speech of quite bewildering ambiguity. No tax rises for two years. That was clear. And the savings were going to be tough. 'When I say save, I mean save,' he declared. And then immediately followed it with a gaping caveat: 'We must admit that we do not always act in the same way as we speak.' He then proceeded to launch into a defence of state subsidies - be it for shipbuilding or the coal-mining industry - as an integral part of the German concept of a 'social' market economy, as opposed to Lady Thatcher's idea of a pure market economy. 'I rejected that (Thatcherite) approach, and I think what has happened since has proved me right,' he said. Subsidy cuts must be seen 'in the total context', whatever that may mean. He is already manoeuvering for his next great challenge: to negotiate the solidarity pact, and keep on board not only his conservative coalition partners, but also bring in the trade unions and the SPD. Yet Mr Kohl must never be underestimated, as Mr Volker Ruhe, his former secretary-general and now ambitious defence minister, can tell. Mr Ruhe came bottom of the poll in the vote for four deputy leaders at the congress, an ignominy he would never have suffered if the chancellor had cared to put in a good word for him. But in recent weeks Mr Ruhe has not disguised his desire to be the crown prince. He has been making nice noises to the SPD. He has talked out of turn on the unfair distribution of the burden of unification. Mr Kohl may be unclear in his speech-making. But he is quite ruthless in his treatment of precocious pretenders.</p>

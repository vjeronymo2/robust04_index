			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE FALLS on the Hong Kong market, along with worries over events in Russia, appeared to provide an opportunity for continued profit-taking in the derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo. On the last day of the equity account, trading in the March futures contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,940, some 10 points below its close on Thursday. But for a small mid-morning rally which saw the contract touch the day's high of 2,945, continuous selling drove the contract lower for the rest of the day. The poor opening on Wall Street only served to increase the falls in March but traders said 2,900 had proved a successful resistance level. March finished at 2,917, down 33 on its previous close and around 2 ahead of its fair value premium to cash of minus 2. Turnover was a healthy 11,062 lots. The traded options saw total volume of 34,175 contracts, of which 15,791 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option. Forte was the busiest stock option with a total of 3,116 contracts, followed by GEC at 2,543 lots.</p>

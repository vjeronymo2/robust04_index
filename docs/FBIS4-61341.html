			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F> ITAR-TASS correspondent Georgiy Shelenkov]    [Text] Cairo, 4 May -- The Russian-U.S. cosponsorship of  the search for a Middle East settlement has passed a stern test.  The heads of the two countries' diplomatic departments spent  two days in the Egyptian capital making strenuous mediating  efforts to bring to a successful finale the talks between the  Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel, which were crowned  today by the conclusion of an historic "peace protocol." Even  during the actual signing ceremony, the intermediaries had to  come urgently to the assistance of the sides.    Several details of the dramatic episode, which almost  obliterated the many months of the "peace marathon," have become  known to ITAR-TASS correspondents from informed sources. As he  appended his signature to the agreement, Yasir 'Arafat demanded  from the United States and Russia additional security guarantees  for the territories now being freed. During an enforced break  in the signing procedure, the cosponsors gave him the relevant  assurances, which insured the Palestinian leader's agreement to  sign the document. Experts from the two great powers started  consultations on the matter today, and the guarantees are  expected to be countersigned tomorrow by the Russian and U.S.  heads of diplomacy.</p>

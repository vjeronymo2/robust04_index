Yermakov had been removed from  the office of representative of the Ukrainian president in  Sevastopol. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told at the  headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet that the decision coincides  with the opinion of Yermakov himself, who previously occupied  the office of head of an aircraft repair plant and has the rank  of colonel in the Navy. Moreover, he never took the Ukrainian  oath and did not express any desire to serve in the Ukrainian  Armed Forces.    The commander of the Black Sea Fleet has ordered the head of  the fleet's personnel department to establish Yermakov in the  post within two months in keeping with his wishes.</p>

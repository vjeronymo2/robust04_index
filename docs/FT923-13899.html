			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / The Brady initiative embraces Braslia but doubts remain: Collor's political weakness presents a problem BRAZIL, the developing world's largest debtor, is the last big Latin American country to have agreed a debt restructuring and reduction accord under the initiative launched by Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury secretary, in 1989. The accord is the most complex yet negotiated under thisinitiative. Banks have the choice among six options, three of which carry collateral assuring payment of interest or principal in case of a Brazilian default. Another layer of complexity is added by a likely lack of collateral - the Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 1.67bn) promised may not be enough to go round. This problem will be surmounted by the issue of 'phase-in' bonds, to be exchanged as and when collateral becomes available. While this makes valuing the various options hideously difficult for banks, the biggest potential pitfalls lie elsewhere. The Brazilian government is intending to secure senate approval of a detailed accord in August. Despite the insistence by the government that approval will be forthcoming, that cannot be taken for granted, given the political weakness of President Fernando Collor. Despite the government's protests to the contrary, the opposition will be able to characterise the accord as of, at best, moderate benefit for Brazil. Because the government is now paying only 30 per cent of scheduled interest, its actual interest payments may well rise after the deal is closed. Furthermore, once restructured, the debt will be very difficult to restructure again, because most of it will have been converted into marketable bonds. Moreover, unless the government's economic programme is firmly on track, the deal could be severely jeopardised before it is even closed. Brazil looks as though it is going to miss its second consecutive set of quarterly targets under its International Monetary Fund economic programme. If the programme is jeopardised, then IMF funds which are needed to provide part of the collateral will also be unavailable. The World Bank - another source of funds for collateral - has made plain, meanwhile, that it is not keen on lending in support of Brazil, given its current economic uncertainty. In providing collateral, Brazil has promised to match the amounts of funds made available by the international institutions and in new money from the banks. If the other funds were not forthcoming, Brazil could choose to top up collateral from its own volatile reserves. But, if the government were not in a valid programme with the IMF, then many banks might decide to reject the agreement. The uncertainty over whether the accord will be closed means that what bankers call 'completion risk' is high. So, while providing a welcome political fillip for Mr Collor, the 'Mexico effect' will be modest, if discernible. When Mexico signed an agreement in principle with banks three years ago, funds flooded into the country and confidence soared. The immediate benefit was lower domestic interest rates - which helped economic recovery and reduced the burden of servicing Mexico's domestic government debt. Brazil has a long way to go before it achieves the depth of economic reform achieved by Mexico three years ago, and the completion risk was significantly lower. The reason banks would entertain this high-risk prospect is because some, particularly in the US, are keen to write back the provisions they have made on their Brazil debt. Some believe that the team of Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, economy minister, is worthy of support, despite the weakness of the government that backs him. Without him, the whole deal might have to be renegotiated at another time. There is also some political pressure from the Bush administration to get the agreement out of the way so that, 10 years more or less from the advent of the debt crisis, the issue may be said to have been resolved. The administration would like to claim that the Brady initiative has resolved the issue.</p>

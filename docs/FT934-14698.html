			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): The shape of sounds to come In the 1930s, an EMI engineer registered the first patent describing stereo sound, writes Andrew Fisher. Sixty years later, Thorn EMI has developed what it claims to be 'the most significant recording development since stereo'. Called Sensaura, it uses digital signal processing and computers to create a sound field which extends beyond the speakers, allowing the listener to hear a more accurate aural version of the original performance. No new equipment will be needed to hear CD or other recordings using Sensaura. The technology, based on the way the human ear registers sound waves to recognise their direction, uses an artificial head to make the recordings. Sensaura was developed by the group's Central Research Laboratories and has been used in demonstration recordings, mainly classical. CRL: UK, 081 848 9779.</p>

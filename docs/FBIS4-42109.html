			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Heidi Avellan: "JAS Still Flying Despite </F> Crashes"]    [Text] Linkoping, Sweden -- Finland chose the Hornet. The  Plowshare Movement slipped into the factory [and damaged planes  with hammers]. The only customer's only plane crashed last  summer with a roar -- only inches from a crowd of people in the  middle of Stockholm and a hairbreadth from causing a giant  disaster. The new Swedish multirole combat [JAS] aircraft was  the subject of big and unfavorable headlines. But at Saab in  Linkoping, the JAS project is continuing.    Automobiles and airplanes -- that is what Saab has become  known for.    The group is represented in the air by both civilian and  military aircraft. Saab Aircraft is the world market leader when  it comes to regional aircraft. In the case of aircraft carrying  from 20 to 39 passengers, the Saab-340 has a worldwide market  share of 37 percent. But civilian aviation has had a few rough  years; people have been traveling less since the start of the  1990's. This also means that the demand for new aircraft has  diminished, and there is sizable overcapacity in the aviation  industry today. Last year's big market share involved no more  than 28 aircraft, compared to the 49 delivered 10 years earlier.  It is primarily the problems on the civilian side of the market  that have dragged profits down. Profits last year totaled 245  million kronor.  <H5>  From Rotary Cultivator to JAS </H5>   Although civilian aviation is experiencing problems, Saab's  management has great faith in military aviation.    Putting it simply, the Swedish military aviation industry's  roots go back to a handshake between the builder of the Swedish  welfare state, Per Albin Hansson, and the Wallenberg industrial  family: the Swedish Air Force would buy Swedish planes, and that  laid the foundation for a Swedish military aviation industry.  First came the Tunnan in 1951, followed by the Lansen in 1955,  the Draken in 1960, and the Viggen in 1973. And, 20 years later,  the Gripen.    A test plane was transformed into a rotary cultivator during  an air show in Linkoping. The first plane to be delivered to the  only customer to date -- the Swedish Armed Forces --  crash-landed in front of thousands of spectators and hundreds of  video cameras during last summer's Water Festival. Then there  was almost a giant disaster in the middle of Stockholm when the  next aircraft crashed, as if by a miracle, in what was  practically the only uninhabited piece of ground in the entire  inner city.    But despite those attention-getting nose dives, despite the  fact that no export opportunities have yet appeared, and even  though the international Plowshare Movement was able to  "sabotage" one aircraft, Sweden believes in the JAS 39 Gripen.  <H5>  Saab Defense </H5>   The military is now operating in an entirely new  environment,  defense and security policy is being revised, military budgets  are being cut, and the Armed Forces are changing. In those  circumstances, the Saab group wants to be in the lead pack, so  at the start of this year, the group's various military  divisions -- aircraft, missiles, electronics, and optronics --  were combined into a single unit called Saab Defense. With that  "Defense" unit, Saab wants to create a distinctive image for  itself in the military area.    "Now that the Armed Forces are being reduced, it is  necessary  to focus even more strongly on quality -- to be technically  sharper," explains Kai Hammerich, the group's vice president.  "And we have a number of interesting products."    The big product is the JAS 39 Gripen: the company has 19  billion kronor worth of orders on its books, and the Gripen  currently accounts for 16 billion kronor of that. The only  customer is the Swedish Armed Forces, and they will receive  their second plane within the next few days. It was the Armed  Forces' first plane that crashed in Stockholm in August. Since  then, a Riksdag committee has examined the Gripen program and  expressed full confidence that the program is being handled  correctly and that the goals will be achieved.  <H5>  For 16 Squadrons </H5>   Also satisfied despite the crash is Claes G. Wretfors, chief  flight engineer of the Defense Materiel Administration, which  handles purchases for the Armed Forces. He says the plane that  is now ready for delivery is more advanced than the one that  crashed, has more functions, and is being inspected extra  carefully in a "type inspection." Five more aircraft are to all  intents and purposes ready for delivery after that, and the  Armed Forces will have received a total of 10 planes by the end  of the year.    In all, the current order calls for 140 aircraft, or enough  for eight squadrons. Two operational squadrons will have  received their aircraft by the end of 1997.    The armament, meaning the weapons carried by the aircraft,  is  ready, generally speaking. The thing that is still lacking is an  active radar-guided missile, a weapon described in U.S. Air  Force parlance as "beyond visual range."    More orders are on the way, and all 16 squadrons will  eventually be flying Gripens.    The JAS 39 Gripen has been called a cheap aircraft.  Obviously, a unit price is hard to calculate, but Wretfors  estimates a figure of from 150 million to 160 million kronor for  the Swedish version and about 200 million kronor for one  equipped for export. He claims that at today's prices, the  Viggen would be more expensive. Above all, the JAS is relatively  cheap to operate: The operating cost per hour is said to be  20,000 kronor, compared to 38,000 kronor for the Viggen and  100,000 kronor for the MiG.  <H5>  We Will Sweep Clean </H5>   In the Armed Forces, people were not entirely pleased at  first when the politicians decided, before the JAS program  began, that it would involve a light concept with small and  inexpensive aircraft. Brigadier General Rolf Clementson admits  it. In other parts of the world, the emphasis was on bigger  planes.    But the military gradually came to realize that the  politicians had not been wrong in their vision. It is a fact  that aircraft are priced by the kilogram, and a small plane is  cheaper than a large one, he says. Moreover, there is no need to  invest in advanced technology to conceal the plane from the  enemy -- small planes are harder to see. From a tactical  standpoint, it is right to have a lot of small planes working  together, Clementson explained, and he showed diagrams of how  air fights are expected to go:    "We'll sweep the firmament clean."    As we all know, Finland has chosen another fighter plane,  but  no one at Saab is admitting disappointment over that today.    "It is true that an order would have been welcome," Kai  Hammerich says.    But the takeoff run for new combat aircraft is a long one,  and the JAS was not ready at the time.    "We wanted to join in and compete for the order even though  we knew that we were really too early, considering Finland's  time constraints."</p>

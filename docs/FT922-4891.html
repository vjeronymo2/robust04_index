			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chile's golden goose close to starvation - Lesley Crawford on a history of under-investment in the state-owned copper industry IT IS beginning to dawn on Chileans that Codelco, the state-owned copper corporation, is not the source of inexhaustible wealth they once believed. The world's leading copper producer and Chile's biggest company, Codelco has been milked dry over its 16-year existence. It has provided more than Dollars 17bn to the state's coffers - about 20 per cent of the government's yearly income - since its creation in 1976. But the government has reinvested only 0.2 per cent of Codelco's profits back into the company. The corporation is now showing all the symptoms of this prolonged starvation. Profits in the first three months of 1992 plummeted by 36 per cent to Dollars 175m. Falling copper prices are partly to blame, but rising production costs at its ageing mines are also gnawing away at the company's profitability. Last year, Codelco mustered only Dollars 870m for the Treasury, compared with Dollars 1.5bn in 1990 and almost Dollars 2bn in 1989. 'The lesson of all this is that Codelco's bounty is not eternal,' says Mr Jorge Bande, the company's planning director. 'We either regain our competitiveness or we die.' Codelco has now prised a bigger investment budget from the claws of the Treasury. Over the next five years it plans to spend Dollars 2.8bn to develop new mines, modernise its production processes and clean up the environmental mess caused by its old-fashioned smelters. But money is only part of the solution. Hidden from public view, a far more fundamental struggle is taking place over how Codelco should be run. The struggle pits the company's young management team, which took over the reins two of political appointees. The seven-man board of directors includes the ministers of mining and finance, a general of the paramilitary police force, two other members chosen by President Patricio Aylwin, and two trade union representatives. It is significant that Mr Alejandro Noemi, Codelco's chief executive, only feels free to air his views when he is out of the country. He told a meeting of the Council of the Americas in New York last month: 'We must promote efficient management minimising political interference and adopting a long-term view of resource allocation and strategic planning.' Mr Noemi, who came close to resigning last year after repeated clashes with Mr Juan Hamilton, the mining minister, pleaded for a board of directors 'free of party ties, not linked to any single government and guided by the permanent interests of the country.' He said Codelco needed to forge a new relationship with its owners. 'This relationship should be based on a truly independent administration.' Mr Noemi wants to be allowed to run Codelco as a business that competes on an equal footing with other mining multinationals. It is unlikely that he will ever be allowed to do so. Codelco is too important to the Chilean economy: it produces 13 per cent of the world's copper, close to a third of Chile's exports, a fifth of the government's income and about 4.5 per cent of the country's GDP. A tenth of its gross sales, which totalled Dollars 2.77bn last year, goes directly to the armed forces. In spite of the country's recent transition to democracy few Chileans feel bold enough to question why the military should be the beneficiary of such largesse. Codelco executives concede that full autonomy is too explosive a political issue to be raised in the final two years of the Aylwin government. But they hope that a recent law, allowing Codelco to form joint ventures to explore and develop new mines, is a step in the right direction. The new law was muddied at the last moment by a presidential clause urging Codelco to 'aim for majority control' in its new partnerships with the private sector. This did not go down well with the mining multinationals established in Chile. 'The last-minute clause is a warning of the political meddling to expect in doing business with Codelco,' one Santiago-based executive said. Most companies said they liked to have majority control over their investments. Codelco's executives see the law as a key factor in the company's long-term development strategy. It will allow the state company to seek partners when it does not have resources to develop mining projects on its own. Codelco owns a third of the registered mining property in Chile, but investment restrictions have limited exploration and development work. Potential partners want to see proof, however, of a more modern management ethic at Codelco before talking business. The test case will come with the development of the Radomiro Tomic copper deposit, close to Codelco's Chuquicamata division in the Atacama desert. The Tomic mine is the first project Codelco begins from scratch and the company is keen to prove that it can run a new mine as efficiently as its rivals in the private sector. Mr Bande says Tomic will be free of the rigidities that plague Codelco's four existing divisions: the top-heavy administration, widespread absenteeism and old mines with escalating production costs and dwindling reserves. Codelco has set up a separate division to study the feasibility of the Dollars 450m-venture. It is headed by Mr Holger Bannach, Chuquicamata's former general manager. Tomic will be a medium-sized operation with an annual production of some 150,000 tonnes of refined copper. A firm decision on the project is expected to be taken at the end of this year, with 1995 as a possible start-up date.</p>

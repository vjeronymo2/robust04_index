			<p>BFN     [Text] A powerful explosion earlier this evening cut off  Schweizer-Reneke in North-West Province from the outside world.  Three electricity substations were set on fire, and according to  Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission], sabotage cannot be ruled  out. No one was injured in the explosion, and police will  continue their investigations at daybreak. One of the fires was  at Eskom's main substation and the assistance of nearby  fire-stations was called in. Eskom officials are at the scene,  and equipment has been ordered from Bloemfontein to restore the  power supply. The police have cordoned off the area. Local  telephone exchanges have also been damaged, and power is not  expected to be restored to Schweizer-Reneke until tomorrow  afternoon.</p>

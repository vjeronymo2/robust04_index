			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Water companies warn of high clean-up costs WATER COMPANIES called yesterday for more flexible standards on drinking water and warned that complete elimination of lead from water could cost Pounds 8bn. European countries should have the right to set their own standards on the colour and taste of drinking water where there were no health implications, said Ms Janet Langdon, director of the Water Services Association, which represents the 10 large water and sewerage companies of England and Wales. The WSA said it accepted the World Health Organisation's tighter guidelines on lead, which is thought to pose health risks, but warned that much of the Pounds 8bn cost for removing lead from water would fall on householders. It also called yesterday for a UK policy on pesticides to reduce the level of chemicals that run off fields into the water supply and require expensive removal. The UK move is part of an attempt by Eureau, a lobby group representing national water companies from all EC countries except Greece, to persuade the European Commission to change its water directives. Officials from the Commission's environment directorate, speaking yesterday at the opening of Eureau's conference in Madrid, said they wanted to hold a seminar by the autumn on the need to review the standards. The drinking water standards, set in 1980, are among the most ambitious environmental measures passed by EC members and have become increasingly controversial as the true cost of compliance has become clear. UK companies have suggested that nearly half of the Pounds 45bn they are likely to invest this decade will be as a result of EC directives. Ofwat, the regulator of the UK companies, has repeatedly questioned whether some of the standards are unnecessary and too stringent. The European water companies want limits on the levels of iron, magnesium, manganese, copper and zinc, which they argue have no impact on health, to be interpreted more flexibly by the Commission.</p>

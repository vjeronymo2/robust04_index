(``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  a proposed rule change to amend its fine schedule relating to the dissemination of quotations in local issues and to amend its Minor Rule Plan (``MRP''). <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 19d&hyph;1(c)(2) under the Act, 17 CFR 240.19d&hyph;1(c)(2), authorizes national securities exchanges to adopt minor rule violation plans for the summary discipline and abbreviated reporting of minor rule violations by exchange members and member organizations. The Exchange's MRP initially was approved by the Commission in 1985. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22654 (November 21, 1985), 50 FR 48853 (November 27, 1985). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34320 (July 6, 1994), 59 FR 35545 (July 12, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to Equity Floor Procedure Advice (``EFPA'') 2&hyph;B, specialists are required to disseminate a quote prior to one-half hour after the PSE opening. If a specialist fails to satisfy this requirement, he currently is subject to a fine of $25 for each violation beginning with the sixth violation. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  The rule change will raise the fine for each violation to $100 beginning with the third violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The number of violations is calculated on a rotating quarterly basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the rule change will add violations of EFPA 2&hyph;B to Exchange Rule 10.13 and the Exchange's MRP. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  PSE Rule 10.13(a) authorizes certain PSE Committees to impose a fine not to exceed $5,000 on any member, member organization, or person association with a member or member organization for any violation of an Exchange rule that has been deemed to be minor in nature and approved by the Commission for inclusion in the MRP. Rule 10.13 includes a list of rule violations that are eligible for the expedited disciplinary procedure under the MRP and that may be the subject of fines, in accordance with the Recommended Fine Schedule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This change was included in Exhibit A to the rule filing. See also letter from Kenneth J. Marcus, Director of Equity Surveillance/Compliance, PSE, to Katherine Simmons, SEC, dated September 29, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b). <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public, and with the Section 6(b)(6) requirement that the rules of an exchange provide that its members are appropriately disciplined for violations of the exchange's rules and the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, the Commission believes that an exchange's ability to effectively enforce compliance by its members and member organization with Commission and Exchange rules is central to its self-regulatory functions. The inclusion of a rule in an exchange's minor rule violation plan, therefore, should not be interpreted to mean that it is not an important rule. On the contrary, the Commission recognizes that the inclusion of minor violations of particular rules under a minor rule violation plan may make the exchange's disciplinary system more efficient in prosecuting more egregious and/or repeated violations of these rules, thereby furthering its mandates to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that adding EFPA 2&hyph;B to PSE Rule 10.13 and the Exchange's MRP is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 6(b)(6) in that the purpose of Rule 10.13 is to provide for a response to a rule violation when a meaningful sanction is needed, but when initiation of a disciplinary proceeding under PSE Rule 10.3 <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  is not suitable because such a proceeding would be more costly and time-consuming than would be warranted given the minor nature of the violation. Rule 10.13 provides for an appropriate response to minor violations of certain Exchange rules, while preserving the due process rights of the party accused through specified, required procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> PSE Rule 10.3 governs the initiation of disciplinary proceedings by the Exchange for violations within the disciplinary jurisdiction of the Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Furthermore, the Commission finds that violations of EFPA 2&hyph;B are objective and technical in nature, and are easily verifiable, thereby lending themselves to the use of expedited proceedings. Noncompliance with the requirement to disseminate quotations in local issue prior to one-half hour after the opening time for trading on the PSE may be determined objectively and adjudicated quickly without the complicated factual and interpretive inquiries associated with more sophisticated Exchange disciplinary proceedings. If the Exchange determines that a violation of one of these rules is not minor in nature, the Exchange retains the discretion to initiate full disciplinary proceedings in accordance with PSE Rule 10.3. The Commission expects the PSE to bring full disciplinary proceedings in appropriate cases ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , in cases where the violation is egregious or where there is a history or pattern of repeat violations). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Commission finds that the increase in the fine from $25 per violation starting with the sixth violation, to $100 per violation starting with the third violation should result in appropriate discipline of members, in a manner that is proportionate to the nature of such violations. The Commission believes that calculating the fines on a rotating quarterly basis is an equitable approach that accounts for the possibility that a substantial period of time may elapse between violations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> It Is Therefore Ordered,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> pursuant to Section 19(b)()2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  of the Act, <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;94&hyph;13) is approved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

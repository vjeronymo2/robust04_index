			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> SMALL GROUP SITS AS JURY ON WOULD-BE JUDGES;  </P> <P> APPOINTMENTS: A LITTLE-KNOWN INFORMAL PANEL HAS QUIETLY HELPED THE GOVERNOR  PICK 11 OF THE 27 JURISTS IN THE COUNTY COURTS.  </P> <P> For the past eight years, a small group of influential Ventura County  Republicans has played a pivotal role in the selection of every new judge in  the Superior and Municipal courts.  </P> <P> Working out of the public eye, this little-known group of judicial advisers has  helped pick almost half the judges now serving in the Ventura County courts --  its recommendations almost always accepted by Gov. George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> The most influential of the advisers -- according to several sources -- is  Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, who has helped secure judicial appointments  for nine assistant prosecutors out of the 11 judgeships that have opened up  since Deukmejian's election in 1982.  </P> <P> In addition to Bradbury's input, three of the county's top Republican Party  stalwarts serve as an informal judicial screening panel for Deukmejian.  </P> <P> They are Paul Leavens of Ventura, former county campaign chairman for  Deukmejian; Gwen Tillemans of Oxnard, county Republican chairwoman; and  Katherine H. Haley of Ojai, a major Republican fund-raiser.  </P> <P> The four have helped give a conservative and prosecution-oriented shape to the  county's bench for years to come, but whether they will enjoy a similar  advisory role in the administration of Republican Gov.-elect Pete Wilson  remains to be seen.  </P> <P> Leavens, Tillemans and Haley say that, in the informal structure of the county  panel's makeup, they see themselves as a separate panel of political advisers  to the governor that usually checks with Bradbury before making judicial  recommendations to Deukmejian.  </P> <P> Leavens is among those who candidly admit that Bradbury is probably the most  influential of Deukmejian's local advisers, an opinion shared by many in the  legal community.  </P> <P> "The district attorney in Ventura County, as I recall, is a very influential  person," said Charles Vogel, president of the California Bar Assn. "I think  that he's not shy about expressing his views and I think that he will endeavor  to influence the composition of the court, since it's important to him."  </P> <P> "It is not sufficient for Kay Haley to say, 'Gee, I'd like you to make Chuck  Campbell a judge now,' " said Wendy Lascher, president of the Ventura County  Bar Assn., referring to Municipal Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr.  </P> <P> "That's how the governor gets the ideas for choosing who to nominate, and if it  comes down to one or the other it makes a difference," Lascher added. "I  suspect Mike Bradbury has had more influence than the rest of those people put  together."  </P> <P> And Leavens conceded:  </P> <P> "I would never send a recommendation to the governor without checking with  Mike. He's probably the most influential one of all. He's in and out of the  courts. He knows who they are."  </P> <P> Bradbury downplays his role in picking the county's judges, insisting that the  governor's office consults the local district attorney on judicial openings in  every county in California.  </P> <P> That statement is supported by Terry Flanigan, the governor's appointment  secretary, but disputed by a spokeswoman for Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner in Los  Angeles, a Democrat, who said Deukmejian never consults Reiner or any other  Democratic head prosecutors around the state.  </P> <P> "I'm treated no differently than any other district attorney in the state . . .  the governor's office seeks our input and we provide it if we have the  pertinent information," Bradbury said. "The governor is clearly his own person  when it comes to judge appointments and he does not simply rubber-stamp the  recommendations of others."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Bradbury said that all 11 judges appointed by Deukmejian in the  last eight years were recommended by him during the initial review process,  including the nine former prosecutors from Bradbury's office.  </P> <P> All the judges are white, nine of the 11 are Republicans and all but one are  men.  </P> <P> Deukmejian appointed five out of the 15 sitting Superior Court judges,  including Robert C. Bradley in 1984 and Barbara A. Lane, Kenneth R. Yegan,  Frederick A. Jones and Edwin M. Osborne in 1986. All were elevated from  Municipal Court positions. Osborne, a Democrat, is now presiding Superior Court  judge.  </P> <P> Deukmejian also installed half of the 12 Ventura County Municipal Court judges,  including Democrat Herbert Curtis III in 1984, John R. Smiley in 1986, Barry B.  Klopfer in 1987, Charles W. Campbell Jr. and Ken W. Riley in 1988 and Thomas J.  Hutchins in 1989.  </P> <P> Lane and Smiley, the only non-prosecutors, were appointed from private  practice.  </P> <P> Bradbury's influence in the judicial selection process, especially the  elevation of Municipal Court judges to the Superior Court, brought an  expression of concern from one expert on legal ethics, Dean Gerald F. Uelmen of  the Santa Clara University School of Law.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a conflict that should preclude him from  serving on the committee, but I think it's a legitimate concern," Uelmen said.  "The danger would be that a judge would be more reluctant to rule against the  D.A. on an issue that comes before him, for fear that it would jeopardize his  prospects for advancement."  </P> <P> Bradbury retorted:  </P> <P> "Gerry's comment is the typical BS that he throws out on this and every other  issue where he takes a very pro-defense point of view. I've never had any judge  try and curry favor with me for any reason."  </P> <P> Bradbury said he has "a fairly combative relationship" with Ventura County's  judges who dislike the fact that his policy against plea bargaining forces 12%  to 15% of cases to trial, compared with 5% to 7% in most other counties.  </P> <P> Bradbury vehemently insisted he is "not on any committee" and added that "my  views do not carry the kind of weight people attribute to me." He said that  Deukmejian's office also consults with Sheriff John V. Gillespie on some  appointments. Gillespie was out of town and unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Each of Deukmejian's judicial appointees in Ventura County began the selection  process by calling or being recommended by someone on the informal three-member  review panel, Leavens said.  </P> <P> Panel members never meet to discuss their work, but they often call each other  and Bradbury to confer on nominees, said Leavens, whose Ventura-based Leavens  Ranches company owns more than 1,000 acres of citrus and avocado orchards in  Ventura and Monterey counties.  </P> <P> Each sends a letter of recommendation to Deukmejian's office only "after  conversing with people that know these people and learning who is  well-respected, who has a good reputation and who would not embarrass the  governor," Leavens said.  </P> <P> Haley, a third-generation Ventura County resident described by some as "Mrs.  Republican" in Ventura County, said she agrees with Leavens' description of  their work.  </P> <P> "The gist of it is that when there were people who had contacted us that were  interested in serving as a judge . . . we investigated whether they were  qualified people who could do the job. We'd write a letter and send it to the  governor," Haley said. "He wouldn't always take our suggestion."  </P> <P> Bradbury said that party loyalties play no role in his recommendations to  Deukmejian. As for the fact that nearly all of Ventura County's judges are  Republican, he said:  </P> <P> "I have a hunch it's because people that go into law enforcement organizations,  for example, prosecutors, tend to be Republican. But we've got our share of  Democrats in the office."  </P> <P> Although the three review panel members do not automatically reject Democrats,  Leavens and Tillemans said they screen the legal records, family background and  political views of potential nominees to make sure that they will hew to  Republican philosophies.  </P> <P> "Through the years, we've had so many judges that were very lenient in so many  ways . . . so we look for the good Republican principles," Tillemans said.  Asked to outline the principles that are reflected in nominees' legal briefs  and judicial rulings, she said, "It's more government by the people than  government for the people."  </P> <P> However, the three said that they do not delve into nominees' personal lives.  </P> <P> "The kind of people we were talking to were all law-abiding citizens that were  well-known in the legal community. Besides, isn't that against the law anyway?"  Haley said. "I never had anybody talk to us that had murdered anybody or threw  his wife downstairs."  </P> <P> And Leavens said they do not concern themselves with the nominees' drinking  habits or marital fidelity. "I think those things you wouldn't have to ask  about. You'd hear about them from other sources. Anybody that wants to go up is  essentially pretty clean."  </P> <P> The process of settling on a recommendation can take four to six months, said  Tillemans, who when not working for her party promotes housing developments for  the Dolphin Group, a Los Angeles-based lobbying and public relations firm with  strong Republican political connections.  </P> <P> "We go over their resumes and we recommend the ones who we think are suitable  and then the governor's appointment secretary looks over them and it goes to  Deukmejian," she said.  </P> <P> But before Deukmejian makes any appointment, each nominee is reviewed by the  state Judicial Nominees Evaluation Commission, a panel of 20 lawyers and six  lay people, which does extensive background checks.  </P> <P> The so-called Jenny Commission also reviews a seven-page questionnaire in which  each nominee lists experience on the bench and at the bar, outlines political  affiliations and personal history, and answers the question, "Why do you want  to be a judge?"  </P> <P> Once that process ends, the commission rates each nominee as extremely well  qualified, well qualified, qualified or "not ready for appointment at this  time," Flanigan said.  </P> <P> After reviewing the commission's recommendations and letters on the nominees  from local bar associations, the governor picks the nominee he feels is best  suited for the slot, Flanigan said.  </P> <P> But this process could change in January -- after what is sure to be a flurry  of appointments by the outgoing Deukmejian -- when Sen. Pete Wilson becomes  governor, legal experts and Wilson associates agree.  </P> <P> Wilson has relied on an eight-member merit selection committee to make initial  recommendations for federal judge appointments in the Central District of  California. The panel included U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Cynthia  Holcomb Hall, U.S. District Judge William D. Keller and California Supreme  Court Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, who also served while a federal district judge.  </P> <P> Although critics on the federal bench challenged the propriety of letting  federal judges help name their colleagues when the Wilson committee's makeup  was first revealed in 1986, the panel has continued to advise Wilson on federal  judicial nominees. Federal judges are appointed by the President upon the  recommendation of legislators.  </P> <P> And if Wilson's taste in federal judges is any guide, his appointments to the  state bench will differ to some degree from Deukmejian's, said Vogel, the state  bar association chief.  </P> <P> "It appears he is impressed with people who have good academic records," Vogel  said of Wilson. "If you look at his federal appointments, many of them were  high achievers in college or law school."  </P> <P> Vogel continued, "Deukmejian was the attorney general, he did work with  prosecutors, he did work with government lawyers. He was pretty proud of them  and felt somewhat in line with them and felt their expertise in government  would fit them well in the bench."  </P> <P> However, Wilson's method of weeding out unwanted nominees probably will change  for state appointees because state law requires nominees to be reviewed by the  Jenny Commission, said John G. Davies, a San Diego lawyer who served as  Wilson's judicial selection adviser.  </P> <P> "Deukmejian and all the other governors in my lifetime have had local screening  committees. I have no idea what Pete's intentions are on that," Davies said.  </P> <P> "We have over 4,000 judicial applications on file for Deukmejian," Flanigan  said. He predicted the lame-duck governor will fill many of the judicial  vacancies before leaving office. "I think he'll look at it as his greatest  legacy."  </P> <P> The retirement last week of Presiding Municipal Judge Lee E. Cooper Jr.  virtually guarantees that Deukmejian's local advisers will have further impact  on the bench before Wilson takes office.  </P> <P> The Jenny Commission already has pumped nominees through the pipeline and  readied them for the governor's final approval, and the local advisers have  made their recommendations for new openings, Bradbury said.  </P> <P> "It's my sense that Deukmejian will fill every opening that he has available  before he leaves office because the judiciary was a very important issue for  him," Bradbury said.  </P> <P> Once Wilson takes office, he will find the California justice system far larger  and more of a challenge -- with 1,500 judgeships -- than the federal system he  is accustomed to, said Flanigan, the governor's appointment secretary.  </P> <P> Flanigan, who has been asked to keep his job through the first year of Wilson's  term, said that relying on a fixed group of people for input "would not be  reasonable," even though "there are lawyers and non-lawyers who we may talk to  in the Deukmejian or future Wilson administration." The ideal situation, he  said, "is to talk to as broad a group as possible."  </P> <P> Flanigan said the work of local advisers such as Bradbury, Leavens, Tillemans  and Haley is vital to selecting the nominees that his office sends to the Jenny  Commission -- that is, the nominees who have a shot at being appointed by the  governor.  </P> <P> "Wilson will follow the same road as Deukmejian in appointing conservative  judges," Tillemans predicted, "and we're on that governor's council now."  </P> <P> Leavens' wife, Carolyn Leavens, who was chairwoman of Wilson's campaign in  Ventura County, said she made a recommendation on one of Deukmejian's judicial  appointees -- a duty she would gladly repeat for Wilson.  </P> <P> Bradbury, who actively campaigned for Wilson this year, said he is uncertain  what his role will be in helping the new governor select future Ventura County  judges.  </P> <P> But he added, "I would hope that Sen. Wilson would continue to seek the input  of local public officials."  </P></p>

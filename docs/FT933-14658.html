			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Espirito Santo in NY placing ESPIRITO Santo Financial Holding, which heads one of the largest financial groups in Portugal, has placed 2.65m American depository shares, on the New York stock exchange. The shares were placed at Dollars 29 each and are being quoted at around Dollars 27, said Mr Ricardo Espirito Santo Salgado, head of the group. The offer was increased from an original 2m shares because of heavy demand, which would have been enough to buy 5.2m shares. A total of 1.9m shares were placed with institutional investors and the remainder with individuals in the US and Canada. This was the second placement of shares in New York by ESFH, which is quoted in London and Luxembourg. Some 28 per cent of the group's capital is held by US and Canadian investors. Grupo Espirito Santo continues to hold a majority of the company followed by Grupo Freres of Belgium and Grupo Agnelli, which together hold 9 per cent. Foreign institutions will be allowed to buy an 80 per cent stake in Portugal's state-owned Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor when it is sold in October, Mr Fernando de Almeida, the bank's president said, Reuter reports from Lisbon. 'The (BPSM privatisation) law does not set any limit on foreigners,' Mr Almeida said. The government would approve the law outlining conditions for the BPSM sale in the next few days. 'Then there will be three months for candidates to apply, so the operation should occur in October,' Mr Almeida added.</p>

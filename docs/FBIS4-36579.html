			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN secretary general's  special envoy, yesterday met with leaders of political parties  and organizations in the Republic of Yemen.    At the outset of the meeting, Brother Dr. Qasim Sallam,  secretary of the Yemen Regional Command of the Arab Socialist  Ba'th Party, acting on his own behalf and on behalf of Yemeni  party leaders, welcomed Brother Lakhdar Brahimi as a  representative of international legitimacy, which our country  and government welcome. He said: Undoubtedly, events in our  country are of interest to the entire world because the Yemeni  people now find themselves in a difficult situation brought  about by a small group that rebelled against constitutional  legitimacy and the Yemeni people's will, as well as the will of  history.    On his part, Brother Lakhdar Brahimi said he hopes the  Republic of Yemen will be able to overcome the current state.  He noted the importance of dialogue to establish peace.    The brother party leaders spoke during the meeting,  stressing  that Yemeni unity is the Yemeni people's fate and future. They  will not relinquish it because it was a great achievement of our  people on 22 May 1990, following a long struggle by the Yemeni  people through the various stages of the Yemeni national  movement. They kept that dream, which lived in the mind of the  people for scores of years, until they achieved it by the  establishment of the Yemeni Republic on 22 May 1990, the Yemeni  people's plebiscite on the Constitution, and the general  elections on 27 April 1993 within the context of political and  party pluralism.    The party leaders noted that what is going on in Yemen is  not  a war between the north and south as portrayed by hostile media,  but, rather, a war between the Yemeni people and the  secessionist clique in the Socialist Party that rebelled against  legitimacy and the constitutional institutions, fabricated the  political crisis, and imposed a war on the people.    The brother party leaders then engaged in a lengthy  discussion on the situations in our country and their dimensions.</p>

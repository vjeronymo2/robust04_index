			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: All-time peak in Shell A SURGE in Royal Dutch stock in the US overnight and on the Amsterdam market early yesterday, which drove the shares up to a record high, promoted a similar wave of support for Shell Transport shares, which raced ahead to an all-time peak of 628p, prior to closing a net 12 up at 627p. Turnover was a healthy 5.2m shares. Apart from the impact of Royal Dutch's performance, Shell's strength came from a general groundswell of international buying, after last week's round of presentations by the company in Europe and ahead of a presentation to UK analysts on Monday. Dealers said the market had been overwhelmed by big buying interest and heavy arbitrage business carried out by four big market players from the US. 'The market was caught short and spent most of yesterday chasing its tail in Shell,' said one marketmaker. In its recent buy note on Shell, Strauss Turnbull said it expected Shell 'to embark on an accelerated programme of cost-cutting, via redundancies'.</p>

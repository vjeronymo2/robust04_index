			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Hongs prepare for climate change  -Groups are searching further afield for fresh gains Turning in strong profit growth last year was, for a Hong Kong-based conglomerate, arguably like stealing candy from a child. The colony's hongs all hold respectable land banks, at a time when demand is far outstripping supply, and are tapped into important infrastructure projects at various stages of development. However, with a strictly controlled supply of new land - just 50 hotly fought-after hectares a year - the developers are casting their nets further afield, buying up plots across the border in China to create commercial and residential units. The conglomerates are doing likewise and are exploring new lines of business in fields such as communications, industry and aviation. Wharf, which has an asset base of about HKDollars 100.5bn (USDollars 13bn), is moving into cable TV and telecommunications. Hutchison is increasing its container terminal interests and preparing for the April launch of its revamped UK telecoms business. Swire Pacific is investing more in ports and bottling activities in China. With the exception of the container terminals, none of these new projects are expected to make a large impact on the remaining financial statements this century. Mr Edmund Brandt, investment analyst with Jardine Fleming, does not see Wharf's cable TV making a large contribution to profits before 2000. In 1993, Wharf derived 75 per cent of its HKDollars 2.7bn profits from property. Over the next three years three new development projects adding 6m sq ft will come on line. The increased supply, twinned with rising rentals, will sustain growth over that period. Earlier this year, Citic Pacific, the Beijing-controlled conglomerate, paid HKDollars 3.4bn for a 50 per cent share in Discovery Bay, a residential complex on one of Hong Kong's outlying islands. This will see its property earnings increase in the current financial year. Last year, the property portfolio was valued at HKDollars 5bn. Citic is positioning itself for the changed climate with power station interests in China (a path followed by Hutchison) and remains on the acquisition trail for both properties and investment/management stakes. For Swire Pacific, where overall earnings were eroded by the fall in profits at Cathay Pacific, the 1993 picture was property driven. About half the profits came from this source and are expected to rise to about 60 per cent this year. The group has a HKDollars 56.2bn portfolio of investment properties and is in one of the strongest positions to carry on milking the property cow. Bucking the trend of strong property earnings last year, Jardine Matheson's Hongkong Land, its 32 per cent owned property investment arm, reported flat net earnings of USDollars 306.5m, compared with USDollars 305m in 1992, partially due to losses at Trafalgar House. Mr Ravi Nahrain, head of research at Peregrine, notes that Swire's commercial property portfolio eclipses that of Hongkong Land's. Only four years ago, Hongkong Land's was double the size of Swire's. 'Hongkong Land was the largest commercial property landlord on Hong Kong island. Now it has quite clearly been replaced by Swire Properties. On a divisional breakdown, the driving force for Swire's earnings for the past couple of years and looking forward will certainly be Swire Properties. They have acquired what is arguably the best property investment portfolio in Hong Kong, and that will grow by a further 50 per cent - at least - in the next five years,' Mr Nahrain says. Swire is addressing the supply constraints on land in a more conservative manner. There is no flashy bidding at auctions, the preferred route for many. It is not calling on the Hong Kong and Chinese governments to free up more land, like Hutchison chairman Mr Li Ka-shing. Unlike Jardine, it is not selling out in favour of foreign fields. Swire Properties will add almost HKDollars 4bn to its net asset value by transforming a bowling alley and cinema, owned by the group, into an office building, simply for the construction cost. It has teamed up with the likes of Citic and China Motor Bus to acquire plots at prices deemed to be on the low side. The group has a good prospect in its Tai Koo development on Hong Kong island. Office rentals here are about a third of those in the prime business district of central, but the area is well served by public transport and is closer to the airport. An increasing number of companies are relocating staff there, including some of the colony's biggest employers such as Jardine Pacific, Hongkong Telecom and Swire On top of demand, there is room for rentals to move upwards. Mr Nahrain reckons another 50 per cent is within reach over 18 months, whereas it is unlikely that prime Exchange Square rentals will rise to the same level of HKDollars 150 a sq ft. Aviation, possibly the weak link after the profits fall at Cathay Pacific, has proved more of a mixed blessing. Dragon Air, the regional airline in which both Citic and Cathay Pacific have large stakes, is reckoned to have grown more than 80 per cent last year, according to Peregrine. Earnings at Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Company rose 15 per cent last year. As Cathay turns round, so aviation contributions will swell. The exciting stories in the years ahead will be in the fields of infrastructure and communications. Container terminals will become more valuable to those companies which have invested in the ports, and are expected to become the driving force for Hutchison's earnings. In communications, Citic will this financial year reap an additional HKDollars 250m in earnings from its stake in Hongkong Telecom in its first full-year holding, according to Crosby Securities. China will continue to play an important role for the hongs, possibly to a lesser extent at Jardine Matheson. According to Peregrine, the princely hong that started the Hong Kong ballgame rolling has been a net seller of HKDollars 7.4bn-worth of Hong Kong and China assets. It may be churlishness ahead of the de-listing next year but Jardine is generally deemed to have done the least in terms of a strategic blueprint to take it up to the turn of the century. Jardine's star turn in 1993 was Jardine Fleming, the Hong Kong merchant banking joint venture with Robert Fleming, which saw net profits leap 166 per cent to USDollars 202m. However, any stock market downturn will hit Jardine Fleming. Analysts also fear the parent will find it tougher to do business in China following the de-listing.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HONG KONG CONGLOMERATES' RESULTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  1993 net profits       Earnings      1992 net profits                       HKDlrs (bn)      per share        HKDollars (bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hutchison                     6.3      Dlrs 1.79                  3.05 Jardine Matheson     USDlrs 0.389  *USDlrs 0.6631         USDlrs 0.317 Swire                         4.6      Dlrs 2.934                  4.4 Wharf                         2.7      Dlrs 1.273                  2.0 Citic Pacific 1.9      Dlrs 1.082             1.0                 81.0  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Change        Earnings                               (%)       per share  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hutchison                   107.0       Dlrs 0.96 Jardine Matheson             23.0   USDlrs 0.5459 Swire                         5.4      Dlrs 2.783 Wharf                        33.0      Dlrs 0.978 Citic Pacific                81.0      Dlrs 0.874  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  * fully diluted  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

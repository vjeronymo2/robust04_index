			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maksim Yusin: "Diplomats in Riga and Moscow </F> Choose Not To Exaggerate Incident"]    [Text] Following official apologies by the Latvian  president and foreign minister, the tension in relations between  Riga and Moscow has begun to abate.    As far as one can tell from what Russian diplomats are  saying, Moscow is prepared to accept Latvia's story: The arrest  of the two generals and seizure of the military facilities was  the work of extremists operating without the republic  leadership's knowledge. This was effectively admitted by Andrey  Kozyrev as well. "A very crude provocation has occurred in  Latvia," he said in a television interview. "It may be a  provocation against the line of the Latvian authorities and  president themselves." At the same time, according to the  Russian minister, the generals' arrest was carried out by "armed  territorial defense representatives, that is, government forces."    A spokesman for the Latvian Embassy in Moscow described this  information as not entirely accurate: "In fact, the action was  carried out mainly by the municipal police; that is, forces  indirectly subordinate to Andrejs Rucs -- head of Riga's Vidzeme  Rayon. As for members of territorial defense subunits, they  participated in the operation on their own initiative, without  the approval of the republic authorities."    According to information from embassy staff, Rucs was  dismissed on 11 January. Criminal proceedings have now been  instituted against him. He is accused of exceeding his official  authority and of unlawful arrest.    To all appearances, the explanations from the Latvian  authorities satisfied the members of the Russian delegation who  flew to Riga on Monday for a further round of consultations on  the withdrawal of forces. On the morning of 11 January the  Russian delegation head, special envoy Sergey Zotov, agreed to  start the talks that had been called off the day before as a  protest against the arrest of the generals.    Diplomats in Riga and Moscow chose not to exaggerate the  incident. Nonetheless it is clear to both sides that certain  political forces are behind Andrejs Rucs, and further  provocations, including armed provocations, against the Russian  military cannnot be ruled out.    The deadline for the final withdrawal of forces has not yet  been agreed -- negotiations are continuing. The likelihood is  that Riga will ultimately accept the schedule proposed by the  Russians: The last soldier is to leave Latvian territory before  1 September 1994.</p>

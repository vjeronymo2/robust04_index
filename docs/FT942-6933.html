			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Interest reins in SW Water South West Water yesterday announced pre-tax profits at the lower end of expectations as the effects of falling interest rates and hefty capital expenditure began to take their toll. The utility reported a marginal Pounds 300,000 improvement in pre-tax profits to Pounds 93m for the year to March 31. Analysts had been expecting between Pounds 93.6m and Pounds 98m. Profits were held back by a Pounds 26m swing in the interest line, as the company began to draw down cash to pay for its Pounds 200m annual investment programme. Some Pounds 14m was paid in interest, against a Pounds 12m gain last time. Turnover rose by 30 per cent to Pounds 252m (Pounds 194m). A 14 per cent increase achieved by the utility business masked a 3 per cent decline in commercial demand. The shares yesterday fell by 15p to 510p. Mr Ken Hill, finance director, said costs had been cut by some Pounds 2m last year by job losses and production efficiencies. The programme to upgrade sewage treatment along South West's coastline was two thirds complete or under way. So far the projects had been finished on budget and on time. South West has been the hardest hit by coastal clean-up regulations, due to its long coastline and relatively sparse population. Consequently it has been allowed to impose the highest charges of the 10 main companies on its customers. Mr Hill refused to comment on the draft price increases, delivered to water and sewage companies by Ofwat, the industry regulator, last weekend. In the period under review the non-regulated businesses, acquired since privatisation for a total investment of Pounds 40m, broke even after interest. At the operating level, the businesses contributed Pounds 2.4m, on a jump in sales from Pounds 10m to Pounds 75m. This reflected in part the inclusion for a full year of Haul Waste and acquisitions. The final dividend goes up in line with expectations by 7.5 per cent to 17.1p, for an increased total of 25.5p (23.7p). Earnings per share were 68.5p (67.9p). COMMENT The financial strains on South West are beginning to show, in particular on dividend and interest cover. The company will be forced to find substantial cost savings in order to protect the dividend, unless the regulator is feeling generous. It seems clear that in spite of its respectable track record in the non-regulated business, substantial returns from these divisions are some way away. Forecasts are for Pounds 100m this year. If the compulsion to invest in water is irresistible in spite of the price uncertainty, then there may be better bets than South West in the short-term.</p>

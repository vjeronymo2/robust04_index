			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Reinhard Voss: "`Exonerating Document' for </F> `Republikaner'?"]    [Text] Duesseldorf, 8 April -- In the first constitutional  protection report to be issued under his responsibility, Federal  Interior Minister Manfred Kanther, of the Christian Democratic  Union, no longer wants to count the Republikaner party among  right-wing extremist parties. This can be concluded from the  draft 1993 constitutional protection report, which the Federal  Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV] presented to  the laender.    Under a separate section, the draft concedes special status  to the Republikaner. North Rhine-Westphalian Interior Minister  Herbert Schnoor, of the Social Democratic Party of Germany,  rejected such an -- as he called it -- "exonerating document"  for the Republikaner in a letter to Kanther, the interior  ministers, and interior senators of the laender.    According to information received by Schnoor, "individual  Republikaner officials" received letters from the interior  minister on their request, stating that the Republikaner were  under BfV observation but that there was no decision yet.  Schnoor, however, pointed to findings by the North  Rhine-Westphalian Office for the Protection of the Constitution,  rulings of the Administrative Court of Baden-Wuerttemberg, and  the High Administrative Court of Muenster, which offered  "sufficient evidence" for regarding the Republikaner as  right-wing extremist.    If, in his report, Kanther indeed was no longer able to  classify the Republikaner as right-wing extremist, he would make  it possible for the Republikaner in upcoming court proceedings  "to cite the Federal Government as a witness against those  laender that are observing them," complains Schnoor to his  colleagues.    Last month, the Duesseldorf interior minister, in his legal  dispute with the Republikaner -- which ended in his favor -- on  the lawfulness of their persecution by the North  Rhine-Westphalian Office for the Protection of the Constitution,  presented to the Duesseldorf Administrative Court eight  procedures initiated against members of the Republikaner in 1993  for politically motivated crimes. These included, among other  things, the "simulated execution" of a Turk in Muelheim -- which  the cardiac victim did not survive, unauthorized possession of  firearms, dangerous injury, and aiding and abetting an attack  against a home for asylum-seekers in the Bergheim district.    There was an attempt to hush up this case with the help of  the Republikaner district and land executive committees to  "prevent the most grave damage to the future of the party."</p>

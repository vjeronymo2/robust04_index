			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / UB sells Terry's chocolates to Kraft KRAFT General Foods International, part of Philip Morris, the large US tobacco and foods group, is to buy Terry's, United Biscuits' chocolates division, for Pounds 220m in cash. The deal marks the first serious entry into the UK chocolate market by KGFI, which owns Jacobs Suchard, a leading Swiss chocolate maker, and recently made a successful Dollars 1.5bn bid for Freia Marabou, Norway's biggest confectionery company. UB said the sale represented an excellent deal. Its share price fell 14p to close at 379p. Analysts attributed the fall mainly to a technical correction after a strong rally in recent days. UB expects the sale to enhance its full-year earnings and cut gearing, excluding intangibles, to about 50 per cent from more than 90 per cent. It would yield an exceptional profit of about Pounds 75m in this year's accounts, after a Pounds 33m charge for goodwill previously written off to reserves. There would be no significant tax liability. Terry's earned trading profits of Pounds 14.3m on sales of Pounds 153m in 1991, when its net assets were Pounds 84m. It has about 3 per cent by volume of the chocolate market in Britain, where it owns two factories, and has subsidiaries in France, Italy and the US. KGFI said the acquisition would give Suchard its own distribution network in the UK, where it has only about 1 per cent of a chocolate market dominated by Cadbury Schweppes, Nestle and Mars. Suchard's brands include Toblerone, Milka and Cote d'Or. KGFI said Terry's had a good stable of brands, sales of which could be further expanded, in Britain and internationally. It planned to retain Terry's existing management and allow it to continue developing the business along recent lines. Mr Jack Keenan, KGFI's chairman, said Suchard was unlikely ever to have a large share of the UK market. But Terry's was the only acquisition candidate available and offered a profitable niche and a product range that complemented Suchard's own. UB said the sale would provide UB with increased flexibility in its biscuit and savoury snack operations. The deal leaves Cadbury as the only large UK-owned chocolate maker.

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Technology: Tapping in to third world telecoms - The market is waiting to be exploited The developing world is becoming a holy grail for the global telecommunications industry. The potential of untapped markets in the poor but populous countries of the third world is enormous. India alone has unsatisfied demand of at least 10m lines. Some countries such as Nepal or Burkina Faso have bought state-of-the art fibre and digital systems that rival those in the US and Europe. Economic liberalisation is sweeping the developing world, tearing down the regulations and trade barriers that once kept multinationals out. In many countries the cost of inefficiency and corruption is becoming too heavy to bear, and governments cannot afford to upgrade networks alone. New lines installed by state companies in Africa, for example, cost Dollars 6,200 (Pounds 4,300) on average, according to the International Telecommunications Union. In Latin America, the figure is Dollars 2,900, although privatisation has lowered this figure in some countries. But a multinational can install a new line for less than Dollars 1,000. Ministers take liberalisation seriously because the link between telecommunications and development has become incontrovertible: the better a country's telecommunications network, the wealthier it is likely to be. This single theme dominated a recent Buenos Aires conference organised by the ITU and sponsored by the United Nations. It was the ITU's first conference aimed at the needs of the developing world. Seminars drove home the lesson to industry executives and ministry officials that private-sector participation and liberalisation are the only way poor countries can modernise and expand telecommunications. This is easier said than done. Edward Salia, Ghana's transport and communication minister, agrees the era of state-controlled telecommunications is over, but says: 'Telecommunications are national assets. Are we going to allow unrestricted entry?' Previous warnings by the ITU that the developing world was being left behind in the telecoms revolution had no effect. Between 1983 and 1992, telephone lines per head in the industrialised world rose by 10 per cent. But the rise in the rest of the world was only 1.4 per cent. The ITU says global telecommunications service and equipment sales last year rose by 8 per cent to Dollars 535bn, but three-quarters of this was spent in the developed world. While heavy investment in telecoms will not alone spur economic growth, privatisation and liberalisation have had positive results. Latin America is in the forefront of telecommunications privatisation. Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela have all privatised their networks. Only Brazil seems to have no time for liberalisation. Brigadier Adyr da Silva, president of the Telebras state telecommunications company, says: 'Brazil, in terms of plant, investment and technology, is in the first world. If (telecommunications) are such a good deal for us, why should we give it to the Americans? There is an immense campaign going on. Everyone is trying to force their way into (foreign) markets. Those who are in are fighting to keep the others out.' The introduction of technologies such as cellular telephony, digital systems and data networks passed the poorest countries by in the 1980s. But the future of some new technologies could depend on demand in third world markets. Inmarsat, the international communications satellite organisation, already has briefcase telephone systems that can provide low-cost satellite phone services for every village in a poor country. It says the future of mobile satellite communications will depend to a large extent on take-up in poor countries. In March, it successfully tested a cellphone-sized handset that transmitted a taped Wilbur Smith novel to one of its satellites. However, it admits this system is at least four years from becoming commercially operational and will require a new generation of satellites. US companies such as Motorola, AT&amp;T and Microsoft plan to introduce similar technologies.</p>

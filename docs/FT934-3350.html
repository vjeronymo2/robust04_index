			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / People: Switched on at East Midlands Time was when the route to the top in the electricity sector was a lifetime of work in the industry. The appointment yesterday of Norman Askew as chief executive at East Midlands electricity is the latest in a series of appointments at regional electricity companies, or recs, which show how times have changed since privatisation. Other recent external recruits to senior rec posts include John Devaney, now chief executive at Eastern Electricity but formerly of the US motor industry, and Andrew Walker who is to succeed David Jones as chief executive of Swalec. Like Walker, Askew came from TI, where he was in charge of the aerospace division. Unlike him, however, he served a year-long apprenticeship before winning the chief executive's job which he takes up in April. He was appointed managing director last July. Askew's elevation follows the decision by John Harris to relinquish the role of combined chief executive and chairman. Harris will remain executive chairman. In stepping up the management ladder, Askew, 51, will assume responsibility for finance and corporate affairs in addition to his current roles. Following the decision by Mike Carus to retire as finance director, the company is expecting to appoint a replacement to report to Askew shortly. Meanwhile Askew is completing a shake-up of executive responsiblities following the move earlier this year to rationalise the company's 13 cost centres into seven profit centres and to cut Pounds 15m of costs annually. The reorganisation of the company also includes cutting out several tiers of management. 'This does not in itself save huge amounts of costs, but it is terribly important in terms of liberalising the business and letting people loose,' says Askew. The company also announced that three associate directors are taking early retirement. They are Stan Errington, (personnel), Graeme Myring (engineering) and Mike Fisher (marketing).</p>

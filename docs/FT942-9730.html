			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Italian privatisations to be priority The new Italian government yesterday suggested priority would be given to privatisation and reducing the state's dominant role, in a government programme due to be delivered to parliament on Monday. These objectives were outlined yesterday by Mr Gianni Letta, the chief of staff of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, who was sworn in as prime minister last Wednesday, after a cabinet meeting that studied the broad programme. The programme has been put together only during the past week and it remains to be seen how many of the items from the election programmes of the three main partners in the Freedom Alliance have been adopted. However, the emphasis on privatisation and tax reform underlines the main platform of both the populist Northern League and Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement. Another priority will be tax reform. To stress the importance of tax reform, Mr Letta said the finance ministry had been given three junior ministers instead of the usual two. The cabinet meeting also approved 37 junior ministers. The list shows a delicate balance between the need to placate the various parties in Mr Berlusconi's alliance and the need to find technically competent people to back up an inexperienced ministerial team. The neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance has been awarded 12 junior ministries on top of five ministerial portfolios. This represents the culmination of the MSI's remarkable political advance after four decades of being regarded as a pariah. Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia is represented by 13 junior ministers, including a pro-European Forza Italia senator and former journalist, Mr Livio Caputo, who will be in direct charge of European policy. The League, although having the most parliamentary seats, was awarded only 10 junior ministries. But this reflects Mr Berlusconi's view that the League already has its prize, the interior ministry.</p>

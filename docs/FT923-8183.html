			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / North American Free Trade Agreement: Pemex open wider but not for sale - Oil and gas MEXICO'S energy sector has emerged from the Nafta negotiations largely unscathed. The Mexican government will not privatise Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), while US and Canadian oil companies will not be allowed to explore for oil, operate refineries, nor open petrol stations, in Mexico, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. The US also appears to have been unable to compel Mexico to offer it a guaranteed supply of oil. Even so, Mexico has agreed to open 50 per cent of the procurement by Pemex and the Federal Electricity Commission to US and Canadian companies in the first year, increasing to 70 per cent over eight years and with no reservation after 10 years. Such companies will receive cash payments for their work, rather than a percentage of the oil they find. However, the Mexican government has agreed to allow 'performance' contracts, where contracted companies receive bonuses if they strike oil. Pemex plans to invest Dollars 20bn from 1990-95, most of it in exploration, drilling and new refineries. Mexico has agreed to open all but a handful of petrochemicals to foreign investment, and will allow foreign gas companies to sell gas directly to Mexican industrial companies, under the supervision of Pemex. The accord abides by Mexico's nationalist constitution and so will be hailed as a victory by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and his negotiators. However, US and Canadian oil and gas companies will be able to increase their business in Mexico if the treaty is implemented.</p>

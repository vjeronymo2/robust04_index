			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Construction Contracts: Design study at Moorgate Station Architectural practice A&amp;DG (ARCHITECTURE &amp; DESIGN GROUP) has been awarded the design contract for one of CrossRail's two City gateway stations which will be sited at Moorgate. This commission will be the first significant project undertaken by the practice following the completion of its designs at Liverpool Street Station and the restructuring of the group from a British Rail in-house architectural unit to a largely independent stand-alone practice. A&amp;DG were selected for the Moorgate project from a nine-strong list of invited practices. The practice now joins an architectural CrossRail line-up which so far includes Alsop &amp; Stormer at Paddington and Ralph Erskine with BDP who will jointly be looking at all internal platform and tunnel designs. A&amp;DG will for an initial 12-week period be producing conceptual feasibility studies for both the internal design of the ticket hall and possible options of ensuring that the CrossRail has a distinctive public image at street level. The civil engineering team for the project will be appointed later in order to give the architects a creative breathing space. Moorgate Underground Station currently suffers from having three separate entrances with no distinguishable main entrance or sense of identity. A&amp;DG has been asked to look at ways in which the entire site can be reconciled - a task which is complicated by the existence of some listed buildings and the conditional planning approval for the redevelopment of Moor House.</p>

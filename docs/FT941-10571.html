			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Minister acts over college dispute Mr Tim Boswell, the minister for further education, yesterday intervened in the dispute between further education colleges and their lecturers over new contracts. Lecturers may now find that they can only receive pay rises if they sign new contracts. The Natfhe lecturers' union announced earlier this week that it would hold a one-day strike on March 1 against new contracts that would add seven hours to the working week. Mr Boswell is backing the Colleges' Employers' Forum, which negotiates on behalf of most college principals in England and Wales. All further education colleges were removed from local authority control in April last year and were incorporated as independent organisations. He told the forum that he was withholding Pounds 50m from colleges' budgets to be released only 'when there had been satisfactory progress within colleges towards more flexible contracts of employment'. He said current contracts for lecturers included 'restrictive practices', and added: 'The model contract which the CEF has drawn up eliminates these restrictive practices.' Natfhe gave an angry response. Ms Sue Berryman, the union's chief negotiator, said: 'It's ironic that the colleges are supposed to have been set free, and then we get this kind of interference.' She said the government was jeopardising its own programme of expanding further education. The forum described the union's strike as 'futile' and pointed out that only 58 per cent of its members had voted in the strike ballot last month. Of these, 62 per cent supported strike action.</p>

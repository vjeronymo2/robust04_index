			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Management: French revolution for record retail rivals - Marketing and Advertising This time last year, the unsalubrious Parisian suburb of Cergy was the scene of a particularly nasty race riot, in which gangs of youths turned the town centre into a battlefield. Yesterday, it became a battlefield of a different kind when FNAC opened its newest store in the Cergy shopping centre. FNAC is already France's biggest single record retailer and the Cergy store forms part of its FFr1.3bn (Pounds 130m) expansion programme. The store is also FNAC's latest weapon in its bitter battle against Virgin, the ambitious British retailer which is now FNAC's closest competitor on its traditional French terrain. For decades, FNAC had enjoyed an apparently effortless dominance over the French market for records, cassettes, videos and books, or 'cultural retailing' as the French like to call it. But three years ago, Virgin arrived in France and, far from shying away from a battle, showed every sign of spoiling for a fight. Virgin went straight for the jugular. It opened its first French megastore in the heart of Paris, on the Champs Elysee. The store, set in a lavishly renovated banking hall, was not only the world's biggest record shop but its sales space was larger than all FNAC's Parisian stores put together. The Champs Elysee store has been an undoubted success with sales of FFr500m in its first year. Emboldened by its experience, Virgin ventured into the French provinces in 1990 by opening two new megastores - in the same opulent style as the Paris store - in Bordeaux and Marseilles. FNAC has fought back. The French press, which has followed the fight with even more than its usual bloodlust, is packed with accounts of the latest spat between Jean-Louis Petriat, the bow-tied chairman of FNAC, and Patrick Zelnick, his laid-back counterpart at Virgin France who, true to the Branson tradition, does not wear a tie at all. Petriat has stopped at nothing in the fight against Virgin from reputedly putting pressure on its minority shareholders to withdraw their support, to slashing prices - reportedly by as much as 30 per cent - at FNAC's Parisian stores. FNAC has also tried to play its competitor at its own game by opening its own megastore, 'La Cathedrale', in the old Grand Bazar department store on Avenue de Ternes to the north of the Champs Elysee. La Cathedrale, which opened last November with a bill of FFr10m, is as opulent as anything Virgin could conceive with its 8,000sq metres of sales space spread over five floors around an 18 metre high post-industrial Colonne du Savoir, (column of knowledge), bearing no fewer than 17 video screens. La Cathedrale is the linchpin of the FFr1.3bn expansion plan with which FNAC plans to double its French floorspace by the end of next year. There will be nine store openings this year, of which Cergy was the first. So far FNAC appears to have the advantage over Virgin. It is, after all, the bigger of the two businesses with 36 stores to Virgin France's three and turnover of FFr7.4bn in the last full financial year, compared with the interloper's FFr840m. Moreover, although the cost of the expansion plan is believed to be depressing FNAC's profits, Virgin, which has been far less successful in the provinces than in Paris, is thought to be losing money in France. Virgin has, characteristically, turned this comparative weakness to its advantage. Zelnick has been careful to cast his company as a groovy young David and FNAC as a staid old Goliath. One of his most successful ploys has been Virgin's campaign against France's strict Sunday trading laws. The campaign has already cost Virgin several hundred thousand francs in fines, but has also produced pages of free publicity and the prospect of a government inquiry into the issue. Moreover Virgin no longer looks quite so puny in its David guise. For a time last autumn, it looked as though the Virgin group, which was under pressure in other areas of activity, might have to give up the fight against FNAC. Zelnick confirmed to the French press in November that he was considering bringing in a new minority investor to provide additional capital. Petriat smugly announced that FNAC might deign to invest. Times have changed. Last month, Branson sold Virgin Music, his original record company, to Thorn EMI for Pounds 510m. Most of the money will be pumped into his airline, but there should be some left for his pugilistic megastores in France. The battle between FNAC and Virgin seems set to go on  -and on.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Attention focused on Eurofima Ecu500m issue KICKING off a busy week, the international bond market was yesterday mostly focused on three Ecu deals, in particular a large Ecu500m 15-year transaction from Eurofima, the rail equipment financing company. The Eurofima issue, lead managed by JP Morgan Securities, has not yet broken syndicate but has already attracted a lot of attention because of its size and maturity. JP Morgan believes there is demand at the longer end of the Ecu yield curve for a liquid issue as this area of the Ecu bond market is under-served - bar a 15-year, Ecu400m issue from SNCF and an Ecu750m issue from Finland. The Ecu market has fallen over the last month due to a combination of factors - general concern over European Monetary Union, fears about the ratification of the Maastricht protocol in some member countries and the feeling that institutional investors are selling off their Ecu bonds. JP Morgan argues the Ecu market is probably oversold. Other houses were doubtful whether such a large issue could be easily placed. The lead manager admitted it could take 'some effort' to get the issue away but said an estimated Ecu200-250m has already been placed. The deal is priced at 4 basis points over the 8 1/2 per cent Ecu OAT due 2002. Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone's Ecu200m issue traded well, and was seen as fairly priced. The reoffer price of 99.5 gave a yield of 8.878 per cent, which compared favourably with other five-year maturities - although there were a few grumbles that the lead manager - Swiss Bank Corporation - kept a high proportion of the deal to sell to retail investors in Switzerland. South Africa tapped the international capital market with a DM120m, five-year issue for Telkom SA, the South Africa telecommunications utility. The deal is the fifth since South Africa's 'rehabilitation' in the public bond market last September, and follows D-Mark and Ecu-denominated issues by the government, the Development Bank of Southern Africa, and Eskom (the South African electricity utility). The deal, which carried a government guarantee, appeared to be well-received and attracted widespread interest from retail investors, according to Deutsche Bank, the lead manager. The pricing on South African issues has steadily fallen since September. The Eskom deal - the most recent South African issue - was priced to yield 150 basis points over the five-year German government notes, which was seen as quite tight pricing. However, Deutsche Bank bucked this trend by deciding to price the Telkom issue at 160 basis points over the five-year notes in order to ensure a better reception for the issue. By mid-afternoon, Telkom was trading at around 98.10, within fees.</p>

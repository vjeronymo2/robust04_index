			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CCDC GIVES LUXURY CONDOMINIUMS THE EDGE IN BID FOR DOWNTOWN SITE  </P> <P> It's exaggerating to say that developers are falling over themselves to get a  crack at downtown San Diego's building boom. But not by much.  </P> <P> That was made clear again Friday, when downtown redevelopment officials found  themselves in increasingly familiar territory: sorting through competing  multimillion-dollar proposals for a small piece of city-owned property, this  one at the southwest corner of Broadway and State Street.  </P> <P> "It's a nice position to be in," said Pam Hamilton, chief of Centre City  Development Corp., the agency in charge of downtown redevelopment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Three Different Proposals  </P> <P> Competing for a chance to build on the 33,321-square-foot site are three  development groups. The front-runner, selected by a committee of CCDC  directors, is called The Huntington, a 38-story, $91-million luxury condominium  project with 196 units. It is proposed by the Koll Co. and Davidson Communities  Inc.  </P> <P> The other two are a 30-story, $44-million high-rent apartment building with 287  units called 900 State Street, by El Dorado Asset Management Inc. and Trammell  Crow Co., and a 16-story, 296-room, $25-million all-suites hotel called City  Suites, by First Integrity Hotel Corp. and Sandor Shapery.  </P> <P> After hearing from all developers, CCDC delayed a decision until May 19,  because board member Tom Carter was absent and board president John Davies had  to leave the meeting early.  </P> <P> Under the Huntington proposal, CCDC would be paid a minimum of $2 million for  the site and receive $912,000 a year in special redevelopment taxes, more than  double its closest competitor, 900 State Street. Aside from the financial  return, some CCDC board members and staffers like the look of the 500-foot-tall  building, which resembles a 1930s tower.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cost Up to $1 Million  </P> <P> The condominiums, which are expected to cost $350,000 to $1 million, would  range in size from two-bedroom, 1,525-square-foot units to three-bedroom,  2,565-square-foot units. They would include wooden floors and 9-foot ceilings.  The Koll Co. also is building two high-rise office towers on the property next  door.  </P> <P> "The time is perfect to be looking at downtown housing," said Bill Davidson,  president of Davidson Communities, who last year was president of the Building  Industry Assn.  </P> <P> The 900 State Street project would pay CCDC a minimum of $3.2 million for the  property and generate $442,000 in special redevelopment taxes annually. El  Dorado Asset Management recently added Trammell Crow, one of the nation's  strongest and most-experienced real estate developers, as a 50% partner, to  help counter fears about El Dorado's strength as a developer. The apartments  would range from 467-square-foot studios to 1,892-square-foot, three-bedroom  units priced for "downtown yuppies," in the words of the developer's spokesmen.  </P> <P> A.J. Lirot, of El Dorado Asset Management, and Daniel Golozato, of Trammell  Crow, maintained that an apartment complex would be easier to finance and would  fill up with tenants faster than a condominium such as The Huntington or  downtown's first luxury condominium high-rise, the Meridian, which after nearly  four years is about 80% sold.  </P> <P> "We can adjust rents . . . we can make it fill up," Lirot said.  </P> <P> The building includes a child-care center for up to 60 children, and, at 20,000  square feet, much more ground-floor retail and commercial space than either of  the other proposals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hotel for Extended Stays  </P> <P> The third project, City Suites, appears to be in last place among the  competitors. Sandor Shapery said the hotel would provide extended-stay  accommodations to business travelers who must live in San Diego for less than a  year and often return home on weekends. He likened the concept to the services  provided by the Oakwood Apartments chain.  </P> <P> The rooms would rent for $60 to $70 a day, he said.  </P> <P> Shapery also is familiar with the site. He is a developer of the  Emerald-Shapery Center high-rise office and hotel complex under construction  directly across Broadway.  </P> <P> Tokyu Corp., a Japanese firm that is putting up the $130 million for the  Emerald-Shapery Center, has expressed concern about the height of some of the  proposals, since it had been told that nothing higher than a 16-story hotel  would be built on the Broadway and State Street property.  </P> <P> The Huntington project, for example, would be about 100 feet taller than the  Emerald-Shapery hotel. A Tokyu Corp. official, in a letter to CCDC, said that,  if views from its building are blocked, the company would "suffer (a)  substantial economic loss."  </P> <P> Hamilton, CCDC'S head administrator, said the agency has neither guaranteed  protection of private views nor, as she specified in a letter to Tokyu, "is it  recommended that such a practice be instituted." CCDC plans also call for tall  high-rises in specific areas of downtown, such as on Broadway.  </P> <P> Mike Stepner, San Diego city architect, had recommended that The Huntington be  reduced to 400 feet, but the developers said they couldn't cut the height and  keep the project financially feasible.  </P> <P> That CCDC is in a position to be picky is another example of how things have  changed. For years, downtown was an urban desert. The opening of Horton Plaza  almost four years ago helped signal a transformation.  </P> <P> Even after Horton Plaza, though, the common practice was for a  development-hungry CCDC to call for bids and then find itself working with a  single developer. But in the last two years, there has been more interest in  property designated for some of the city's tallest buildings.  </P> <P> It began in 1987, with competing proposals for property at Broadway and Kettner  Boulevard, where the victors, Starboard Development Corp. and Great American  Development Co., plan to build a $200-million plaza consisting of a 33-story  office tower and 15-story hotel.  </P> <P> Then there were dueling development proposals for the block between 1st Avenue  and Front, Market and G streets, eventually won by the Tutor Saliba/Paragon  Group, which plans to build a 40-story apartment tower.  </P></p>

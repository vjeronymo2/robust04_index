			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POPLINE: A REAL TEEN SENSATION  </P> <P> R&amp;B singer Tracie Spencer, the 13-year-old phenom, pondered a very silly  question: What would happen if heartthrob Al B. Sure! walked through the door  of the Hollywood record-company office?  </P> <P> She looked at the door and started giggling, burying her face in her hands.  "I'd probably die," she replied.  </P> <P> That was the first indication that there was a real teen-ager under that aloof,  low-key facade.  </P> <P> "In these situations, I can't act like a typical teen-ager, like I am with my  friends," explained Spencer, who signed with Capitol Records in the summer of  '87, about six months after a spectacular triumph -- at age 11 -- on the TV  talent-hunt show "Star Search." "I have to be professional -- mature and all  that."  </P> <P> Though never bubbly and outgoing during the interview, she did loosen up a bit  after that.  </P> <P> Because her vocals sound so mature and because she's tall for her age and much  older-looking than 13, it's easy to forget her real age. "People may forget  that I'm so young but I don't," she said.  </P> <P> Inspired by her father, a former singer, Spencer starting singing as a toddler  back in her hometown of Waterloo, Iowa. She had other aspirations too. "When I  was 5, I wanted to be a nurse and a professional basketball player," she  recalled. "You know how kids are."  </P> <P> While developing her singing skills doing amateur engagements in preparation  for a professional career, Spencer had only one fear: "I thought if I became a  celebrity, my friends might treat me differently and not like me anymore. So  far that hasn't happened."  </P> <P> How does she deal with the rigors and demands of the pop-music business?  </P> <P> "My father watches out for me," she replied. "But I watch out for myself too. I  get frustrated sometimes when I'm around a lot of older people all the time and  I'm working real hard. Sometimes I want to run off and be lazy but I can't. I  have to remember I'm not a kid anymore." DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

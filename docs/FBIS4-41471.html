			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Rybak report under the "Investment" rubric: "Oleg </F> Soskovets Trying To Lure Foreign Investors"]    [Text] At a meeting of the World Economic Forum, which  ended its work in Moscow yesterday, First Deputy Prime Minister  Oleg Soskovets called for foreign investors to step up their  operations in Russia. According to government estimates,  currently there are 1,316 -- mostly small -- joint ventures  operating in Russia. The aggregate foreign share in them is  estimated at $181 million.    The first deputy prime minister's statement was designed to  attract as many foreign investors as possible to the Russian  economy. In his words, Western investors will soon have an  easier time doing business in Russia. This will be helped by  the passing of the law "On Concession Agreements, Agreements on  Providing Services, and Production-Sharing Agreements with  Foreign Investors" and also by amending the law "On Foreign  Investment in the RSFSR." According to Mr. Soskovets, these  draft documents will shortly be considered by the Government  Presidium. Overseas investors' operations will also by  facilitated by presidential edicts that will form a third  package.    In addition, the first deputy prime minister thought it  "advisable to reduce the number of taxes, to cut the value-added  tax and profit tax rates for enterprises producing goods and  services" at the expense of raising taxes levied on mediatory  organizations. Presently a government commission is being set up  to improve tax legislation, which will be made up of  representatives of federal authorities, economic institutes, and  "prominent economic managers."    Oleg Soskovets expects to receive long-term loans for social  projects from the World Bank. In his words, "Western assistance  is necessary if reform is to succeed in a swifter and less  painful fashion."</p>

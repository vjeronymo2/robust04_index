			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Sport: Life as a heavy hitter - American Football / Patrick Harverson meets Ronnie Lott, master of the kamikaze tackle ON AN overcast, humid day, a squad of American football players strolls off the New York Jets' practice field after the whistle sounds to end the morning session. In a distant corner, a lone figure stays behind. For the next 10 minutes, he charges a tackling dummy. Knees bent, body low to the ground, he hits the padded dummy at full speed. Each time, he drives the dummy back a few yards before wrestling it to the ground. When he finishes, uniform soaked in sweat and helmet pushed high up on the top of his head, he walks back to the locker room, stopping to sign autographs for a small crowd of children. Showered and rested, Ronnie Lott, the Jets' star defender, sits down happily for a chat in a cramped office behind the practice facility. The extra workout on the tackling dummy was typical of Lott. 'I think it's important to spend a little extra time practising,' he says. 'It makes you more confident.' Lott is 34 and in his 13th season in the National Football League, yet he displays the enthusiasm of a player fresh from college. In the 1980s, he anchored the defence of the San Francisco 49ers. He helped the team to win four Super Bowl in nine years. In 1991, he left San Francisco for a brief stint with the Los Angeles Raiders before signing this year with the Jets, who have won two of their first three games and are tipped to make the playoffs. Most NFL players are fortunate if they last four years. For a defensive player who hurls his body into opponents, Lott's longevity is miraculous. It has surprised even Lott himself. 'When I started, I expected to play about eight years.' He says fitness, extra training and a mix of conventional medical treatments and unconventional healing techniques have allowed him to survive for so long. A lot of it, he says, is about adopting a positive attitude: 'It's amazing how strong your mind can be in helping your body heal.' Lott is a 'safety'. He roams behind the defensive lines bringing down runners or intercepting passes. 'You're the last line of defence, the guy that tries to make sure everything stays in front of you.' The safety must be a leader and possess a good footballing brain. 'You spend a lot of time directing people and coordinating positions. If someone blows an assignment, you have to cover up for them. You have to understand everything that's going on in the game. Your job is to make sure you give your team one more chance to line up.' Lott's tackling is legendary. Even if you rarely watch American football, you have probably seen him on one of the highlight videos that show the sport's brutal collisions, hitting opponents with bone-jarring tackles. The secret to good tackling, or 'hitting', is catching the target off-guard, he says. 'Some of the best hits you see are when a player is running, and all of a sudden he doesn't see the other player, and BOOM, the guy whacks him, catching him off balance. You have to be able to hit him before he's ready for you.' Lott talks about his art with little emotion, just a cool description of how to create mayhem. 'When you go to hit somebody, it's like you have blinkers on - you cannot see anything but the target. As soon as you hit the target you release your energy . . . you need that to make sure they go down.' What is it like to bring down a charging 250-pound running back? 'Sometimes it hurts, sometimes it doesn't. It's like if you're a baseball player, and when you hit a pitch at the end of the bat and your hands start to ring . . . that's because you didn't hit it at the right spot - the sweet spot. A lot of the time it's the same thing in football. If you do not hit them in the right spot, you ring a little. Yet, sometimes you hit a guy and you get right up as if nothing happened.' That, he says, is when you know you have hit the sweet spot. Lott says he never intends to put an opponent out of the game. 'I don't want to ever hurt someone deliberately. But I want that guy to know that I've given him everything that I have. If I'm out there to hurt them, they are not going to respect me.' Lott is famous for the burning glare he turns on opponents during games. He admits he can be intimidating. 'I don't try and intimidate people with the way I look, that's just part of who I am. I walk out on the street and people go: 'Why don't you smile? What's wrong with you?' And I say: 'That's just me.' Some days it frightens people. 'To a certain extent, I do enjoy violence. Violence is not necessarily destructive. Violence can be constructive. Everybody has a little violence in them. Some people use it the wrong way, some people use it a positive way.' Although he has suffered countless concussions, Lott is still in one piece. Well, almost. In 1986, he chose to have the tip of a mangled finger amputated rather than miss part of the season recovering from the surgery needed to save it. Lott views the threat of serious injury as an unavoidable part of the sport. 'You've got to have that Chuck Yeager attitude - the Right Stuff - to play this game. You can't be defeated by the fear gods. They're there, always tapping you on your shoulder, but you have to somehow block them out of your mind. 'The game is a lot tougher than fans think. If someone thinks they can play football, throw a ball up into the air for them, and just before it hits their hands, grab a baseball bat and hit that guy on the back of his head. If he can hold on to the ball, then he can play.' In this game, Lott is always the one with the bat.</p>

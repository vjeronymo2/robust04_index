			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast; broadcast in progress]    [Text] ...the Investment Fund of Venezuela [FIV] and former  Bank of Venezuela President Carlos Bernardez Losada was  appointed to the post. Observers believe President Caldera's  decision to remove FIV President Abdon Vivas Teran was prompted  by the way he handled Aeropostal's privatization, which was  considered a failure because the bid was declared invalid.    It is also said the decision was prompted by the rejection  of  Air Force Commander General Otto Garcia Rivara, who reportedly  objected to the fact that one of the enterprises participating  in the bid was a Colombian airline. He believes Aeropostal is a  strategic Venezuelan company, and one must take into account the  border problems we have with our neighbor.    OCI [Central Information Office] chief Guillermo Alvarez  explained that Abdon Vivas Teran will remain in the government  even though he has left the FIV. This means he will possibly be  appointed to another post in the ministerial cabinet.    [Begin recording] [Alvarez] I cannot report new changes.  These are the ones the president authorized us to announce today.    [Briceno] Does this mean Mr. Abdon Vivas Teran is now out of  the government?    [Alvarez] He is obviously out of the post he held. This does  not mean he is out of the government. [end recording]    Alvarez announced Alberto Poletto will still be in charge of  the Foreign Trade Institute [ICE]. This situation might  propitiate a merger of the ICE and the Development Ministry,  which would become the industry and commerce ministry.    Ciro Zaa Alvarez has been appointed to the MTC [Ministry of  Transportation and Communications]. Zaa was formerly in charge  of the Urban Development Ministry and Francisco Gonzalez,  current president of the Urban Development Fund, was temporarily  appointed to the post. President Caldera's plans include the  unification of these infrastructure ministries.    Luis Carlos Palacios has been appointed to the Central  Office  of Coordination and Planning, replacing Enzo del Bufalo, who  tendered his official resignation to the head of state. Another  appointment made by President Caldera was that of Alfredo  Gruber, current president of Palmaven in the Venezuelan  Petroleum Corporation who will be in charge of the Venezuelan  Corporation of Guayana.    To conclude, Pompeyo Marquez has been given responsibility  for coordinating the government's social programs. The new  ministers will be sworn in by President Caldera on Monday [30  May] at Miraflores Palace.</p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: New York Reason may argue that the rise in US bond yields has already more than discounted the possibility of another increase in interest rates, but sentiment continues to dictate otherwise. Last week the Treasury 30-year bond yield rose to 6.98 per cent as the market ran scared again, this time on political uncertainties caused by the investigation into the Whitewater land deal. This week, the market is probably in a mood for consolidation. But it is unlikely to get it. It faces what Salomon Brothers describes as the statistical equivalent of a daylight bombing run as three key price reports are published on three consecutive days. The raid starts on Tuesday with the publication of the producer price index for February. Salomon predicts the index will rise by 0.5 per cent, the largest monthly gain since last April - though excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, it believes the increase could be a more palatable 0.3 per cent. Wednesday sees the publication of the consumer price index, with analysts predicting an acceleration from January's 0.1 per cent to 0.3 or 0.4 per cent for February. Then, on Thursday, the Philadelphia Business Outlook Survey could scare the market if, as expected, it shows an increase in the proportion of manufacturers expecting input and output prices to rise.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by special correspondent Li Lun (2621 0243): </F> "Refuting Lies With Facts, Promoting Cooperation With Sincerity"]    [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Recently  some people in the Taiwan "Mainland Affairs Committee" and  Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] have unreasonably accused the  mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait  [ARATS] of not maintaining smooth communications with SEF in  handling the "Qiandaohu case." They also have attacked ARATS as  an "obstacle" to cross-strait relations because it did not allow  the SEF to send personnel to accompany the Taiwan victims'  family members to the site of the incident. The material  published by ARATS today clarifies the truth by presenting a  host of facts, thus fully and effectively refuting these  people's wanton distortions and wicked slanders.    As everyone knows, respecting and earnestly implementing  agreements reached between ARATS and the SEF is a precondition  and important basis for establishing mutual trust and  cooperation between these two organizations. In terms of the  two organizations' relations and cooperation, strict observance  and loyal implementation of the relevant agreements involve two  mutually related aspects: One is that both sides must do what  must be done according to the provisions of the relevant  agreements; the other is that neither side should overstep,  under any pretext, the provisions of the agreements or make  arbitrary demands that embarrass the other side. In handling  the aftermath of the "Qiandaohu incident," ARATS strictly abided  by the relevant agreements, did a lot of work, and kept the  communications lines open. This reporter learned that at the  talks between Wang Daohan [ARATS chairman] and Koo Cheng-fu [SEF  board chairman] last year, they discussed how to handle the  problem of one side's personnel proceeding to the site of an  incident on the other side in case of emergency. As an incident  must be handled by the side on which it breaks out, no agreement  was reached at the talks on how one side should authorize a  delegation to proceed to the site of the incident. The SEF's  request to send personnel to accompany the victims' family  members to the site of the "Qiandaohu incident" obviously went  beyond the agreements between the two sides, so it is  understandable that ARATS did not agree with the request. What  is noteworthy is that some people in Taiwan made requests  contrary to the agreements, purposely damaged the solemnness of  the agreements, and took advantage of the incident to exaggerate  other issues. This constituted disrespect for the agreements  reached by ARATS and the SEF, and was aimed at instigating some  people who were not clear about the truth to oppose the mainland  and viciously attack ARATS. This fully portrayed their rudeness  and recklessness, and the fact that they had ulterior motives.  Compatriots on both sides of the strait must take precautions  against this.    ARATS and the SEF are authorized mass organizations that  undertake the heavy responsibility of promoting exchanges  between the two sides. Compatriots on both sides strongly hope  that the two organizations can sincerely cooperate in promoting  the two sides' relations. Some people's vicious attacks on  ARATS are not in the least advantageous to the two  organizations' cooperation, but will only cause serious harm to  this cooperation and to relations between the two sides of the  strait. Whether or not facts are honestly respected and the two  organizations' agreements are strictly observed are important  points determining whether cooperation can be smoothly carried  out between the two organizations. If some people in Taiwan  still regard the agreements as trifling matters and take  advantage of contingencies to force others to implement their  unilateral ideas, this will ruin the two organizations' mutual  trust and cooperation, instead of achieving good results. We  will wait and see whether these people will continue to create  obstacles to the two organizations' cooperation or will  cooperate with the mainland and do something practical for the  two sides' exchanges.</p>

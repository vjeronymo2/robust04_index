			<p>BFN     [Text] A knowledgeable aide to Azeri President Heydar  Aliyev said there were neither Russian troops nor Russian  military facilities in Azerbaijan, so there was no reason for  Baku to respond to President Yeltsin's order for the creation of  Russian army bases in Commonwealth republics.    According to the source, discussion continued of issues  related to the use of the Gabalinskaya radar station still  manned by Russians. Discussion focused on the possible lease of  the radar station in northern Azerbaijan to the Russian  military. The source stressed that the Gabalinskaya radar  station was not an army base but a military facility.</p>

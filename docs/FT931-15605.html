			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Observer: History lesson It's a depressing lesson of history that no matter how much governments say they are in favour of greater openness, they instinctively try to stifle legislation designed to achieve it. Take Harold Macmillan's Conservative administration. Barely a year after being elected in 1959 with a manifesto promising more openness, the government sabotaged a private member's bill to open local authority meetings to the press. The revelations, published today by the tireless Campaign for Freedom of Information, gain piquancy from the identity of the backbencher who was forced to accept a watered-down bill . . . Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the newly elected MP for Finchley.</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Retreat on council shake-ups set to embarrass ministers The Local Government Commission will later this week reverse recommendations to abolish six county councils, according to local authorities which have worked with the commission. The move would be embarrassing for the government, which has asked the commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, to recommend single-tier unitary authorities to replace the existing two-tier counties and districts. However, the commission now seems certain to recommend maintaining the status quo in Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cumbria, Kent, Lancashire and Oxfordshire, having originally recommended unitary authorities in all of them. In Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire it is likely to favour creating three and four unitary authorities respectively, while in Hampshire it will recommend making Portsmouth and Southampton unitary cities, and giving an independent authority to the New Forest. The two-tier system seems likely to continue in the rest of the county. In all cases this would involve altering the first preference originally published by the commission when it announced provisional recommendations in June. Sir John has repeatedly said that the commission would not recommend change without 'overwhelming' evidence of local support. These proposals would all follow the majority preferences shown by a survey of public opinion in the nine counties. The cross-party Association of District Councils, which has lobbied for unitary authorities, criticised the survey, saying it had been 'corrupted' by aggressive publicity campaigns mounted by county councils, which generally support the two-tier status quo. In Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, where the most popular option was to create more unitaries than first recommended, the commission has also changed its proposals. The commission has postponed announcements on Berkshire and Leicestershire, on which it also published provisional proposals in June. It appears unable to agree on how many unitaries to create in Berkshire, while in Leicestershire there is controversy over whether Rutland should be recreated as a unitary county. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, cannot create a new unitary authority unless it has first been recommended by the commission. He has asked it to reconsider recommendations for three counties so far, but the commission has refused to change them on all occasions and it seems unlikely to do so in future. Formal announcements will be made on Wednesday.</p>

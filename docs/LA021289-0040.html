			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> O'SULLIVAN HOPES TO ADD TO REPUTATION IN TIMES MEET  </P> <P> When Eamonn Coghlan, world record-holder in the mile, decided to retire, fellow  Irishman Marcus O'Sullivan quickly took over as "Chairman of the Boards."  </P> <P> The 27-year-old O'Sullivan has been virtually unbeatable the past two years and  in 1988 ran the fastest 1500 meters ever indoors, 3:35.4 at East Rutherford. He  also ran the third-fastest mile in history, 3:50.94, a figure basted only by  Coghlan.  </P> <P> Friday night at the Forum in the Times/Eagle Indoor Games, O'Sullivan will be  running the mile against two other Irishmen, Frank O'Mara and Ray Flynn, Jose  Abascal of Spain, Nourdine Morcelli, Algeria (Riverside City College), and the  lone American, Jeff Atkinson, winner of last year's Olympic Trials.  </P> <P> O'Sullivan -- as expected -- won the mile here last year and then went on to  wrap up another superb season by winning the USA/Mobil Indoor Mile title in  3:59.85.  </P> <P> At Seoul in 1988, he finished eighth in the 1500 meters in 3:38.39. That race  was missing Morocco's Said Aouita, the world record-holder at that distance,  who had a leg injury.  </P> <P> After winning his first two races ever run indoors on the boards last weekend  on the East coast, Aouita indicated he might like to try the mile at the Forum.  </P> <P> "When O'Sullivan runs by himself, that's one story," Aouita said. "When he runs  with Aouita, that's another story."  </P> <P> Can O'Sullivan beat Aouita should the Moroccoan(sp?) opt for the mile rather  than the scheduled 3000 meters?  </P> <P> "It's dangerous to predict what a race is going to be like because what happens  is you're not ready for the unexpected," O'Sullivan says.  </P> <P> "You ride it along and wait for the cards to unfold and everyone, sooner or  later, will show their cards. It could be some guy in the field saying, 'The  hell with you. I'm going from the beginning. You either come with me or you  don't come.'  </P> <P> "It's almost like a game of poker."  </P> <P> A possible O'Sullivan-Aouita confrontation will depend on Aouita, says meet  director Will Kern. "He can run any distance he wants."  </P> <P> If Auoita decides on the 3000 meters he will face Steve Scott, who set the  Times record at the distance last year at 7:57.78; a pair of U.S. Olympians  Doug Padilla and Brian Abshire, Mark Junkerman and countryman Aziz Sahar.  </P></p>

Speaking  upon his return from Brussels this evening, Mikhailidhis  described as very significant, the statement of Hans Van Den  Broek, EU commissioner on foreign affairs, that Cyprus should  not be a hostage to never-ending negotiations on accession into  the European Union, and that whatever the result of the  proximity talks, Cyprus should not be obstructed from its  direction toward Europe.

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICROWAVE . . .: TRY FLASH-FROZEN VEGETABLES THAT STEAM IN THEIR OWN SAVORY  VAPOR  </P> <P> Thanks to the microwave oven, frozen vegetables may stage a comeback. They're  quick to prepare, versatile and available year round. Better yet, they often  taste fresher than vegetables that have lolled about supermarket bins.  </P> <P> And why shouldn't frozen vegetables taste just-picked? Most were flash-frozen  before the dew had a chance to dry. Frozen vegetables, moreover, rarely require  additional liquid when microwaved. They steam in their own savory vapor so that  their natural flavors are intensified.  </P> <P> Often a solidly frozen vegetable block can be popped into a casserole,  sprinkled with herbs or spices, covered, then thawed and cooked in a single,  quick operation. And there's no need to worry about vegetables scorching or  sticking to the pot.  </P> <P> What this means is that you're free to tend to other meal prep jobs while the  vegetable microwaves out of the way, needing, for the most part, nothing more  than an occasional stir or turn.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reduce Recommended Time  </P> <P> Almost all frozen vegetables now include microwaving instructions on the  package. For crisper vegetables with fresher flavor, however, we like to reduce  the prescribed time by 30 seconds.  </P> <P> And a final word of advice: never microwave frozen vegetables in their paper  carton, they'll taste terrible and be messy and dangerous to remove from the  carton. It's far better and simpler to microwave them in a casserole that can  be removed to the table.  </P> <P> Here, then, are some of our favorite ways to jazz up frozen vegetables. Most  are ready to serve in less than 10 minutes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CORN WITH SWEET RED PEPPER AND MUSTARD  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon whipping cream  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  </P> <P> 1 (10-ounce) package frozen whole-kernel corn  </P> <P> 1/2 cup diced sweet red pepper  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon butter or margarine  </P> <P> 4 small sprigs fresh rosemary or 1/4 teaspoon dried  </P> <P> Combine whipping cream, Dijon mustard and pepper in 1-quart casserole. Sprinkle  corn into casserole, top with red pepper, then butter. Tuck rosemary sprigs  into mixture (or sprinkle with dried rosemary), cover with lid or vented  plastic wrap and microwave according to corn package directions.

Makes 3 to 4 servings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GREEN PEAS WITH ROSEMARY AND ORANGE  </P> <P> 2 cups frozen green peas  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon whipping cream  </P> <P> 4 (2x1/2-inch) strips orange peel  </P> <P> 4 sprigs fresh rosemary or 1/4 teaspoon dried  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Spread green peas in 1-quart casserole, dot with butter and drizzle with  whipping cream. Tuck orange peel and rosemary into mixture (or sprinkle with  dried rosemary). Cover and microwave according to pea package directions.  Remove orange peel and rosemary sprigs and season to taste with salt and  pepper. Makes 2 to 3 servings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BEANS WITH OIL AND VINEGAR  </P> <P> 1 (10-ounce) package frozen green, wax or Italian beans  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, minced  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons olive oil  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon tarragon vinegar  </P> <P> Combine beans, garlic and olive oil in casserole.

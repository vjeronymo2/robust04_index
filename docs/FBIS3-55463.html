The Azerbaijani forces, backed by armoured vehicles, were  heading toward Mardekert in northern Nagorno-Karabakh and toward  Askeran in the east, some 30 kilometres (18 miles) from the  capital Stepanakert, the army headquarters said.    Heavy fighting was also continuing around Agdam, a strategic  Azerbaijani town two kilometres east of the Nagorno-Karabakh  border, which was captured by Armenian separatists six months  ago.    The Stepanakert headquarters confirmed that Goradiz, a key  town near the Iranian-Azerbaijani border, had been recaptured by  the Azerbaijani Army.    But it denied Baku's claim Saturday that Azerbaijan  controlled the road linking Goradiz and Fizuli, on the southern  border of Nagorno-Karabakh.    The Armenian separatists had "succeeded in halting the  Azerbaijani offensive" in that area, the headquarters said.</p>

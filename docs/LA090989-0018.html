			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL FANS MOURN LOSS OF COMMISSIONER WITH GENUINE SORROW  </P> <P> It was questioned, "How could a non-baseball man lead our game into the 1990s?"  Maybe Bart Giamatti could lead it because he viewed the game as I, my father  and you do, with love and enthusiasm.  </P> <P> With his death I feel a great loss, for he was not only the leader of my  beloved game, but he was a fellow fan.  </P> <P> MARK LOPEZ, Lynwood  </P></p>

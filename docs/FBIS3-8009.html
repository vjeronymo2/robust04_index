			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Bratinka by </F> Kristian Chalupa in Brno on 26 February: "The Middle East Peace  Process Has Not Ended"]    [Text] Pavel Bratinka, Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA]  deputy chairman and deputy foreign minister, took part in the  meeting of the ODA Central Assembly in Brno on Saturday [26  February]. We took the opportunity to ask him for a brief  interview.    [Chalupa] Ivan Mjartan, Slovak ambassador to the Czech  Republic, described, in an interview for our newspaper,  Czech-Slovak relations as being very favorable. Do you identify  with this view?    [Bratinka] Of course, relations between the Czech and Slovak  Republics are good, but they could be better. After all, the  economies of the two states are more dependent on each other  and, for this reason, there should be as few problems as  possible in mutual trade. It is obvious that there will be  certain problems; we have to work to get rid of them.    [Chalupa] Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia Central  Committee Chairman Grebenicek declared at a recent news  conference that pressure from various groups abroad is behind  the various approaches in the government coalition to resolving  the Bosnian crisis....    [Bratinka] If someone were to say that different states have  different interests, it would be the truth--the banal truth.  However, I steadfastly reject any suggestion that a struggle  among various foreign power-wielding groups is taking place in  the government.    [Chalupa] Your ministry is preparing a draft government  decree that should make it easier for individual compatriots to  resettle in the Czech Republic. This decree should also concern  the Kazakh Czechs. When will this matter be discussed in the  government?    [Bratinka] This decree is being prepared by the Interior  Ministry, and we should merely add our comments. I cannot tell  you at the moment when this will come onto the government's  agenda; this is within the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister's  Office and the prime minister himself. The question is whether  these people should be given, without bureaucratic holdups,  permanent residency permits, at least for the first phase. The  Foreign Ministry is monitoring the situation in Kazakhstan; we  can add our points of view. If people are to be resettled,  then, of course, our diplomats and our representative offices  will be very active in this matter.    [Chalupa] What do you think of the chances for the recently  initiated Middle East peace process following the bloody  massacre in Hebron?    [Bratinka] The peace process was initiated because logic was  moving in this direction. Although it will be slowed down or in  a way impaired, the overall headway and the overall direction  and aim will be maintained. This is a matter of reason, a  matter that, the longer it is postponed, the greater the risk of  such murderous behavior on both sides. This massacre highlights  the need for a definitive solution. I do not think that the  Middle East peace process has ended.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN  </P> <P> Dees' Wanna-Bes  </P> <P> Two businessmen in New York City watch ABC's "Into the Night Starring Rick  Dees" just for the fashion show. Then they call up Beverly Hills retailer Sami  Dinar, who outfits Dees for the show, two, sometimes even three times a week to  order the same Canali suits and Marienbad ties they see on the tube.  </P> <P> The men are notorious for their allegiance to Dees' style, which made Christmas  shopping for them easy. Last week, friends and relatives called Dinar to order  presents for the guys.  </P> <P> TUX DELUXE: Been searching for an affordable version of those ruffled,  Edwardian-style tuxedo shirts Prince wore in his Purple Rain videos? Listen  just uncovered a stash of them, for the less-than-princely sum of $2 each, at  Top Hat on South Broadway, downtown. There are men's and boy's sizes, with  ruffles trimmed in blue, burgundy, green, yellow, fuchsia and, yes, even  purple.  </P> <P> DOUBLING THE PLEASURE: Carrie Fisher and Bridget Fonda are from the one-for-me  and one-for-you school of shopping. They were spotted in Prada, a Beverly Hills  boutique, where Fisher bought a handbag for her mom, Debbie Reynolds, as well  as one for herself. Fonda shopped for her dad, Peter, picking out a black  travel bag; she also bought a black cashmere shawl.  </P> <P> CAMEO ROLE: While some guests were sampling the food at Diaghilev in the Bel  Age hotel, others were staring at an elegant man in a pin-striped suit. Was it  actor Raul Julia? It was, looking taller, thinner and more debonair than he did  in "Havana."  </P></p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Billam rises to Pounds 271,000 Despite difficult trading conditions, reflecting weak home demand and sustained but fragile export growth, J Billam, the specialist engineer, raised pre-tax profits by 13 per cent from Pounds 239,000 to Pounds 271,000 for the first half of 1993. Turnover increased 12 per cent to Pounds 3.46m, but with prices under pressure, growth in operating profits was restricted to 5 per cent at Pounds 286,000. Earnings per share were up 15 per cent at 11.4p (9.9p) and an interim dividend up from 1.9p to 2.2p has been declared.</p>

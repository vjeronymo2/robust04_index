			<p>BFN     [Text] The Attorney General's Office authorized special  provincial prosecutors for drug cases in Pucallpa, to  participate in the joint antinarcotics operations carried out  throughout the country.    For this purpose, the prosecutors must coordinate their  participation with the Armed Forces joint command, the Peruvian  National Police Antinarcotics Division, the DEA, and the U.S.  Embassy antinarcotics department.    If special prosecutors Juan Malca Perez, Roberto Pesantes  Creder, Luis Valdivia Susunaga, and Jorge Requifo Rojas find  evidence of crimes, they must inform the provincial prosecutor  of the respective jurisdiction so he can adopt the measures  established by law.</p>

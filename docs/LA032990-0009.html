			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTHROP  </P> <P> Les Daly, a spokesman for the Northrop Corp., responded (letter, March 15) to  an article by Richard Reeves (Op-Ed Page, March 2) about the recent conviction  of Northrop for fraud on two of our nation's critical weapons systems: the  nuclear air launched cruise missile, and the U.S. Navy Harrier jet. Daly's  letter contains several misstatements of fact and seeks to perpetuate  Northrop's attempt to minimize its guilty conduct.  </P> <P> The letter nowhere mentions the two most significant facts of Northrop's  conviction. First, this was the first time that a defense contractor has been  convicted for failing to conduct critical tests, and covering up that failure,  on a nuclear weapons system. Second, the $17-million criminal fine paid by  Northrop is by far the largest ever imposed on a defense contractor and  reflects the seriousness of Northrop's criminal conduct.  </P> <P> Daly's statement that "three or four" people failed to perform tests overlooks  the fact that it was Northrop which was responsible for the tests, failed to do  the tests, and then covered up these failures. Moreover, the Northrop employees  involved in the cheating included the general manager of a Northrop factory  (who was convicted of eight felony counts of fraud and false statements) and  the chief engineer of the same factory (who was convicted of three similar  felony counts). Finally, there were at least five test technicians and  supervisors who falsified test results at the direction of the general manager  and chief engineer.  </P> <P> Daly is also incorrect when he implies that there was a full disclosure by  Northrop of the cheating on the missile and jet programs. To the contrary,  Northrop sought from the beginning to suggest that cheating had occurred on  only about two dozen components for the cruise missile. Northrop also sought to  minimize its guilt as to the false testing on the jet. However, Northrop was  indicted in 1989 by a federal grand jury for cheating, and covering up, on  stabilization systems which went into more than 600 cruise missiles and more  than 100 jets. Ultimately, Northrop was convicted of cheating on testing of  components for more than 110 missiles and jets.  </P> <P> We must also take exception to Northrop's claim that it "accepted  responsibility for the unauthorized and unacceptable acts of three or four of  its employees even though they had acted on their own." In fact, there was no  evidence introduced in any court hearing that the convicted employees were  acting on their own. Instead, the general manager and chief engineer of  Northrop's factory acted to benefit and did benefit Northrop Corp. The value of  Northrop's contracts on the missile and jet programs was in the millions of  dollars.  </P> <P> It seems to us that the public interest would be better served by Northrop and  other convicted defense contractors if they would step up to their  responsibilities when convicted of serious criminal conduct instead of  attempting to minimize their culpability by a distortion of the facts.  </P> <P> WILLIAM F.

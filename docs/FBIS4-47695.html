			<p>BFN     [Text] Port Elizabeth April 30 SAPA -- Thirty-one ballot  boxes from KwaZakhele township in Port Elizabeth were isolated  pending further examination by police on Saturday [30 April] on  suspicion of electoral fraud. No finality on the charge of  tampering has materialised. Both the police and the Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] have urgently requested the  attorney-general [AG] to travel from the judicial capital of  Grahamstown to Port Elizabeth to make a ruling.    The ballots from these boxes will not be counted until the  attorney-general reaches a decision, even though provisions for  counting are contained in the Electoral Act.    Police liaison officer Col Chris Maritz claimed this week  IEC  officials had broken the seals off "several" ballot boxes and  were scrutinising the ballots.    The IEC has repeatedly denied the allegation, though its  officials have remained reluctant to comment until their own  investigations were complete. A statement on the progress of the  inquiry is expected to be released within the hour.    The National Party's [NP] premier candidate in the Eastern  Cape, Dr Tertius Delport, formally requested the IEC on Saturday  night to declare the ballots contained in the 31 boxes null and  void. Dr Delport said the NP regarded the KwaZakhele votes as  invalid.    African Christian Democratic Party regional elections head  Ross Bradder said his party would abide by the AG's decision.    A declaration of the votes as null as void would not  necessarily be in the interests of a free or fair election,  however. "For the people who voted in good faith, their voice to  the nation is being ignored in that case.    "It is unfortunate that this has occurred because we believe  the election in the Eastern Cape has generally been run in a  peaceful and correct way."    Ballots from a second Port Elizabeth suburb may be suspect,  Mr Bradder announced later.    One ballot box from the Bethelsdorp area was separated from  counting on saturday when officials at the central counting  station noted it might have been resealed.    A discrepancy in serial numbers was spotted, said Mr  Bradder.    IEC comment was not immediately available.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Equitable to inject Dollars 800m into life insurance arm - Deal values Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette at Dollars 1.3bn Equitable, the US insurer, plans to inject Dollars 800m into its US life insurance company before the end of the year in a deal which values its broking arm, Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette (DLJ), at Dollars 1.3bn. The transaction is part of a move by Equitable to boost the capital of Equitable Life Assurance Society of the US before the year-end, when risk-based capital rules will come into force for the first time for all US insurers. Equitable said it will buy 61 per cent of DLJ from its life insurance subsidiary with the proceeds from a new Dollars 304m debt issue launched yesterday, together with around Dollars 500m of cash and other liquid assets. The Dollars 1.3bn valuation of DLJ implied by the deal, which Equitable said had been arrived at through an independent valuation, is slightly ahead of most market estimates, which had put the broker's worth at around Dollars 1bn. The transaction will allow the life assurance company to revalue its remaining 39 per cent holding, boosting its capital position. The deal will remove a large part of the DLJ equity holding from the life company's balance sheet, which would otherwise have attracted a high capital charge under the new regulatory rules, according to Ms Shelley Harris, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency. She added, though, that the DLJ valuation was already factored into the company's A-plus rating for claims-paying ability, and the deal made little difference to the life company's efforts to regain a double-A rating. Equitable had said in May it planned to put a value on DLJ, the institutional broking firm which it bought for Dollars 430m cash in 1984. The move to revalue the subsidiary in this way, rather than partially float it, does not alter Equitable's intention to take the broker public, though the urgency to do so is reduced. The brokers' founders include Mr Richard Jenrette, now chairman of Equitable, and former New York Stock Exchange chairman Mr William Donaldson. The group's US life insurance company, which has been suffering from the effects of 1980s investments in real estate and junk bonds, had capital of Dollars 2.46bn at the end of September under statutory accounting rules. Equitable would not say to what extent the subsidiary's capital base would be improved by the deal. The Dollars 304m of debt issue yesterday will be loaned to a special trust, which will use the money to buy preferred stock in Equitable convertible into ordinary shares after July 22 1994.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / IIF chief to join German bank council MR Horst Schulmann, a former senior economic adviser to Mr Helmut Schmidt, former German Chancellor, and a central figure in the creation of the European Monetary System, is to return to Germany to join the Bundesbank's policy-making council. Mr Schulmann, 59, managing director of the Institute for International Finance in Washington, will bring to the Bundesbank an exceptional blend of domestic and international monetary expertise. He has been nominated by the regional government of Hesse as successor to Mr Karl Thomas as president of the local state central bank, who sits on the Bundesbank council along with Germany's other state central bank chiefs. Mr Thomas died this month at the age of 63 after serving just 2 1/2 years of an eight-year term. The appointment, still to be ratified by the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German parliament, may add to the central bank's credibility at a time of controversy over its restrictive monetary policy. His influence is likely to prove a counterweight to the mainly domestically-orientated policy views of other members of the Bundesbank council. Mr Schulmann was Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's personal representative for economic summits between 1978 and 1982, and in 1980 he was appointed state secretary at the finance ministry. He spent four years as a senior executive at the World Bank in the early 1970s. He joined the Institute for International Finance as deputy managing director in March 1984, taking over as managing director in January 1987. The IIF is an agency set by international commercial banks to monitor Third World debt. As 'sherpa' to Mr Schmidt, he helped prepare the ground for a succession of western economic summit conferences from 1978-82. He also helped usher in the EMS in 1978. He accompanied Mr Schmidt at a historic meeting with the Bundesbank council in November 1978 at which Mr Schmidt tried to overcome Bundesbank hostility to the setting up of the EMS. The state central bank in Hesse has important responsibilities for regulation of Frankfurt's financial services sector, Germany's largest. He seems likely to pursue measures designed to strengthten Frankfurt as a financial services centre.</p>

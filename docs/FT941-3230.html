			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Crossed Lamont stops ex-chequer Healey Never again will Lord Healey's finger be extended for a sympathetic shop assistant to hang a wrapped CD from it. No longer will the former chancellor walk out of a record shop and flinch at the sight of a Thresher's off-licence. A campaign of television commercials for debit cards starring the Labour elder statesman has been scrapped by The Independent Television Commission after it received a complaint from Mr Norman Lamont, a former Conservative chancellor. The commercials illustrate making purchases without cheques and are accompanied by billboard posters describing Lord Healey as an 'ex-chequer'. On television, he buys a CD, potters into the street and confronts the Thresher's sign. The voiceover says that the Visa Delta debit card is so simple that even chancellors of the exchequer can understand it. Newspaper reports last year alleged that Mr Lamont had bought wine and cigarettes at a particular branch of the Thresher's off-licence chain with his credit card. Mr Lamont is not referred to in the Healey commercial, but the commission said: 'He clearly believed (the advertisement) referred to him, and other people agreed with him.' Asked about the advertisement at Westminster yesterday, Mr Lamont said: 'The whole Thresher incident was a lie and a fabrication of certain newspapers. I do not see why a lie should be perpetuated in an advertisement.' The ITC said it upheld Mr Lamont's complaint because the advertisement breached its rules on privacy. Under the ITC's code permission has to be sought from individuals portrayed. Visa International said yesterday the advertising campaign had been 'highly successful in improving cardholder understanding of Visa Delta' and was only intended to run until yesterday.</p>

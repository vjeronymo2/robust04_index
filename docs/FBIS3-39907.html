In Russia and the other successor  states to the Soviet Union, however, there is no hope for an  early stabilization. This is the content of the most recent  economic report by the Vienna Institute for International  Economic Comparison (WIIW). Concerning the East European reform  countries, the institute revised its forecast slightly upward  for this year.    Whereas Poland was the only country with a positive growth  rate last year, the WIIW experts expect the decline of economic  activities to continue only in Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania.  Particularly since the second half of 1993, there has been a  noticeable production increase in the reform countries, Gabor  Hunya, the author of the study, stated.    Growth is primarily sustained by domestic demand. The export  situation is very difficult at the moment. "Whereas imports  into the reform countries rose by 18 percent in the first three  quarters of 1993, exports dropped by 1 percent," Hunya pointed  out. "This is in line with Western interests." Only the Czech  Republic was able to increase its exports because, as a result  of the devaluation of the koruna at the beginning of the  reforms, is still enjoys big cost advantages.    However, the production increase has not yet had an impact  on  the employment situation. Unemployment rates are still rising  in these countries. The WIIW expects rates between 7 percent  for the Czech Republic and 18 percent in Slovenia and Slovakia.    In Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, the development was  characterized by a major production decline and hyperinflation  -- which stands at 1,000 percent per year in Russia -- in 1993.  A reversal of the trend is not yet in sight, the Russia expert  Peter Havlik pointed out. The political and social chaos  prevents a stabilization. These economies are particularly  affected by the collapse of trade among the CIS states after the  dissolution of the ruble zone last autumn.    Despite the unfavorable election results for the camp of  reformers, Havlik does not see a danger for Moscow's reform  course. Even in the past it was not possible to implement  radical reforms. Since the middle of 1992, a reorientation aimed  at financial stabilization to support production has been  observed. The current government in Moscow may even turn out to  be more efficient because it is homogeneous, he stated.</p>

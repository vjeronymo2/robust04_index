It is  said that the United States has a special foundation for  cooperation with different countries in this field.    Latvian Minister of Foreign Affairs George Andrejevs and  Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis took part in the meeting,  where the NATO cooperation program "Partnership for Peace" was  also discussed. G. Andrejevs confirmed Latvia's readiness to  participate in this program; there is already a group of  specialists prepared to begin work on this program. U.S.  representatives have expressed the view that the "Partnership  for Peace" program might stimulate mutual cooperation among the  Baltic States in the field of security, and have advised Latvia  to participate in joint military maneuvers in 1994 in the  framework of this program.    Both Latvian ministers acquainted their guests with the main  points of the Latvian security concept. A. Andrejevs expressed  anxiety concerning Latvia's security during the Skrunda radar  station activities, which could cause various misunderstandings  and incidents. The U.S. side responded that in the event of  danger Latvia can consult NATO, taking advantage of "Partnership  for Peace." The head of the U.S. delegation explained that  America understands Latvia's anxiety in regard to its safety,  and therefore contacts for mutual cooperation are being  established. In addition, the United States is interested in  long term cooperation with Latvia.    V. Pavlovskis spoke about financial problems in the defense  forces. The U.S. delegation said that limited financial support  can also be expected from NATO. This organization could, in the  future, support the Latvian mission and cover expenses of joint  military maneuvers.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>   [Text] A communique just released by the Foreign Relations  Ministry reports that today six people identified as members of  the Nicaraguan resistance peacefully seized control of the  Colombian Embassy in Managua. We repeat, six people identified  as Nicaraguan resistance members have decided to peacefully take  control of the Colombian Embassy in Managua. We have just  spoken to a Colombian official at the embassy in Managua.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Are there any  problems? Are they armed?    [Unidentified embassy official] No, none whatsover.    [Reporter] Neither you nor any of the other Colombian  officials are in any danger?    [Official] No sir.    [Reporter] You are all unharmed at this time?    [Official] Yes, we are all unharmed. Everything is under  control.    [Reporter] Are all of these people adults?    [Official] Yes.    [Reporter] Are they Sandinists or contras?    [Official] Well, at this time I cannot say. I am really not  that familiar with the situation.    [Reporter] What are they demanding? Political asylum?    [Official] We are not sure yet, because that is what they  are  discussing in the meeting, and I do not know what arrangements  they are discussing.    [Reporter] Is there any likelyhood that they will be granted  political asylum or that they will leave the embassy grounds  tonight?    [Official] Yes, I believe there is. [end recording]</p>

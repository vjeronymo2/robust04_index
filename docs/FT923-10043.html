			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / The Long View: Secrets of the drug culture AMID another wave of Olympic drug-taking scandals there are fears that the problem is spreading to the financial markets. Various novel substances are being tried out, and scientists are racing to develop new detection methods . . . Lamontose A derivative of the drug Majorin, this controversial hallucinogen has pain-killing qualities that enable those taking it to carry on marathon-style beyond the normal limits of endurance. In fact it is almost impossible to persuade them to stop, whatever damage they are doing to themselves or others. Common side-effects include green streaks in the vision which can progress to cause almost complete blindness. Ultimately the drug can lead to permanent deep depression. Thatcheronol Has recently appeared at secret acid house parties as an antidote to Lamontose. Produces dramatic clarity in the vision, and those swallowing this concoction achieve a feeling of great certainty and self-confidence. It may one day be legitimised in the UK, but the chances of Thatcheronol ('Blue Hearts') ever being approved in Continental Europe are regarded as non-existent, because of total incompability with German cold water treatment. Devalium Often taken as part of a potent cocktail with Thatcheronol, or its close cousin Tebbitin, Devalium is a version of an old stimulant banned some years ago in most of Western Europe (though still popular in the US and parts of Scandinavia). It is sometimes prescribed as a last-resort method of getting people out of bed and back to work; best avoided, but occasionally resorted to as a result of a wild weekend. Natsaverine Normally a legitimate and harmless enough financial sedative taken in small quantities by mostly old people, this has proved to have unsuspected qualities when increased in dosage and taken in conjunction with Cheltenum G, another tranquiliser with which it tends to react quite violently. In fact the government has panicked over this development, and the product has been withdrawn by the manufacturer and replaced by a weaker version, Natsaverine 2, reckoned to be inoffensive. Maastrichterone Appeared on the Dutch narcotics scene with much publicity at the end of last year. After injection with this powerful artificial hormone even ageing politicians and European Community officials have acquired aggressive, masculine characteristics and have gained added weight and power. However, newer and even more powerful drugs such as Danabol-N and the still untested Francenon (due on the market in September) may render Maastrichterone obsolete. Danabol-N This powerful derivative of referendenol, a traditional Swiss remedy for weakness and indecisiveness last made widely available in the UK by Harold Wilson's second government, appeared unexpectedly in Denmark in June and is believed to have taken European financial markets by storm. Can permit swift muscle-building by small peoples. The Brussels regulators appear to have been taken by surprise but may not be able to rule Danabol-N illegal. Frankfurtone Slap-on anti-inflammatory remedy widely used in conjunction with German ice-cold water and mud-bath therapy. It is considered excessively powerful by many other Europeans as in some circumstances it can lead to loss of circulation and even partial paralysis. It comes in two isomers, and L-Frankfurtone (currently recommended for application as a 9 1/2 per cent solution) is regarded as more significant than the D-form (8 3/4 per cent). A disadvantage is that it may take a long time to work, but the Germans are unconcerned about the damaging side-effects. Banned in the US and Japan. Beta-statistiform Anti-depressant formula which has a following among certain government ministers and top civil servants. It can, for instance, make unpalatable numbers appear attractive. Often prescribed for economy, and prices can be made to appear low though they can vary according to interest levels. This treatment came under suspicion when it was applied to large numbers of unemployed people and many mysteriously disappeared, but nothing was proved. Imrolin Mind-bending drug from Maxwell Laboratories rumoured to be taken by financial regulators to relieve the tedium of their job. Tell-tale signs include a tendency for the eyes to glaze over and the head to nod uncontrollably up and down. Highly addictive, although abusers may eventually be switched over to the less damaging Sibrulin (large doses are now considered necessary under a new regime). If the Imrolin addict does not respond quickly, early retirement may be the only practical answer. Programmerol An alternative pick-me-up treatment enjoying something of a vogue amongst computer software engineers, the joke being that they need it to help them cure computer viruses. The most significant effect is a tendency towards optimism which causes addicts to build strong recoveries into economic models and this may explain some of the recent errors by City forecasters. But now most are said to be back on nothing more mind-bending than aspirin. Electorin Detection-beating treatment designed to cleanse the system of controversial elements. If this works the drug user can then expect four or five years in which he can go back to his bad old ways before being tested again. For instance, John Major appears to have survived tests for Lamontose and, rumours have it, Maastrichterone (though some believe he opted out of this particular treatment) but in the US George Bush may not find it so easy. He is reckoned to be something of a devalium junkie. Divimor Pleasure-enhancing extract which has been very popular amongst unit trust companies and pension fund managers. But manufacturers are being forced to cut output because of a shortage of ingredients. Addicts could face some rather nasty withdrawal symptoms.</p>

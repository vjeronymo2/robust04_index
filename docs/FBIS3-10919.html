			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Legislators from diverse political parties have  questioned the position of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori  who denied there was a border problem between Peru and Ecuador.  Fujimori, who attended the presidential inauguration in Chile,  stressed that the Rio de Janeiro Protocol is an international  treaty and therefore ironclad. The parliamentarians said  Ecuador does have a border problem, therefore, it should insist  on finding a sovereign and graceful outlet to the Amazon. The  Rio de Janeiro Protocol which benefits Peru should be annulled.    The statements by President Fujimori in Chile on the Rio de  Janeiro Protocol have caused uneasiness in Ecuadoran political  circles. Deputy Carlos Vallejo said it was advisable for the  Executive Branch to continue handling the matter through the  Foreign Ministry.    [Begin Vallejo recording] As I have always said, this is an  issue we must let the Executive Branch handle through the  Foreign Ministry. This branch is the representative that must  deal with international matters and our problem with Peru. [end  recording]    Nevertheless, for Independent Deputy [name indistinct] the  problem of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol is a political problem  used during election time.    [Begin independent deputy recording] Of course, Peru will  never accept the existence of a border problem. If we were in  their shoes we would not accept the existence of a border  problem either. When I was a young boy we absolutely thought  that the only way for us to recover our territory was by force,  that the Peruvian people were spineless, and that we had enough  force, interest, and courage to occupy that territory. It has  been handled politically for the past 50 plus that the Rio de  Janeiro Protocol has existed. It is time to be honest. Let us  stop handling this politically and much less during preelection  time. We must put our hands on our hearts, think honestly and  rationally and realize that the only way to have our outlet to  the Amazon is by the diplomatic road. We must bring about that  the Peruvian Foreign Ministry, the Peruvian Government, and the  Peruvian people -- brothers as they now feel of the Ecuadorans  -- grant us the renewal of that right we have; that is to  navigate along the Amazon River. [end recording]    Fujimori reiterated in Chile that the Rio de Janeiro  Protocol  is completely valid. These statements prompted several  political sectors to say there is no reason for our President  Sixto Duran-Ballen to travel to that nation. Other deputies  also expressed their points of view on this issue. Democratic  Left Deputy Antonio Rodriguez said that the Ecuadoran Government  should ratify that the Rio de Janeiro Protocol signed in 1942 is  null. Our position, he said, should be unyielding in upholding  that the Rio de Janeiro Protocol is null and that there is a  territorial conflict that in no way seeks an armed solution.  Rather, it wants to draw attention to holding a permanent  dialogue.    Meanwhile Republican Deputy Abraham Romero indicated that  Peru's position that no border problem exists, is not in keeping  with reality. The thesis that there is a problem cannot be  wiped out, he said. A solution must be found promoting  dialogue, he noted. Former Congress President Carlos Vallejo  also said it was unacceptable for the Peruvian president to  ignore the fact that there is a border problem. They themselves  have sought -- through the protocol's guarantors -- a solution  to the crisis, he noted. Carlos Vallejo also said that the two  communities should reach an honorable agreement that will allow  the two nations to act with dignity without giving up the rights  over the Amazon River.</p>

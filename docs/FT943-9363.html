			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Arguments grow for muffling open outcry - Derivatives After-hours screen trading for options on Liffe, scheduled for the end of the year, is set to give a new kick to the argument that open outcry should be muffled. The traditional practice whereby traders in gaudy jackets crowd into a pit the size of a boxing ring to bid for contracts is seen by supporters as the most efficient way of dealing. But some of the biggest marketmaking firms in the UK say it is strangling trade in stock options - instruments giving the right to buy or sell shares at a fixed price. Mr Gerald Freedman, director of derivatives at integrated securities house Smith New Court, says change must come: 'The truth is that the market has been so rotten for the past four or five years that there is not much to lose.' The case against open outcry boils down to transparency. A big investor might want to buy call options which give the right to buy shares at a later date. The marketmaker has the duty to provide those shares if the option is exercised, and has to buy them in the stock market in order to hedge the position. However, because rivals have seen the initial option trade they will immediately mark the share price higher. Smith New Court argues that if option dealing were screen-based, details of the deal would be instantly available as before but the identity of the dealer would not. 'As far as the big integrated houses are concerned it has to be anonymous. The market itself would benefit enormously from the extra volume that anonymity would generate,' says Mr Freedman. While volume in FT-SE 100 futures and options has boomed, stock option turnover has refused to budge. Many of the UK's biggest companies see the daily equivalent of less than 100,000 shares changing hands in the form of options. Average turnover was more than 40,000 contracts a day (equivalent to 40m shares) in 1987, the year of the crash, but subsequently fell back to around half that level. The other side of the argument comes from agency brokers whose principal duty is to clients. Mr Nigel Croft, head of derivatives at Kleinwort Benson says: 'I can see why dealers want to go screen-based but for the broker (open-outcry) means that all the marketmakers are in one place at one time and can be reached with one phone call. It makes for a level playing field.' There is also a frisson of unease among the independent traders, known as 'locals', who trade their own capital on Liffe. Although locals are not very active in options, they worry that if stock options go to open outcry then other contracts might follow. But Ms Karin Forseke, director of equity products at Liffe, says the automated system being developed will not be ready until either the end of this year or early next year and will then only be used for after-hours dealing. 'Open outcry is an effective way of trading some of the world's most successful products,' she says. 'There is nothing that has proved to me that an automated environment will be better.' She claims that the problems with the options market relate to a lack of transparency in the underlying stock market where big trades can be hidden for between 90 minutes and five days. The poor growth of the listed stock options market in London has been one of the reasons behind the development of over-the-counter options, which are tailor-made by securities houses and banks for clients. But OMLX, the Swedish-owned derivatives exchange which offers a screen-based system in Swedish companies, claims that turnover in Astra, the pharmaceuticals group, was the highest of any stock option traded in the UK in the first six months of this year, topping Hanson by more than 23,000 contracts. No one doubts that the start of after-hours screen-based trading will provide a much needed fillip for Liffe's equity option, but many feel that a more drastic shift will be required in the long run.</p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Bonn urged to tell 'truth' on economy THE German government must tell 'the unvarnished truth', set out clear targets and provide the necessary political leadership to help break the downward economic spiral, according to Mr Tyll Necker, president of the BDI federal industry association. All economic indicators were still pointing downwards and cuts in production and workforces would continue in the coming months, he said yesterday. There were no signs of any improvement. Complaining of a crisis of confidence, and alleging that politicians did not take the business community's appeals seriously, Mr Necker demanded that Bonn set clear goals. It should say when and how it would reverse the rise in state indebtedness and reduce the tax burden. It should also back up its targets with 'concrete and credible' actions, he said. 'Those who announce their willingness to make savings and at the same time let loose an avalanche of costs on employment damage their credibility,' Mr Necker said. Continuous talk of new burdens and taxes shook investors' and consumers' confidence, he added. He repeated industry's opposition to proposals for funding care for the elderly, and complained about looming increases in pensions contributions and fuel taxes. The business community was working on cutting costs and payrolls. 'But industry also has to warn politicians and unions neither to underestimate nor to gloss over the extent of our problems,' he said. Mr Necker's protest coincided with a further worsening in the mood in key sections of German industry. The VDMA engineering industry association revised its forecasts for this year from a real fall in output of 5 per cent to a drop of 8 per cent. New orders booked in May were 10 per cent down on the same month last year. The motor traders' association claimed new vehicle registrations in Germany would fall 23 per cent this year, basing its estimate on a 20 per cent drop in the first five months.</p>

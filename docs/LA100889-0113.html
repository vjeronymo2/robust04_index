			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> APPROACHING THE HOMELESS PROBLEM  </P> <P> I am writing to express outrage at the county's recent decision to place rocks  beneath several street overpasses to prevent the homeless from using them for  shelter. I am reminded of a time when a city on the East Coast covered heating  grates to prevent the homeless from gathering over them during the winter.  </P> <P> The "solution" of giving the displaced individuals 25 cents for a phone call  and a list of resources is particularly disturbing. Anyone who has worked on  any resource hot line in the country knows that it takes numerous phone calls  to locate a shelter, if any, with an available bed. It was a poor gesture on  the part of the county to offer such a thinly disguised empty hand.  </P> <P> It again becomes painfully evident that this problem must be addressed at a  national level.  </P> <P> LINDA SCHATZMAN  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

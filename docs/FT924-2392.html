			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Prudential The Prudential's decision to shed the last of its commercial business more or less completes the reshaping since Mr Mick Newmarch took charge in 1990. As the shares have outperformed the market by 25 per cent in that time, the market might reasonably wonder where the company goes from here. Yesterday's 4 per cent fall suggests more than a smidgeon of uncertainty. For one thing, general reinsurance is still bleeding cash. The Pru's rating will doubtless receive another boost if a buyer is ever found, but that could be years away. Compared to the risks elsewhere in the sector, though, Prudential is sitting pretty. While composite insurers look better geared to recovery, mortgage indemnity claims could be a millstone well into the middle of the decade. With the estate agencies, commercial business and troublesome overseas operations out of the way, Prudential's growth prospects turn on the long-term savings business. The immediate outlook is rosy enough. The new business boom of the early 1980s should feed into profits as 10-year policies mature. That underpins the promise to increase the dividend this year. Whether Mr Newmarch can keep new business flowing and expenses under control is another matter. There are certainly signs of self-confidence. Prudential's new accruals method of accounting for life profits makes the new business performance more transparent. By introducing it, Mr Newmarch has nailed his colours firmly to the mast.</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: Fondiaria trims losses and sees improvement Fondiaria, the Italian insurance company indirectly controlled by the Ferruzzi industrial group, announced continued heavy losses for 1993, but claimed that there were 'encouraging signs of an improvement'. Losses last year reached L465bn (Dollars 275m), compared with L576bn in 1992, but the group pointed out in a statement issued at the weekend that its insurance losses had been cut from L664bn in 1992 to L252bn. Directors of the company expressed their confidence in the correctness of the group's accounts, following the news last Friday that two former managers of the group had been put under investigation by Ravenna magistrates for allegedly declaring false accounts, a criminal offence in Italy. The directors said they were confident the true facts would soon be established. The group said its debts had fallen to L2,139bn at the end of last year, from L2,451bn at the end of 1992, of which L1,046bn was owed to banks. In 1993, gross premiums increased by 8.3 per cent to L6,607bn, of which L6,016bn came from consolidated companies. Italian premiums contributed L5,349bn to this figure - L4,369bn from non-life business, and L980bn from life insurance.</p>

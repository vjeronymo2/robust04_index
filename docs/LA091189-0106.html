			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> PARLIAMENT PANEL SEEKS PAPANDREOU PROSECUTION FOR TELEPHONE TAPPING  </P> <P> A Greek parliamentary committee recommended today that former Socialist Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou be prosecuted on charges of telephone tapping  during his eight years in office.  </P> <P> "We recommend . . . his prosecution for illegal telephone tappings" of  political opponents, newspapers and journalists, and for violating the  constitutional right to privacy of communications, said the report submitted to  Parliament.  </P> <P> It was the first recommendation against Papandreou by one of the committees  investigating a series of scandals that rocked the Socialist government before  its crushing defeat in the June elections.  </P> <P> Another committee will report Friday on whether there are any links between  Papandreou and a $200-million embezzlement scandal involving the private Bank  of Crete.  </P> <P> The committee's recommendation will be studied by the 300 deputies in  Parliament, who will vote next week on whether to prosecute the 70-year-old  Socialist leader.  </P></p>

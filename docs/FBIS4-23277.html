			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Electoral Administration  Technical Secretariat in Zambezia says that after the chairman  of the Zambezia Provincial Elections Commission got his voter  card this morning, its technical team -- made up of delegates of  the Mozambique Liberal and Democratic Party, the Mozambican  Nationalist Movement, a representative of the town council,  Catholic Bishop Dom Bernardo, and a government official -- flew  urgently to Gile District. This happened because the Mozambique  National Resistance [Renamo] delegate in that district burned  one of the electoral registration posts in the capital of Gile  and afterwards, with a group of people, attempted to destroy the  District Elections Commission office. Having been immediately  detained by the Police of the Republic of Mozambique Command,  the delegate of Renamo in Gile District said he was following  orders from his superiors since Renamo does not recognize the  electoral organs.</p>

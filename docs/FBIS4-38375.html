			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin announced  that a Russian government delegation's official visit to China  had failed to settle the problem of mutual debts. He told  Interfax that China had not repaid Russia the 80 million Swiss  franc credit, extended to it for the construction of a railway  (1 dollar equals 1.4 Swiss francs - Interfax).    According to the Russian Ministry for Foreign Economic  Relations, in 1990 the Soviet Union borrowed 0.5 billion Swiss  francs and in 1991 - 1 billion Swiss francs from China (Russia  is the Soviet Union's legal successor). Moreover, Russia's debt  to China for supplies on a clearing basis exceeds 800 million  Swiss francs.    Shokhin said that the sides had not yet evaluated all of the  mutual debts and claims, and that this work was to be done  during the next few weeks.    To quote Shokhin, "in order to retain an equal attitude to  all creditors, given the current financial problems and other  considerations, Russia will have to ask Beijing to put off the  repayment of the debt on terms similar to the ones advanced by  the Paris Club. Although China is not a member of the Paris  Club, if Russia repays its debt to China on more favorable  terms, Moscow will find itself in a difficult situation on the  eve of the talks with the Paris Club," Shokhin pointed out.    "Without a departure from the barter scheme, which allows a  couple of Chinese companies to dictate prices and choice of  goods, we shall fail to keep trade with China on a proper  level," he continued.    He also said that China had promised to give Russian exports  broader access to the Chinese market.</p>

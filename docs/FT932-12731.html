			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Personal View: No way to run a health service It is accepted by most outsiders and even acknowledged by a few honest insiders that Whitehall's greatest skill is in stopping things happening - not in the sense of bringing things to a halt but preventing them from being as good as they might have been. Nowhere is this illustrated more strikingly than in the development of the National Health Service since Kenneth Clarke, then the health secretary, introduced his reform package in April 1991. It released a wave of expectation and energy among progressive general managers of the service and even caught the imagination of some doctors and nurses. But the sad truth is that disillusionment has now set in. The reforms introduced the idea of survival through performance. A market would be created in which the purchasers were separated from the providers of healthcare. Hospitals providing an effective service would thrive and would attract more business; those which performed less well would be at risk. Purchasing power was to be the order of the day, but this was to be balanced by giving local management wide-ranging freedoms from central control. This left management's survival in the new market to be determined by its own efforts. No longer were managers to be strangled in a web of central bureaucracy. So much for the theory. In practice, matters are turning out very differently. To take the health market first. There are deep divisions at political and senior management levels about how the market should be allowed to develop. Some believe in encouraging a free market which should be regulated only when it seems that the provision of essential services to particular communities might be squeezed out by competitive pressures. Others believe that the market should be managed in a way which ensures that the consequences of market pressures are almost entirely avoided by, for example, the retention of large contingency funds for use wherever providers run into difficulties. This 'back pocket' approach, which is the one being pursued at present, undermines the belief that providers in the new NHS have to stand on their own feet. If the health market is simply adrift, the approach to making the best use of staff is in disarray. The reforms offered an opportunity to break free of the centralised pay and personnel dictates imposed by the review bodies and Whitley councils. This could have happened by the trusts themselves taking the initiative, or they could have been made to take it by the central abolition of the pay bodies. Neither has happened. Trusts have not, with a very few exceptions, created new employment packages for their staffs and ministers have not been prepared to withstand the fuss which the unions and staff associations would undoubtedly have made if the pay bodies had been disbanded by central diktat. The NHS should not now complain if it finds its freedom of manoeuvre over pay and personnel matters to be increasingly limited over the next few years. In one area of staffing, however, unstoppable forces have been released. In simple terms, managers are beginning to insist that staff concentrate on what they are trained to do. They are increasingly reluctant to pay staff to do work which others could do just as well and at less cost. This is called skill-mixing - redressing the balance between professionally qualified and support staff in favour of the latter. Some bolder spirits are even beginning to encourage staff to acquire additional skills. This will lead to fewer multi-skilled staff doing the work which more people with narrower skills do at present. The tragedy is that these moves are being frowned upon by ministers because of the anxieties they are creating among the professions, with whom ministers do not wish to quarrel. I fear for the NHS reforms. In their first year, which coincided with the run-up to the general election, the NHS was shamelessly used as a political football. No risks were allowed either with the operation of the market or the exercise of new flexibilities. Managers, eager to prove themselves, were never able to do so. Central authority was strictly upheld. At the end of the second year, however, the same dreary pattern continues with managerial flexibility still being sacrificed to political expediency. Health ministers are not dismantling the central bureaucracy in the way the supporters of the reforms were promised. At the same time they appear to be doing their utmost to squeeze out of the system examples of local initiatives which seem best designed to produce increased efficiency. This is no way to run a railway. The author is former personnel director of the NHS</p>

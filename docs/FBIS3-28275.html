Negotiations on the automobile and auto parts sector is  now facing rough sailing because Japan has rejected the U.S.  demand for setting numerical targets. The automobile industry's  cooperation is indispensable for settling the negotiations prior  to the Japan-U.S. summit slated for 11 February and the gap  between MITI and the automobile industry holds the key to the  direction the negotiations will take.    It was reported on 2 February that MITI asked Japanese  automakers to submit their plans every year for the purchase of  foreign-made auto parts and the report has become controversial.  Enraged by the report, Yutaka Kume, president of the Japan  Automobile Manufacturers Association (and president of Nissan  Motor Corporation), asked MITI to categorically deny the report.  President Kume was enraged by the report because it came  shortly after he; Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor  Corporation; and Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president of Honda Motor  Company, met with Hiroshi Kumagai, MITI minister, to ask the  latter to oppose the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets.    Japanese automakers worked out their voluntary plans for the  purchase of $19 billion worth of American-made auto parts in  January 1992 when Former President Bush visited Japan, but the  plans have transformed into a Japanese commitment to the United  States. The Japanese automakers have this bitter experience.  In the recent negotiations on the automobile and auto parts  sector, MITI proposed a cooperative approach in which both  Japanese and American automobile industries cooperate in trading  auto parts. MITI Minister Kumagai has said: "It would be good  if automakers in the two nations decide on their trade of auto  parts." In this way, Mr. Kumagai is eager to look for a way to  break the deadlock in the negotiations through the formula of  voluntary cooperation between automakers of the two nations.    President Kume once said: "The negotiations on the  automobile sector should be held between automakers of the two  countries and it is ridiculous that two nations' governments  intervene in their trade." In this way, Japanese automakers are  increasingly reacting against the intergovernmental  negotiations. With the Japan-U.S. summit one week away, MITI is  getting increasingly irritated.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>   [Text] In a news conference this afternoon, Luis  Cortavarria Chequeli, director of the Superintendency of Banks  and Insurance, justified the definitive intervention in the  Latin American Business Advisory Center [CLAE]. As one of the  reasons, he mentioned failure to meet the schedule of payments  to CLAE depositors.    [Begin recording] [Cortavarria] Here we have a letter  stating  that the clients would begin to get their money on 7 February.  By this date we had already started to prepare CLAE's closure.  We reached the conclusion that if CLAE had not started to pay by  this date, we would start the closure procedure. CLAE failed to  begin returning the money on 8, 9, or 10 February. I believe the  superintendent's office made the best possible effort to try to  formalize CLAE. It is not that we intervened in CLAE even though  CLAE reported on its operations. CLAE has been handing over  documents that do not support the reported value of its assets.  As we said since the beginning, CLAE's obligations to the public  are not guaranteed. The proper procedure [words indistinct]  because it is an organization not authorized by the  superintendent's office.    [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] previously?    [Cortavarria] What do you mean previously?    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Cortavarria] Banking Law 637 of 1991 stipulates in a  temporary article that banks that receive deposits from the  public without authorization can formalize their status by  providing information. A process then starts. The law provided  the opportunity for CLAE to formalize its status, but it failed  to stick by the law. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Council tax for Wellingborough Occupants of the most expensive house in the Northamptonshire district of Wellingborough will pay a council tax of Pounds 587 in the coming financial year - less than many residents of modest terraced homes in parts of Britain with less wealthy councils, Chris Tighe writes. In 1994-95, the Conservative-controlled borough is not only levying no council tax for its own services, but is giving discounts of up to Pounds 400 on the precept levied by Northamptonshire County Council. Northamptonshire will levy a precept of Pounds 490.78 for Band D. On this figure, Wellingborough will offer a Pounds 200 discount, bringing the total tax paid down to Pounds 290.78. In 1993-94 Wellingborough had the lowest council tax bills in Britain, and Mr Brian Veal, chief executive, predicts that it will keep the lowest bill in the shire districts in 1994-95. Another rural district, Hambleton in North Yorkshire, which is sitting on reserves of Pounds 40m, is also to make a zero charge in 1994-95, and offers a discount, Pounds 32 on Band D. This means Hambleton's smartest residences will attract a maximum council tax bill in 1994-95 of Pounds 933, including the county and maximum parish precepts. Under local government reorganisation both Wellingborough, with 81,000 population, and Hambleton, with 68,000, face amalgamation with other areas.</p>

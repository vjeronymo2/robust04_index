			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article on a news conference by Vladimir Meciar, Slovak </F> prime minister and chairman of the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia (HZDS), Jan Slota, chairman of the Slovak National  Party (SNS), and Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the  Democratic Left (SDL), with unidentified correspondents in  Bratislava on 28 February--recorded]    [Excerpts] Top officials of the HZDS and the SNS met for  regular coalition talks today. HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar  and SNS Chairman Jan Slota briefed journalists on the results of  the talks at an impromptu meeting:    [Meciar] Both parties agreed on fundamental talks [zasadne  rozhovory] with the SDL on how to stabilize and assess the  situation. As for the developments in the most immediate  future, we have to take into consideration several new facts.    First, representatives of the Association of Towns and  Villages strongly protest against the possibility that communal  elections could coincide with the national elections.    Second, by 25 February, over 400,000 people said in a  petition that they were in favor of a referendum as a means of  solving the present political situation and of tackling all  three questions. As far as I know, the petition committee later  relaxed its activities because it obtained many more signatures  than needed, and many more were still interested in signing.    Third, we cannot allow the parliamentary crisis to change  into a permanent one. It would affect economic and social  relations in such a way that the political climate would  eventually result in the deterioration of the economy and of  social welfare. It would be the people who would pay for it--in  prices, pensions, etc. That is threatening the state. It is in  the interest of the state--we both agreed on this--to hold  elections as soon as possible. The date of 24-25 June 1994  seems to us to be the most suitable. However, the HZDS and the  SNS together do not have enough votes to be able to push these  dates through in parliament. That is why we need to hold talks  with other political parties.    [Correspondent] Which parties come under consideration?    [Meciar] The SDL. We have agreed that both parties would  hold talks with the SDL.    [Slota] Clearly, June is the most suitable election time for  the SNS. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Is there any realistic chance that the SDL  and the HZDS would agree on the date of early elections, which  should be, as the prime minister said today, the end of June  1994?    [Weiss] There is no realistic chance for that. We have  received no official offer for talks. I do not know on what  grounds the prime minister gave you such information.</p>

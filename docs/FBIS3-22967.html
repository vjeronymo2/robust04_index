The 20 Romanians working for a cement factory are to move  from the southern Asyut region to the northern city of  Alexandria until the situation calms down, ministry spokesman  Mircea Geoana [name as received] said.    The engineers were on board a bus that was hit by gunfire on  Monday near Asyut. They were unhurt, but the next day they  received threats from the al-Jama'ah saying the shooting was  only a warning.    The Egyptian authorities and the Romanian Embassy in Cairo  were studying ways of protecting the 200 Romanians working in  "sensitive" parts of the country, Geoana added.</p>

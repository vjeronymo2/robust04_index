On 25 January, Chen Xitong and his party went to Mengtougou  District and met with the newly elected district party committee  standing committee members. They also went to Sanggu Village of  Junxiang Township, an old revolutionary area, to understand the  situation and called on the veteran party members who had joined  the early stage of revolution and some households with  difficulties.    These two districts have shared the common characteristics  as  follows: Emancipate the mind; proceed from reality; base on the  local natural resources; develop, on a large scale, economic  forests and building materials; and quicken the pace of seeking  wealth and stepping toward the target of becoming fairly  well-off.    Song Xiyou, newly elected secretary of the Mengtougou  District Party Committee, said: The newly elected members of  the leading body are at an average age of 43.5 years. The  youngest standing committee member is only 29 years old. Thus,  the leading body is basically "installed in the shape of  ladder." Except that only one person is graduated from the  secondary specialized school, the rest have an educational level  of university or higher. It can be said that the new leading  body is full of vitality, is able to realize the target of  becoming fairly well-off, and enjoys the support of the broad  masses of party members and veteran cadres. We maintain that  this is a strategic measure for strengthening the building of  leading bodies. Song Xiyou also reported on the district's  strategic idea for becoming fairly well-off in 1997 and the plan  for relying on the natural resources of the mountain areas to  build Shilong small industrial zone and five major bases engaged  in the production of building materials, coal, and fruit  products and the development of tourist trade. He said:  Practice showed that it is accurate to persist in the new ideas  of "relying on the mountain areas to making a living, going out  of the mountain areas to build mountain areas, entering markets  to seek wealth, and make the mountain areas wealthy by opening  to the outside world and development; and it is right to persist  in the work methods of conducting investigations and study on a  large scale and proceeding from reality. Mengtougou, a district  with mountains, changes itself from "having no ways to make  development" into "having methods to make development" because  it has persisted in the accurate development ideas and work  methods.    Chen Xitong congratulated Mengtougou District on the  successful convocation of the party congress, praised that  representatives of party members and veteran cadres have  strategic foresight to support the election of younger leading  body members, and fully affirmed the district's strategic ideas  of conducting investigations and study, proceeding from reality,  and becoming fairly well-off ahead of schedule. He stressed:  The new leading body's tasks are to work under the guidance of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, to conscientiously implement the  guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party  Central Committee, to work in line with the work guiding  principles of the municipal party committee and the municipal  government and in reliance on the district's party members and  people, to proceed from the reality of the mountain areas, and  to make the work be submitted to and serve the target of  quickening the pace of becoming wealthy and the target of  becoming fairly well-off.    On the basis of the local natural resources, Fangshan  District with rich natural resources has vigorously developed  the fruit tree planting industry, the household-based breeding  industry, and the tourist trade. So, the peasants in the  district start to take on the path of seeking wealth. Last  year, the total product of the district reached 7.9 billion  yuan, an increase of 60 percent over 1992. This year, this  district further eliminated the thinking of small-scale  development; set forth, according to the local actual  conditions, a plan for building a 10,000-mu kiwi production  garden, a 10,000-mu apricot production garden, a 10,000-mu  Chinese toon production garden, and a 10,000-mu chestnut  production garden; and also started to implement the plan. So  far, Xibaidai Village of Zhangfang Town has sown kiwis on 1,000  mu of land and has a good marketing prospect. Jiudu Village has  also gained benefits from developing the breeding industry. Of  160 households, 130 households are engaged in the breeding of  coypus. Last year, the village's revenues netted 800,000 yuan  and the village's savings deposits increased by a big margin.    Chen Xitong fully affirmed Fangshan District's practice of  emancipating the mind, using the local advantages to develop the  economy, and guiding the peasants to step toward the target of  becoming fairly well-off. He especially pointed out that in the  past, the mountains and rivers in Shidu scenic spot were of no  use; but now, the people there have emancipated the mind, opened  the mountain areas to the outside world, and thought out  methods. With these methods, the mountains and rivers have been  changed into wealth.    When calling on veteran party members and households with  difficulties, Chen Xitong urged again and again that districts  and villages should give more concerns and support to them and  have them experience the concerns of the party and the warmth of  the socialist society. He especially praised Mengtougou  District and the townships and villages of the district for  giving monthly living subsidies to veteran party members and  giving temporary and special subsidies to those with  difficulties. He also told the cadres that the old  revolutionary areas have many old party members, fighters, and  comrades. They made sacrifice and contributions to the  revolution. We must never forget them. So, we should do more  good and concrete deeds for them and have them spend a good  Spring Festival. In Jiudu Village of Fangshan District, Chen  Xitong especially urged that the comrades in the district should  help Veteran Party Member Liu Xianfu and help cure his eye  diseases. It was informed that the No. 1 hospital of the  district has diagnosed his illness and worked out a treatment  program for him.</p>

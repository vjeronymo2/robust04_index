			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Sustained rise in cabinet sales assists Silentnight SILENTNIGHT Holdings, Europe's biggest manufacturer of beds, said a full contribution from its recent German acquisition and remedial action in the US helped the group increase interim pre-tax profits 27 per cent to Pounds 5.2m. Turnover rose 13 per cent to Pounds 79.6m in the six months to July 31. In the UK, sales were ahead by 6 per cent and margins were broadly maintained in what the group said was still a 'very tough market'. Mr Bill Davies, chairman, said: 'Improvement on last year's excellent second-half performance will depend largely upon a recovery in the UK furniture market which is not yet evident.' Silentnight's shares, which have outperformed the market by 50 per cent this year, closed 1p lower at 377p. Matthias Houben, the German manufacturer of beds and mattresses which Silentnight bought last year for Pounds 3.2m, made operating profits of Pounds 737,000in the six-month period, compared with a two-month contribution last time. Mr Davies said sales in Germany had flattened in recent months, but margins and return on investment remained good. Sales in the US were not markedly changed from last year, but new management had improved margins and reduced costs, taking the business out of losses. Mr Davies said profits in the US could grow quickly, if and when recovery took off. In the UK, bed sales were slightly ahead in a flat market, but cabinet sales rose 20 per cent, maintaining a three-year record of consistent growth. Cabinets now account for nearly 30 per of total UK sales. Silentnight increased capital expenditure from Pounds 4m to Pounds 4.2m and had net cash of Pounds 5.6m. Devaluation of sterling was blamed for the shift to interest payable of Pounds 66,000 from the previous period's interest receivable of Pounds 180,000. This is because the group's debts are in Germany and the US, matching assets there, but cash is held in the UK, where interest rates have fallen. Earnings per share rose 24 per cent to 7.41p (5.98p). The interim dividend is lifted 22 per cent to 2.75p (2.25p). Mr Barry McKenzie, finance director, said the interim dividend had been pegged for the last five years, and was being increased to reduce the gap between the interim and final payments. Silentnight said that it continued to maintain its dominant position in the UK beds market, of which it controls more than 30 per cent, even though sales had increased only marginally in the six months to July 31. Mr Davies said the main opportunity for growth was in the rapidly-expanding cabinets business. where the group only had about a 6 per cent share of the UK market. Silentnight has invested heavily in cabinet technology using sophisticated printed foils, which have a similar appearance to cheaper wood veneer finishes. COMMENT These were an impressive set of results, with the core UK beds business continuing to generate cash and healthy margins in spite of a flat market. The German acquisition has also performed better than expected, even if the onset of recession suggests it may now mark time for a while. The group will also be pleased to have stopped losses at its US operation which - though never quantified - were described to analysts as 'big enough to be unpleasant'. However, Silentnight shares have outperformed the market by 50 per cent this year and are now trading on a prospective multiple of 20, a significant premium. The group's success in Germany, the US and with cabinets bodes well for the future, but the chairman's downbeat note on the second half would suggest the shares are up with events.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Heseltine puts Post Office sale on agenda THE POST OFFICE may be privatised after a wide-ranging review of its organisation and structure which was announced yesterday by the government. In a departure from previous policy, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, put privatisation of the Post Office firmly on the political agenda. He said he had no preconception of the likely outcome of the review and did not rule out leaving the corporation in the public sector. But he claimed that public ownership meant the Post Office was 'shackled' and its market was being 'creamed off' by competitors. 'There is growing interest worldwide in the potential advantages of freeing-up of postal markets,' he said. Mr Heseltine reiterated the government's commitment to the proposals in the Citizen's Charter on the Post Office. At the moment the Post Office has a monopoly on letters under Pounds 1. The Citizen's Charter suggested lowering the threshold to a level closer to the price of a first class stamp, currently at 24p. The Citizen's Charter, however, made no mention about the possibility of changing the ownership of the Post Office. 'We want to see if there are ways the Post Office can be given a bigger opportunity to raise money, compete more effectively and offer shares to their own workforce,' Mr Heseltine said. 'I am not suggesting a management-employee buy-out is my preferred solution but I would be very surprised if we didn't hear from people coming forward from within the Post Office making suggestions of that sort.' He said the Royal Mail title would be kept and disclosed that two companies had expressed interest in the possibility of bidding for Parcelforce, the parcel division. The government's commitment to a nationwide delivery network within a uniform and affordable price structure was 'non-negotiable', he said. Sir Bryan Nicholson, Post Office chairman, said the board would discuss how the corporation could take advantage of the government's review. 'Every effort should be made to give the employees a share of the action,' he added. Labour swiftly condemned the planned review, saying it had more to do with privatisation than public service. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'The danger is that the review will sniff out the profitable parts of the Post Office and skim them off for the private sector.'</p>

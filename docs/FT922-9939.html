			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / The FT Interview: 'F' stands for culture - David Mellor, secretary of state for National Heritage, speaks to Raymond Snoddy David Mellor's officials are already calling it 'the F word'. And they are not at all sure whether they should use it in the hearing of the first secretary of state for the new National Heritage department. This 'F word' has nothing whatever to do with the language of an avant garde Arts Council-funded play. This is 'F for Fun', and a reference to the instant nickname given to one of Prime Minister John Major's 'big ideas' - a department with Cabinet rank which brings together everything from arts, museums and libraries to sport, tourism, broadcasting, proper celebration of the millenium and a national lottery to help pay for those activities. In fact Mellor does not actually disapprove of the fact that his department will forever be known as the Ministry of Fun. 'I was responsible for that. I am not a pompous chap,' he says, relaxing into an armchair in his temporary accommodation, the Office of Arts and Libraries facing St James's Park in central London. While his public image may have softened, the Heritage secretary concedes that he has been a fairly controversial character in a political career that began as the 15-year-old chairman of the South Dorset Young Conservatives. The smiles over his new job description should not be allowed to obscure the fact that Mellor is a serious politician - dubbed a 'rottweiler' by some colleagues because of his savage attacks on Labour's taxation plans during the campaign. All the signs are that John Major is equally serious about the creation of the most significant new ministry since Harold Wilson set up the Ministry of Economic Affairs 30 years ago. 'The prime minister has taken the exceptional step of creating this department as a fundamental vision of the kind of society that he wants Britain to be,' Mellor says. In the 1980s, the Tories concentrated on the need to make Britain a dynamic economy, and to reawaken a competitive entrepreneurial spirit. Now it is time, Mellor says, to give everyone a chance to take part in culture, in sport, in heritage. Later, he lights on a better way of explaining his new mission, albeit with the help of a remark by the un-Thatcherite economist J K Galbraith regarding private affluence and public squalor in the US. Mellor goes on: 'We want private affluence. None of us is ashamed of private affluence; it is the fundamental basis of a successful society. But the public dimension has got to be looked after as well and my job is to ensure that the public dimension is looked after.' The new government department did not come as a surprise, and neither did Mellor's appointment. The arts had long sought representation at Cabinet level and the idea started to germinate in Major's mind when, as chancellor, he imposed a tax on football pools to help modernise club grounds. 'I suppose I would have been surprised if I hadn't got the job. The prime minister thinks the responsibilities fit me like a glove, though obviously I must prove the glove hasn't got too many holes in it.' Not only has Mellor been broadcasting minister (twice) and arts minister (once) but the fact that he supports Chelsea Football Club and enlivened debate at the Treasury - where he was Chief Secretary from 1990 until the general election - with a compact disc player and lots of classical music was surely the clincher. 'This isn't some poor little tugboat limping along behind the rest of the fleet. This is a full-scale ship that can sail along with every other department as their equal,' he says. But how will the department which Mellor insists is not 'a Frankenstein creation cobbled together from bits of bodies lying around in other departments' actually be set up? Where will it be located? How will it be funded and, most important, what will it do? Because it is new, the National Heritage department has to reach decisions on everything from how many paper clips are needed to how long the department's question-time in the House of Commons will last. Mellor is out to attract 'the brightest and best' from Whitehall and there are signs that he may succeed. More than 50 civil servants have already applied for the five jobs in the press office. What is more tricky is finding a permanent home. The Office of Arts and Libraries is too small for a final staff of about 400. Mellor wanted to go to London's Docklands, which he regards as one of the bravest development ventures in Britain this century. The move was ruled out because of the slender nature of the government's majority and the need to be close to the Commons to vote in key debates. The old Energy Department is a candidate, along with two other premises, and there is also the possibility that the department will go to a new building  -one with some style though not grandiose. 'One cannot put up a sign that says National Heritage over something that looks like one of the more unattractive manifestations of one of the direr eras of British architecture. But equally one cannot move into somewhere that looked as if one was getting above one's station,' says Mellor. If all goes well, the public money that already goes to the arts - Pounds 221m to the Arts Council alone next year - will be augmented by up to Pounds 1bn a year from a national lottery. Mellor choses his words carefully when addressing just what the mix of money will be. 'A clear undertaking has been given that the lottery is not to replace other public provision, but I think it was also said that we would have to have regard to the proceeds of the lottery when looking at the allocation of other resources,' he says, in a sentence that did credit to a former Treasury minister. But what is he actually going to do with the funds? 'I don't see myself as a sort of culture Tsar, either trying to provide a false picture of the culture of the nation or providing bread and circuses for the masses.' Apart from encouraging 'the whole swathe of creative people in society' to high artistic tic and sporting achievements, Mellor says he wants to create 'memorials', before quickly deciding that is not the right word. Instead he changes it to 'permanent examples of the nature of our culture that future generations will have pride in, the way we take pride in Buckingham Palace or the British Museum.' Once 'the premises and the livestock' have been sorted out, Mellor will start to address policy. Like most people in most of the areas that National Heritage is now responsible for he believes that change is inevitable, he says. 'I don't want them to fear change or fear that change will be pushed upon them by some petty dictator calling himself the secretary of state for National Heritage.' The secretary, who has been called arrogant, ambitious, rude and abrasive - 'tuppeny-halfpenny rubbish that people take out of the cuttings libraries' - is already setting up a series of meetings with leading figures in areas under the department's reponsibility, including arts and broadcasting. A key issue will be the future of the BBC and the renegotiations for its new Royal Charter after the current one expires in 1996. Mellor, widely praised for his improvements to the 1990 Broadcasting Act, denies he is approaching the BBC with an axe. 'And what's more John Major isn't either,' he says, adding that he wants to open up a public debate about the future of the corporation. Yet Mellor does issue an unambiguous warning about his intentions. 'I can't think of a single area where there is an existing policy that doesn't have to be taken down, inspected, scrutinised and at the very least polished up and probably frankly dismantled and put together again.' However creative his policies turn out to be, he knows the National Heritage department will not be able to create a Mozart. But he believes there is a vein of artistic potential which can be tapped and that it is cultural achievements that endure in a society - more than its patrons or its politicians. 'If we can find someone in this country who writes great music he will be remembered long after people have forgotten what the community charge was,' says Mellor.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1949 Born March 12 Dorset.

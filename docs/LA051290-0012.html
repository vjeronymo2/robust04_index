			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> ATHLETE MAY ENTER NO-CONTEST PLEA  </P> <P> An attorney for basketball player Allan Leavell said Friday that his client  will probably plead no contest to punching a referee during a minor-league  game.  </P> <P> Leavell, the first professional athlete ever to be arrested for striking a  referee, did not show up in Ventura Municipal Court for his arraignment on a  battery charge Friday.  </P> <P> However, defense attorney Louis Samonsky Jr. asked the court for a continuance,  which Judge Herbert Curtis III granted. Leavell is expected to enter a plea on  May 29 to a charge of battery, Samonsky said.  </P> <P> Samonsky said Friday that Leavell "said he'd be up here, but I said there was  no need to. He gave me the authority to come up and represent him."  </P> <P> Samonsky said Friday that he planned to contact Leavell in Houston and tell him  that Judge Curtis expects to sentence him to a period of probation and a $500  fine. The misdemeanor charge of battery carries a maximum penalty of six months  in jail and a $2,000 fine.  </P> <P> Leavell was arrested after a Continental Basketball Assn. game between his  team, the Tulsa Fast Breakers, and the Santa Barbara Islanders at Ventura  Community College on March 30.  </P> <P> According to the police report, Leavell punched referee Peter Quinn, knocking  him to the floor, after Quinn made a call against the Fast Breakers in the  final seconds of the game. Quinn pressed criminal charges. MACK REED  </P></p>

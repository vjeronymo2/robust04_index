			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Liffe condemns concealment of share prices The Stock Exchange must gradually remove restrictions which block immediate publication of the prices at which shares are bought and sold in London, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange said yesterday. Mr Daniel Hodson, chief executive of Liffe, said the lack of transparency was already inhibiting the development of a robust futures market in London and would constrain it even further in the future. He said activity in financial futures which track the FT-SE 100 index was already lower than in comparable futures contracts in France and Germany. Liffe was responding to a paper from the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, which asked whether some practices affecting professional investors in London were beneficial to certain market participants at the expense of others. In particular, SIB asked whether rules which restrict price transparency were truly needed to ensure that sufficient liquidity was available to investors. Liffe is arguing that because so much business in London is executed at prices which are not visible to the public, equity derivatives products cannot properly reflect the value of the underlying cash market they are intended to mimic. Stock Exchange rules allow any trade of more than three times 'normal market size' to be hidden from other market participants for 90 minutes, and any trade more than 75 times normal market size to be hidden for up to five days or until the marketmaker has hedged against the risk of adverse price movements in that stock. Also, the exchange allows marketmakers to buy and sell shares to each other through inter-dealer broker screens at prices which may not coincide with those on the Exchange's own Seaq price-display mechanism.</p>

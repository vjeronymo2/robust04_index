			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of Madeira (3): EU funds pay for roads - A backward region of a backward country / Peter Wise on the economy Viewed from some angles, Madeira appears to offer little hope of prosperity for its quarter of a million people. The leading manufacturing industry is embroidery. The island imports 85 per cent of all it consumes. Export markets can be half an ocean away. A sixth of the workforce farms terraced plots not much bigger than a couple of tablecloths. But economic weaknesses are negotiating strengths when it comes to securing aid from the European Union. EU funds currently account for a third of the region's income and are the driving force behind an economy where output rose by an estimated 6 per cent in 1993, while mainland Portugal suffered recession. Construction companies are benefiting from an extensive infrastructure programme. Tourism is another promising sector, representing 20 per cent of gross regional product and employing 9 per cent of a working population of 118,000. Operators differ over which niche Madeira should aim at within the higher-income bracket of the tourism market; but they agree that prospects are relatively bright both for earnings and jobs. A third focus of development is the International Business Centre (IBC), whose tax exemptions represent another perk from the European Commission. However, its immediate impact on the economy is likely to be limited considering that the free-trade industrial zone will employ only 3,000 people - 2.5 per cent of the workforce - when all the projects currently in the pipeline are operating. Nor does much of the money that moves through offshore financial and services companies stay in Madeira. As a backward region of a backward country, Madeira has qualified for a substantial inflow of European funds since Portugal joined what is now the European Union in 1986. The Lisbon government raises no objection to allocating Madeira between 5 and 7 per cent of its EU aid, although the island accounts for only 2.5 per cent of the population. 'We could never catch up with the rest of the country if we received any less,' says Mr Alberto Joao Jardim, president of the regional government since 1978. 'The central government has given Madeira the fullest support in our negotiations with Brussels and never complained that we were getting more than our fair share.' He acknowledges that being a stronghold of the centre-right Social Democrats, also the governing party in Lisbon, has helped the island win favour with the central administration. Madeira is due to receive about Es200bn in EU funds from 1994 to 1999, double the amount transferred during the previous five years. Lisbon also supplies about 10 per cent of regional budget spending out of the central budget. This is to compensate for the duty the island loses on goods imported into mainland Portugal but consumed in Madeira and for the corporate tax paid by companies operating in the island whose consolidated profits are taxed in Lisbon. In effect, Lisbon covers the cost of servicing Madeira's Es100bn public debt. Statistics testify to the development that these funds and a central government guarantee enabling Madeira to run up debt have brought to the island. Madeira's GDP per capita was 24 per cent of the European average in 1976; it is now close to 45 per cent. The figure for Portugal as a whole is 58 per cent. Emigration, once the only hope of affluence for the island's workers, has fallen to a trickle. Over the same period the number of doctors has increased threefold, the infant mortality rate has been cut from 75 to 12 per 1,000 births and six times as many children receive secondary school education. Most money is being spent on infrastructure. New roads sweep across the island, cutting through the precipitous volcanic terrain by tunnel and viaduct. 'Where do the people go on all these roads?' Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, Portugal's prime minister, is reputed to have asked during a recent visit to the island, which is only 61km long and 25km wide. Almost 200km of new roads have been built over the past 18 years, cement consumption has increased fivefold and construction companies employ 13 per cent of the workforce. But critics question the wisdom of pouring so much cash into concrete and tarmac. 'The regional government has made itself popular by building impressive infrastructures but what is going to happen when the money from Europe stops flowing?' asks Mr Jose Carlos Mota Torres, leader of the opposition Socialists, who have 12 seats in the 57-member regional parliament compared with the Social Democrats' 39 seats. The Socialists argue, as do some businessmen, that a bigger share of the EU money should be allocated to the private sector in the form of investment incentives. 'This would help create an economy that would be able to stand on its own in the future without subsidies from Brussels,' says one Madeira economist. 'The people who make these kinds of criticisms were born with a silver spoon in their mouths,' argues Mr Jardim in his usual forthright style. 'When they say incentives they mean subsidies. They don't know how to make a profit in a market economy. But I'm not going to help them.' Building roads, schools and hospitals improves the quality of life for everyone, he says. The voters who have elected him with an absolute majority in four successive elections so far appear to agree. Mr Jardim adopts the same tough-minded approach towards reforming agriculture, which provides little more than a subsistence living for 15 per cent of the workforce. 'There is no future for agriculture in Madeira unless people cultivate profitable crops such as tropical fruit and flowers. But many farmers still insist on growing cabbages and potatoes,' he says. The government provides fruit tree seedlings and flowers for farmers who want to adapt. 'But I'll never give them money,' says Mr Jardim, 'they'd just spend it in the tavern.' One planned infrastructure investment is causing little controversy. The regional government will spend about Es60bn, of which the EU will provide two-thirds, to extend Madeira's airport runway by 500 metres. This will enable tourism operators to bring in larger aircraft and lower the cost of transporting cargo, which currently has to compete with passengers for expensive and limited space. Not least, the extension, involving a realignment of the runway, should make landing on the island a less alarming experience.</p>

In this American sitcom you get all the familiar permissable jokes about male vanity and men who can't keep it up - but also jokes about female spongers and feminine scattiness. It is in such contrast to the prevailing feminist dogma that you wonder how it gets on British television at all. The answer is that it hardly does: just in London (other ITV areas occasionally) and late at night; 11.15 today. Earlier on BBC2 the politically correct shadow arts minister Mark Fisher and architect Sir Richard Rogers (both keen Labour men) get 45 minutes on Open Space to travel across London on top of a bus explaining how they could improve everything with the firm smack of centralised planning. If what you really want is a bit more about the ghastliness of men and the universal victimisation of women you could try Episode 2 of Fay Weldon's serial Growing Rich featuring that typical male, the devil (9.00 ITV), or the first in a new series of Roseanne, with its fat, foul-mouthed heroine (10.00 C4).</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Risk and Reward: New instrument blends bond and futures fund THE strong performance of futures funds this year, at a time when attractive returns are increasingly hard to come by, has aroused fresh interest in the sector. However, many investors are still afraid to take the plunge. Although futures funds have had a good run this year - in the first eight months the average total return was 17.45 per cent, according to the TASS Management index, which tracks their movements - their performance is highly volatile. In bad times, investors can see large portions of their investments wiped out rapidly. One solution has been to structure guaranteed funds - the bulk of the fund is used to buy zero-coupon bonds, with a much smaller portion allocated for trading. One criticism of these funds is that they are neither flesh nor fowl: the investor may be protected from the potential losses associated with futures funds, but the small size of the investment in futures will also limit potential gains. However, another option is available. On Friday, Citibank launched a hybrid instrument which is part futures fund, part bond. The structure is designed to attract investors, particularly bond investors, who would not feel comfortable with buying futures funds outright. The Ecu50m offering, called Fleetwings, is structured as a 10-year Eurobond, and will be rated triple-A by Standard &amp; Poor's, the ratings agency. For bond investors, this provides a high level of comfort. It also means that some institutions which would not be allowed to invest in futures funds can buy the triple-A rated bonds. The concept is similar to a guaranteed fund: 80 per cent of the proceeds of the offering is used to buy bonds issued by the Nordic Investment Bank, while the remaining 20 per cent will be invested in a managed futures trading programme operated by Waldner Financial, a futures specialist. Waldner was chosen because of its long audited track record, and also because it focuses on the currency and interest-rate sectors, with which bond investors are more comfortable. The NIB bonds act as collateral and also provide a minimum level of interest for holders of the Fleetwings bonds. The minimum interest starts at 6 1/2 per cent in the first year, but by year five has dropped to 1 1/2 per cent before falling to 1 per cent in years nine and 10. The coupon declines because the expectation is that the performance of the managed futures portion increases over time. On a historical basis, the return on this deal would be an annualised 13.1 per cent, according to Citibank, with gains concentrated in the latter years of the bonds' life. Every quarter, half the trading gains are set aside and the other half reinvested, to preserve some of the gains made in the trading account. Nevertheless, the relatively long life of the issue gives a sufficient time frame to substantially enhance the return. So what is the downside for investors? If only the minimum interest rate is paid, the investor will receive an average annual interest of around 3 per cent. In this case, investors would have done much better by buying plain vanilla bonds, since that is just half the current yield on 10-year Ecu bonds with triple-A ratings. However, according to a Citibank simulation, there is more that an 80 per cent probability of receiving a return of more than 10 per cent. This probability is simulated by taking the historical data points, and then assuming the pattern may not be replicated, so scrambling them. A handful of similar deals have already been launched. For example, in 1991 Waldner was involved in an Ecu100m deal, the proceeds of which were partly invested in Swiss Bank Corporation bonds and partly managed by Waldner. The decline in interest rates in the last few years may encourage more investors to depart from their traditional approach. Fleetwings is aimed at institutional investors and high net worth individuals: the minimum investment is Ecu10,000. Similar deals in other currencies could be launched. According to Citibank, most of the buyers of the issue had not previously bought futures funds.</p>

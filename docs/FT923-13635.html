			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: When surrender leads to heavy loss - The pitfalls of life policies LIFE MAY never be the same again. This week, nine of the UK's biggest life insurers admitted they faced a serious problem with early surrenders of life policies, and committed themselves to tackling it. A large and ambitious report, which they commissioned, showed that the recession had much to do with current high surrender rates, but also disclosed problems with the policies themselves. The verdict, according to Keith Bedell-Pearce of Prudential, was that the industry 'must do better'. None of this has come too soon. The companies were stung into action by a Securities and Investments Board report published last year which showed that during 1990, 37.1 per cent of unit-linked life policies, and 23 per cent of with-profits policies, were terminated within two years of being started. These disquieting figures were attacked by regulators and by the press - including the Financial Times. The industry's response was less contrite than it is now. Hugh Scurfield, general manager of Norwich Union, wrote a letter to the Financial Times which said: 'The investigation is flawed and I suggest no further conclusions should be drawn from it.' However, Norwich Union is one of the companies which conducted the research, and now accepts that there is a problem. Bedell-Pearce said some offices disagreed with the SIB survey 'at the margins', but added: 'There was a very clear message that rates of persistency had deteriorated, and that they were unacceptable. It was also clear that no hard reasons yet existed.' Early surrenders benefit no-one - investors get a poor return on the money, as the full benefits of the investment are only available to those who carry on to maturity, while insurers have to take substantially reduced profits, or even losses. Sometimes intermediaries will lose commission. The companies' survey attempted to find out why so many had surrendered their policies, by interviewing people who had done so within the last six months. It found that 68 per cent of them had done so because of a 'change in personal circumstances'. Of these, 10 per cent were caused by redundancy, 15 per cent by inability to afford the premiums and 7 per cent by a need for extra cash. These people tended to live in the south and the Midlands, where the recession is most severe. In 17 per cent of cases, consumers had allowed their policy to lapse because of product cover and value for money, while 14 per cent of lapses were due to problems with advice or service. Of these, problems with direct debits only accounted for 3 per cent of lapses. It seems that blatant bad advice such as churning - telling a customer to cash in an old policy and then pocketing the commission on the new one - is quite rare among advisers and sales agents. Only 3 per cent said they had been influenced explicitly by the advice of a financial adviser. While manifestly dishonest advice is rare, advice which is economical with the truth is more widespread. The survey found that only 81 per cent of customers were aware that not all their premiums would be returned if they surrendered, while more than one third of customers said they were not told about the financial implications of lapsing a policy. The survey, carried out by Survey Research Associates, made several important recommendations. It suggests that the life companies should: Review their sales processes to identify possible 'change of circumstances' issues; Communicate the serious financial implications of early surrender to customers more effectively; Improve quality of service; Consider more flexible 'customer-orientated' products. This phrase is revealing - a 25-year policy which penalises you for stopping any earlier certainly cannot be described as 'customer-orientated'. The shopping list of measures for extra flexibility produced by SRA also make eminent sense. They include: Variable premiums, a measure which has been made much easier by the move from traditional to unitised with-profits contracts; Premium holidays - at the outset you would be allowed to take a certain number of holidays between premiums; Longer hiatus periods between premiums being paid, which would allow customers greater scope for improved cash flow; Waiver of premiums, allowing the ultimate value of the policy to be reduced without terminating it; Special options for those hit by divorce or separation; Loan facilities - these could be extended. You could borrow at a preferential rate against the maturity value of the policy. The total debt outstanding would be deducted from that value; and Part encashment. All of these should make endowments more attractive than they are at present. It is questionable to what extent the report's findings exonerate the industry. They show that people are very prone to 'changes in personal circumstances'. This is just as well. Life would be very boring if one could expect to live through 25 years - the term for a mortgage-related endowment - without any significant changes in circumstances. The figure for people whose circumstances have changed suggests that the inherent inflexibility of endowments makes them inappropriate for customers who usually need flexibility. The best solution would be for them to buy a different product altogether. The most obvious, tax-efficient alternative is the personal equity plan (Pep). Bedell-Pearce admitted that the Pru would love to sell more Peps, a view echoed by other insurers. But he said the Pru still found it difficult to sell them, though recently Pep sales have increased. Another nagging issue is the fact that 32 per cent of people surrendered for the 'wrong' reasons - problems with the product or the intermediary. But the nine companies deserve great credit for acknowledging a problem which some in the industry still wanted to ignore, and going a long way to doing something about it. The roll of honour is: Commercial Union, Eagle Star, GA Life, Guardian Royal Exchange, Legal &amp; General, Norwich Union, Prudential, Royal Life, and Sun Alliance. All nine have committed themselves to improvements. They said regulatory changes to disclosure, which will force poor surrender values to be made clearer, and to training and competence of sales staff would both help. The companies are also committed to emphasising possible changes of circumstances. Laudably, they intend to be 'more pro-active in addressing industry issues.' So in future they will not wait for SIB to issue a damning survey, and then wait months before taking action.</p>

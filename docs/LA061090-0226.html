			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS DRAFT TODD BLYLEVEN IN 39TH ROUND  </P> <P> Villa Park High School pitcher Todd Blyleven, son of Angels' pitcher Bert, was  the club's 39th-round pick in last week's free agent amateur draft.  </P> <P> Todd, 8-2 as a senior with a 1.26 earned-run average and 80 strikeouts, has  been offered a scholarship by Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> "He has some options to consider and we're keeping both avenues open," said  Bert, who was a third-round pick from Santiago High School in Garden Grove in  1969. "We have to take into consideration where the Angels would expect him to  go, the money, things like that. I'm his father first. My only concern is for  my son."  </P> <P> Blyleven said he'd love to have his son as his Angel teammate. "It would  definitely be a good feeling if that could happen," he said. "I wouldn't mind  (retiring) if my son could take my place. That wouldn't be bad."  </P> <P> Elsewhere, Mike Bradish of Christ College Irvine has signed with the Chicago  White Sox. Bradish, a first baseman who batted .325 with 30 RBIs and seven home  runs, was drafted in the 13th round.  </P> <P> Buster Nietzke, an outfielder at Saddleback College, was drafted by the  Milwaukee Brewers in the 23rd round. Nietzke, an first team all-Orange Empire  selection as a freshman, doesn't expect to sign with Milwaukee this year.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Martin Beck contributed to this story.  </P></p>

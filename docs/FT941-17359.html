			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / House prices show increase of 'twice the inflation rate' House prices rose by more than 3 per cent last year, more than twice the latest published annual inflation rate, says Nationwide, Britain's second-largest building society. The society's figures, published yesterday, are thought to be at odds with a house-price survey due to be published tomorrow by Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender. According to Nationwide, house prices rose on average by 0.8 per cent in December, or Pounds 438. The society said that in the past 12 months the price of an average home had risen 3.3 per cent to Pounds 53,571. The Halifax survey, based on a larger sample of mortgage loans than the Nationwide's, is understood to point to a much more subdued recovery rate. Halifax is expected to say that the rise in house prices last year was close to the general rise in annual inflation of 1.4 per cent in November. This would mean that, according to Halifax, prices fell by less than 1 per cent last month. December is traditionally one of the weakest months of the year for house sales. The society has said it expects the pace of recovery to accelerate this year, although it has warned that there still could be occasional monthly price falls. Halifax has forecast that prices will rise by about 5 per cent this year, with the number of sales expected to rise by about 15 per cent. Nationwide internal forecasts are thought to take a similar view. Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's operations director, said yesterday: 'The modest upturn in the UK economy in 1993 has led to an increase in confidence in the housing market which in turn has been reflected in the rise in house prices in the last 12 months. 'As the economic recovery continues we expect confidence in the housing market to continue to improve in 1994, resulting in an increase in the number of transactions as buyers take advantage of the lowest mortgage interest rates for 20 years. This could well be translated into further price rises during 1994, probable slightly outpacing inflation.' Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at brokers UBS, said the figures firmed up predictions of a steady rise in prices this year. He added: 'Prices, whichever numbers you look at, have started to rise again  -at least in line with general inflation. This, together with better unemployment figures and the fact that houses are the most affordable for at least 15 years, should encourage the confidence of potential house-buyers. 'The snowball of recovery is beginning to grow in size.'</p>

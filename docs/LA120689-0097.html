			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Program Trading Activity Down Sharply: Program trading activity dropped sharply  in the first two weeks of November after an outcry over the controversial  strategy, which has been blamed for increasing market volatility, the New York  Stock Exchange reported. A steep decline in index arbitrage, the main form of  computerized program trading, reflected an exodus by large brokerages after the  strategy was blamed by some for worsening a stock market drop on Oct. 13. Index  arbitrage accounted for 38.7% of program trades from Nov. 6-10 and 25.7% from  Nov. 13-17, down from 53.8% in October, the NYSE said.  </P></p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Letter: When Lloyd's last lost money Sir, Amid the furore over Lloyd's losses, nobody seems to have noticed a salient fact in the Rowland Task Force report. In 1965, the last year of major overall loss, the deficit was Pounds 272.1m. This is Pounds 2,443m in present-day terms: much more than the Pounds 509.7m incurred for 1988, and the Pounds 1,350m foreseen for 1989.

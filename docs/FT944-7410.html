			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia mobilises for fight against deforestation - A look at initiatives aimed at saving the world's second biggest forested area In Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo, seemingly endless forests cover the landscape, creating the impression of an infinite resource. It is difficult to picture this vast, rugged, sparsely populated region stripped of most of its trees. Yet the World Bank warns that harvests from Indonesia's tropical forests, the world's largest after Brazil's, are running about 50 per cent higher than the estimated sustainable cut. Indonesia's minister of forestry, Mr Djamaludin Suryohadikusomo, has set in motion a plan to deal with the problems of deforestation, the first Indonesian minister to take such action. In September he introduced a restructuring of government regulations on forestry management, promising to crack down on logging companies that fail to manage their concessions responsibly. The regulations are aimed at loggers who cut trees outside their concession areas, illegally convert logged forest land to agriculture or fail to replant. Mr Djamaludin admitted there were only 113m ha of natural forest cover left in Indonesia, as opposed to earlier claims of 141m ha. The minister announced that as the current 20-year logging concessions expired, forest areas would be converted into a new type of management unit, operating on a long-term basis and having an average size of 100,000 ha. 'If someone is managing a forest area, as opposed to just having a licence to sell the stock in a concession area, then there is a far greater incentive to protect it,' commented a Jakarta-based forestry consultant. The current duration of concessions does not encourage replanting of trees that will take about 70 years to mature. Supporters of the new system argue that it will encourage loggers to make inventories of tree stocks, providing the data needed to maintain a constant growing stock and facilitating sustainable development of the resource. Not everyone is convinced, however. It could take 25 years to implement the system and at current rates of deforestation, Indonesia's forests do not have that much time left. It would be far more effective, argue some consultants, to create an independent policing system to ensure government regulations were observed. The Institute of Eco-labelling, set up by Indonesia's former minister of environment Mr Emil Salim, could take on this task. But progress has been thwarted by arguments between pressure groups, consultants and officials, who cannot agree on how the institute should be managed or what its purpose should be. The idea initially was to label forest products from a sustainable forest resource as 'environmentally sound', with manufacturers subscribing to the system voluntarily. The problem is that most Indonesian timber products are exported to Taiwan, Japan and Korea, where environmental concerns have low priority. This has convinced some that eco-labelling needs to be compulsory. An independent inspection team publishing its reports would ensure public accountability and a degree of transparency in the forestry sector that has not existed to date. The punishment of offenders would be left to the Ministry of Forestry. There is no doubt that Mr Djamaludin's team has powers to deal with offending loggers. Recently, the ministry took over 49 per cent of the shares in two concessions supplying timber giant PT Barito Pacific Timber, as punishment for irresponsible forest management. It was an unprecedented move that tackled one of the most powerful forces in the forestry sector and was designed to send warning signals to other concession holders. The question is whether Mr Djamaludin has the political clout to deal effectively with illegal and irresponsible logging. Indonesia's forestry sector is politically powerful and Mr Djamaludin's crackdown on offenders has been irregular and arbitrary as a result. The forest products sector is run almost single-handedly by timber merchant Mr Bob Hasan, who is close to the presidential family. There are five different forestry associations, all headed by Mr Hasan. The most significant, Apkindo, the association of plywood producers, is often regarded as a major culprit in accelerated deforestation. It operates as a cartel, setting prices for plywood below international levels, ensuring that Indonesian manufacturers keep the lion's share of the world market. Indonesia earned Dollars 4.5bn from exports of forest-based products last year, of which 75 per cent was from plywood. The association decides who gets an export licence, where a manufacturer will export to and at what price. Apkindo's political clout has been sufficient to ensure that concessions to manufacturers are cheap. Royalties on logs average about Dollars 22 a cubic metre, compared with between Dollars 60 to Dollars 80 in other parts of the world. 'This creates a cavalier attitude towards the resource,' said a forestry consultant. In an effort to slow down the rate of deforestation, Mr Djamaludin announced that the total annual allowable cut would be lowered to 22m cu m from 33m. It is a bold move, but does not address another cause of accelerated deforestation in Indonesia - illegal logging. Mr Indro Tjahjono, a co-ordinator at Skephi, an Indonesian pressure group working for forest preservation, says 40 to 60 per cent of all logging is illegal. Other estimates put the demand for illegal logs at around 60m cu m a year. The scale of illegal logging underlines the urgent need for effective policing. Ms Emmy Hafild, of the environmental pressure group Walhi, points out that about half of the Ministry of Forestry's employees work in Jakarta. 'They're in the wrong place,' she says. 'They should be out in the field guarding the forest.'</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Jubilee extension 'under threat' THE GOVERNMENT may use the collapse of Canary Wharf as an excuse for cancelling the Jubilee Line Tube extension, according to an administrator to the insolvent office project in London's Docklands, Vanessa Houlder writes. Mr Stephen Adamson, a partner at Ernst &amp; Young, who is an administrator to the project, said yesterday: 'It does seem illogical that if you're talking about a Pounds 1.7bn extension cost and you compare that with O&amp;Y's contribution that that would be the reason for cancelling the whole project . . . It seems that the collapse of Canary Wharf is being used as an excuse.' Olympia &amp; York, Canary Wharf's developers, had agreed to contribute Pounds 170m towards the extension. No agreement was signed to help to fund the extension before the project went into administration, the administrators emphasised. Mr Adamson also indicated that the government was interested in taking between 700,000 and 900,000 sq ft of office space in Canary Wharf for the relocation of civil servants.</p>

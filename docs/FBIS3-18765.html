What was  supposed to be the great meeting to present the League's  candidates was in fact little more than a pretext. This was  immediately apparent. It was clear later, too, when many people  left after his speech. By then the show was over.    But [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi did not  disappoint those who were expecting further polemics. He spoke  for 50 minutes, launching some sustained attacks and, in order  to remove any doubts, set his sights directly on [Forza Italia  leader] Berlusconi and the Christian Democrats. And he was  shooting to kill. Following the skirmishes of the past few  days, he made his intentions clear from the start: "Berlusconi  is the synthesis of the five-party alliance." To avoid any  misunderstandings, he added: "Our allies are a creation of the  DC [Christian Democratic Party]. Before dying, the DC decided to  create alternative structures that would enable the old leaders  to return. But we saw through that. And we stopped them."    Before an audience that was full of smiles, applause, and  scarves depicting Alberto da Giussano [medieval Lombard knight],  the League leader continued with a crescendo of theories,  explanations, and attacks. His reassuring, "we will honor the  electoral agreement," was not enough to make him softer his  tone. This, partly because he issued an explicit and  uncompromising appeal: "On your gray ballot papers, the ones  for the proportional quota, vote only for our symbol, and  encourage others to do the same. Do not look at those of our  allies. We must demonstrate our strength and make people  understand that we have nothing to do with the others... We  will have 200 deputies. We will not become confused with them,  and that goes for the presentation of candidates, too: Those  initiatives are Christian Democratic jamborees. But we are a  force of the people." And the people -- or, at least, his  people -- applauded him, interrupting him twice. First, they  listened to the long story of the accord that led to the pole  for freedoms, then it showed its appreciation of his umpteenth  charge against the DC: "We destroyed the DC key which, though  held in Palermo, in fact opened the strongholds of the North.  and I am not accusing the people of the South; I am blaming the  leadership class."    In the end none of the League's allies was spared.  Berlusconi, the Christian Democratic Center, and the Center  Union were analyzed, dissected, and overwhelmed by the torrent  of a Bossi in full flow. It is no coincidence that he said not a  word about the progressive forces, apart from a few very brief  mentions such as, "they are the enemies to be defeated." With  [Pact for Italy leader] Segni it was exactly the opposite: "He  imagined that he could do whatever he pleased, but we fixed him  right away. We forced him to return to grandpa [DC Secretary]  Martinazzoli...."    So at least for Bossi, the grand coalition of the pole for  freedoms was exclusively "a tactical choice." "Fellows," he  shouted, "do you remember what I told you? Never lower your  guard, do not trust anyone... Well, now I will repeat it even  louder! Yes, because this alliance served solely to wreck the  plans of those whose sole aim was to restore the Italian Social  Movement's [MSI] strength and to crush us. But we saw through  that and stopped them. And we will remain suspicious. Our  allies will have to accept our idea of federalism; we will not  allow ourselves to be enchanted by strange formulas... Have you  never wondered why the DC accepted an electoral reform that  decreed its demise? The answer is simple: It had already  agreed to help the MSI in the South, and it had already given  thought to some strange coalitions in the North." [passage  omitted]</p>

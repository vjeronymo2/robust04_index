			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Asia as a region: A forum for co-operation should be encouraged We all know that China contains roughly a quarter of the human race. Given that fact, it is remarkable how unimportant to the rest of the world it has been and, as of this moment, still is. For Japan, despite its proximity, China is no bigger a trading partner than Australia. As a market for British exports, it is one-quarter the size of Australia, and only just bigger than New Zealand. Precisely because China is so vast, its energies until now were turned inward. In the 19th and 20th centuries its development was held back by internal upheavals, as well as by foreign interference and conquest. From 1949 to 1978 it was walled in by a draconian form of communism. But since 1979 China has been changing at breakneck speed. During the 1980s growth averaged nearly 10 per cent a year, and after a brief dose of austerity following the 1989 Tiananmen massacre it climbed again to 12 per cent last year. Some of the implications are spelt out by Peter Ferdinand, of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, in a paper prepared for last weekend's UK-Japan 2000 Group meeting at Awashima, near Tokyo. He refers to 'rudimentary calculations at the IMF' suggesting that on current growth trends China could overtake Japan and become the second largest economy in the world 'around or soon after the year 2000'. Simple projections of current trends are nearly always wrong, of course. Mr Ferdinand lists political, economic, environmental, administrative and foreign policy problems that China now has to confront. But he also sees similarities between China's development model and those of other east Asian economies, which have sustained high growth for 20 years or more, based on a high ratio of savings to gross domestic product. Already there is a de facto 'Chinese economic area', linking Hong Kong and Taiwan to the mainland. This in turn, says Mr Ferdinand, will be increasingly integrated 'into the dynamism of the broader Asia-Pacific region'. It is thus quite plausible that Chinese growth will continue through this decade at an average of 7 per cent, while exports rise from their current 17 per cent share of GDP to at least 20 per cent. In that case, China's share of world trade could be 3.5 per cent by the year 2000 - the share that Canada, a G7 member, has now. China's military power will no doubt keep pace. It is currently buying large numbers of SU 27 and MiG 31 fighters from Russia, and has shown interest in acquiring an aircraft carrier from Ukraine. Increasing defence expenditure is a general trend throughout the region. In part, it reflects the increased spending power of states with rapidly growing economies, but it also stems from a general insecurity. Peace, a necessary condition for continued economic growth, is not taken for granted. Indeed, many of China's neighbours are less inclined to take it for granted than in the past, when the cold war made it reasonably certain that the US would remain militarily engaged in the region. Yet it is hard to believe that a regional arms race is the best way, either to encourage the US to stay in the region or to compensate for its withdrawal. What is needed is a multilateral political relationship which would both reflect and ensure the growing interdependence of the region's economies. East Asians are quick to tell you that their region does not lend itself to institutions such as Nato, the EC or the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. It lacks a common cultural heritage, they say, and even a clear geographical identity. The states of the region have divergent interests and different political systems. Behind these abstractions lurk more specific anxieties. Many fear a new Japanese hegemony, while Japan (rather like the UK in Europe) fears being forced to choose between a regional role and its special relationship with the US. The US itself has discouraged the East Asian Economic Caucus proposed by Malaysia, fearing it might lead to discrimination against US exports. Yet, ironically, the US has also, by pushing Japan to open its financial markets, helped bring about the beginnings of a 'yen zone' in which the dollar is losing ground. And there is no obvious reason why an Asian economic grouping should be any more protectionist than the North American free trade area. East Asia is even more dependent on international trade than are North America and western Europe; and so has even less interest than they do in a world of protectionist trading blocs. The emergence of China as an economic power should make multilateral relationships in Asia easier to manage because they would no longer automatically be dominated by Japan. It also makes them more necessary. If China is isolated it will remain suspicious of external powers, and more inclined to rely on military strength for its security, which in turn will make neighbouring states less secure. What is needed is a forum in which China and other states interested in east Asian security (which must include Russia and the US) can find ways of reassuring each other about their military capabilities and political intentions. The next post-ministerial conference of the Association of South-East Asian Nations would be a good place to start.</p>

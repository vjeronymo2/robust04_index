			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Fading hopes of a further cut in interest rates saw stock index futures surrender most of Tuesday's gains from a late squeeze in another lacklustre trading session, writes Joel kibazo. The first trade in the December contract on the FT-SE was struck at 2,750, some 3 points below the previous day's close, and the contract traded in a narrow range of 2,740 and 2,750 right through into the afternoon with profit taking, mainly from independent traders, playing the major role. Poor form in the fixed interest markets also played its part in dampening enthusiasm. It was however a large sell off by two leading US houses just before 3pm that led to the slide in December. It finished at 2,724, down 29 on Tuesday's session and around 6 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. A healthy premium was maintained for most of the session until just before the close when it briefly traded at a discount. Turnover was 5,482 contracts. Dealers talked of continued selling in after hours trading. In Traded options, the 10.10am expiry of several stock options provided the only excitement in another poor session and it accounted for a majority of the day's turnover. Total volume reached 28,248 lots with trade in the FT-SE 100 option a meagre 4,885 contracts. Asda was the busiest stock option with a day's total of 2,929.</p>

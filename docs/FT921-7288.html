			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Germany While UK investors agonise over whether to switch from equities to gilts, the opposite debate is raging in Germany. That was illustrated by yesterday's close above 1,700 on the DAX index despite a background of gloomy economic news. Admittedly the market remains vulnerable to a prolongation of the Bundesbank's tight monetary policy. But it is benefiting from the widespread perception that the medium-term outlook favours equities for reasons that go beyond the cycle. In theory, equity market reform should remove at least some of the discrimination against minority shareholders that has deterred buyers hitherto. European single market reforms promise increased competition in the insurance industry, leaving it uncomfortable with the safe, but relatively modest, returns available from the bond market. For the first time in modern German history, individuals are accumulating inherited wealth and wondering what to do with it. Since they are already affluent, they are more likely to take the risks of equity investment - all the more so since unification should push up the medium-term trend rate of German growth. Even if the Bundesbank goes in for overkill and the promised recovery does not materialise, bonds may not regain their traditional appeal. There is not much scope for a further fall in yields now those in the US have turned up. A large part of unification spending is still being dissipated in consumption, while wage rises have pushed up industry's cost base. Both factors speak for stubborn inflationary pressures even in a downturn. The choice seems to be between cash and equities: bonds are running a distant third.</p>

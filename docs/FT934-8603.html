			<p>931115 FT  15 NOV 93 / MI6 arms evidence to remain secret LORD Justice Scott has decided not to publish evidence given by an intelligence officer which contradicts statements made to the arms-for-Iraq inquiry by a Foreign Office official. The evidence given by an MI6 officer, identified only as Mr O, was heard at a private hearing last week after Mr Simon Sherrington, the Foreign Office official, had agreed to give his evidence in public. Mr Sherrington said that in October 1989 he had advised Mr William Waldegrave, then a Foreign Office minister, that lathes made by the Midlands company Matrix Churchill were not necessarily defence-related and therefore not in breach of government guidelines. Mr Sherrington said he had based his advice on a briefing from his MI6 contact, Mr O. The intelligence officer was questioned privately last week after it emerged that Mr Sherrington's evidence contradicted Mr O's written submission. It is understood that last week's private hearing has not resolved the differences.</p>

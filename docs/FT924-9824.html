			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Dollar firm in volatile trade THE DOLLAR firmed against leading currencies in volatile Tokyo trading this morning, as it became clearer that Mr Bill Clinton was on his way to victory in the US presidential election. In early Far East trade, US and UK banks, waiting for election results, sold dollars for D-Marks and sterling on technical position adjustments. But the start of the Clinton landslide prompted speculation of higher US interest rates due to a tighter fiscal policy, triggering dollar-buying. Traders in Tokyo said hopes that Mr Clinton would rebuild the US economy also pushed up the dollar. The US currency, firmed to DM1.5745 at lunchtime after opening at DM1.5683, while sterling slipped to Dollars 1.5415 from Dollars 1.5500 at the opening. Rumours that a Clinton aide wanted the dollar to fall to Y100 prompted speculators to sell dollars for yen. But the US currency ended the morning at Y123.35 against an opening Y122.5. Dealers in New York this morning said that, although trading was quiet, the reaction of currency markets to the early results showing a clear Clinton victory was predominantly favourable. Mr Michael Dessa, head of foreign exchange trading at Citibank, said: 'The landslide is regarded as a positive. The fact that Clinton will have a clear mandate means he will be able to affect many of his policies in his first year.' London dealers reported extremely volatile trading, with the dollar strengthening markedly as Tokyo traders took their lunchtime break. The election results had little impact on Japanese share prices. The Nikkei index was down some 50 points at around 16,800 at mid-session, with brokers saying investors were more concerned about poor corporate results. Hong Kong share prices fell initially. Brokers said that although a Clinton win was expected, some investors felt uncomfortable with the outcome.</p>

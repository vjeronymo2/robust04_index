			<p>BFN     [Text] At the High Council of the Republic-Transitional  Parliament [HCR-PT], we are a day away from D-day: In principle,  tomorrow is the deadline set by the HCR-PT for the political  group opposed to President Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko to decide  and nominate the prime minister who will head a 15-month  national union government in accordance with the new  constitution act promulgated on 9 April by Marshal Mobutu. On  the eve of this deadline, the atmosphere is far from positive.  Yesterday, we broadcast a few statements on the issue. Now we  bring you that of Lawyer Kamanda wa Kamanda, chairman of the  Nationalist Common Front and of the Union for the Republic and  Democracy [URD] subplatform.    [Begin recording] [Words indistinct] the Sacred Union of the  Radical Opposition [USOR]. But in view of the confusion created  by Mende's statement and by some articles published in the  newspapers which we consider inappropriate, on behalf of URD  members I would like to make a few clarifications that would  enable the national and international community to judge for  themselves.    On 13 April, at the People's Palace, USOR members of the URD  who took part in the political consultations of the People's  Palace turned up for the USOR executive committee meeting, which  featured a single item on its agenda: examination of the problem  posed by Article 78, paragraph 2, of the Interim Constitutional  Act [ACT], in light of the HCR-PT executive organ's statement on  12 April 1994. At this meeting, the URD members, through me,  their chairman, put forward a strategy and requested the others  to let us examine how best to organize the consultations  concerning Article 78 of the Constitutional Act and the HCR-PT  executive organ's statement. We discussed how to tackle item by  item a number of crucial issues, particularly the composition of  the USOR delegation to the consultations with members of the  Political Forces of the Conclave, the timing [preceding word in  English] and procedure of consultations with the other  components of USOR and Allies [USORAL].    3. [as heard] The signing of the protocol agreement which  concluded the political consultations of the People's Palace and  of the special disposition by those who had not yet signed it  and by the prime minister who would be presented at the end of  the consultations.    4. The position of the prime minister elected by the  Sovereign National Conference on this problem, on the protocol  agreement, on the special disposition, as well as on the ACT.    6. [as heard] The management of subsequent candidacies and  of  ambitions within USOR first, and then within USORAL, taking into  account the deadline problem for filing candidacies within USOR  to achieve a joint presentation of the prime minister to the  other members of the political class.    The USOR presidium on that day categorically refused to open  a debate on the issues I have just recalled and on the strategy  we put forward, declaring that everything had already been  settled at (?IMET) [expansion unknown] during the 6 April USOR  plenary session and that there was no longer anything to  discuss. The presidium had read the report which was prepared  at (?IMET) at the 6 April plenary session which was not attended  by URD members because they were uninformed, and at which  suspension measures or disciplinary actions were taken against  members of the URD for reasons we do not know.    Faced with this refusal to hold discussion and with the will  of the presidium to impose the fait accompli, the URD members  pulled out after having recorded their disapproval in the  meeting's report. Thus, they did not take part in the  resource-pooling meeting between USOR, the civil society, and  the Allies on 13 April at the People's Palace.    I would like to add that the URD members did not take part  in  any vote during this meeting, because no vote was conducted in  their presence, let alone in their absence, since only one group  stayed back at the meeting place and sought to impose its view.  After all, in relation to whom and to what other viewpoint  could any vote have taken place? This is why members of the URD  refute and rebut the shameless lies that were published in the  newspapers. [end recording]</p>

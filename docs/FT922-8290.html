			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Pay rise for Russian teachers and doctors THE RUSSIAN government yesterday more than doubled teachers' and doctors' pay after they had threatened to strike for a 10-fold increase. The two groups are among the poorest in Russia, earning about Rbs700 a month (the minimum wage has just been increased to Rbs900 to help people survive price liberalisation and rapid inflation). The government also announced plans to levy import taxes of 5-10 per cent to reduce the import bill. They will come into effect in August, and follow a 13 per cent increase in first quarter imports, compared with a year ago. That pushed the balance of payments deficit for the period to Dollars 2bn. Mr Andrei Vavilov, first deputy finance minister, said separately that the government aimed to unify import tariffs so that their average level did not exceed 15 per cent. Import taxes were suspended in January until June in order to encourage imports so there would be goods on the shelves when the government freed most consumer prices at the start of the year. Mr Pyotr Aven, foreign economic relations minister, told Interfax news agency the government was also considering an extra 28 per cent VAT on imports. Meanwhile, a law setting a framework for regulating currency operations was submitted to parliament yesterday. Rather than spelling out what would and what would not be allowed, it listed areas for which the central bank would have to provide more detailed regulations, such as conditions for exporting capital.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Markets: Stocks languish under the weather - Wall Street SUMMER put in an early appearance in New York this week, with a string of hot, humid days. While the tourists in Central Park enjoyed the August-like conditions, the weather-induced torpor took its toll on Wall Street, where trading on the stock markets was as suffocating as the climate outside. After a bright start on Monday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 18 points on a burst of late buying, the broader market quickly lost momentum. Over the next three and a half trading days, the Dow barely budged as investors struggled to find persuasive cause to buy, or sell, stocks. Many had hoped yesterday's April employment report would provide the motivation to return to the markets. Unfortunately, the employment data disappointed. The Labor department reported that the civilian unemployment rate remained unchanged at 7 per cent, and that non-farm payrolls rose 119,000 last month, slightly less than analysts had expected. Somewhat worryingly, the manufacturing sector lost 65,000 jobs during April, while the construction sector also reported a fall in the number of workers with jobs. This surprised analysts, although labour market statisticians once again blamed part of the declines on bad weather, claiming that heavy rains had depressed demand for construction work, and that poor weather nationwide had affected employment in food processing. Even the winter storms of March were dredged up again to explain some of the disappointing figures. Apparently, inventories had grown sharply in March because the winter storms had depressed demand, so in April companies chose to run down those inventories rather than hire fresh labour to manufacture new goods. Blaming the weather failed to impress investors, who were distinctly underwhelmed by the employment report. By late yesterday morning, three hours after the release of the data, the Dow was down two points, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was almost unchanged and the Nasdaq composite, which has proved the liveliest equity index this week, were slightly higher. A good clue to market sentiment was the performance of shares quoted on the American Stock Exchange. The Amex is home to many small-to-medium sized companies, and is usually overlooked because trading is so much heavier on the much bigger New York Stock Exchange. This week, however, the Amex's market value index hit record highs on three consecutive days while the Dow and S &amp; P 500 have languished. Analysts believe the strength of Amex stocks has been a reflection of investors' unease with the broader market, whose poor performance has forced investors to turn to smaller company stocks in the hope that they will produce returns. The strong run from Amex stocks aside, investors remain confused about the outlook for equities and corporate earnings, and their recent behaviour has been particularly skittish. Cable television stocks were a good example this week. On Tuesday, buyers rushed to the sector after analysts judged that the new industry regulations, unveiled by the Federal Communications Commission late on Monday, looked as if they were going to be less onerous for cable TV companies than had been feared originally. A string of big cable TV stocks rose handily on this news, including Time Warner, Cablevision, Comcast and Tele-Communications Inc. (Time Warner was given an additional lift by rumours in the market that Warren Buffett, the billionaire reknowned for his canny investments, had bought a 5 per cent stake in the company. As of yesterday, the rumour had not yet been confirmed.) The rally in the cable TV sector, however, proved extremely short-lived. On Wednesday, the buying gave way to heavy selling, and all the stocks that had recorded big advances on Tuesday gave most of their gains back as some leading industry analysts backed away from their initial judgment, warning that it was too early to tell what how the new regulations would effect cable TV companies. There was a similar display of investors' nerves in airline stocks this week. On Monday the big three - Delta, AMR (parent of American Airlines) and UAL - rose sharply, on hopes that the airline industry may have got over the worst of its slump. By yesterday, however, AMR, UAL and Delta share were back in the doghouse as investors suddenly got nervous about what the latest outbreak in the air fare wars might do the industry's bottom line.  ------------------------------- Monday      3446.46  +  18.91 Tuesday     3446.19  -   0.27 Wednesday   3449.10  +   2.91 Thursday    3441.90  -   7.20 Friday      3437.19  -   4.71  -------------------------------</p>

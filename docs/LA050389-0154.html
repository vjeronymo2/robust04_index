			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CLIPPERS TOLD TO ARBITRATE WITH WALTON  </P> <P> A judge ordered the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team today to meet with an  arbitrator to try to settle a contract dispute with former player Bill Walton  amid allegations of drug abuse.  </P> <P> It was the first time the Clippers publicly alleged that Walton had used  illegal drugs while under contract, which the team said hampered the player's  recovery from basketball injuries.  </P> <P> Walton, 36, who was accompanied by a lawyer in court, denied using drugs while  he played for the team, which moved from San Diego to Los Angeles in 1984.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arguments Rejected  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski rejected arguments by Clippers lawyer Gary  Platt that the team's dispute with Walton should be settled before a judge  rather than through arbitration.  </P> <P> Zebrowski said Walton's contract required the team to try to resolve the  dispute first in arbitration.  </P> <P> The Clippers contend that they should no longer have to make deferred payments  to Walton, whose contract calls for him to receive $200,000 a year through  1996, or $1.6 million.  </P></p>

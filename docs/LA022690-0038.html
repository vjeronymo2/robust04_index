			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. COUNCIL ALREADY IS HIGHEST-PAID IN U.S.;  </P> <P> CITY HALL: COUNCILMEN DEFEND REQUEST FOR A $33,000 PAY HIKE. BUT CRITICS SAY  THAT IS ASKING FOR TOO MUCH AT THE WRONG TIME.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council, which is seeking a nearly $33,000-a-year pay  raise, already is the highest paid city council in the country, according to a  Times survey.  </P> <P> If voters approve a June ballot measure, annual salaries for the 15 council  members will rise to $94,344 -- more than many big-city mayors and all but five  governors. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, for example, makes $80,000 a year,  and Gov. George Deukmejian receives $85,000.  </P> <P> Even with the 53% pay raise, however, council members will be making less than  dozens of Los Angeles city workers and department heads. Top police and fire  officials make more than $90,000 a year. The head of the Department of Airports  is paid $160,087, the city's highest annual salary.  </P> <P> In light of such city salaries and pay rates in private industry, some council  members believe that they are underpaid at $61,522 a year. During recent debate  on the issue, Councilman Joel Wachs suggested that he and his colleagues would  be content with the hourly wages of a plumber.  </P> <P> In fact, the council wants to be paid as much as Superior Court judges, who  make $94,344 a year. The pay of Los Angeles County supervisors already is tied  to that of the judges.  </P> <P> The public will be asked to vote on the council's request as part of a complex  ethics reform package that includes public financing of political campaigns, a  ban on outside work and honorariums, and restrictions on gifts.  </P> <P> Backers and opponents say the measure's success will hinge on whether voters  want to approve substantial pay raises for city elected officials, including  the mayor, city attorney and controller.  </P> <P> Council members and others say the raises are deserved and long overdue.  </P> <P> Arch Hardyment, executive director of L.A. Tax, a business association  concerned with city and county fiscal matters, said last week that council  members probably are underpaid and a raise may be merited.  </P> <P> "To attract high-quality people to run for (the council), it will have to be a  little bit higher paying than it is now," he said.  </P> <P> But Victor Tabbush, chairman of the city's salary commission, is troubled by  the amount of the council's pay request.  </P> <P> "It was highly irresponsible of the council to ignore the recommendation of the  official salary authority," said Tabbush, assistant dean of the UCLA Graduate  School of Management.  </P> <P> Tabbush headed the city commission that last year recommended raising council  pay to the level of Municipal Court judges, who now get $86,156 a year. That  amounts to $8,188 less than the council is seeking.  </P> <P> "We would like to be able to offer salaries that would attract qualified  people," he said. "Tying it to Municipal Court judge was on the generous side."  </P> <P> The original ethics proposal -- crafted by Councilman Michael Woo and a  commission appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley -- did not include a pay raise. The  salary increase was added last month by the council during debate on the ethics  package.  </P> <P> Geoffrey Cowan, head of the mayor's ethics commission, has said he supports a  pay raise but fears that such a steep raise could defeat the entire measure.  </P> <P> In arguing for higher salaries, City Council President John Ferraro has pointed  out that some 1,500 city workers make more than the council. Included are  dozens of police lieutenants, captains, commanders and deputy chiefs, fire  department captains, battalion chiefs, assistant chiefs and deputy chiefs, as  well as upper-level administrators in many departments.  </P> <P> However, Ferraro said last week he may change his mind and vote for a lower pay  raise when the ethics package comes before the council for a final time  Tuesday.  </P> <P> "I like to think I keep an open mind," Ferraro said. "I could change my mind.  This is something the whole council has to look at."  </P> <P> Woo said late last week that the council might reduce the size of its pay  request to make it more palatable to voters. "I think there is a desire on the  part of the majority of the council to see this package pass," he said. "A  majority will not want the salary issue to be the major obstacle."  </P> <P> Regardless of whether the council gets the raise, the members will continue to  get substantial perquisites, including seven city cars per council office, two  or three free offices at City Hall and in their districts, and annual budgets  of nearly $700,000 a year. Council members are free to decide how to spend  their allotments and most hire staffs of a dozen or more.  </P> <P> Other cities generally do not pay for district offices and few provide more  than one car per council member, according to a Times survey of the seven most  populous cities in the country and other data.  </P> <P> Mary Colby, research director of City &amp; State, a trade newspaper for  government officials, recently completed a national survey of city, county and  state pay levels. She said that the perquisites and staffing budgets received  by Los Angeles City Council members are "really amazing. . . . City councilmen  in other places get nothing; maybe some staff, but no cars."  </P> <P> Outside of Los Angeles, The Times found, the highest paid council members are  in Detroit, where the salary is $60,000 a year.  </P> <P> New York's 35 council members get a base pay of $55,000 a year. The council  speaker gets $90,000 and two committee chairmen get $77,500, but New York  council members generally earn less than their Los Angeles counterparts.  </P> <P> Philadelphia pays its 17 council members $40,000 a year. Houston, which has a  part-time council, pays its 14 members $34,800.  </P> <P> Chicago's 50 aldermen get $40,000 a year. San Diego's eight council members get  $45,000, and the mayor, who serves on the council, gets an additional $15,000.  </P> <P> Sheri Erlewine, a spokeswoman for the League of California Cities, suggested  that Los Angeles council members, as leaders in the state's largest city, may  merit higher pay than officials elsewhere.  </P> <P> "More and more cities are interested in (properly) compensating their elected  folks," she said. "City government is becoming so much more complex that it  takes a lot more time than it did 15 or 20 years ago. Most citizens do not  understand what it takes to be a local elected official."  </P> <P> That view is shared by Councilwoman Joy Picus, who argues that the Los Angeles  City Council has far greater responsibility for the day-to-day city business  than do councils in other large cities.  </P> <P> The Chicago City Council meets only twice a month, while Los Angeles council  members meet three times a week; each of Chicago's 50 aldermen represents far  fewer constituents than do Los Angeles' 15 council members.  </P> <P> "We have more responsibility and have full-time jobs," Picus said. "I think we  do as much constituent work easily as a congressional office."  </P> <P> Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said the Los Angeles council has far greater  responsibility than New York's council for the administration of city  government, including planning and zoning matters. A court-ordered  reorganization of New York city government will expand the size and  responsibilities of its council.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said that he believes the Los Angeles council is underpaid but  "couldn't have picked a worse time to try and get approval for a pay raise."  </P> <P> "In light of the ethics problems that have rocked this city in the last 10  months, it's going to be very difficult to convince voters that the mayor in  particular and elected officials in general are worthy of an increase."  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL SALARIES IN MAJOR CITIES  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES  </P> <P> Current Pay: $61,522  </P> <P> Proposed Pay: $94,344  </P> <P> Population: 3.2 million  </P> <P> Number of council members: 15  </P> <P> Allocations per council office: Office budget for council president, $705,513;  office budget per council member, $667,658; rent-free City Hall and district  offices; seven automobiles; home alarm system linked to Police Department.  </P> <P> NEW YORK  </P> <P> Current Pay: $55,000; Speaker, $90,000; two committee chairmen get $77,500;  most others get smaller additional amounts.  </P> <P> Population: 7.2 million  </P> <P> Number of council members: 35 (reorganization plans will add 15 members).  </P> <P> Allocations per council office: Office budget, $177,000; rent-free office near  City Hall.  </P> <P> CHICAGO  </P> <P> Current Pay: $40,000  </P> <P> Population: 3 million  </P> <P> Number of aldermen: 50  </P> <P> Allocations per alderman: $123,563 average for salaries; $5,480 travel  allowance; rent-free office at City Hall.  </P> <P> HOUSTON  </P> <P> Current Pay: $34,800  </P> <P> Population: 1.7 million  </P> <P> Number of council members: 14  </P> <P> Allocations per member: Office budget, $75,903; car allowance $4,200; rent-free  office at City Hall.  </P> <P> PHILADELPHIA  </P> <P> Current Pay: $40,000  </P> <P> Pay in 1992: $65,000; president, $80,000; majority leader, $68,000; minority  leader, $67,000.  </P> <P> Population: 1.6 million  </P> <P> Number of council members: 17  </P> <P> Allocations per member: Office budgets, $127,000-$188,000; one automobile;  rent-free office at City Hall.  </P> <P> DETROIT  </P> <P> Current Pay: $60,000; president, $63,000  </P> <P> Population: 1.1 million  </P> <P> Number of council members: 9  </P> <P> Allocations per member: Three administrative assistants, one secretary; one  automobile; rent-free office at City Hall.  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Current Pay: $45,000  </P> <P> Population: 1 million  </P> <P> Number of council members: 8  </P> <P> Allocations per member: Office budgets from $307,000 to $358,000; rent-free  office at City Hall; tickets to professional sports events.  </P></p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Stanhope Properties Pounds 15.4m in the red STANHOPE Properties, the joint owner of the Broadgate complex in the City of London, yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 15.4m for the first half of 1992, marginally up on the comparative Pounds 15.3m which included Pounds 1.19m abortive merger costs. The company also announced that Mr Paul Reichmann, head of Olympia &amp; York, the crippled property developer that owned a third of Stanhope, had resigned from the board. Stanhope said its recovery was largely dependent upon increasing values at Broadgate, which were likely to benefit from the rising demand from tenants and investors that stemmed from the fall in interest rates and sterling. 'If the estimates of future growth projected by leading surveyors are met, the Broadgate assets will be among the first to benefit,' it said. However, its optimism was tempered by the difficulties in letting its unoccupied buildings, including Ludgate, the office complex on the western edge of the City. 'It would be prudent at this stage to envisage a further net reduction in the value of the group's property assets,' it said. Stanhope, which is part of the London regeneration Consortium redeveloping land around King's Cross, said it would receive compensation if the government chose to make St Pancras, rather than Kings Cross, the terminus for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. The compensation could be worth several million pounds, it said. Turnover rose from Pounds 24.3m to Pounds 27.5m. Net interest payable surged from Pounds 7.85m to Pounds 11.6m, partly as a result of higher average borrowings and partly of a changed accounting policy. Losses per share increased from 9.21p to 9.26p.</p>

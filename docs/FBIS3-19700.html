			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Michael Hill: "Temporary Compromise"] </F>   [Text] He will not "drink to it until everything down to  the smallest detail has been settled," Transport Minister  Matthias Wissmann said on the agreement achieved in the  German-U.S. aviation dispute on Friday [18 March]. Yet --  putting it simply -- everything will remain much the same for  the U.S. side; the capacity reduction in U.S. flights to Germany  and beyond Germany, which were the starting point of talks about  a new German-U.S. aviation agreement last year, will not take  place. The German side has achieved that Lufthansa will be able  to start the much-discussed code-sharing with its partner United  Airlines as of 1 May. In addition, the airlines of the two  countries, together with other partners, may offer flights going  from Germany to the East, and from the United States to Latin  America and the Caribbean, under their own flight numbers. Yet,  the latest agreement will only remain a temporary arrangement.    On 15 May, representatives of the two countries are to meet  to discuss the medium-term enforcement of an "open sky" -- the  complete liberalization of aviation between the United States  and Germany. In four years, at the latest, the agreement being  concluded now will be replaced by a more comprehensive  "bilateral or multinational settlement." One can expect the  Brussels Commission's plans to replace existing bilateral  aviation agreements between individual European Union [EU]  members by EU agreements negotiated in Brussels to have been  effected by then.    Now -- for the next four years -- Lufthansa can offer an  increasing number of flights to destinations that have so far  not been included in its program, with through flight numbers,  changing between Lufthansa and United planes.    But this code-sharing must remain a makeshift solution. If  the problem of neutral presentation, especially in the U.S.  travel agency reservation systems, did not exist, the advantages  in which this term leads the customer to believe could also have  been achieved by a cooperation agreement among individual  airlines: Good connections, through check-in, joint programs  for frequent travelers, other joint services, such as the use of  lounges, are not subject to code-sharing.    European and U.S. consumer protection organizations, as well  as Brussels, are beginning to realize that a joint flight  number, where you have to change planes once or twice and change  airlines, makes the traveler believe that he gets to his  destination "in one go." Alliances, such as the one Swissair has  formed with Delta Airlines going west, and with Singapore  Airlines going to Asia, are more honest to the user.    Now the German-U.S. aviation problem has -- hopefully --  been  settled for the next four years. Lufthansa must use this time  to continue getting its own house in order so that it can do  without protective fences against non-EU countries, as is  already the case with EU airlines. By the end of this decade,  aviation must do without any protective fences by the state and  must only be subject to GATT competition regulations.</p>

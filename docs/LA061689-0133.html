			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: SUN'S GRAZIANO JOINS RIVAL APPLE COMPUTER  </P> <P> Joseph A. Graziano has resigned as vice president of finance and chief  financial officer at Sun Microsystems Inc. to join rival Apple Computer Inc. in  a similar position.  </P> <P> This is the second tour of duty at Apple for the 45-year-old Graziano, who  served as the company's chief financial officer from October, 1981, to May,  1985.  </P> <P> Graziano is the second high-ranking executive to leave Sun this spring. In  April, executive vice president Bernard Lacroute abruptly resigned. No reasons  were offered and Lacroute has not taken another post.  </P> <P> Graziano's switch was not viewed with great alarm by analysts in Silicon  Valley, where job hopping among high tech companies is a fact of life. Over the  past year alone, Sun has gained two product marketing managers from Apple,  including Chuck Berger, now Sun's vice president for product marketing. Apple  hired away Jim Davis, Sun's former director of software product marketing.  </P> <P> Graziano succeeds Deborah A. Coleman, who took a medical leave of absence from  Apple late last year. At the time, Coleman said she wanted to lose the weight  she had gained while in the CFO position and assume a less demanding role in  the company.  </P> <P> A Sun insider said it was well known within the high tech community in Silicon  Valley that Coleman's post was vacant, and Graziano had been weighing for a  while whether to return to the post. Because Apple's revenue is about four  times higher than Sun's, the shift was widely viewed as a career-enhancing move  for Graziano.  </P> <P> William J. Raduchel, vice president of corporate planning and development, has  been named acting chief financial officer at Sun. CARLA LAZZARESCHI  </P></p>

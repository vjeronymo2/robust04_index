			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Black gets month to mount bid for News MR CONRAD Black, the Canadian publisher who owns the Daily Telegraph, has been given one month to see if he can forge a deal to buy the New York Daily News, the paper said yesterday, Reuter reports. The Daily News, currently under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law, has been seeking a new buyer since the publishing empire of Mr Robert Maxwell, its last owner, collapsed last year. Mr Black, who has extensive interests in Canada and also owns the Jerusalem Post, was given the go-ahead to begin negotiations to buy the paper at a meeting with the Daily News management, unions and creditors on Tuesday. The paper said the go-ahead did not constitute approval of Mr Black's proposal to buy it, but one member of the 'working group' at the meeting was quoted by the paper as saying that the decision meant that the Canadian publisher has now become the front-runner. Mr Black was given four weeks to see if he could fashion a deal through Hollinger, his Vancouver-based company. If he fails, the working group said there were other alternatives. One was to turn to Mr Mort Zuckerman, a real estate developer who has also made a bid for the paper. Also there was speculation that Mr Black might be interested in a joint deal with Mr Peter Kalikow, the owner of the New York Post. But it is thought that Mr Kalikow and Mr Black's discussions have ended. New York newspaper industry sources said a deal to buy the Daily News could total about Dollars 100m (Pounds 56.4m) - about Dollars 30m to pay off creditors, another Dollars 30m to buy out staff and Dollars 40m in working capital to modernise the paper.</p>

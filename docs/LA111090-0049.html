			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHITTIER CHRISTIAN FOILS BRETHREN BID  </P> <P> Phil Bravo, Whittier Christian High School's football coach, knew his team  didn't need any fancy offense Friday night against Brethren Christian.  </P> <P> He just turned tailback Rex Pritchard loose.  </P> <P> Pritchard ran for 176 yards in 16 carries and scored five touchdowns as  Whittier Christian won its second consecutive Olympic League title with a 43-34  victory over Brethren Christian at Lakewood High School.  </P> <P> Pritchard's performance overshadowed a strong game by Brethren Christian  tailback Frank Brady.  </P> <P> Brady rushed for 145 yards and three touchdowns in 19 carries. He also caught  two pases for 68 yards, including a 24-yard pass from Brandon Stott with 3:35  left.  </P> <P> But it was Pritchard who made the difference in the fourth quarter. He scored  on runs of 12 and four yards in the final quarter as Whittier Christian (9-0,  4-0) overcame a 20-19 deficit.  </P> <P> Bravo's assessment of Pritchard's play: "Rex played a great game. We came out  pumped."  </P> <P> "I'm proud of all our kids," Bravo said. "No one gave them respect all year.  Last year, when we had (running backs) Scott Jordan and Ron Papazian, we got a  lot of attention.  </P> <P> "But no one gave us a look this year. All we heard about was the 'Sweet 17'  (Brethren Christian's 17 players) and Orange Lutheran."  </P> <P> The loss left Brethren Christian's Division IX Playoff hopes in jeopardy with  the Warriors (7-2, 2-2) needing a victory by Ontario Christian over Orange  Lutheran tonight to qualify.  </P> <P> Pritchard scored three first-half touchdowns on runs of 12, 26 and 10 yards. He  had 94 yards rushing in 10 carries as Whittier Christian led, 19-13, at  halftime.  </P> <P> Brady, who had 65 yards in eight first-half carries, scored on runs of 11 and  five yards.  </P> <P> Brady was a workhorse on Brethren Christian's opening drive of the second half.  He caught a 44-yard pass from Stott and later scored on a four-yard run, giving  Brethren Christian a 20-19 lead.  </P> <P> Whittier Christian came back to score two possessions later, driving 70 yards  in six plays. A 12-yard touchdown run by Pritchard with 10:08 left in the  fourth quarter gave Whittier Christian the lead for good, 27-20.  </P> <P> The Heralds pushed the lead to 35-20 when Carl Martinez scored on a seven-yard  run and Ron Rector added a two-point conversion run.  </P></p>

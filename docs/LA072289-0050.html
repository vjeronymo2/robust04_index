			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE MEADOWS PARKING  </P> <P> After a rock concert on July 8, it took me 2 3/4 hours to get out of the  parking lot of Irvine Meadows Amphitheater. This was a deterioration from two  months earlier, when it took just under two hours to get out after a show.  </P> <P> Once the concert managers have our ticket money and concessions money, they  don't seem to care what happens to us; after all, we are a captive audience  when the concert is over.  </P> <P> JEANNE DOUGLAS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

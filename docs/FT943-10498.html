			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: Vereinsbank ahead 8% midway First-half operating profits at the Bayerische Vereinsbank group rose 8.7 per cent to DM574m (Dollars 365.6m) compared with the first six months of last year, in spite of losses on own-account trading and sharply increased capital spending. The main force behind the result was the Bavarian institution's strength in the busy German mortgage market, which helped bolster interest income by 17.5 per cent to just over DM2bn. This strength - the bank is believed to control more than 20 per cent of domestic mortgage business - showed in a 36.5 per cent surge in total operating profits at the German holding company. Net interest income surged almost 26 per cent to DM1.47bn. While the recent volatility in securities markets led to higher write-downs for bonds and a loss of DM7.9m on its own-account business after a profit of DM150m in the first half of 1993, commission income rose almost 8 per cent to DM543m. Partial operating income, excluding own-account trading results and before risk provisions, rose almost 21 per cent to DM956.5m. Provisions for bad and doubtful debts were some 12 per cent lower at DM376m. In common with other banks reporting recently - excluding Deutsche - Bayerische has this year started publishing half-time figures in direct comparison with the first half of the previous accounting period. . Bayerische said the German practice of comparing an interim figure with the relevant proportion of the previous year's full results would continue in parallel until agreement had been reached on a common domestic standard.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Peter Mackler] </F>   [Text] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 31 (AFP) -- Moscow plans to  limit the presence of foreign commercial banks in Russia to  encourage the activity of local institutions, central bank  chairman Victor Gerashchenko said here Monday [31 January].    Gerashchenko said at the World Economic Forum here that  foreign banks represent 12 percent of the one trillion rubles  (646 million dollars) in capital held by the Russian banking  community.    "We think that for a certain period of time, we will keep  this limitation," he told AFP. "We need to promote our  commercial banks."    Moscow has already moved to curb the activities of foreign  commercial banks operating under license in Russia, with only  three of the 12 allowed to handle transactions with Russian  residents.    Gerashchenko also said that $20 billion placed by Russian  banks abroad was not being properly used. He said of the  country's 2,090 commercial banks, only 100 or so were serious  institutions.    Boris Nemtsov, governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region, which  is a showcase for Russian reforms, criticised the fact that the  20 billion dollars was being placed overseas at all. "Our first  job it to direct Russian money to our economy," he said.    Gerashchenko said Russia was also looking at tax breaks and  other special arrangements to attract selected foreign firms to  invest in Russia. "We need companies with some type of  pioneering experience," he said.    The central bank chief echoed the determination of Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin not to rely exclusively on monetary  policy to fight rampant inflation in Russia.    He said the monetary component of Russia's inflation was  "insignificant" and most of it was due to the state firms  factoring all their costs into their prices while not using all  their capacity.    The key, Gerashchenko said, was to selectively encourage  production. "If we don't have a government-supported investment  policy we will be unable through monetarist means to fight  inflation."    Gerashchenko said that government expenditures for 1993  totaled 33.2 trillion rubles ($21 billion) and income was about  24 trillion ($15.5 billion).    He said out of the 24 trillion rubles in income, 17 trillion  was normal tax revenues and 6.8 trillion was from sales of  assets to the central bank.    Gerashchenko swore here that he was committed to free-market  reforms in Russia, but came under renewed attack by critics who  accused him of incompetence.    Jeffrey Sachs, former advisor to President Boris Yeltsin,  said that for the last two years, Gerashchenko and other  conservatives undermined economic reform in Russia by  "demonstrating devastating disdain" for sound money management.    "Gerashchenko is showing no understanding that money is not  a  political toy," said Sachs.</p>

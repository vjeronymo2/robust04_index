			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading Light bargain hunting and increased stability in bond and currency markets brought an advance to stock index futures, although volume remained modest, writes Joel Kibazo. After an initial setback in the September contract on the FT-SE 100 which saw it fall to 2,934 in the first half-hour of trading, the contract moved steadily ahead for most of the day. A successful French bond auction boosted both European bond and gilt markets, encouraging buying of the September contract. Its advance helped to pull the underlying cash market higher. The decision by the Bundesbank to make no change to its key interest rates had no impact on trading, although uncertainty surrounding the dollar continued. The firm opening on Wall Street brought further buying and September climbed to a day's high of 2,982. It closed at 2,970, up 23 from its previous finish and at a 5-point premium to cash. Volume, at 11,746, showed a slight improvement. Turnover in the traded options returned to a low level, totalling only 26,588 lots. The day's activity in the index options brought business of 8,446 in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,217 in the Euro FT-SE. GEC was the busiest stock option, having 1,431 contracts transacted.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by interim President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya at the </F> funeral for late President Cyprien Ntaryamira in Bujumbura on 16  April]    [Excerpts] His excellency, the head of state and friends,  their excellencies Ministers Bernard Ciza and Cyriaque Simbizi  and friends. We are meeting just four months and a week after  coming here in your company, to bid farewell to President  Ndadaye, his aides and other friends who were killed during the  events of 21 October 1993. [passage omitted]    President of the Republic, Cyprien Ntaryamira, all  Burundians  are currently crying because of you. You leave us at a time  when we hoped to get a lot from you. Who could have thought  that the plane you travelled on when you were trying to reach  your country as soon as possible could have killed you. Now you  are dead. You left this world on 6 April 1994. You died  outside the country. Nobody has seen you since or heard you  talking. You left this world without quarreling with anybody.  Burundians are also biding farewell to Ministers Ciza Bernard  and Cyriaque Simbizi who were traveling with you.    They died together with you. We are not aware of the content  of your last conversation. But what we do know is that Burundi  has lost men, wise men, who only dreamed of fighting and  strengthening peace for freedom, democratic rule, and  development for all Burundians. Let the Almighty welcome you in  his kingdom and give you an everlasting life. There is no doubt  about this. Our prayers will be accepted because neither you,  the head of state, nor Ministers Ciza and Simbizi, did wrong to  anyone. In the event of you having wronged any Burundian or  foreigner, we join you to ask for forgiveness.    Burundians, this is the second time that you lose a head of  state in not more than six months. Some think that God has let  us down. Others say that God may be testing us. Still others  say this is the pain felt by a mother while giving birth to a  baby. Here in Burundi, we are looking for a good path that can  help us release ourselves from the ropes of divisionism in our  country. Looking at it, none of the above comments are wrong.  Our country is going through a difficult time. It is therefore  necessary that Burundians unite, so that Hutus, Tutsis, and Twas  know that they are brothers; so that they unite to build a new  Burundi, a peaceful Burundi in which justice and development  prevails for all; so that the peace prevailing in Burundi will  also spread to the whole of our region.

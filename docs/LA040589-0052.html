			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV ASKS LATIN ARMS BAN;  </P> <P> BUT SOVIET AID TO NICARAGUA COULD CONTINUE UNDER TERMS OF HIS PLAN  </P> <P> Proclaiming a "real possibility of guaranteeing peace in Central America,"  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called Tuesday for an end to "military  supplies to Latin America from any part of the world."  </P> <P> But by conditioning his plea on U.S. behavior in Central America, he implicitly  left open the possibility that Soviet arms aid to Nicaragua will continue  despite a plea from Washington last week that he announce an end to such aid  during his first visit to Cuba.  </P> <P> The Soviets supply more than $1 billion annually in arms and economic aid to  the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The United States supplies arms to El  Salvador, Honduras and other countries in the region.  </P> <P> Earlier, at a brief ceremony at Havana's Palace of Conventions, Gorbachev and  Castro signed a peace and friendship treaty between their countries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Political Means'  </P> <P> The treaty said the two countries would "contribute to the solution of regional  conflicts and hotbeds of tension through negotiated political means."  </P> <P> In a speech to Cuba's rubber-stamp National Assembly that wound up his  three-day visit here, Gorbachev praised the accord agreed to by five Central  American nations for ending the conflict between Nicaragua and the Contras. But  he said its success "will depend to a large extent" on the future behavior of  the United States and Nicaragua's Central American neighbors.  </P> <P> "We are worried about (the U.S.) decision to continue assisting the Contras,"  he said, stressing that the conflict requires "a Latin American solution . . .  without any foreign interference."  </P> <P> The Bush Administration and congressional leaders agreed last month to continue  non-military aid to the Contras, at the rate of about $4.5 million a month,  until elections are held in Nicaragua next February.  </P> <P> Gorbachev curtly dismissed a statement by Vice President Dan Quayle that  Central America is of paramount concern to Washington because it is the "back  yard of the United States."  </P> <P> "We have analyzed this with Fidel Castro, and we are fully convinced this  problem can only be solved through political means," Gorbachev said. "There now  exists the real possibility of guaranteeing peace, and one of the basic  conditions would be to put an end to military supplies to Latin America from  any part of the world."  </P> <P> His words, translated as he spoke by a Cuban interpreter, appeared to suggest  an end to all Latin arms aid by the United States before the Soviets would  follow suit in Nicaragua. Thus, while his remarks may have created a slight  opening for discussion, they did not represent the breakthrough that President  Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III apparently had hoped for when  they called for evidence during the Cuba visit of what Gorbachev has called the  Kremlin's "new thinking" about foreign policy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'U.S. Always Interested'  </P> <P> In Washington, White House spokesman Roman Popakiuk said: "We are always  interested in what Mr. Gorbachev has to say. However we will have to give his  speech careful study before we offer any comments. We will be examining it with  a view to whether or not it offers the 'new thinking' the Soviets keep  referring to on various issues."  </P> <P> However, the Soviet leader did restate principles that represent a departure  from the traditional Marxist foreign policy of his predecessors.  </P> <P> "The Soviet Union does not seek for itself political, strategic or military  advantage in the Western Hemisphere. . . ," he said. "The Soviet Union has not  and does not intend to have naval, air force or missile bases in Latin America,  or deploy nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction there."  </P> <P> Underscoring the remarks, he warned of "extremely grave consequences" if the  United States and Pakistan intensify their support of rebels fighting the  Soviet-backed government of Afghanistan.  </P> <P> But Gorbachev was generally positive in some of his other remarks about the  United States. During a press conference after the speech, he spoke approvingly  of U.S.-Soviet cooperation in a treaty to eliminate mid-range nuclear missiles  and in talks to reduce conventional weapons in Europe and to eliminate chemical  weapons.  </P> <P> "For the first time since World War II we have brought light to the solution of  international problems that for decades have poisoned international life," he  said. Adding the hope for continued progress in improving relations with the  West, he said "we must triple our collective efforts to avoid holocaust."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Main Thrust of Speech  </P> <P> The main thrust of Gorbachev's speech concerned Soviet relations with Cuba.  Before the visit, many observers had described those relations as tense, as  Castro continued to reject for Cuba the examples of Gorbachev's glasnost  (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) reforms. The Soviets are known to be  impatient with the inefficient use of the more than $5 billion in economic aid  they send annually to Cuba. Soviet experts have urged changes in Cuba's rigid  bureaucracy.  </P> <P> However, Gorbachev dismissed the speculation "that we would meet as enemies" as  "pure invention."  </P> <P> "Our friendship today is greater than ever," he said. "Each country solves the  problems of socialist transformation on the basis of its own political  experience, its own development, its own traditions."  </P> <P> In introducing the Soviet president with a speech of more than 50 minutes --  almost as long as the main event -- Castro also derided the speculation of a  breach between the longtime allies. "We have no differences whatsoever with the  Soviet Union," he said, pointing out that the internal difficulties of the two  countries have been very different.  </P> <P> "It would be absurd to purport that we should apply in a country of 10 million  inhabitants the formulas of a country with 285 million inhabitants," he said ".  . . Anyone can see this is madness."  </P> <P> Castro even conceded to the Soviets the right to use capitalist approaches to  solving problems.  </P> <P> "If a socialist country wants to build capitalism, we must respect their  right," he said. "We have no right to interfere with that."  </P> <P> It appeared from the remark that if there was a rivalry between the two men  before their meeting, Gorbachev came out the winner.  </P> <P> The two also dismissed reports that Gorbachev would forgive Cuba's $9-billion  to $10 billion debt to the Soviet Union. Gorbachev acknowledged that the  subject was discussed and said "we agreed to continue our analysis." But Castro  said he did not want the debt forgiven because it exists on such soft terms,  with frequent rescheduling and postponements, that it is not a problem for  Cuba.  </P> <P> In his speech and the joint press conference with Castro, Gorbachev called for  a new "North, South, East and West" dialogue on debt problems, suggesting a  new, permanent institution in the United Nations to analyze the problem and  plan strategies to solve it.  </P> <P> "It is one of the most serious problems of civilization," he said, adding that  he did not believe it would be solved until such an organization takes a global  view of it.  </P></p>

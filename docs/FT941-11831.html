			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Marks and Spencer Consumers will doubtless feel safe with a pension from Marks and Spencer, but whether they will actually go out and buy one is another matter. Given most people's reluctance, the quip that insurance is sold and not bought carries a good deal of weight. It is a premise of the life industry that without a salesman's insistent patter in the family home, clients will not sign on the dotted line. Getting foot-dragging consumers to trot along to the local M&amp;S store voluntarily may thus be a tall order. Marks and Spencer is, however, touching on some important trends. Consumers are finally catching on to the large commissions paid on life-related products. Now that these are to be disclosed, pressure will mount to cut charges. That will require a lower cost base, which M&amp;S is in a better position to provide than traditional insurance sales forces, independent advisers or even the banks. The industry may thus move to a much lower cost base. The other trend is towards simplicity. Whatever the marketing hype of fund management groups, there can be little need for almost as many unit trusts as there are quoted UK companies. Consumers may place a premium on off-the-peg financial planning and simple products to go with it. This is classic M&amp;S territory. While purists may quibble, the mass market may be better served by a standardised M&amp;S financial product than the inappropriate personal pensions many have thus far been sold. The only consolation for life companies is that Marks and Spencers' inherent caution leaves a breathing space for the industry.</p>

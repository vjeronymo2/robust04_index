			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Regulators get to work on capital adequacy standards THE regulatory revolution which overtook the banking industry in the late 1980s will soon hit the international bond market. At the heart of the changes are common capital adequacy standards for securities firms currently being drafted by international regulators. Capital adequacy standards ensure that institutions maintain sufficient capital to back loans or bonds held on the balance sheet. Capital can absorb losses, protecting the bank or securities firm against failure should the assets turn bad. International banks have been working towards common capital standards since the Basle accord was signed in 1988. The effect has been profound, making capital a rare commodity and forcing banks to focus on return on capital as a key measure of profitability across different areas of business. However, securities firms and the securities operations of banks, including the underwriting and trading of bonds, were not included in the Basle framework. A striking feature of the international bond market is how few syndicate officials have more than a sketchy idea of how much capital is tied up in their business - and hence the return on capital they are able to deliver. If the bond market follows the banking industry, this will change dramatically. The negotiations which affect the Eurobond market are taking place at two levels. The Basle committee of central bank regulators and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) recently agreed the ground-rules for capital adequacy regulations for securities trading. In addition, European Community governments are working on a capital adequacy directive and a large exposures directive, which cover similar ground. Eurobond firms based in London, the heart of the primary market, currently work under capital adequacy rules laid down by the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA). Under SFA rules, core capital comprises shareholders' funds, but this can be supplemented up to four times by subordinated loans from the parent company. The amount of capital which has to be set aside against bond holdings is decided by: the value of securities held; the currency in which the position is denominated (volatile Escudos carry a higher capital weighting than dollars or Ecu, for example); the maturity of the securities (a holding of 30-year bonds requires more capital than a holding of two-year notes); and the credit quality of the issuer. The net result is that capital requirements can be less than 1 per cent for a holding of short maturity bonds issued by a high-grade issuer in a low-volatility currency. Alternatively, a holding of 20-year bonds issued by a sub-investment grade company in a high-volatility currency can carry a 30 per cent capital requirement. The same system applies to bonds held in the process of new issue underwriting, except that there is 'grace' period until the closing date of the deal, in which only half the usual amount of capital is required. The Basle/IOSCO agreement and early drafts of the capital adequacy directive differ from these regulations in several key respects: The ratio of subordinated capital to shareholders' funds is lowered from 4:1 under SFA rules to just 2.5:1. If this is carried forward, the parent companies will have to inject more pure equity capital into their Eurobond operations, making them more expensive to run: The credit quality of the issuer is probably given more weight than under the SFA rules, making it more expensive to hold corporate bonds than government or supranational paper. This could discourage trading of corporate bonds and, possibly, raise underwriting costs: The Basle/IOSCO agreement does not cover underwriting risks, avoiding the debate over when capital adequacy requirements should start to 'bite' on underwriting positions. However, EC legislation will tackle this issue. Early indications are that the current underwriting exemption under SFA rules may be replaced by more onerous regulations. The International Primary Markets Association, which represents new issue firms, is concerned that the new regulations will impose an excessive cost on the underwriting business. Privately, senior bankers acknowledge that regulations which damage the fragile profitability of the primary Eurobond market would, at best, lead to the withdrawal of less profitable firms. At worst, additional costs would have to be passed through to borrowers, making the primary Eurobond market a less attractive source of funding.</p>

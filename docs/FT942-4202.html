			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chilean copper project expected to begin producing this month Quebrada Blanca, the first of several medium and large-scale copper projects scheduled to start up in Chile over the next few years, is expected to begin production by the end of this month, according to Mr James Drake, general manager. The mine, a Dollars 360m Canadian-Chilean project, should reach full capacity of 75,000 tonnes of grade A copper cathodes by the start of 1995 and is expected to have a life of 14 years. Quebrada Blanca is a Chilean-registered company formed by shareholders Cominco, Cominco Resources International and Teck Corporation of Canada, which have a total equity stake of 76.5 per cent, Minera Pudahuel of Chile (13.5 per cent) and state company Empresa Nacional de Mineria (10 per cent). Cominco is responsible for design, construction and operation of the mine, which will have a staff of 500. Quebrada Blanca will use bacterial heap leaching and solvent-extraction-electro-winning (SX-EW) technology to exploit the 89m-tonne secondary sulphide ore body, which has an average grade of 1.3 per cent copper. Production costs at the mine, situated in the far north of the Atacama desert at an altitude of 4,300m, are expected to be less than 50 cents a pound. When the main deposit is exhausted, the company will decide whether it is feasible to exploit the 200m-tonne primary sulphide sublayer, which has a much lower copper grade of 0.5 per cent. 'It may be that it is viable - by that time the technology may be better and the price of copper may make it economically justifiable,' said Mr Drake. Quebrada Blanca is just one of several new projects that are expected to raise Chilean copper production - already the highest in the world - by a further 1.3m tonnes to 3.5m tonnes by the year 2000. Other projects due to start up before then include Cerro Colorado (annual production of 40,000 tonnes), the giant Collahuasi deposit (300,000), Zaldivar (120,000) and El Abra (225,000). Much of the new production will use SX-EW technology, far less environmentally destructive than traditional methods that require a smelting process. By the turn of the century, about 25 per cent of Chilean copper should be produced using this technique, compared with 8 per cent last year.</p>

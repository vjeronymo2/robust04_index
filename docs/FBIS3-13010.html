			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of  Iran First Program Network at 0345 GMT on 6 March broadcasts a  special 45-minute feature on Jerusalem Day, which is to be  celebrated on Friday, 11 March. The feature includes a brief  opening talk by the announcer, who says: "If we want to examine  the al-Khalil [Hebron] mosque massacre, we can see that,  contrary to the allegations by the regime occupying Jerusalem,  the massacre of the worshipers at the al-Ibrahimi mosque was not  a spontaneous act by a group of extremists but the starting  point of a series of acts that are being perpetrated by the  Zionist government in a bid to achieve a special objective. If  we want to understand this better, we have to look at the recent  U.S.-Israeli act in the region. What the West is propounding as  the peace process only mentions the word peace and pursues very  specific objectives."    The announcer then goes on to say: "The first objective that  international Zionism is pursuing is to extinguish the burning  flames of the intifadah, which is considered to be one of the  most dangerous political-social phenomena of the region for  Israel, the United States, and even the corrupt regimes around  them. International Zionism considers the intifadah to be yet  another fruit of the Islamic revival process, which is  threatening the interests and objectives of the regime occupying  Jerusalem."    Then the guest of the feature, Hoseyn Sheykholeslam, Iranian  deputy foreign minister for Arab and African affairs, is asked  to comment on the Hebron massacre. In answer to a question on  what objective the Zionists are pursuing in the incident,  Sheykholeslam says: "The Zionists' objective is very simple.  They do not want there to be any Palestinian in Palestine.  They do not want any non-Israeli or anyone who does not believe  in world domination by Zionism to be in Israel. Israel has a  big strategic plan for this purpose. This plan has political,  international, economic, propaganda, social, and psychological  aspects. It has been following this plan for more than 50 years  in various stages. It has almost succeeded, especially with the  implementation of the Camp David agreement as well as the  compromise plans that have emerged, one by one, after Camp  David."    Sheykholeslam then refers to the Islamic revolution in Iran  and says that one of the most important aspects of the  revolution was the method that Imam Khomeyni used in directing  the revolution: "a method that displayed the true power of the  nation, something that we saw in our revolution and what we are  witnessing in Palestine today." Sheykholeslam says: "This  massacre was actually a follow-up to the psychological-social  plan to spread fear in the hearts of the Palestinians so that  they will become dissatisfied with their life in Palestine and  will leave their territories and go." Sheykholeslam discusses  how the same method is being used in the field of economics by  "increasing inflation at home" so that the Palestinians will not  be able to lead a good life and will have to leave the country.    Later in the feature and after music and slogans,  Sheykholeslam is asked to give details on the Hebron incident  and to comment: "It is good to note that the majority of the  martyrs were between 18 and 25 years of age. This shows how  close this [Palestinian] revolution is to our revolution. Like  the role that the youths played in our revolution, the youths  there have now come onto the scene. The youths have stolen the  scene from the nationalists, politicians, and communists and it  is the Muslims who are on the scene now. Fortunately, this  trend is growing more and more each day. The last base of the  nationalists was al-Khalil which, I think, will be taken out of  the Israelis' hands with this incident."    The feature goes on to broadcast phone calls from listeners  who express their readiness to fight next to the Palestinians.  Sheykholeslam then says: "The nation is well aware that this  war, the war that is going on in Palestine, is one between Islam  and blasphemy. The future of the world will be determined by  this war. Whether we want it or not, the future of the world  will be determined by a confrontation between Islam led by the  pure Muhammedan Islam, which His Eminence the Imam propounded in  Iran, on the one side and arrogance, which is led by the United  States and Israel, on the other."    Later in the program the announcer asks Sheykholeslam to  comment on the opinion by many analysts that "there is a link  between the massacre of Muslims in Palestine and the massacre of  Muslims elsewhere, namely in Bosnia-Herzegovina." Sheykholeslam  says that as previously stated: "The future war will be one  between Islam, especially the outlook of our nation and its  leadership on the one side, and arrogance in general on the  other. Each and every Muslim, wherever he may be, is considered  a potential enemy to them. The more combatant a Muslim is, a  bigger enemy he is for them. And if there is the possibility  that he can form Islamic rule, even a rule by Muslims, this is  considered a greater threat to them. The crime that you are  witnessing in Bosnia-Herzegovina today is being done to prevent  the Muslims there from forming a country and an Islamic rule. I  do not know why it is, but apparently it is God's wish that the  hotter this furnace of struggle becomes, the more combatant the  elements that emerge from it are. According to the Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, if it was not for this struggle they would  not have been able to become acquainted with Islam in this way,  and if this genocide had not continued, they would not have come  so close to the Islamic Republic and the mode of our thoughts.  The same applies to Palestine. Today's Palestinians are much  closer to us than the Palestinian of the pro-Camp David era."    The feature continues with more phone calls. The last  question asked of Sheykholslam is what significance the people's  presence at the Jerusalem Day march has. Sheykholeslam says:  "Our nation should know that arrogance wants to convince the  Palestinians that they do not have anyone to support them. This  is the policy that is aimed at spreading disillusionment. But  our nation should know that by coming to the scene and to the  marches, it shows that it is next to the Palestinian nation. It  will encourage the Palestinians. And this is exactly the  opposite of the policy that arrogance wants to impose. Our  Palestinian brothers believe that Muslims bearing black flags  will come from the east and will liberate Palestine. Maybe this  means the black chadors [veils] of the Iranian nation. You know  that our nation, and especially the women, impressed the West  with their black chadors and conveyed a special message. This  belief by the Palestinian nation may mean this. At any rate,  the Palestinian nation, which arrogance tried to disillusion as  much as possible, is powerfully on the scene today and should be  supported by our nation in every possible way, the most simple  of which may be presence at the Jerusalem Day march."</p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BLAST, FIRE IN MOTEL BLAMED ON DRUG LAB  </P> <P> A suspected methamphetamine lab exploded in a La Quinta Inn motel room  Wednesday morning, engulfing the room in fire and setting off a search for  those connected with the operation. No injuries were immediately reported.  </P> <P> Police say drug-producing labs in motel rooms, such as the one which apparently  triggered Wednesday's explosion and fire, are not unusual.  </P> <P> "It's fairly common to set up labs in motel rooms in urban areas," said Tom  Wadkins, supervisor of the Orange County Laboratory Enforcement Team, a task  force of the California Bureau of Narcotics assigned to investigate drug labs.  </P> <P> "It's been done this way for many years. Then these people don't contaminate  their homes, and they can pack up and leave real quickly if they have to,"  Wadkins explained.  </P> <P> Another narcotics expert supported that assertion. "I know that (portable labs)  happen on a regular basis," said narcotics Detective Robert B. Phillips of the  Costa Mesa Police Department. "These people go from hotel room to hotel room.  They are very mobile. They usually get rooms in front or in back of the hotel.  They make drugs, move out and check into another motel under a different name."  </P> <P> However, one officer said Wednesday's drug explosion was a rare occurrence in  Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> The explosion and flash fire at La Quinta Inn, 1515 S. Coast Drive, caused the  evacuation of about a dozen neighboring guests, police said. Police would not  say whether anyone was in the room when the blast occurred.  </P> <P> The Fire Department received an anonymous call from a man at 6:07 a.m.  reporting the fire, Sgt. John P. Pherrin of the Costa Mesa Police Department  said.  </P> <P> When police units arrived at the motel along with the Fire Department, Room 219  on the second level facing South Coast Drive was in flames, Wadkins said.  </P> <P> The size of the explosion indicated that the lab could have been producing one  to four pounds of methamphetamines, Wadkins said.  </P> <P> He said it takes about two days from start to finish to set up a lab and cook  the drug to completion. Such a lab poses an explosion and fire danger when  fumes from volatile, drug-processing chemicals, such as ether and acetone,  ignite.  </P> <P> "They were converting the liquids into a crystal-type form," Wadkins said. "It  would look like crystal salt. There were a lot of solvents used. You can make  small quantities in about 12 hours."  </P> <P> Found in the burned room were a microwave oven, an acetone bottle and other  volatile fluids used to produce crack cocaine or methamphetamine. The explosion  caved in a wall, and the fire destroyed the bed and scorched the carpet.  </P> <P> "At this time," Wadkins added, "it appears it was an illegal drug lab."  </P> <P> And, he said, "not in recent history have we had an explosion like this (in  Costa Mesa)."  </P> <P> No suspect has been arrested, but police believe that there is more than one  involved. Police found articles indicating that both men and women occupied the  room. Also recovered at the scene were stun guns, a .38-caliber gun and four  knives.  </P> <P> So far, no witnesses have come forward.  </P> <P> Last year, the Orange County task force seized 30 methamphetamine labs,  according to Wadkins.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Wendy Paulson contributed to this story.  </P></p>

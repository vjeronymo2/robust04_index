			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Qualifications record of ET is attacked MORE THAN half of all trainees on youth training and Employment Training programmes leave without a qualification, according to previously unpublished figures revealed yesterday by the Labour party. Mr Tony Blair, the shadow employment secretary, said that the Department of Employment figures showed that only a third of those on Employment Training (ET) obtained a qualification, while 67 per cent of Youth Training (YT) trainees did not even gain a credit towards a national vocational qualification. The Labour attack came the day after a meeting of more than half the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) agreed to protest to the government over the 'substantial reduction' in funding for training programmes, and was timed to coincide with the prime minister's speech on training yesterday afternoon. Mr Blair added that only a quarter of ET trainees ended up in full-time employment, while more than 60 per cent of ET and 35 per cent of YT trainees were unable to get a job within three months of completing their course. 'The figures show conclusively that the government has been failing our young people,' he said. Mr Henry McLeish, an opposition employment spokesman, said: 'These figures show the yawning gap between the rhetoric of the Conservatives and the realities facing young people in Conservative Britain.' New measures to improve relations between providers of Youth Training and Tecs have persuaded the British Printing Industries Federation to reverse a decision to stop being a managing agent for Youth Training. The measures, drawn up by the Department of Employment, are due to be announced next week. They will simplify the task cited by several large companies of negotiating individually with the 82 Tecs and the 22 Local Enterprise Companies, the Scottish equivalent to Tecs.</p>

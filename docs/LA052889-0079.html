			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE LONG BEACH EXPECTED TO ENACT CAMPUSWIDE SMOKING BAN  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach is about to become the first campus in the California  State University and Colleges system to declare itself a "smoke-free"  environment.  </P> <P> A recommendation by the Faculty Senate expected to be approved by university  President Curtis L. McCray would ban smoking beginning in the fall in all  campus buildings except the student union and dormitories.  </P> <P> "Given the state of our ventilation, when you smoke in a closed interior the  smoke is extended beyond the confines of a small room," said June Cooper, vice  president of faculty and staff relations, who said she brought the issue before  the Faculty Senate after receiving numerous complaints. "This (expresses our)  concern for the health hazards of nonsmokers and our concern for providing a  safe and healthy working environment."  </P></p>

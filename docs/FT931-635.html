			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / TUC issues alternative to the government's White Paper THE Trades Union Congress yesterday issued an alternative to the government's white paper on coal as it prepared for a march and lobby of parliament to coincide with today's debate on the government's coal strategy. It dismissed the white paper as a 'contemptuous political fix' which failed to tackle the main problem which it said was the rigging of the power generation market against coal. The alternative white paper, No Prospects For Coal, predicts that on top of the 18 pits which will close or be mothballed immediately, a further four will close after a year with 5,000 job losses and a further eight in two years, with 8,000 job losses. Selling off the pits no longer wanted by British Coal would not tackle the issue, the TUC said. 'Without any market prospects they will have to close by the end of the year.' The Coalfield Communities Campaign pressure group also criticised the white paper, saying that the government was proposing a framework that 'even in the short run would allow a maximum of only seven of the threatened pits to survive'.</p>

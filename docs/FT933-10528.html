			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Spain calls for wage and dividend freeze THE Spanish government has asked unions and employers to accept a three-year incomes policy that would freeze both wages and dividends to shareholders next year and only permit small rises in 1995 and 1996. The proposals are similar to an initiative rejected by the unions in 1991, but have added urgency as Spain's economy sinks further into recession and unemployment hovers at a record 22.3 per cent. The move has been received with equanimity by employers and some hostility by unions. It represents probably the most explicit effort by government to manipulate incomes since Spain became a democracy in the late-1970s. The government has told employers it wants companies participating in the agreement to maintain employment levels. In late night talks in Madrid on Monday, the government also said it wanted to prevent senior corporate managers being awarded 'armour-plated' contracts which guaranteed large pay-offs if they were fired. Negotiators said they would start removing these contracts in the public sector. The management contracts and firing freeze are aimed at softening union suspicions. Union leaders said yesterday they were unhappy with a wages freeze and that they wanted concessions on social policy. Under the proposals, all wages and dividends would be frozen next year and would rise below inflation in 1995. Any increase in 1996 would depend on the state of the economy. The CEOE, the main employers' federation, said yesterday it had no fundamental objection to the proposals. Profits have been hit by the deepening recession. The public airing of the proposals - one of the main elements of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez' efforts to manage the country's economic crisis following his re-election in June - coincided yesterday with signs that the Bank of Spain has begun to test the currency markets for deeper interest rate cuts later in the year. Following the weekend widening of ERM fluctuation bands, the Bank of Spain yesterday cut its benchmark intervention rate half a point to 10.5 per cent. The peseta strengthened sharply against the D-Mark despite the cut.</p>

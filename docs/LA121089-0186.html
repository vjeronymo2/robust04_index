			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FAIRCHILD IS QUEEN OF THE HILL  </P> <P> On Morley Field's cross-country course, site of Saturday's Kinney National high  school championships, there is one obstacle that runners find particularly  bearish -- the Pershing Avenue hill.  </P> <P> It's otherwise known as The Hill.  </P> <P> The Hill is a steep incline up a dirt portion of the course that continues for  a full city block. It usually weeds out the also-rans. No one ever kicks on the  hill; it usually works the other way around, and the hill kicks them.  </P> <P> At least that's the way it was until Saturday, when Melody Fairchild, a slight  5-foot-2, 95-pound junior from Boulder, Colo., decided The Hill was her ally.  </P> <P> Fairchild, who hung back from the lead pack in the early going of the girls'  race, made her move at the bottom of The Hill and overtook the early  pace-setters at the top. She went on to win in 17 minutes 05.5 seconds, more  than seven seconds faster than second-place Megan Thompson of Florissant, Mo.  (17:12.7).  </P> <P> "I love hills," Fairchild said after catching her breath. "I'm proud that I  live in Boulder, Colo., which is known for hills. I like to think hills are my  strong point."  </P> <P> Well, she at least convinced Thompson, who wasn't so sure of Fairchild's  running ability going into the race.  </P> <P> "I've never seen anyone who doesn't look like a runner run like Melody did  today," Thompson said. "Runners are tall and lanky, she's so short. But she has  so much power in her legs . . . she amazes me."  </P> <P> Fairchild has heard it all before but insists height is not a prerequisite to  running successfully.  </P> <P> "I'm determined to prove that size doesn't make a difference," she said. "It  doesn't matter how long your legs are but how big your heart is."  </P> <P> It was Fairchild's second appearance at the Kinney. Last year, she finished  second to Celeste Susnis of Wheatfield, Ind. This year, Susnis, a senior,  placed fifth at 17:39.2 behind Carole Zajac of Pittsburgh, Pa. (17:22.9) and  Sarah Schwald of Spokane, Wash. (17:35.3).  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Kazakh Government has decided to speed up the  commissioning of an oil pipeline from Atyr oil fields to the  Chimkent and Pavlodar refineries via Aktyubinsk and Kzyl-Orda  regions. The measure follows the country's dwindling oil  exports which almost completely dried up in May, President of  state Munaigaz holding company (production, refining and  marketing of fuel) Bulat Yelemanov said in an interview with the  Kazakh Panorama newspaper.    Kazakhstan whose annual oil output runs at about 17 million  tonnes has no direct access to export pipelines or sea ports  having to export crude oil via Russian territory.    Experts say the project will cost some $500 million to  implement. Yelemanov said that a 7 km-length pipeline to be  commissioned by the end of 1996 had already been laid down.    He accused Russia of blocking all outlets for Kazakhstan's  oil exports. Yelemanov said Russian oil agencies offer too high  prices for pumping oil through Russian territory or refer to  overcapacity on export pipelines. Worse still, Russian oil  refineries which handle Kazakh oil now refuse to accept it  because of glut.    Officials in Alma-Ata [Almaty] maintain that Russia does not  want to honor its obligations. It has now agreed to handle only  one million tonnes of Kazakhstan's crude oil instead of three  million tonnes as provided under the contract. Experts say the  country exported only 285,500 tonnes of crude via Russia in the  first quarter of this year, which is 75 percent of last year's  level.</p>

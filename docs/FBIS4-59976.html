			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Text] Israel demands that the agreement signed recently  by the PLO and the UNDP [UN Development Program] be amended,  seeing that Faruq Qaddumi signed it with the title "foreign  minister of Palestine." As it was signed, the agreement gives  the PLO a status in the entire West Bank, and not just in  Jericho.    The UNDP, which specializes in extending aid to developing  countries, has been operating in the territories for many years  in coordination with Israel financing economic and agricultural  development programs. The establishment of self-rule in Gaza  and Jericho required a change in the UNDP's status in the  Palestinian Authority areas. The Gaza-Jericho agreement  stipulates that the PLO may sign agreements concerning  development programs and economic aid to the Palestinians with  countries and international organizations on behalf of the  Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho.    The Israeli UN delegation came across the PLO-UNDP agreement  last week and reported it to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. Israel lodged a harsh protest  with the UNDP over the agreement, which contrary to what had  been promised, was not coordinated with it. Israel argued that  the agreement contravenes the Israeli-PLO accords, that  Qaddumi's title of foreign minister of Palestine contravenes UN  resolutions, and that it transpires from the agreement that the  PLO is the source of authority in all the territories and not  just in Gaza and Jericho.    At the same time, Israel asked the United States to help it  pressure the UN not to pass a resolution ratifying the agreement  and to prevent a precedent which could be emulated in other  agreements between the PLO and international organizations. UN  officials sent a message to Israel apologizing for the error,  noting that they had gave in to PLO pressure to sign the draft  agreement, and asserting that the UN will send a letter to the  PLO informing it that there has been no "recognition" of  Qaddumi's status as foreign minister and that the agreement will  only apply to Gaza and Jericho.    Political sources in Jerusalem said yesterday that the  Palestinians have been trying to sneak "symbols of sovereignty"  into Gaza and Jericho. For example, contrary to what had been  agreed upon, the word "national" appears on the badges worn by  Palestinian policemen on their sleeves and a sign bearing the  inscription "The Palestine Police" was hung on the police  building in Gaza. The assessment in internal consultations held  by the Foreign Ministry is that the Palestinians will attempt to  use the offices of the donor countries in Jericho to maintain  external relations with them.    The Gaza-Jericho agreement bans the Palestinian Authority  from maintaining external relations or opening embassies in its  territory or in other countries.</p>

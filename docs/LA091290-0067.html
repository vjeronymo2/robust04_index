He praised the  American military and hailed the new level of cooperation between Washington  and Moscow.  </P> <P> Japan said it may give $2 billion to the nations hit hardest by U.N. sanctions,  on top of the $1 billion aid package already promised for multinational  peacekeeping forces in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hostage Front:  </P> <P> Iraq promised to permit Arab-born American males to leave occupied Kuwait with  American women and children. And the State Department said it has chartered two  more Iraqi Airways jets to airlift up to 800 Westerners from Kuwait.  </P> <P> In Kuwait, four more countries -- Austria, Bangladesh, Greece and Switzerland  -- ordered their besieged diplomats to pull out. The U.S. embassy continues to  hold on. At the western border of Iraq, about 300,000 Egyptians and 70,000  Asians wait to cross into Jordan. Two Virgin Atlantic aircraft left London with  supplies for the refugees. One of the planes was due to ferry refugees to Sri  Lanka and Bangladesh.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Military Front:  </P> <P> Iraqi military forces have stepped up activity along the country's borders with  Turkey and Syria, but there are no signs of imminent hostilities, a Pentagon  spokesman said.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the crisis in the Persian Gulf has sparked  terrorist threats against the United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trade Front:  </P> <P> The first of the nations to respond to Saddam Hussein's offer of free oil, the  Philippines and Namibia, said no.

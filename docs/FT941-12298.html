			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Westerner takes a shine to the rustbelt: Richard Waters explains BankAmerica's shift away from its California home For BankAmerica, the midwest is about to become a second home. Friday's announcement of its planned Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.26bn) takeover of Chicago-based Continental Bank signals its first big foray out of its home markets in the western states of the US. It also signals a plan by the US's second biggest bank to shift its centre of gravity away from California, where it earns an estimated two thirds of its income. As such, it is likely to give a further push to the development of nationwide banking in the US. Continental is a rare animal in the US. While many institutions have shifted their focus more towards retail banking, credit cards and consumer finance, where lending margins and fees are good, Continental has sought to become a specialist corporate bank. In this, it resembles its far larger and more powerful New York rivals, JP Morgan and Bankers Trust. With the purchase of Continental, BankAmerica is buying extensive contacts with companies throughout the nation's rustbelt. Mr Richard Rosenberg, BankAmerica's chairman, says: 'It's still the largest industrial base in the US, with a string of good companies.' The bank claims the acquisition will give it more primary relationships with US companies than any other bank, including Citicorp, the country's largest banking group. With the takeover, BankAmerica plans to move the headquarters of its own US corporate banking operations to Chicago, in the process creating a new wholesale banking giant in the midwest. Mr Rosenberg puts BankAmerica's corporate banking assets at 'around three times' Continental's total Dollars 22bn, and its income from the business at more than Dollars 500m. Despite the size, the new BankAmerica operation will have a long way to go to rival banks like Citicorp and JP Morgan in the market for servicing big, internationally active companies. While Continental will bring it experience in trading in foreign exchange, derivatives and other financial markets, these trading operations are modest compared with the big New York trading banks. Also, BankAmerica has a weaker international network than its rivals: it drew in its horns, along with other US banks, in the late 1980s, and since then has been held back by the prolonged slump in its home market in California and the long and arduous process of digesting Security Pacific, a rival west coast bank that it bought two years ago. Apart from the corporate customer base in the midwest, the deal has many attractions for BankAmerica. For a start, Continental should prove relatively easy to absorb. 'It's a much easier transaction than Security Pacific, since it's not based on cost savings,' said Ms Diane Glossman, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. Also, the purchase price - though a premium of around 15 per cent on Continental's share price before the deal was announced - looks a bargain for BankAmerica's shareholders. Continental's shares had been trading at a discount to book value: even with the premium, BankAmerica is paying only 1.2 times book value (most banks sell for nearer 1.5 times book.) Perhaps for this reason, BankAmerica's share price on Friday did not show the sort of weakness which has infected the stocks of other acquisitive US banks of late, brought on by market fear that they are being forced to pay a high price to pursue their ambitions. Also, BankAmerica said it would buy back Dollars 500m of its own stock before the cash-and-shares transaction is completed, countering the dilution to its earnings that would otherwise have resulted. The agreement between the two banks contains a poison pill arrangement designed to deter any rivals from making unwanted bids for Continental. Such arrangements are becoming an increasingly familiar part of bank takeovers, which tend to be cosy affairs. BankAmerica will be hoping that no one else shares its views on just how attractive Continental may be. Where do the BankAmerica's ambitions end? Many had been expecting it to make a foray out of its home base to buy a retail bank rather than a corporate one. Mr Rosenberg says there are no plans now to take over a retail bank in the midwest, or to build a retail business out of Continental. 'It is a very focused corporate bank,' he says. 'We certainly do not want to diffuse or distract that focus by putting the bank into businesses it was not designed for.' Nonetheless, a takeover of Continental is unlikely to mark the end of BankAmerica's ambitions.  ---------------------------------------      REACHING ACROSS AMERICA  --------------------------------------- Assets              dollars bn  --------------------------------------- Citicorp                 216.6 BankAmerica/Continental  209.5 NationsBank              157.8 Chemical                 149.9 JP Morgan                133.9 Chase Manhatten          102.1 Bankers Trust             92.1 Banc One                  79.9 First Union               70.8 KeyCorp/Society           59.7* First Chicago             57.7  --------------------------------------- * Merger pending  --------------------------------------- Source: Standard &amp; Poor's  ---------------------------------------</p>

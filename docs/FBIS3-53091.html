			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Stop Feuding, Start Governing the Country"] </F>   [Text] No apology needed to revert to the state of the  Pakistan People's Party [PPP]. It is not at its best. Of  course, it could be worse. That all is not well is becoming  more and more pronouncedly clear. The Al Murtaza firing death  of a student supporter of Mir Murtaza Bhutto; the dramatic  arrest, release and arrest of PPP activist Suresh Kumar; the  weird allegations of harbouring RAW [Research and Analysis Wing]  agents against Begum Nusrat Bhutto; the hasty suspension of a  whole platoon of police officers and men in Larkana; Premier  Benazir Bhutto's prolonged stay in Larkana; her renewed emphasis  on a rapprochement with the much maligned MQM [Muhajir Qaumi  Movement]; the swearing in of a bloated cabinet in Punjab;  intermittent sparring between Punjab Chief Minister Wattoo and  Senior Minister Hayat; the unexplained delay in finalising the  government at the centre... One could go on and on with  embarrassing items of omission and commission. In a word there  is widespread scepticism about how confident a grip the Benazir  Bhutto government has over the issues that need effective  handling. What is undermining the PPP administration's image in  public eye is the family feud which shows no sign of abating.  The elder lady has not distinguished herself for either  patience or propriety; the younger remains manifestly unsure.  There is no doubt that she is trying her best to play it cool.  So far, her best has not been good enough. The temperature is  constantly rising. The Al Murtaza incident was exactly what the  Prime Minister should have done without. No one except the PPP  government in Sindh is to blame for it. There may or may not be  a convincing case for the heavy hand falling on the Larkana  police, but there is a compelling case against the Government of  Sindh. From the very start, it went about its precautions to  prevent untoward incidents in a very unwise manner. It virtually  invited trouble and got it in unendurable abundance. This  gigantic error of the Sindh Government has already cost the PPP  leader so much of undeserved agony. And no end to it is in  sight.    The damage done is profound and painful. Part of it may now  be beyond repair. What Ms. Benazir is apparently trying is  damage-limitation. How much she may be able to salvage is still  not very clear. The professional Cassandras may be exaggerating  the losses incurred by the PPP, or the cracks in party unity.  However, there is little doubt that a hairline fracture is  there. It is a challenge to the PPP leadership to heal it.  Patience, forbearance and even forgiveness may be the right  recipe. Begum Nusrat Bhutto has undoubtedly been unduly rasping  with her tongue. Perhaps she cannot help it at this moment in  her life. But the real damage caused to the PPP is by its own  jialas [workers] hurling thoughtless and undignified accusations  questioning the integrity and patriotism of Begum Nusrat Bhutto.  It is difficult to imagine of anything more condemnable. It is  not the politics of civilised people. Political differences are  understandable, debasing of politics is not. Let us not pollute  the already muddied waters.    Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto would be less than wise if she  failed to realise that there is need to lift politics out of the  abyss into which it has fallen as a result of what should have  been no more than a passing family misunderstanding sorted out  pleasantly -- and in private. There is still time and room to  set things right. Start by clearing the question of  "succession". The Pakistan People's Party is not Bhutto family  property. It is the legacy which the people of Pakistan -- no  individual, however high or mighty -- is entitled to inherit.  This humbug about Mir Murtaza Bhutto or the Bhutto widow, is  the sole proprietor of the PPP, must be buried under a million  tons of earth, never to be resurrected. The election of Ms.  Benazir Bhutto as Party Chairperson should be regularised  according to PPP constitution. And that should be that. The  Prime Minister should accord the highest priority to a  settlement with MQM, without which it would be almost impossible  to normalise Sindh. And it is about time the Prime Minister  started governing the country in right earnest.</p>

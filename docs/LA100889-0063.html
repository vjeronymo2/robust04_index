			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SAVVY TRAVELER: ELEVATOR TRANSPORTATION HAS ITS UPS AND DOWNS  </P> <P> Someone once asked the legendary writer James Thurber why so many writers  seemed to stay at the Algonquin Hotel in New York.  </P> <P> "They didn't come here as writers," he deadpanned. "They became writers while  waiting for the elevator."  </P> <P> Few things anger travelers more than having to wait -- and wait -- for an  airplane, a taxi and, yes, even for an elevator. The hotel elevator is one of  those things travelers ignore . . . unless it's slow.  </P> <P> Some of the worst cases are at large convention hotels, where elevators  apparently were designed and built for the number of rooms but not for the  number of people in the hotel.  </P> <P> Other bad elevators can be found at older hotels that have been expanded  without the addition of much-needed elevators.  </P> <P> Some hotel elevators are bad because hotel owners have simply waited too long  to upgrade and renovate the systems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One for the Owner  </P> <P> In one instance, guests at the Aladdin Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas were  inconvenienced because the casino owner decided that one of the elevators was  to be off-limits to guests and would only be used occasionally -- to take the  owner to his suite.  </P> <P> Many times, waits are caused when elevators are taken out of passenger service  and used for other hotel departments: the bell staff (to move luggage),  catering (to move meals) and, in many hotels, certain elevators are blocked off  in the mornings and used by room service to deliver breakfast.  </P> <P> At the new 1,241-room Hyatt Regency Waikoloa on the Big Island of Hawaii, the  hotel is part of the massive 31,000-acre Waikoloa Beach Resort. Guests stay in  any one of three towers. No one has to wait more than 30 seconds for one of the  high-tech elevators to arrive. The elevators then speed the guests to the  ground floor of their tower.  </P> <P> But then you have to be patient. To get from each tower to the main lobby, you  can choose between a 15-minute walk or a 5-minute wait for a 10-minute ride in  a motorized tram. Yet in most cases, guests don't want a lengthy sightseeing  tour.  </P> <P> At one hotel, the laws of gravity are severely tested, to the dismay of many  guests. The elevators at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in New Orleans often disprove  the theory that what goes up must come down. The glass elevators are still such  a novelty that excited children delight in pushing all the buttons so they can  prolong their ride -- and your wait.  </P> <P> Yet when it comes to most hotel elevators in Asia, no one seems to wait.  </P> <P> At the Regent in Hong Kong, the six high-speed Hitachi elevators are constantly  moving. And the hotel has added a thoughtful touch. When a guest pushes the  button to summon an elevator, a light switch and tone announce the arrival of  the specific elevator 15 seconds in advance. This is particularly helpful for  any guest carrying his or her own bags.  </P> <P> It's hard to find a bad hotel elevator in Japan. The Ginza Seiyo Hotel in Tokyo  has about the best elevators I've ever seen or ridden.  </P> <P> Sometimes a hotel will recognize its elevator shortcomings, only to discover  serious maintenance problems after installing an expensive, sophisticated  computerized system.  </P> <P> A case in point: the Peace Hotel in Shanghai, China, once had ancient, manually  operated elevators. They were slow, and often broke down. But the staff fixed  them quickly, sometimes with spare parts which they machine-tooled themselves.  </P> <P> Then, a few years ago, the hotel decided to begin an ambitious renovation  program. An expensive Japanese elevator system was installed, but never  properly calibrated. Some of the new elevators were even slower than the old,  and frequently broke down. Even worse, try getting an elevator repairman  knowledegable about the system on short notice in Shanghai.  </P> <P> The Drake Hotel in New York is known for good service, friendly staff . . . and  notoriously slow elevators. "There is no denying it," said General Manager  Jacques Hamburger. "They are slow. Too slow."  </P> <P> When the hotel is crowded, or in the mornings when many guests are either  checking out or hurrying off to business meetings, the wait for the 60-year-old  Drake elevators can be horrendous.  </P> <P> But the hotel is doing something about it. "A hotel prides itself on service,"  said Hamburger, "and the hotel elevator is just as much a part of that service  as anything else. You might be staying in the best room in town, but if you  have to wait 7 to 10 minutes to get there, the room suddenly diminishes in  quality."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Faster and More  </P> <P> Engineers and special elevator designers will soon rip out all of the Drake's  old elevators. They will be refurbished with new shafts and cabs, two elevators  will be added and the system will get faster. Now they move at 300 feet per  minute. When the $4.2-million job is finished, all the elevators will travel at  nearly 500 feet per minute.  </P> <P> Old elevators can't always be helped. In fact, they often add to the charm of  the establishment. Some older European hotels, for example, still have antique  iron cage elevators that ascend and descend slowly. But when you see one of  these ornate machines, you almost immediately get in the mood for a nostalgic,  deliberate trip.  </P> <P> At some hotels, elevators have become conversation pieces -- especially outside  glass-enclosed elevators, like the $500,000 cliffside Pali Kai elevator at the  Westin Kauai. It is an engineering marvel built into the hillside to transport  guests from the hotel to the beach.  </P> <P> Or the Summit elevators at the Westin Hotel, Renaissance Center, Detroit. The  elevators zoom up a glass tube, soaring 760 feet in just 1 minute and 10  seconds. At the top, and on a clear day, visibility is about 30 miles.  </P> <P> And there still are a few hotels left in America that pride themselves on  preserving an endangered species: the hotel elevator operators.  </P> <P> A small cadre of veteran elevator operators runs the original Kaestner and  Hecht cabs at the Drake Hotel in Chicago. The Pierre and the Mayfair Regent are  two New York hotels that still employ elevator operators.  </P> <P> "It's a tradition we fight to maintain," said George Schwab, general manager of  the Pierre. "We have many repeat guests who look forward to seeing their  favorite elevator operators. It's like coming home. And an elevator operator  gives our guests an extra measure of security, especially at night. They are  our additional eyes and ears."  </P> <P> As part of the renovation of the new Mark Hotel in New York, formerly the  Madison Avenue Hotel, General Manager Raymond Bickson attacked the elevators  first. They were old. They were slow. New elevators were built, new motors and  cables installed and a new electrical system put in place. Then Bickson hired  elevator operators. He even gave them the title of "lift attendants."  </P> <P> When the Mayfair Regent recently spent more than $1 million to renovate its  elevators, cables and motors, General Manager Dario Mariotti insisted that the  hotel retain the original elevator cabs and shells, as well as the white-gloved  elevator operators.  </P> <P> "It would have been cheaper to make the elevators automatic," Mariotti said,  "but it would have detracted from our service. In fact, we didn't even add  floor buttons inside the cabs, because I didn't want to be tempted to replace  the operators. Certain traditions are worth keeping.  </P> <P> "Think of it this way: At least the guests still have someone friendly to talk  to on the way up, or the way down. In New York, that's very important."  </P></p>

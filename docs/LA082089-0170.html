			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A British diplomat and Middle East expert was arrested in London under the  Prevention of Terrorism Act. He was identified by the British press as Andrew  Balfour, 39, who had held a series of diplomatic posts in the Middle East.  Britain's Independent Television News said he was apparently involved in  facilitating visas for Iranian nationals. Few other details were immediately  available on Balfour or on a second man arrested along with him. Both were  later released on bail.  </P></p>

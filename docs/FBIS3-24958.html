			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Mozambique Democratic Party, Pademo, has asked  Afonso Dhlakama, the Mozambique National Resistance, Renamo,  leader to urgently remind President Joaquim Chissano of the case  of General Domingos Fondo's alleged involvement in the smuggling  of weapons to South Africa.    A note received at the Radio Mozambique news desk says that  Pademo also demands that the Renamo leader produce evidence  demonstrating Gen. Domingos Fondo's culpability. Pademo  believes that there must be no liars among the leaders of the  opposition, so it advises Afonso Dhlakama to present  incriminating evidence against Gen. Fondo.    The Pademo note also says that institutions such as the  Attorney General's Office and the Criminal Investigation Police  are working in fear and without the government's backing,  thereby preventing proper investigation into cases such as Gen.  Domingo Fondo's.</p>

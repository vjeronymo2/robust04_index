Reliable sources in Beijing had earlier said Balladur,  accompanied by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Industry  Minister Gerard Longuet would visit China from January 27 to 30  to mark the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic  relations between the two countries.    Catherine Colonna, deputy spokesperson at the Foreign  Ministry, said: "No decision has yet been taken on an eventual  visit."    The sources in Beijing said a close Balladur aide, Jacques  Friedman, visited China at the end of December to prepare for  the visit which would come a year after a cooling in relations  brought about by French sales of fighter aircraft to Taiwan.    Speaking on January 4, Juppe had said Paris this year hoped  to rekindle relations with China.</p>

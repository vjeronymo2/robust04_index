			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Observer: Salty dogs When you make a television documentary about the Royal Marines, the language is likely to be on the strong side. Westcountry's series - Commando - was larded with expletives, but since it was originally shown at 10.40 pm on regional TV, it easily passed muster. The problem comes when sensitive programmes are broadcast before the witching hour - 9 pm - when children are deemed to be asleep. The ITV network now plans to show Commando nationwide, starting on February 17. But in order to put it out at peak family time - 8.30 pm - Westcountry had to cut the blasphemies and substitute bleeps and baas; so many of them were required that the commandos sound like little lambs. Now ITV has unexpectedly rescheduled the series to 9.30 pm, when military bluntness is once again acceptable. So will our brave boys see their own rich dialogue restored? This calls for strategic planning . .</p>

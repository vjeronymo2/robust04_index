			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOB GREENE: IT'S NOT ONLY ROCK 'N' ROLL  </P> <P> No matter what kind of music you like, you have to give credit to the Rolling  Stones' current tour as a magnificent entrepreneurial accomplishment. By the  time the tour concludes in a few weeks, the band is expected to have made in  excess of $100 million -- not bad in a year during which other major  corporations (and the Rolling Stones are a corporation) have seen their profits  dwindle or disappear.  </P> <P> Even if you're a senior executive of some multinational conglomerate and you  don't like Mick Jagger's voice -- or have never heard it -- you ought to salute  his management skills and business savvy. The guy could probably run General  Motors.  </P> <P> As the tour winds down, though, I find myself thinking not so much about the  music, or even about the $100 million, as I do about the two Ronnies. Time and  happenstance can change so many things.  </P> <P> In 1972 there was a British rock band -- one of the best bands I have ever  heard -- called the Faces. On assignment for Rolling Stone magazine, I went out  on tour with them. There was a certain tension in the band -- the lead singer,  Rod Stewart, was developing a following of his own, and his growing fame was  threatening to break up the band, which it eventually did.  </P> <P> On this tour, though, the band was terrific, and after a concert in Clemson,  S.C., a day of rest had been built into the schedule. Behind the hotel was a  lake. Four of us went out in the afternoon sun and sat on a wooden dock,  passing a bottle of brandy back and forth. There was Stewart, and there were  two guitar players from the band -- Ron Wood and Ronnie Lane.  </P> <P> After a while, we went back to the hotel parking lot and divided into teams. We  kicked a soccer ball around. It was Stewart and I against the two Ronnies. We  played until it got dark.  </P> <P> I think about the two Ronnies now; at the time they knew that the Faces would  probably disband. Undoubtedly they wondered what would happen to them after  Stewart went out on his own. Things couldn't have ended up much more  dramatically different for them, it turns out.  </P> <P> A job opening developed in another band. If you are employed by, say, General  Foods, maybe you're always on the lookout for a job opening at, say, Coca-Cola.  It works the same way in music.  </P> <P> The Rolling Stones had a sudden opening for a guitar player. Ron Wood applied  for the job and got it. Not a bad career move -- from the Faces to the Rolling  Stones. That's where he is now, and if you've been following the current tour  you've seen pictures of him on stage.  </P> <P> And Ronnie Lane? I saw a picture of him the other day, too. After leaving the  Faces, Ronnie Lane developed multiple sclerosis. The picture showed him sitting  in his wheelchair. He has lost the use of his legs, and at the age of 43 he  weighs 110 pounds.  </P> <P> That's the way life works. Always has -- forks in the road, and the direction  is not always yours to choose. It just seems all the eerier when it happens to  rock 'n' rollers, who live in a fantasy world but who are not exempt from  life's eternal puzzles.  </P> <P> The two Ronnies, full of brandy and full of energy, playing soccer in the  parking lot of a South Carolina Holiday Inn . . . now one's a Rolling Stone,  and perhaps the other is following the news of the tour.  </P> <P> Might as well end this on a not-so-somber note. There is a wonderful photo that  was taken when the Rolling Stones first came to the U.S. in 1964. Young and  desperate for publicity, the band members walked out into the middle of  Michigan Avenue during a visit to Chicago. They just stood there until someone  took their picture. It was one way to get noticed.  </P> <P> The other night I was looking at a menu from a gourmet Chinese restaurant in  Chicago. Most of the entrees -- Yu Hsiang Pork, Sichuan Shrimp -- bore  traditional Oriental descriptions. But one caught my eye.  </P> <P> It was called Beggar's Chicken. "Mick Jagger's favorite!" the menu said. "Our  version is prepared with a Rock Cornish hen. An unusual and unique flavor with  many tasty bones to pick. Last time Mick Jagger dined with us he had two  servings."  </P> <P> Who knows? Jagger and his friends certainly don't have to stand in the middle  of traffic anymore in order to be noticed. The restaurant using his name on its  1989 menu is probably not all that different from all the restaurants that, in  1959, displayed framed glossies of Frank Sinatra on their walls.  </P> <P> Everything changes; nothing changes.  </P></p>

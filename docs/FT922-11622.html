			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mexican mining reform debate next week THE MEXICAN Congress will begin debating next week reforms to the constitution aimed at easing restrictions on foreign investors in the mining industry, according to an official at the Energy and Mines Ministry (Semip), reports Reuter from Mexico City. Mr Abel Magana, director of information at Semip, said that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was expected to present the initiative in Congress next week. He thought the reforms would be approved within 15 to 20 days. They would facilitate foreign investment in all sectors of the mining industry except uranium, Mr Magana said. The need for foreign investors to ally themselves with Mexican partners holding majority interests would end and the requirement that the investment work through a fund administered by a Mexican bank would also be removed. The law would permit foreign investors to buy concessions to exploit mineral reserves.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Liquidator traces Maxwell pension cash LIQUIDATORS have so far recovered only Pounds 237m of the Pounds 695m pension fund assets held by Bishopsgate Investment Management, from which the late Mr Robert Maxwell took money in an effort to save his crumbling business empire. Mr Neil Cooper, a partner with Robson Rhodes, who was appointed provisional liquidator to BIM by the courts in December, said yesterday in his first public statement since starting the investigation, that he had traced all but Pounds 2m of the pension fund assets. He estimated that Mr Maxwell transferred Pounds 217m from BIM to third parties, in transactions including security against loans made by banks to his companies. Any attempts to recover these assets over the coming months are likely to involve a flurry of legal actions. A further Pounds 239m was liquidated by Mr Maxwell and the balance transferred to other companies in his group. Any cash remaining from these transfers is now controlled by the administrators and receivers of the businesses and Mr Cooper said it is probably 'irrecoverable'. He believes the value of the assets managed by BIM would now total about Pounds 695m. The figure is lower than some previous estimates because it has been revalued in the past few days to reflect current market values. Mr Ken Trench, chairman of the Maxwell private companies' pension fund members association, said: 'It's good news to realise that something is happening, but there is still a massive black hole. There may well be some people who never receive their pensions.' Some Pounds 111m of the safeguarded assets belong to the Common Investment Fund, which contained the assets of six pension funds of Maxwell companies and should have totalled Pounds 411m. The remaining Pounds 126m recovered belonged to pension funds in their own names. However, Mr Cooper refused to state how the assets recovered divided between the different pension funds. Mr Cooper said he had informed the independent trustees of these figures. Over the past few weeks Mr Cooper has interviewed Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr Larry Trachtenberg. He will interview other former directors and senior employees of BIM over the coming months. Pension loans, Page 23</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Parker &amp; Parsley bids for Bridge Oil Parker &amp; Parsley, the Texas-based oil independent which last year acquired Prudential Securities' troubled energy partnerships in the US, yesterday launched an uninvited ADollars 294m (USDollars 211.5m) bid for Bridge Oil, the Sydney-based oil and gas company. P&amp;P said it would offer 70 cents a share in cash for Bridge. It claimed that this was a 'fair price', representing a 35 per cent premium over the 30-day average trading price for Bridge shares before P&amp;P started to amass a stake in late April. P&amp;P said yesterday that its stake now amounted to 4.2 per cent of its target's equity. Bridge issued a brief statement, advising investors not to sell their shares, and promising further advice later. Earlier this month, Mr Robert Strauss, Bridge's chairman, told shareholders at the annual meeting that 'recognition of (the) proper value' of Bridge's US operations would take the group's net asset backing to more than ADollars 1 a share. Some analysts suggested that the current price offered for Bridge shares was likely to be an opening shot. However, P&amp;P's chairman, Mr Scott Sheffield, maintained yesterday that: 'It is our intention that this is a final price - we have no intention of increasing our offer.' Bridge shares closed at 72 cents in Sydney. Bridge's exploration and production operations are split between Australia and south-east Asia, and the US - with the Australian activities centred on the Cooper, Surat and Carnavon Basins, and the US interests spanning five states. Bridge had planned to float its US business on the stock market there at the beginning of this year, but temporarily abandoned the plan because of weak crude oil prices. It has said the scheme would be re-examined later this year. Net profits in 1993 fell from ADollars 39.4m to ADollars 27.6m. Parker &amp; Parsley, meanwhile, has been growing rapidly through acquisitions - often of troubled assets - during the past seven years. However, the bid for Bridge represents its first major move outside the US.</p>

On Monday [21 February] Pyongyang put forth new  conditions for the inspection of its nuclear installations by  the IAEA. Among these conditions is the date for this  inspection.    North Korea has made the date of the inspection of its  nuclear installations contingent on the progress in the  U.S.-North Korean talks, which are to be held in New York. In  North Korea's opinion, the precise date of the inspection should  be in coordination with the date that the United States has set  for its other decisions on North Korea.    Probably, Pyongyang wants all the aspects of the issue to be  clarified before the inspection of its nuclear installations by  the IAEA. It seems that what North Korea means by U.S.  decisions is the cancellation of the joint military maneuvers by  the United States and South Korea and U.S. economic assistance  to North Korea.    At the same time, Pyongyang has announced that it has agreed  only to a limited inspection of its nuclear installations and  has threatened that if it is pressured to expand this inspection  it will cancel its agreement with the IAEA. On the basis of  this agreement, North Korea will allow the IAEA to inspect only  seven of its nine nuclear bases. North Korea's objective behind  this threat is to gain an IAEA guarantee from the very start  that it will not apply pressure about the other two nuclear  sites. The developments in the Korean peninsula will be  determined by the IAEA's reply to North Korea.    Political analysts believe Pyongyang's new actions are a  result of the pressure that the United States has placed on it  through threats. Negative action leads to negative reaction,  and as long as the United States ignores North Korea's wishes  and intends to pressure that country, it will have no  alternative but to retaliate.    At any rate, if the United States and the IAEA ignore North  Korea's recent threat, the talks may reach an impasse.  Moreover, Pyongyang will prevent an inspection by the IAEA.  Thus, the crisis in the Korean peninsula will become more  complicated and finding a solution will become more difficult.</p>

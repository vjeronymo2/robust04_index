			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEY'RE WILD ABOUT PITINO;  </P> <P> HIS FIRST TEAM AT KENTUCKY IS SHORT AND ON PROBATION, BUT COACH WINS OVER FANS  </P> <P> As construction continues on Rick Pitino's new home, so does the steady stream  of drive-by gawkers, who cruise past the work site as if it were a shrine, not  a residence-to-be for Kentucky's latest basketball coach.  </P> <P> Pitino stopped by one Sunday to check on the building's progress and found a  caravan of cars about 300 yards long weaving through the neighborhood.  </P> <P> One disc jockey went so far as to sneak into the yard, steal some dirt and then  tell Kentucky athletic department officials that he planned to reward lucky  listeners with the stuff. He would have done it, too, had not university public  relations types begged for mercy.  </P> <P> Of course, Pitino-mania isn't limited to the work of a deejay's shovel. Readers  of the Lexington Herald-Leader recently were treated to "The Ballad of Rick  Pitino," a heartfelt poem penned by an adoring fan. Emily Dickinson, it wasn't.  </P> <P> In the school's bookstore are "Pitino's Bombinos" sweat shirts. In the magazine  racks are nearly a half-dozen basketball preview magazines, many of them with  Pitino's smiling mug on the cover. And at one of the nearby hotel gift shops  are copies of Pitino's biography, "Born To Coach."  </P> <P> "Nothing comes close to this," Pitino said. "There's nothing else in the  people's lives bigger than Kentucky basketball. Vacations, social life . . .  everything they do with their family revolves around Kentucky basketball. These  people could talk about Kentucky basketball the entire year, every minute of  their lives. It's a pleasure for them to do that. It's a lot different from  everything else I've experienced.  </P> <P> "I've signed more autographs in the short time I've been here than I have in my  life, maybe 10 times over," he said.  </P> <P> This is what happens when a boy wonder from the North, wearing a Final Four  ring the size of an infant's clutched fist and sporting a New York accent as  thick as a pastrami-on-rye from the Carnegie Deli, steps up to the podium and  promises to restore a shamed Kentucky basketball program to past glories.  </P> <P> Pitino did this and more last June. He vowed that the Wildcats' recovery would  be relatively swift and done according to the NCAA rule manual, a copy of which  seemed to be permanently misplaced during previous coach Eddie Sutton's era.  </P> <P> Because of the speech and the surprising 11 victories that have been recorded  by a team short on seniors, stars and scholarships, Pitino has become as valued  by Kentucky faithful as one of those national championship banners that hang  from the rafters of Rupp Arena. After nearly 19 months of unwanted notoriety, a  university is beginning to feel good about itself and its basketball program.  </P> <P> Among the reasons: former UK President David Roselle, Athletic Director C.M.  Newton and, of course, Pitino, only the fourth Kentucky coach since 1931, but  the third in the 1980s.  </P> <P> Roselle guided the school through the embarrassing NCAA investigation and  sanction process, and later enacted measures to ensure it never happened again.  He was branded a traitor by some factions of school supporters, a savior by  most others.  </P> <P> Newton, a respected former coach, earned praise for his hands-on administrative  style. He hired Bill Curry, last seen on the Sugar Bowl sidelines with a 10-2  Alabama team; and Pitino, 37, who last season led the New York Knicks to a  division title, their first since 1971, in only his second season as an NBA  coach. Before that, Pitino directed Providence to a surprising Final Four  appearance.  </P> <P> The normally reserved Newton couldn't contain himself the day he introduced  Pitino to the media last June 1.  </P> <P> "We have just . . . named the very best head coach in the country," he gushed.  "Today begins a new day in Kentucky basketball."  </P> <P> Added a beaming Roselle: "It's a historic day and a happy day."  </P> <P> There have been few moments in the past two years that have brought smiles to  Kentucky followers. Sutton's tenure often was marked by crisis and controversy,  to say nothing of Kentucky's first losing season in almost 65 years.  </P> <P> Still, had everything gone as planned by Sutton, the Wildcats would have begun  the year as a likely Final Four participant. The roster would have included  such stars as Rex Chapman, Shawn Kemp, Eric Manuel, Chris Mills and LeRon  Ellis.  </P> <P> Instead, Chapman opted to turn pro and is in his second season with Charlotte  Hornets. Kemp, one of the country's most sought-after high school players,  decided to forgo a college career and jump directly to the NBA. He is a rookie  with the Seattle SuperSonics.  </P> <P> Manuel, a gifted offensive player, was forbidden to play for any NCAA member  school because of a cheating scandal. Mills, the team's leading rebounder last  season, transferred to Arizona after becoming the focal point of the NCAA's  investigation. Mills was sent the infamous Emery overnight package, allegedly  containing $1,000 from then-Kentucky assistant coach Dwayne Casey.  </P> <P> Ellis, UK's leading scorer in 1989, fled to Syracuse.  </P> <P> Kentucky was left with eight scholarship players, only one of them a senior.  When Pitino took his place for the preseason team photograph, he found that his  coaches and support staff outnumbered his players almost two to one.  </P> <P> According to the NCAA sanctions, Kentucky cannot make any live television  appearances this year and won't be able to participate in the Southeastern  Conference or NCAA tournaments until 1992. Probation ends after the 1992  season.  </P> <P> Pitino had only three scholarships to offer this year but will be under no NCAA  restrictions next year, meaning he can offer up to five for the 1991-92 season.  </P> <P> Faced with such an array of constraints, Pitino asked for and received a  seven-year contract -- worth a reported $5 million -- from Newton.  </P> <P> In addition, he was promised remodeled basketball offices, weight room and  practice facilities. So old was the Memorial Coliseum locker room, that the  same hook Newton used to hang his clothes when he played at Kentucky in 1951  still was being used in 1989.  </P> <P> Pitino considered the program's possibilities and told Newton he had a deal,  thus ending a four-month courtship that had begun with a simple no.  </P> <P> "(Newton) called me probably sometime in February and told me he had four  people he was going to talk to: Mike Krzyzewski, Lute Olson, myself and Pat  Riley," Pitino said.  </P> <P> "I thought to myself, 'Well, you're oh for four right off the bat.' I knew I  wasn't leaving. I knew Pat Riley wasn't going to leave the Lakers, that Mike  Krzyzewski certainly wasn't going to leave Duke and I wondered, you never know,  if Lute Olson possibly may be interested in it.  </P> <P> "I just told (Newton), 'Thank you very much,' but I just wasn't interested in  leaving the Knicks."  </P> <P> Newton persisted.  </P> <P> Pitino suggested he consider Seton Hall's P. J. Carlesimo.  </P> <P> Newton did but decided to work on Pitino instead.  </P> <P> "OK, when the playoffs are over, I'll come visit," Pitino told Newton.  </P> <P> And?  </P> <P> "I came here to visit and I just fell in love with the potential of the place,"  he said.  </P> <P> There were other factors. Pitino didn't consider his efforts fully appreciated  in New York. He helped turn around a struggling franchise in two seasons, but  still he heard the occasional remarks concerning his coaching style (too  rah-rah, critics said) and his playing scheme (too heavy on the press and  three-pointers). Nor did Pitino get along well with Knick General Manager Al  Bianchi.  </P> <P> "I should have never left Providence, in hindsight," Pitino said. "Though my  experience in New York was invaluable, I should have never left Providence.  </P> <P> "It was an emotional time for me. It was a thing that if you're a New Yorker  and you grow up 10 streets away from Madison Square Garden, how do you turn  down the New York Knicks' job? A year later, the Providence job reopened, and I  was offered the job to come back. In hindsight, I felt that I couldn't do that,  but that's what I should have done.  </P> <P> "When this job opened up, I just wanted to get back to college basketball at  that point. And there's no finer place to go than Kentucky if you're going to  come back to college basketball."  </P> <P> Pitino's impact has been immediate and noticeable. For instance:  </P> <P>  -- Without a player taller than 6-foot-7, the Wildcats have won with a  stifling defense and an offense that specializes in the three-point shot.  </P> <P> A seven-man rotation works only because Pitino ran the Wildcats in their  preseason conditioning drills until they dropped . . . or worse. A large  garbage can strategically placed near courtside was a multipurpose container.  </P> <P> "It was basically for cups, but it wasn't uncommon to see someone hanging  around there, if you know what I mean," said John Pelphrey, a forward who  survived.  </P> <P>  -- When Kentucky traveled to Somerset, Manchester, Maysville and Frankfort for  its traditional in-state scrimmages, Pitino took the on-court microphone and  conducted a question-and-answer session with fans, as well as detailing the  proper techniques for cheering.  </P> <P> "In one year, he's gotten the crowd to do what cheerleaders have been trying to  do here for years," said Chris Cameron, the school's sports information  director.  </P> <P>  -- During a practice session the day before Kentucky played North Carolina,  Pitino organized a slam-dunk contest for his players, answered questions from  the assembled fans and then invited everyone down to the court to meet the  Wildcat players.  </P> <P> Another time, he conducted a team scrimmage exclusively for Kentucky students,  staff and faculty -- no general public allowed.  </P> <P>  -- Pitino actually put in some serious time at his own UK basketball camp,  something of a first for the people used to the cameo appearances made by  Sutton.  </P> <P>  -- He appealed for the school's best musicians to try out for the pep band.  </P> <P>  -- He happily agreed to include such state schools as Eastern Kentucky and  Western Kentucky on future schedules, heretofore considered sacrilegious by  Adolph Rupp, Joe B. Hall and Sutton.  </P> <P> "I didn't realize that Kentucky didn't play in-state schools before, figuring  it had everything to lose and nothing to gain," Pitino said. "(Kentucky) wanted  fans border to border. I said, 'That's ludicrous.' If they wanted to play us,  we're no better than anyone else."  </P> <P>  -- He already has plans to hang the jerseys of Kentucky's All-Americans from  the Rupp Arena rafters, to attach plaques to each player's locker. Engraved on  each plaque will be the names of previous UK players who wore that particular  jersey number.  </P> <P>  -- And, in what amounted to the Kentucky equivalent of merging church and  state, Curry was invited to appear on Pitino's weekly television show.  </P> <P> "Everybody made such a big deal about it," Pitino said. "I said I had him on  for two reasons: one, to make him feel welcome; and, two, for the ratings."  </P> <P> Little things, but all designed to give Kentucky back some of its pride.  </P> <P> Pitino can do little wrong these days. Kentucky fans loved it when Pitino,  during a game against Indiana, told the game officials never to allow Indiana  Coach Bobby Knight to intimidate them. And despite a later reprimand from the  SEC commissioner's office, Kentucky followers weren't overly upset when Pitino  nearly traded punches with Louisiana State's Dale Brown at courtside last  month.  </P> <P> So popular is Pitino that about 5,000 fans remain in their seats to watch the  coach do his postgame radio show. One time, as forward Reggie Hanson walked  toward an exit, Pitino called him over to the microphone and asked him on the  air why the player was so well dressed. Hanson smiled nervously.  </P> <P> "No, really," Pitino said. "Is this a big date or a regular date?"  </P> <P> Pitino's workday usually begins about 5:30 a.m., when he and the rest of his  coaching staff arrive at Memorial Coliseum for their daily pickup basketball  game. According to Ralph Willard, associate coach and longtime friend, Pitino  is the best player because of sheer will.  </P> <P> "No matter what he does, he wants to win," Willard said. "He has a real passion  for what he does. Rick takes it to another level. He lives, breathes, eats,  sleeps, drinks (basketball)."  </P> <P> Willard, who coached with Pitino in New York, said his boss becomes so involved  in games that he often returns to the locker room at halftime with shirt and  suit coat soaked in sweat. Nor is it unusual for Pitino to become so enraged  over a costly error that he turns to Willard and, in all seriousness, says,  "You're fired."  </P> <P> Said Willard: "Sometimes he doesn't even realize he said what he said. He's  fired us a hundred times."  </P> <P> It is a Pitino coaching tradition to have a cup of diet root beer or cream soda  nearby at all times. It keeps his throat moist, allowing him to yell  constantly. Last year, as the Knicks played the Detroit Pistons, Pitino reached  for his cup and found it empty. His face filled with rage, Pitino turned to the  team trainer. "What do you think I am, a camel?" he screamed. "Get me a drink!"  </P> <P> For the first time since he began coaching college teams, Pitino is telling  recruits that he will be there to see them graduate. It is his way of informing  Kentucky that he has made an honest commitment to a program in dire need of  one.  </P> <P> At times, he misses New York, when he could dine at a restaurant and have to  sign only the credit card receipt. The Knicks used to play in Los Angeles,  Seattle and Chicago. Kentucky visits Starkville, Miss.; Tuscaloosa, Ala., and  Athens, Ga.  </P> <P> It is a different life, complete with some local wise guy entrepreneurs selling  hats that read, "Rick Pitino: Brought to you by Emery."  </P> <P> The hats are gone, but Pitino remains. He said he plans to stay for a long  time.  </P> <P> "Wherever I've been, I've been happy," he said. "But my life is not the life of  a normal person. My life goes as basketball goes. That may sound shallow, but  it's true."  </P> <P> And right now, life couldn't be better.  </P></p>

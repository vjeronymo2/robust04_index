			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Unipart expands to Pounds 13.3m Rapidly expanding motor component manufacturing activities helped Unipart, the motor parts and accessories group once owned by Rover Group, achieve an increase in first half pre-tax profits from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 13.3m. Mr John Neill the chief executive, reported the figures to July 2 from turnover 14 per cent higher at Pounds 401m (Pounds 353m). The figures were accompanied by the disclosure that a recently-formed joint venture with Air International Group of Australia to produce vehicle air-conditioning systems has started its first development work, for General Motors' Opel car making subsidiary. Unipart DCM, the group's parts distribution division, has also just won the contract to take over all parts distribution in France for luxury car maker Jaguar. Mr Neill added that he did not expect this year's second half 'to be any worse' than the first. There were 'mixed signals' about demand, so Unipart would continue to focus on reducing costs.</p>

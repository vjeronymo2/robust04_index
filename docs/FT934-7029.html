			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Observer: Macleod's day Meanwhile it did not take long to spot the odd man out at the summit. Hamish Macleod, a 53-year-old Scottish civil servant, can scarcely have expected to be rubbing shoulders so informally with the leaders of 40 per cent of the world's population when he was appointed to be Hong Kong's financial secretary. However as all three Chinas - China, Taiwan and Hong Kong - are members of Apec it was politic only for one to send its head of government. So Macleod, a mild-mannered St Andrews graduate who has worked his way up the Hong Kong government since joining as an administrative officer in 1966, was sent as Hong Kong's 'economic leader'. What Jiang Zemin, China's president, thought of having Macleod sitting next to him in all the meetings is not recorded.</p>

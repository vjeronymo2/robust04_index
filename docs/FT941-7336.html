			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Covent Garden scheme revised The Royal Opera House in Covent Garden has dropped proposals to help fund its redevelopment by building commercial offices, according to new plans unveiled yesterday. The new scheme, drawn up by Stanhope Properties, depends on securing cash from the Millennium Fund from the National Lottery, and from public appeal. It involves modernising the stage facilities, providing more seats, restoring the adjacent Floral Hall building and giving the Royal Ballet a home at Covent Garden. The opera house won planning consent in 1990 for a scheme which incorporated commercial office and retail space. This proposal was criticised by conservationists and became less commercially attractive as a result of the decline in the property market. A review of the scheme found that if the office space were removed it would not be necessary to have deep basements and the project would take less time and money. If the new plan is approved by Westminster City Council and funding is available, the opera house is expected to close in 1997 and reopen by the year 2000.</p>

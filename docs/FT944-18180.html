			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Indicators up 0.6% in August The US government index pointing to future economic activity rose in August by the largest amount since March, led by strong orders for consumer goods and materials. The index of leading economic indicators went up by 0.6 per cent in the month, following no change in July and a modest 0.2 per cent advance in June. In March the index had jumped by 0.7 per cent. The August performance, confirming the National Association of Purchasing Managers report, published on Monday and showing continuing strong expansion, was in line with market expectations and had little early impact on equity prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 7 points in morning trading. Nine of the 11 component parts of the index rose last month. The largest contributions were made by manufacturers' new orders, vendor performance, state unemployment benefits claims and stock prices. Two elements declined - the money supply and unfilled orders by manufacturers. The overall increase meant the index was 3.8 per cent higher than a year ago, according to the commerce department. But market analysts expected a smaller increase in September.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 23 (CTK) -- "Mr. President has never and  nowhere said that the Benes decrees (on the displacement of  Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia after World War Two) should  be abolished," Ladislav Spacek, spokesman for Czech President  Vaclav Havel, told journalists today.    He was reacting to the 45th Sudeten German congress held in  Nuremberg last weekend, at which German Finance Minister and  chairman of the government Christian Social Union (CSU), Theo  Waigel, expressed himself for the abolition of the Benes  decrees. This idea was also supported by Austrian Foreign  Minister Alois Mock, Bavarian Premier Edmund Stoiber and  chairman of the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft Franz Neubauer.  Mock and Neubauer referred to earlier statements by Havel.    "President Vaclav Havel declared his resolute stance -- that  it was impossible to abolish the Benes decrees -- even in his  statement mentioned" (at the Nuremberg congress), Spacek said.  He added that quotations of Havel at the congress were  inaccurate. To prove this, Spacek recalled a statement made by  Havel during his visit to Austria in March 1993, in which the  Czech president said: "Given the time interval separating us  from the issuing of the decrees, my stance towards them is  critical, but this does not mean that these ancient legal acts  can be simply annulled or abolished."    Spacek said it would be premature to evaluate the Nuremberg  congress in the nearest days, and therefore Havel could not be  expected to do so.</p>

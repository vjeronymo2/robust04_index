			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Colgate-Palmolive advances 6% Rapid volume growth in the developing world and an improvement in gross margins helped Colgate-Palmolive, the US consumer products group, report a 6 per cent increase in first-quarter net income to Dollars 149.6m, excluding the effect of last year's accounting changes. Turnover rose to Dollars 1.77bn from Dollars 1.7bn and earnings per share, driven up by a stock repurchasing programme that removed 8 per cent of the issued equity, rose by 15 per cent to 98 cents. Colgate-Palmolive's shareholders are used to seeing the fastest growth coming from the company's markets in Latin America, Asia and Africa, because its older markets in North America and Europe are mature. Yesterday, it appeared the trend might have reversed when the company reported an unusually large unit volume growth of 4 per cent in its North American market, attributing the gain to new products like Irish Spring liquid soap and Palmolive Ultra dishwashing powder. However, Colgate-Palmolive said the value of sales in North America had declined because of continuing pressure on prices in the highly competitive US market. In the developing world, Colgate-Asia/Africa saw a 23 per cent increase in net volume, with 'outstanding' performances from Malaysia, Hong Kong, China and South Africa. Colgate-Latin America saw a broad-based 9 per cent increase in volume growth. Colgate-Europe increased volume by 1 per cent.</p>

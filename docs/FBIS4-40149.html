			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 14 (YONHAP) -- Russia would agree to  phased sanctions against North Korea if Pyongyang seeks to  withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), Russian  President Boris Yeltsin said on Tuesday.    In an airport press conference prior to his departure for a  local tour, Yeltsin said, "If North Korea tries to push ahead  with its withdrawal from the NPT, Russia would convene an  emergency international meeting and agree to phased sanctions  against Pyongyang."    He said he had a telephone conversation with U.S. President  Bill Clinton Monday on the North Korean nuclear question and  Korean situation.    Russian televisions and radios reported that in their  telephone talks, it was agreed that President Yeltsin would make  an official visit to the United States in coming autumn.    One of the major topics of the Yeltsin-Clinton meeting would  be the North Korean nuclear question in addition to the issue of  bilateral economic cooperation, they said.    Meanwhile, an ITAR-TASS report said a senior Chinese Defense  Ministry official on Monday gave a strong-worded message to Choe  Kwang, chief of the General Staff of the North Korean People's  Army, that North Korea should not depart from its being a  non-nuclear country.</p>

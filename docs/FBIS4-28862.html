			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- Working people of  various strata in Pyongyang held a mass rally today and bitterly  denounced the Japanese reactionaries' reckless suppression of  the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon)  and Koreans in Japan as a gross infringement upon the dignity  and sovereignty of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    In his speech, Yu Ho-chun, director of the Secretariat of  the  Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification  of the Fatherland, said: The recent fascist suppression and  persecution of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan by the Japanese  reactionaries are hostile acts most vicious ever since the  inauguration of Chongnyon. In view of their look and danger the  acts remind us of the eve of the Korean war when the Japanese  reactionaries suppressed the Federation of Koreans in Japan  (Choyon) and Japan-resident Koreans.    Noting that the suppression was not an accidental incident,  the speaker said:    The Japanese reactionaries are now openly scheming  "constitutional amendment," "emergency legislative arrangements"  and "measures for domestic security" in a bid to stage a  military comeback to Korea and the rest of Asia, while serving  the U.S. imperialists and the international reactionary forces  as a shock brigade in their frantic moves to isolate and stifle  the DPRK under the pretext of its fictitious "nuclear issue."    Branding the suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan  by  the Japanese reactionaries as a heinous crime which cannot be  justified with anything, Yu Ho-chun said:    We cannot remain an onlooker to the criminal acts of the  Japanese authorities, who have committed an unheard-of  suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan, availing  themselves of the anti-DPRK moves of the United States and the  South Korean puppets. We will always keep tabs on them.    The Japanese authorities must act with discretion, pondering  over all the consequences to be entailed by their antagonism  against and harsh suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan  and promptly stop the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon moves.    Speeches were made also by Vice-chairman of the Korean  Committee for Aiding Overseas Compatriots Kim Tong-sop,  permanent member of the Korea-Japan Friendship Association Paek  Pong-kyu, a faculty dean of the Korean University of Chongnyon  Ku Tae-sok and Korea-resident Japanese woman Sin Chong-ho.    They demanded that the Japanese reactionaries immediately  stop the suppression of Chongnyon, apologize for it, liquidate  the past doings of aggression and plunder against the Korean  people and make an adequate compensation, clearly mindful that  the suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan is a foolish  act of wringing their own necks.    A letter of protest to the Japanese Government was adopted  at  the rally.    It says that though the Japanese authorities intend to  attain  their sinister political purpose without difficulty by launching  the repressive campaign against Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan  at a time when the international reactionaries are intensifying  their moves to take "sanctions" against the DPRK, this is a  mistake.    The letter says:    The Japanese authorities must stop acting rashly and know  that antagonism against the DPRK and the suppression of  Chongnyon will bring nothing favorable to them.    Strong is the will and resolution of the Korean people at  home and in Japan, who hold the sovereignty and dignity of the  nation dearer than their lives.    We strongly demand that the Japanese authorities apologize  for the unjustifiable suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in  Japan, promise to refrain from such acts and take steps to  sternly punish the masterminds of the recent cases.    We also state that it is a good option for the Japanese  authorities not to join the international reactionaries in their  reckless moves to take "sanctions" against the DPRK in a bid to  stifle it.    We will never tolerate the infringement on the national  dignity and democratic national rights of Chongnyon, an  organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK, and Koreans in  Japan but decisively counter it to the end.    Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of  Korea Kim Chung-nin and Vice-premier of the Administration  Council Chang Chol were present at the rally.</p>

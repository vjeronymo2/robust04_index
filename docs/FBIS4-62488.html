			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy speaker of Moldova's parliament, Dmitry  Motspan, who leads the Agrarian Democratic Party (INTERFAX note:  parliamentary majority party) qualified the call for setting up  a Russian military base in Moldova as political speculation.  "Having proclaimed itself a demilitarized zone, Moldova does  not accept the idea of turning Russia's 14th Army into a  military base or maintaining the army on its soil under some  other status," he told INTERFAX on Monday [16 May].    "To define a political status for Trans-Dniestria and for  the  localities populated largely by the Gagauzi is a primary problem  requiring urgent solution," Motspan said. According to him,  "it would be good to determine the status of Trans-Dniestria and  Gagauzi-populated localities prior to adopting a new  Constitution, so that it could be reflected in the fundamental  laws."    "A new constitution will have to be adopted no later than  this autumn in any case," the deputy speaker said. "By that time  some of the problems connected with the special status of  Moldova's southern and eastern areas might remain unresolved,"  Motspan said.    If a new constitution is adopted earlier than a special  status for Trans-Dniestria and the Gagauzi-populated areas is  determined, "no amendments to the Constitution will be  required," Motspan said. "The fundamental laws will state that  Moldova is an independent state, and the establishment of a  federation or confederation on its territory is inadmissible,"  he said.    The leader of Moldovan agrarians believes that another armed  conflict in Trans-Dniestria must not be allowed to take place.  At the same time he expressed willingness to "cooperate in the  endeavors to resolve this and other problems with any political  forces, even if they are not represented in the parliament."</p>

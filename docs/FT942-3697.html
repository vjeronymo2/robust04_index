			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Voters wary of grand designs - Rebellious mood tempered by yearning for greater security / The European Parliament has a chance to exert real influence The new European parliament has made an inauspicious start. Low voter turnout has again challenged the legitimacy of an institution which claims to represent the European Union's best chance of increasing democratic accountability. Apathy was expected in the UK but the mood seems to have spread to the Netherlands, Ireland and Portugal, traditional bastions of Euro-enthusiasm. Where electors failed to show indifference, they demonstrated defiance. With the exception of Germany, where Mr Helmut Kohl's victory shows how much voters still lean toward Stabilitat uber alles, the politics of protest scored heavily. The main - practically the only - left-wing victory came in the UK, where the British government's insistence in keeping the majority voting system for Euro elections has resulted in a disproportionate increase in the Socialist group in Strasbourg. Across Europe, the outcome was one of kaleidoscopic variety. In France, Mr Bernard Tapie and Mr Philippe de Villiers, mavericks of the left and right, emerged far stronger than expected. In Italy, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi showed that his Forza Italia movement's general election victory in March was more than simply an isolated surge of resentment with the political establishment. In Spain, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez joins Mr John Major as one more incumbent leader in deep trouble. The picture that emerged on Sunday night contains conflicting and contradictory elements. The forces of fragmentation unleashed by the collapse of communism in eastern Europe are still on the loose in the west. Disillusionment with political elites remains palpable. But rebelliousness is tempered by a yearning for greater security. Curiously, the EU looks a safer and more attractive place from outside than from inside. Perhaps the most significant result will turn out to be the overwhelming Austrian vote on Sunday in favour of joining the European Union. The big question is whether the EU, now attempting to bring in four new members from the European Free Trade Association, can reconcile this volatile public mood with the grand designs drawn up in the Maastricht treaty. Can Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose chances of remaining in office in the October general election have clearly grown, coax the German electorate into accepting a fixed timetable for surrendering the D-Mark in economic and monetary union (Emu)? Can President Francois Mitterrand's successor in 1995 persuade his fellow Frenchmen that the price of winning German support for Emu will be political union - an arrangement which will necessarily constrain French sovereignty in foreign and security policy? Can a weakened Felipe Gonzalez encourage Spaniards to accept the labour market flexibility and public spending discipline which remain crucial to Spain's economic future? Mr Hans Van den Broek, former Dutch foreign minister and now EU Commissioner for external political affairs, said on Sunday night that it was very difficult for the ordinary European citizen to recapture enthusiasm for the European ideal in the absence of 'concrete achievements'. He singled out EU's impotence in the face of the conflict in Bosnia, despite its huge humanitarian aid effort. And he pointed to the EU's army of unemployed, now past the 18m mark. A Commission official adds: 'Europe has failed to answer the question: 'What's in it for me?' ' In search of an answer, the newly-elected parliament can play a constructive role. Not a decisive role, because its powers are limited. It cannot initiate legislation, for that is the sole prerogative of the Commission. Nor does it enjoy direct revenue raising powers. But the new Maastricht right of co-decision on Euro-legislation, which it shares with the Council of Ministers, offer MEPs the opportunity to put the parliament on the map. The chances of MEPs exerting real influence depend on a variety of factors, starting with the composition of the parliament. At least 60 per cent of the intake will be new members. With luck, many should be superior in quality to their predecessors, a motley bunch of mavericks and freeloaders interspersed with genuine talent (much of which was to be found among British MEPs, widely praised by their peers in a pre-election survey conducted led by Liberation, the French daily). It is unclear, however, how the new groupings and parties will work with each other in order to strengthen the parliament's influence on legislation as well as its power alongside the Commission and the Council. The parliament's institutional future will itself a crucial question at the intergovernmental conference to review Maastricht in 1996. The Socialist group is likely to be the parliament's single most cohesive group. The centre right has gained strength, but the Christian Democrat-dominated European People's Party remains fragmented, with the allegiances of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the French Gaullists in doubt. The British Labour party is by far the strongest force in the Socialist group. Although the Socialists may be able to assert themselves in the parliament, their influence will meet natural limits in the form of the continuing predominance of centre-right governments in the Council of Ministers. The lack of political harmony between parliament and Council raises another large question. How far is the parliament ready to use its muscle to challenge the Council not just on the fine points of Euro-legislation but also on the wider question of democratic accountability in decision-making? An early test of strength will turn on the choice of the next president of the European Commission, a decision to be taken in secret by the 12 EU heads of government, possibly at next week's European summit in Corfu. Under the Maastricht treaty, the parliament is called upon to approve the selection. To exert a veto would be tantamount to pressing a nuclear button. But MEPs could use the opportunity of their high profile in public debate to pass judgment on the wisdom of the choice, and could also put forward a list of legislative priorities for the next Commission. MEPs are considering holding quasi-Congressional hearings to question the Commission president's team, sending a clear signal to member states that the practice of sending political deadbeats to Brussels is no longer acceptable. The task for the new Euro-assembly will be to exercise and develop its present powers without provoking the Council (and national parliaments) to the extent of causing a backlash at the 1996 inter-governmental conference. If they can succeed in this design, and somehow simultaneously win the trust and engage the interest of the Euro-electorate, MEPs might be able to claim that they have finally come of age.</p>

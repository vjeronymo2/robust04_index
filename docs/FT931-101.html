			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Nestor-BNA down 20% and buys agency chain NESTOR-BNA, the nursing agency group, recorded a drop in pre-tax profits in 1992 to Pounds 4.2m. The 1991 figure was Pounds 5.3m, after an exceptional charge of Pounds 840,000. The group also took an extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.5m relating to its near-20 per cent stake in Nutri/System (UK), the weight loss business now being closed down. As a result there was a retained loss of Pounds 1.7m (profit Pounds 1.9m). Nestor-BNA also announced the acquisition of a 15-branch nursing agency chain from Bupa, the private health insurance group. The purchase was for Pounds 2.2m including taking on debt of Pounds 1.8m. Mr Clive Chapman, finance director, said the deal raised gearing from 180 per cent at the year end - when net debt was Pounds 13.2m - to about 300 per cent because of a goodwill write off as well as the extra debt. There will also be restructuring costs involved in integrating the business. Group turnover fell 4 per cent to Pounds 96.3m (Pounds 100.5m) and operating profits fell 28 per cent to Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 7.7m). All six divisions were in profit but only the UK nursing agencies and the doctors deputising service showed an increase. Interest took Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1.5m). Earnings per share were 4.3p (5.81p). The proposed final is held at 2p to give a maintained total of 3.15p.</p>

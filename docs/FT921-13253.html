			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Testing time for the new man of letters - The job facing Alan Johnson as leader of the postal workers' union ALAN TUFFIN inherited a special telephone when he took over as general secretary of the UCW postal workers' union in 1982. 'That's the hotline. If it rings, it's either the prime minister or the chancellor of the exchequer,' said Mr Tom Jackson, Mr Tuffin's famously mustachioed predecessor, as he cleared his desk. A decade later Mr Tuffin is preparing, in turn, to hand over his office to Mr Alan Johnson, whose election as UCW general secretary-designate was announced on Friday. The telephone - not the vibrant red one might imagine for a hotline, but a dusty, old-fashioned ivory model - still sits on the desk. It has only rung once in Mr Tuffin's time as UCW leader. 'Somebody wanted to know if it was Sainsbury's,' says Mr Tuffin wistfully. 'I've never had the luxury of a Labour government. I've had to deal with a hostile, anti-trade union government for all the time I've been general secretary.' Number 10 no longer quakes at the prospect of postal workers flexing their industrial muscle. The Christmas card is still played most years, as postal deliveries are briefly threatened as part of pay negotiating tactics. But there have been just two national postal strikes in the past two decades - apart from some stoppages at Crown Post Offices last year, which affected few people. If a Labour government is back in power by the time Mr Johnson takes over next year, the worst of the union's fears on privatisation of the postal service are unlikely to be realised. However, the union would still face a number of threats and pressures. They include: New rules from the European Community that are likely to increase competition and tighten up on cross-subsidies, for example between letter and parcel services. The effect might be the loss of Post Office business - and UCW members - to largely non-unionised private operators. New technology, which might mean the reduction of postal sorting jobs. UCW membership has been bolstered in recent years by the growth in postal volumes; but further technological advances might outstrip volume gains. That has been the case among another of the union's former strong membership groups, BT telephone operators. Internal Post Office reorganisation, including separation of the different businesses, to which the union is only now beginning to respond. Fragmentation of bargaining has stretched negotiating resources and, at the same time, the UCW's local structure is under threat from Post Office management. A special union conference next month will discuss how to slim down the existing 800 branches to about 80. To date, the union has managed to avoid the kind of political divisions which consume so much energy in some other unions. A smaller number of more powerful branches might leave the UCW more vulnerable to factionalism in future. The need to professionalise and streamline head office bureaucracy. The UCW elects rather than appoints its officers, a policy meaning that, in many cases, parallel professional appointments have to be made to ensure a reasonable degree of head office competence. Management consultants have recommended changes but a special conference of the union last year rejected many of the proposals. Radical internal reorganisation is unlikely until after any merger with the National Communications Union. Mr Tuffin hopes to see the merger agreed before he steps down next year; the election of Mr Johnson, who is fervently pro-merger, increases the chances of that happening. Combining with the NCU to form a union with about 350,000 members - of which the UCW will contribute about 200,000 - would not put the merged body into the super-union league, neither would it ease the difficulties of being linked to a single sector at a time of great change. A merger would, however, allow the best use of resources as the search for new membership groups becomes more urgent. What of Mr Johnson himself? He is comparatively unknown outside the communications union world. He did, however, hit the headlines briefly a few months ago when the union extracted an apology from Reebok, the maker of training shoes, over advertising posters featuring postmen pursued by dogs. Mr Johnson is well-known for his sense of humour but, as an ex-postman, finds jokes about dogs too close to the bone. He is seen as having great promise - a natural successor to Mr Tuffin, but from an updated mould. Mr Peter Hain, the UCW's former head of research and now Labour MP for Neath, thinks Mr Johnson will be 'one of the brightest stars in the trade union movement'. Now 41, Mr Johnson is young for the job but, as a man who had three children by the time he was 20, he has some practice of being ahead of his years. He was orphaned as a child, narrowly escaping a children's home when it was decided his older sister should look after him. He is a Queens Park Rangers fan and assiduously follows The Archers on Radio 4. Like Mr Tuffin, he came up through the union's ranks and is stoutly Kinnockite. He is a lucid speaker, reputed to be a quick and meticulous negotiator, and is said to abhor old-style table thumping. His election address points out that union members need no 'recitation of the problems they face; they need to be confident that we have the vitality and ingenuity to find solutions'. As for the ivory telephone on what will be his new desk - he plans to keep it, just in case.</p>

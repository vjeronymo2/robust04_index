			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Population growth warning Half the world's population will be living in cities by the end of this decade, leading to critical shortages of clean water, housing and health care, according to Population Concern, the UK-based family planning charity, writes Bronwen Maddox. The world's population is growing by 96m people a year, with more than 80 per cent of the growth in towns, it says. The UN has forecast that the world's population could double to more than 10bn people by the middle of the next century.</p>

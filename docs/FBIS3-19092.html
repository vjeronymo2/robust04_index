No Lifting of Blockade in Near Future"; as released by  Bern ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Geneva, 10 Mar (ATS) -- Cyrus Vance, UN mediator in  the dispute between Greece and The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia [FYROM], had a long meeting in Geneva on Thursday [10  March] with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. "There is  room for a solution but obstacles remain," Mr. Vance said after  the meeting in which he handed Mr. Papoulias a "document," the  contents of which he did not reveal.    The Greek minister welcomed the "excellent climate" which  prevailed during this meeting. A second meeting will probably  be held in "the near future," Mr. Vance said. Meanwhile, "our  representatives will meet to continue the search for a means of  breaking the deadlock," Mr. Papoulias explained.    The question of the blockade imposed by Greece on FYROM must  be "discussed." "I do not think that this blockade will be  lifted soon," Mr. Papoulias stressed. The lifting of the  blockade will have to "form part of an overall solution to the  problem" of FYROM, the Greek minister said.    Following his first meeting with the UN mediator, Mr.  Papoulias left Geneva for Belgrade, according to his spokesman.  No meeting therefore will be held in Geneva, as had been  rumored, between the Greek minister and FYROM Foreign Minister  Stevo Crvenkovski, who meanwhile had arrived in the lakeside  city.  <H5>  Damaging Effects </H5>   Mr. Crvenkovski had a meeting with Mr. Vance late in the  afternoon. The FYROM minister stressed the "illegal" nature of  the blockade whose effects are "enormously" damaging for the  FYROM economy.    Mr. Papoulias reaffirmed to the European Parliament in  Strasbourg on Wednesday that Athens had decided on an economic  blockade to defend itself from FYROM's "aggressive attitudes."  Since 16 February, the passage of goods for FYROM through the  Greek port of Salonika has been banned. In addition, the Greek  Consulate in Skopje, capital of the FYROM, has been closed.    Greece is demanding that the Skopje government abandon its  flag, which shows the Vergina sun (symbol of the late Macedonian  dynasty), and the name "Macedonia." This name, Athens points  out in substance, implies territorial claims on the northern  province of Greece which has been called "Macedonia" for  centuries.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Conservative Party vice presidential </F> candidate Luis Fernando Ramirez by Carlos Murcia; place and date  not given; first paragraph is EL ESPECTADOR introduction]    [Text] The fight between the Samper-De la Calle and the  Pastrana-Ramirez Acuna tickets is now set. As a good  Santanderean, former minister Luis Fernando Ramirez does not  avoid confrontation. It was said of him that he was fine as a  government official, but as a politician he brought nothing to  candidate Andres Pastrana. In just a few hours he managed to  disprove that. One thing he said in this interview will  certainly draw fire: "Samper was disloyal to President Gaviria  when he was in the government...."    [Murcia] The Samper people are still saying that you are  ineligible. What is your response?    [Ramirez] Concerning my supposed political ineligibility, I  repeat that they are mistaken. The Council of State settled that  in response to a query from the minister of government on 10  June 1993, when it categorically stated that having been a  member of a ministerial cabinet or a government official creates  no legal bar to being vice president. There is no such  ineligibility for the vice president or the president.    [Murcia] Horacio Serpa says that you could not become  president as you were a government official until last Saturday.    [Ramirez] That contradicts the position of the Council of  State. In terms of ineligibility, analogies can not be applied.  The Constitution lists a single cause of ineligibility for the  vice presidency: he must not have served as vice president  during the preceding term.    [Murcia] Why do you think your ticket is better than the  liberal ticket of Samper and De la Calle?    [Ramirez] We represent the future, they the past. In our  case, there is unity of views, identity of platforms. We did not  have to give up our principles or our platforms for electoral  purposes. Our program has great credibility and viability,  especially for voters who, in past elections, when they looked  at the ballot and saw Samper and De la Calle, decided to stay  home.    [Murcia] Why did you agree so quickly when they called you  early Saturday morning and offered you the candidacy?    [Ramirez] Despite my state of mind because of my father's  kidnapping, I made the decision after talking it over with  Andres Pastrana and the campaign team, for we have a strong  commitment to Colombia. We represent a young but experienced  ticket. I have worked on the economic and social reforms of the  recent governments with both President Gaviria and President  Barco. I know the program that best suits Colombia in this  second phase, and that is the platform of Andres Pastrana. It  seems a good opportunity for me to continue to serve the nation.    [Murcia] It is said that you are not a politician in this  campaign.    [Ramirez] I believe that explains the very high abstention  rates. People are tired of the traditional politician who is in  a state of constant contradiction and in search of political  compromises, so that he has to sacrifice a government program.  People wonder if in the future those who acted like that will  not again place their personal interests ahead of the nation's  interests. In our case, the ticket does not reflect a political  compromise but rather an identity of views and a cohesion of  ideas and a shared commitment to the nation. It was not put  together for purely electoral purposes.    [Murcia] Why a conservative and not a liberal for the  Pastrana ticket?    [Ramirez] The Andres Pastrana and Luis Fernando Ramirez  ticket is for all Colombians, not just for conservatives. With  this ticket, we call upon liberals, conservatives, independents,  and especially those who did not take part in the liberal  primary because they found no program there that was viable for  Colombia in the 21st century. I believe a liberal could have  been chosen for the vice presidency, but the politicians'  mistake is believing that people still vote in response to party  labels. The people can see that ours is a platform aimed toward  the future.    [Murcia] Why do Samper and De la Calle not offer  credibility?    [Ramirez] The people are very concerned about the  differences  between Samper and De la Calle. Dr. De la Calle had been saying  that Samper had placed a car bomb on the social security  program, and then overnight he joined forces with the  "carbomber." The Colombian people fear that in the government  the same differences that arose between Samper and Gaviria might  recur between Samper and De la Calle.    [Murcia] Are you suggesting that Samper was a "fifth  columnist" inside the government?    [Ramirez] There is no doubt that he was a "fifth columnist."  All of Gaviria's reforms were made against Samper's opposition.  Economic liberalization, social security, even the foreign trade  reform. He certainly was not very loyal when he was in the  government. That is what people fear might happen with a Samper  government, that De la Calle might apply the same medicine,  because their platforms are not the same. They have already  showed their true colors, and it does not bother them to alter  their platforms in order to work out a political deal. You  wonder if, when they have to choose between what is best for the  nation and what is best for them, they might not choose the  second alternative.    [Murcia] You were a key player during the debates in  Congress  on the social security and pension system reform. Will that help  you or hurt you in the campaign--with the workers, for example?    [Ramirez] I think President Gaviria himself answered that  question when he said it is the most important social reform  Colombia has had in the last 50 years. That is a guarantee that  in the Pastrana government program, social policy will occupy a  leading place.    [Murcia] Do you think this is the right time to hold public  debates, with frankness, on the platforms of one ticket or  another?    [Ramirez] I believe it is best for the country if we present  our platforms so we can see which campaign has internal  differences and which is consistent, with united views. We are  ready for those debates.</p>

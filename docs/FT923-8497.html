			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE DERIVATIVES markets had a dull trading session, with prices drifting lower as traders backed away in the face of Tokyo's poor performance and the setback across the range of markets in Europe, writes Terry Byland. The September contract on the FT-SE index had a poor day, trading for most of the session below its fair value premium - the figure which allows for financing costs and dividend flows on the underlying stocks. The contract opened some 18 points down on Friday's close and, after briefly trimming the loss, fell away smartly. At the day's low, September traded at around 2,321 and a rally to the 2,335 area was thwarted when New York opened uncertainly. Traders reported some arbitrage selling throughout the day, with one large US firm buying and a London firm selling. At the official close, the contract stood at 2,329, but it came under further pressure in after-hours dealing. In traded options, the FT-SE and Euro FT-SE contracts were the most active as dealers arbitraged between falling stock prices across Europe. The most active stock option was British Gas, with a mere 689 contracts. Total trading volume increased to 26,974 contracts from Friday's 20,619.</p>

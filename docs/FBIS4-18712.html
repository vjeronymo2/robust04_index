			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Any Government Can Continue </F> Privatizations, Ciampi"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 7 -- Privatizations begun under  his administration can continue under either a left-wing or a  right-wing government, according to acting Prime Minister Carlo  Azeglio Ciampi.    "Privatizations are compatible with a government of the  right  or of the left," Ciampi said in a public television interview,  adding that two positive results will come from privatizations:  "improved company management and the creation of a wider  financial market, which this country needs."    The state will not "disappear" from the economic field,  Ciampi said: "it will remain part of the economy because it's  good for the state to be present in some sectors and because it  is the state that sets rules and enforces the rules, leaving the  private sector free to work within these rules."    Deregulation, according to Ciampi, means "greater freedom to  operate, not the total abandonment of all rules."    Ciampi stressed that the central bank must retain its  autonomy and that the government must provide "direction and  guarantees."    Turning back to privatizations, Ciampi said that when his  government was formed in spring 1993, there had been talk of  privatizations for years but that nothing had been done. Now  they are under full steam, he claimed, citing the sale of Comit,  Credit and part of IMI [Italian Institute for Financing Personal  and Real Property], and plans for the sale of STET [Turin  Telephone Finance Company] and SME, as well as part of the steel  sector.    He also predicted that fiscal pressure would drop one  percent  this year.</p>

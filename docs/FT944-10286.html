			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / People: More bang for 'pretty boxes' Derek Mottershead, 47, the former chief executive of Prontaprint, has been given the job of putting the bang back into the UK business of Bang &amp; Olufsen, the 70-year-old Danish family firm which makes specialist TV and audio products. Bang &amp; Olufsen, a minnow in a market dominated by multinationals, made a name for itself because of its flair for design and clever technology. However, the company lost its way at the end of the 1980s and sales in the UK, which was once the company's biggest overseas market, have fallen by around two thirds from a peak of around Pounds 40m a year. Just over three years ago a new management team took over in Denmark and the company's fortunes have been recovering. Mottershead, who started out as a Cadbury Schweppes' brand manager, believes that Bang &amp; Olufsen's problems in the UK stem from a perception that its products are 'very high-priced and too design-orientated'. There is a lot more to the group than 'pretty boxes', says Mottershead. While most of Bang &amp; Olufsen's competitors concentrate on volume and prices, Mottershead believes that the key to success is to use the combination of the Danish firm's technical innovation and styling to promote 'life style' products. Mottershead, a former chairman of the British Franchise Association, joined Prontaprint, the Darlington-based print and business service franchiser, in 1987 and doubled turnover over the next four years. The company was taken over the following year and in September 1992 Mottershead led a management buy-out. He resigned as chairman and managing director of Prontaprint in August 1993 because he says that he was fed up with commuting between two homes at either end of the country.</p>

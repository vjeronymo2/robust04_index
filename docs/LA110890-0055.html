			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO STATE;  </P> <P> SAGAPOLUTELE TO SEE SOME OLD FRIENDS  </P> <P> San Diego State defensive end Pio Sagapolutele will be seeing plenty of  familiar faces Saturday when Hawaii plays the Aztecs at San Diego Jack Murphy  Stadium. Sagapolutele went to Maryknoll High in Honolulu and one of his  teammates there was Hawaii quarterback Garrett Gabriel. He is also friends with  several of the other players.  </P> <P> "We're good friends," Sagapolutele said of Gabriel. "I'm good friends with half  of the offensive team. . . . When I went back this summer, I said (to Gabriel),  'Yeah, I'll see you in the backfield.' "  </P> <P> Sagapolutele said the only problem is that Gabriel relays his comments to the  Hawaii offensive line.  </P> <P> Still, during the summer, Sagapolutele and several of the Rainbow Warriors get  together.  </P> <P> "I go out with them to dances, and watch movies or for a few beers,"  Sagapolutele said. "It's different when we're on the field, though. They act  like they're not my friends, and I act like I don't know them."  </P> <P> It should be an interesting weekend for the folks from Hawaii.  </P> <P> First, the football team. The Rainbow Warriors will fly to Los Angeles today  and work out at a high school there. They will take the train to San Diego  Friday and practice that afternoon at the stadium.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Hawaii Alumni Association is promoting "UH Alumni Weekend II",  with festivities ranging from a pre-game tailgate party in the stadium parking  lot to a post-game party at a hotel. The SDSU ticket department estimated that  there will be about 2,000 Hawaii fans in attendance.  </P> <P> Despite the Aztecs' rousing success against Utah Saturday, Coach Al Luginbill  does not want two weeks off again anytime soon. "If we could, I'd rather play a  full schedule without a break . . . 11 straight weeks, and then take a break  before playing a bowl game," Luginbill said. "It's difficult. I'd just as soon  not do it. It's a grind." . . . Scouts from nearly 10 NFL teams have requested  passes for Saturday's game, including representatives from Cleveland, Detroit,  New York Jets, New York Giants, Seattle and the Los Angeles Rams. Former Ram  running back Lawrence McCutcheon is the Ram scout. SCOTT MILLER  </P></p>

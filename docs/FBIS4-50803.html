Representatives of eight youth  volunteer service teams took the "Chinese Youth Volunteers"  banners from Qiao Shi, member of the Standing Committee of the  Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of  Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Ding  Guangen, member of the Political Bureau and Secretariat of the  CPC Central Committee.    Speaking at the ceremony, Qiao Shi said that he is confident  the youth will, by their own concrete actions, promote the  volunteers' spirit of unity, fraternity, helping others, moral  courage, and selfless dedication and foster patriotic,  collective, and socialist ideas and ethics.    He said it is hoped that the party and society as a whole  will support the work of organizations of the Communist Youth  League [CYL] at all levels and the activities of the youth  volunteers. Meanwhile, he said it is hoped that more young  people will join the ranks of the volunteers.

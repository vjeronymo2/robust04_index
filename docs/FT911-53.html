			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Observer: Idle Hans Let us not be beastly to the Germans, but are they really the dedicated, horny-handed toilers they are made out to be? According to the German Economic Institute, they seem increasingly ready to bunk off work and head for the nearest beer hall. The institute reckons those employed in industry should be clocking up an average of just over 1,650 hours a year. But they are typically falling 145 hours short - for the most part, strange though it may seem, on Mondays and Fridays. By comparison the British, no longer the sick men and women of Europe, are expected to put in more than 1,750 hours - and record a 'no show' for only 119 of same. Both, however, look lazy alongside the Japanese who on average should be in the factory for more than 2,200 hours each year, and bow out for a mere 36 hours. The dedication of the Japanese could be something to do with the widespread belief that while you can be sick, it must be in your own time and at your own expense. The absence of the Germans, it appears, could be put down to the generous compensation available and to competition among doctors to hang on to patients by never knowingly refusing a sick note.</p>

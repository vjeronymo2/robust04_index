The merger was announced  at a joint news conference in the capital Harare. Mr. Muzorewa,  aged 67, a retired clergyman of the U.S.-based United Methodist  Church and leader of the now small opposition party United  National African Council, and Mr. Tekere, leader of the Zimbabwe  Unity Movement, ZUM, became co-president of the new party which  has retained the name ZUM.    The retired bishop has made a comeback after retiring from  politics in 1985 following 10 months of detention by Mr.  Mugabe's government for alleged subversive activities. He was  in the limelight in 1970's, when the other black nationalists  like Mr. Mugabe and Vice President Dr. Joshua Nkomo were either  exiled or detained by the former Rhodesian rebel leader, Mr. Ian  Smith.    Mr. Muzorewa headed the transitional government to a black  majority rule set up by Mr. Smith, but lost to Mr. Mugabe in the  1980 elections because of his alignment to whites.</p>

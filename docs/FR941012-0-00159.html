			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``Congress understood that the Act would create substantial costs for employers, yet intended to impose such costs when necessary to create a safe and healthful working environment. Congress viewed the costs of health and safety as a cost of doing business. *&blank;*&blank;* Indeed, Congress thought that the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> financial costs  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> of health and safety problems in the workplace were as large as or larger than the financial costs of eliminating these problems [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> American Textile Mfrs.

(1970), reprinted in Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, Legislative History of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, (Committee Print 1971) (``Leg. Hist.'') at 444 (Senator Yarborough)].'' ``Of course, it will cost a little more per item to produce a washing machine. Those of us who use washing machines will pay for the increased cost, but it is worth it, to stop the terrible death and injury rate in this country [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> at 324; see also 510&hyph;511, 517].'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [T]he vitality of the Nation's economy will be enhanced by the greater productivity realized through saved lives and useful years of labor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When one man is injured or disabled by an industrial accident or disease, it is he and his family who suffer the most immediate and personal loss. However, that tragic loss also affects each of us. As a result of occupational accidents and disease, over $1.5 billion in wages is lost each year [1970 dollars], and the annual loss to the gross national product is estimated to be over $8 billion. Vast resources that could be available for productive use are siphoned off to pay workmen's compensation and medical expenses. *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only through a comprehensive approach can we hope to effect a significant reduction in these job death and casualty figures.

Moreover, ``many employers_particularly smaller ones_simply cannot make the necessary investment in health and safety, and survive competitively, unless all are compelled to do so [Leg. Hist. at 144, 854, 1188, 1201].''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, the statutory text and legislative history make clear that Congress conclusively determined that OSHA regulation is necessary to protect workers from occupational hazards and that employers should be required to reduce or eliminate significant workplace health and safety threats.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. As Construed by the Courts and by OSHA, the OSH Act Sets a Threshold and a Ceiling for Safety Rulemaking That Provide Clear and Reasonable Parameters for Agency Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA has long followed the teaching that section 3(8) of the OSH Act requires that, before it promulgates `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> any <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  permanent health or safety standard, [it must] make a threshold finding that a place of employment is unsafe_in the sense that significant risks are present and can be eliminated or lessened by a change in practices [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Industrial Union Dep't, AFL&hyph;CIO  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> American Petroleum Inst.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 448 U.S. 607, 642 (1980) (plurality) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Benzene <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ); emphasis was supplied in original].'' When, as frequently happens in safety rulemaking, OSHA promulgates standards that differ from existing national consensus standards, it must explain ``why the rule as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(8)].'' Thus, national consensus and existing federal standards that Congress instructed OSHA to adopt summarily within two years of the OSH Act's inception provide reference points concerning the least an OSHA standard should achieve (29 U.S.C. 655(a)). As a result, OSHA is precluded from regulating insignificant safety risks or from issuing safety standards that do not at least lessen risk in a significant way.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OSH Act also limits OSHA's discretion to issue overly burdensome rules, as the agency also has long recognized that ``any standard that was not economically or technologically feasible would  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a fortiori  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> not be `reasonably necessary or appropriate' under the Act.

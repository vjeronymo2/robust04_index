			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CLOVIS;  </P> <P> MAN, 2 DAUGHTERS KILLED IN HOUSE FIRE  </P> <P> Two young girls and their father died in a house fire in the Fresno County  community of Clovis. The blaze may have been hidden from passers-by by a dense  San Joaquin Valley fog, authorities said. A motorist who spotted the flames  called firefighters on a car phone, but the fog prevented the driver from  pinpointing his location, a Clovis fire official said. The Fresno County  coroner's office identified the victims as Avery Hensley III, 28, and his  daughters Rebecca, 6, and Stephanie, 8.  </P></p>

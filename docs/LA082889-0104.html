			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHINESE STUDENT SENTENCED TO 9 YEARS FOR PROTEST ROLE  </P> <P> A student charged with spreading rumors to the Voice of America during spring  pro-democracy protests has been given a nine-year prison term, a state  newspaper reported today. It was the first announced sentencing of a student  participant since the government's June crackdown.  </P> <P> The China Youth News said Zhang Weiping, 25, was sentenced Saturday by the  Hangzhou Intermediate People's Court for spreading counterrevolutionary  propaganda and instigating criminal acts.  </P> <P> Zhang, a fourth-year student at Zhejiang Fine Arts Institute in the eastern  city of Hangzhou, admitted some of the charges against him but would not  acknowledge that his acts were counterrevolutionary, the daily said.  </P> <P> The court said that on June 6, two days after the bloody military crackdown of  the student movement in Beijing, Zhang called the U.S.-funded Voice of America  and falsely reported that students in Hangzhou forced local authorities to fly  the Chinese flag at half-staff to mourn victims of the Beijing massacre.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Bad Political Influence'  </P> <P> It said that Zhang sent a tape of the VOA broadcast of his report to his  university and that "it created a very bad political influence."  </P> <P> The court also accused Zhang of drawing eight cartoons vilifying Communist  Party and government leaders.  </P> <P> The newspaper did not say when Zhang was convicted, but conviction and  sentencing often happen at the same time. It also did not say under what clause  of the criminal code he was tried or what the maximum sentence was.  </P> <P> One clause covering counterrevolutionaries who incite the masses says those  found guilty of serious cases shall not serve terms of less than five years. A  counterrevolutionary can get a life term if the offense is deemed serious  enough.  </P> <P> Chinese police have arrested thousands of workers and students who took part in  the pro-democracy movement and have publicly sentenced dozens of workers to  long prison terms for rioting and causing social disturbances.  </P></p>

It had stopped these efforts for about a month after  the disappearance of former Libyan Foreign Minister Mansur  al-Kikhya.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that Egyptian Information  Minister Safwat al-Sharif's sudden visit to Tripoli and his  meeting with Libyan Leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi were part of  these efforts.    According to informed sources in Cairo, Egypt conveyed to  Libya France's willingness to start a dialogue with Libya on  means of resolving the crisis. That is what French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe had conveyed to Cairo, during his recent  visit, in response to the Egyptian proposals calling for a  direct dialogue similar to that held with Britain at the  beginning of the crisis.    The sources also revealed that, in a reply message from  Chairman al-Qadhdhafi to Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, Libya  officially confirmed that it had nothing to do with al-Kikhya's  disappearance and that it was perfectly willing to cooperate  with Egypt to find out what happened to him.

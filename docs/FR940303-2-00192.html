The primary objective of this program is, initially, to instill in a group of public administrators, with responsibility for a variety of civil administrative and management functions, a sense of civil administration as a crucial element in the emergence of a viable civil culture, and secondly, to broaden and refine their ability to fulfill their duties and to contribute to the development of a cadre of enlightened, self-conscious, and responsible public administrators in their home countries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Participants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participants for the U.S. component of this exchange will include mid-level public administrators from various sectors health, education, housing, security, and general social welfare_from Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon, whose English-language skills are sufficient to enable them to function successfully during the U.S. internship phase of the program. Participants will be nominated through coordination among USIA, U.S. Information Service personnel in the region, and overseas partner institutions. USIA and the participating USIS posts retain the right to nominate all participants and to accept or reject participants recommended by grantee institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American participants in the program, both those institutions which will host foreign public administrators in the United States and those individuals who will subsequently travel overseas as resource persons in the second component of the exchange, will be selected by the American grantee organization in consultation with the Office of Citizen Exchanges. The consultants travelling overseas should be fluent in the language of the country in which the seminar is presented or the American grantee organization should undertake to provide simultaneous interpretation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </ADDRESS> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Observer: Singular rival Wheeling in from the past comes former British Leyland whizz-kid Ian McKinnon, now running Alcan Specialities' aerospace division in Birmingham. He doesn't aim to stay there much longer, judging by his wish to pay what must be at least Pounds 200m for Leyland Daf's truck business just when a management buy-out was apparently going ahead. Numerous members of the rival team of course used to work for McKinnon. While he says he'd like them to do so again, they were lukewarm about same yesterday after already agreeing outline terms for the buy-out with the receivers, Arthur Andersen. Despite McKinnon's promise to equal or better his rivals' offer, the receiver may prefer a bird i' th'and - as they say in Lancashire - to two in t'bush. Aberdonian engineer McKinnon also apparently has some way to go to finalise the financing. Still, his cv doesn't look bad. After rising rapidly to run Leyland Trucks throughout the UK, he led the management buy-out of Leyland Bus once the trucks business had gone to Daf. He then sold out very profitably to Volvo in 1987 after turning round the bus operation. At only 46, he is clearly champing for the next challenge.</p>

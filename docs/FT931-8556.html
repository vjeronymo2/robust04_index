			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Although Australian wool prices have become a little dearer this week, with the Wool Corporation's market indicator reaching 470 cents a kg. yesterday compared with 457 a week earlier, there are still very heavy withdrawals by farmers to take into account. Withdrawals at reserves during the sale amounted to about 15%, but in addition 10% to 25% was withdrawn at the three selling centres prior to the start of the sale. Thus anything from 25% to 40% of the originally scheduled offering was not sold. China is listed as the main buyer.</p>

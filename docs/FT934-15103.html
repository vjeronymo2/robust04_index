			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: Ecu bonds benefit most as European sector rallies EUROPEAN bonds rallied after Germany's constitutional court gave its broad approval to the Maastricht treaty for European monetary union. Prices were also lifted by hopes for further European rate cuts after the Bundesbank switched to variable-rate repos for today's allocation, following two months of fixed-rate repos. The move was seen as paving the way for lower short-term rates in coming weeks. Ecu bonds were the main beneficiaries of the German ruling and the Ecu bond contract on Matif jumped 0.80 point to 118.94. The market had moved to a very defensive pricing in recent months amid uncertainty over the treaty's ratification, but the ruling removed the last great unknown, allowing Ecu bonds to become more fairly valued, said Mr Bob Tyley, head of bond analysis at Paribas Capital Markets. 'Ecu bonds are now very attractive, and I expect investors to come into the market who were sidelined since the ratification problems began,' he said. Mr Tyley expects the 10-year Ecu yield spread over bunds to shrink to about 40 basis points before year-end, from 56 basis points now. Elsewhere, the Bank of England announced the auction of Ecu500m of three-year Treasury notes, which will be fungible with Ecu1.5bn of notes sold earlier this year. GERMAN bonds, which had attracted safe-haven buying in the run-up to the court ruling, dipped slightly on the announcement but recovered later, aided by the US Treasury rally and technical futures trading. The December bund future hit a new high at 100.07 and closed at 100.02. up 0.22 point from Monday. The government issued DM3bn of 6 per cent bunds at 100.90, which met with solid demand, mainly from domestic investors. Another DM3bn-DM4bn is expected to be sold at today's auction. Bunds were lifted by hopes that the minimum rate on 14-day repos may ease at today's Bundesbank repo. Money market dealers forecast a minimum rate of 6.68 per cent, with a liquidity add of some DM10bn seen. UK gilts rose along with the other markets, but traders reported little cash activity. 'The market's on tenterhooks about (today's) RPI numbers,' said a gilts trader. FRENCH bonds rose in line with other markets, but gains were capped by technical resistance at 123.18 on the December notional bond future. The short end of the market firmed on hopes that the German repo rate might ease today, causing the 3-month December Pibor future to rise 0.16 point to 93.44. Italian bonds posted strong gains, with the BTP future rising 0.81 point to 117.95 and expected to test 118.00 today. THE JGB futures contract hit a six-year high and closed at 113.70, up 0.29 from Friday. Prices were fuelled by Friday's US Treasuries rally and solid cash buying, a trader said. AFTER early gains on follow-through buying of bonds from last Friday, longer-dated US Treasury prices fell back to opening levels yesterday in the wake of higher gold and commodities prices. By late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/32 at 104 19/32 , yielding 5.915 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 1/8 , to yield 3.791 per cent. After taking Monday off for the Columbus Day holiday, the bond market resumed the rally it had started last Friday following the release of a September employment report which traders and investors judged to be bullish for longer-dated Treasury securities. Although buying was sporadic, it was enough to lift 30-year prices, and send the yield on the benchmark issue below 5.9 per cent for the first time since the Treasury began issuing long bonds on a regular basis in 1977. Prices, however, could not hold on to their early gains as dwindling volume and a brief surge in gold and other commodity prices took the shine off the market's morning glow.</p>

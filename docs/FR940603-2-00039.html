The first EUP on this organism was issued April 10, 1992. The Agency has determined that this may be of national or regional significance. Therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR 172.11(a), the Agency is soliciting public comments on this application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> Dates <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> : Written comments must be received on or before July 5, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> : Comments in triplicate, must bear the docket control number OPP&hyph;50784 and be submitted to: Public Docket and Freedom of Information Section, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

An extension of the experimental use permit was granted May 18, 1993. An additional amendment was granted December 1993, for the purposes of adding two sites in Puerto Rico. The purpose of this amendment/extension is to conduct an additional 12 experiments on 120 sites in 15 states (four additional states to include Florida, Maryland, Missouri, and Virginia) and the territory of Puerto Rico. Total transgenic B.t.k. cotton plantings at all sites combined will not exceed 1,665 acres. Cotton lines for the additional sites contain the plasmid vectors PV&hyph;GHBKO3, PV&hyph;GHBKO4, and PV&hyph;GHBKO7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's scientific staff has evaluated the potential for adverse effects on nontarget species and the environment as a result of this EUP amendment. According to Monsanto, the B.t.k. delta-endotoxin is expected to occur in roots, stems, leaves, bolls and seeds of the cotton plant; the NPT II marker enzyme is expected to occur in stems and seeds. Neither protein was detected by Monsanto in the pollen, nectar or lint of the genetically-engineered cotton plants. The Agency does not foresee any human health risks or effects resulting from the proposed field tests because there will be minimal human exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several microbial pesticides containing nonengineered B.t.k. proteins have been registered over the last few years for which extensive avian, aquatic, and beneficial insect testing has failed to demonstrate any significant toxicity to these nontarget organisms. Monsanto, however, is using a truncated form of delta-endotoxin in three of its seven genetically-engineered cotton plants; it is possible that the truncated forms of B.t.k. proteins may affect a greater range of organisms than the full-length, nonengineered B.t.k. proteins present in wettable powder or oil flowable microbial pesticide formulations. This is not a concern, however, due to the limited exposure for nontarget organisms with the EUP amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the field tests will be conducted in areas of the States where no known population of endangered lepidopteran species exist, no risk is expected as a result of the additional sites. In addition, because of the low exposure due the limited acreage and duration of the EUP, EPA feels that there will not be a situation warranting a formal review under the Endangered Species Act for any endangered mammals, birds, invertebrates, plants, or aquatic species. Comments on this EUP amendment should be submitted by July 5, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Lists of Subjects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 18, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen L.

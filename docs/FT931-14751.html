			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Letter: BBC licence fee is no more than flat-rate, inequitable tax Sir, It seems to me that the proper use of licence systems is to regulate and tax minority pursuits. The BBC 'licence fee' is in reality a flat-rate tax of Pounds 80 on all householders regardless of circumstance and, as such, seems unique. Taxpayers are not asked to pay a flat-rate tax to support the armed forces or the health service, why should the BBC be different? In using the words 'rough justice', David Robertson (Letters, January 13) clearly has some feel for the basic inequity in the system, but I suspect he has no concept of what a huge (hugely unfair?) sum Pounds 80 represents to low-income people, who might be totally dependent on television as their sole source of entertainment. The system, far from offering justice in any form, seems to me to be almost immoral. The time for change is long overdue and there seem to be two very reasonable alternatives. First, direct grant from government. Apart from the fairness that would ensue, think of the savings to be made in the costs of collecting and administering the licence system. Second, advertising (although I suspect the commercial television companies would regard a new powerful competitor as 'rough' if not 'justice'). Why shouldn't the BBC be subject to normal commercial pressures and financial discipline? The usual response to such suggestions is hysteria about adverse effects on so-called programme quality. But is Coronation Street worse than Eldorado? Alan McCartney, 35a Wrottesley Road, Wolverhampton WV6 8SG</p>

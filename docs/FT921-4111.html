			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Shevardnadze to be new Georgian leader FORMER Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze is to head a new council set up to run the republic of Georgia, Reuter reports from Moscow. He was named in a decree issued by the military council that has ruled Georgia since driving out President Zviad Gamsakhurdia two months ago. Mr Shevardnadze was Georgia's Communist party chief for 13 years before President Mikhail Gorbachev brought him to Moscow as foreign minister. He returned to his native Georgia last week after seven years in Moscow. Mr Shevardnadze has said he will probably stand for a seat in the Georgian parliament later this year and has not ruled out standing for the presidency. Many Georgians regard him as the last hope of bringing peace to the country, suffering from severe economic difficulties in the aftermath of civil strife. The new state council is to have executive and legislative power. The decree named Mr Iosi Joseliani, one of the military commanders who led the rebellion against President Gamsakhurdia, as Mr Shevardnadze's deputy. Also included is Mr Tengiz Sigua, Georgia's virtual prime minister since Mr Gamsakhurdia's overthrow. Members of various minority groups, at odds with Tbilisi during Mr Gamsakhurdia's tenure, were also included. Georgia became isolated internationally under Mr Gamsakhurdia and remains outside the Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>

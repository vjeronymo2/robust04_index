			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (XINHUA) -- When interviewed by this  reporter at the Second Session of the Eighth National People's  Congress, Tian Qiyu, vice minister of public security and an NPC  deputy, said that public security organs will work hard to  create a social environment favorable for reform, opening up,  and economic construction.    Tian Qiyu said: The situation of China's public security can  be summed up in three sentences: 1) Society is generally safe  for reform, opening up, and economic construction; 2) the number  of criminal offenses, especialy major, heinous crimes, is  increasing; and 3) in certain areas, the public security is  poor, crimes are rampant, and people feel unsafe -- just as  Premier Li Peng noted in his government work report.    Tian Qiyu said: The major reform measures the state will  carry out in the financial, taxation, banking, and investment  sectors this year certainly will bring about all-around social  progress. But we must also realize that, compared with those  introduced in the last decade or so, the reform measures to be  introduced this year are both the largest in number and the most  difficult to carry out, and society certainly will feel some  pains because of their introduction. We must have sufficient  understanding of this problem.    Tian Qiyu said: Public security organs' main mission is to  make all-out efforts to maintain political and social stability.  Public security organs will continue to come down hard on  criminal offenses; give priority to "cracking major cases,  striking criminal gangs, and pursuing fugitives;" and carry out  special, priority crackdown projects in a way appropriate to the  local situations. In areas where problems of public security  are conspicuous, collective county, city, or even more  widespread campaigns will be organized to crack down on crimes.  Priority will be given to cracking down on murder, robbery,  theft, and organized crimes. In rural areas, hooliganism  jeopardizing local safety will be harshly punished according to  law. A fight against guns, narcotics, smuggling, and illegal  emigration will be launched in some provinces and municipalities.    Tian Qiyu said: This year we also underscore the need of  setting higher goals for cracking cases. We will crack more  major cases, step up prosecution of cases that have been  cracked, act more efficiently in handling cases, enforce the law  strictly, and firmly correct the problem of reducing penalties,  such as accepting fines in lieu of imprisonment.    On controlling public offenses, Tian Qiyu said: Public  security organs will give priority to controlling guns and  explosives, and to controlling the floating population and  crime-prone places. We will collectively put in order  problem-ridden stations, ferry piers, trains, and recreational  districts; increase the intensity of wiping out social viles;  and continue to promote and improve the system of assigning  policemen to patrol duty.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / People: Gareth Griffiths Gareth Griffiths, who has died at the age of 40, joined the industrial reporting side of the Financial Times in 1979 and later went on to make his mark in a wider field. After grammar school in Wales and Jesus College, Oxford, he joined Thomson's regional papers in Wales and then the Liverpool Daily Post. At the FT, he helped develop the paper's coverage of social affairs. In 1984 he decided to study law, and was called to the Bar in 1986. But a summer relief job with the public relations agency Carl Byoir persuaded him to pursue a career in PR, first with Shandwick and later for a short time with Burson-Marsteller, before successfully branching out on his own. He acted for such blue-chip names as Dalgety, Booker and the Oxford University appeal. Recently, he had decided to read for holy orders and was to have entered St Michael's College, Llandaff, next month to undertake the long road to ordination in the Church of Wales.</p>

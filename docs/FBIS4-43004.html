			<p>BFN     [Text] Duesseldorf (DPA) -- Early Sunday morning [5 June],  a bomb attack, which caused approximately 30,000 German marks in  damages, was carried out on the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]  district office in Duesseldorf. According to the police, a  letter in which a leftist autonomous group claimed  responsibility for the attack was found at the scene of the  crime. At 0233, the rather amateurish bomb exploded between two  windows in the courtyard of the office and destroyed several  windowpanes and parts of the facade of the building. No one was  injured. The 15 inhabitants of the building were temporarily  evacuated.    The house with the seat of the CDU district association had  already been scribbled on with paint before. Next Thursday,  Chancellor Helmut Kohl (CDU) wants to take the floor at a  European election event.</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Unwelcome Miras bill My husband and I bought our house in January 1988 when we were not married. The mortgage was Pounds 37,000. We married in May that year but did not tell the building society until a few months ago. The Revenue is now claiming we have been receiving too much Miras and has sent us an accumulative bill of nearly Pounds 900. The provisions of section 42 of the Finance Act 1988 were designed to discourage cohabiting mortgagors from marrying: although the 1988 act was not passed until after you had got married, the March Budget, plus comment in the FT and elsewhere, did make the then chancellor's proposed tax penalty for marriage quite clear. It is a pity both of you missed all the warnings against getting married while your joint mortgage exceeded Pounds 30,000. You say you did not tell the building society of your marriage until a few months ago but it is not clear if you also kept your respective tax offices in the dark. If you did, then your respective tax affairs will need revision for 1988-89 onwards as a whole (not just in respect of the mortgage interest) because you will have continued to be taxed as two single people instead of as a married couple. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

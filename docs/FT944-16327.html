			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Loyalist pledge may speed talks: Ministers say Ulster ceasefire could mean discussions with Sinn Fein by Christmas The government was yesterday preparing the ground for early talks with republican leaders, as the announcement of an open-ended loyalist ceasefire improved the prospect of an end to sectarian violence in Ulster for the first time in 25 years. As Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, used a speech at the Tory conference in Bournemouth to reassert the party's belief in the Union, ministers acknowledged that talks with Sinn Fein could be under way by Christmas. 'We don't want to drag our feet on this, we are not dawdling at all,' Sir Patrick said, holding out the prospect that loyalist representatives could also be brought into talks. London is considering a scaled-down response to the IRA ceasefire amid acknowledgement by senior ministers that it may never be given an unequivocal pledge that the end to violence is for good. The idea that the government should open a 'reversible' dialogue with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, will be considered by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and cabinet colleagues next week. Sir Patrick said the loyalist ceasefire made it 'that much harder for the Provisionals to come back to violence and therefore it makes it a good deal easier for us to come to a working assumption'. The ceasefire gave a big push to the peace effort being carefully orchestrated by the UK and Irish governments. Mr Major said the announcement was 'unalloyed good news'. But he warned: 'We must analyse it and consider it and then carefully decide with realism what is the way forward.' Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, was less cautious, describing the development as 'a wonderful moment'. He urged everyone to 'now work together in a spirit of goodwill, reconciliation and forbearance to consolidate a just and lasting peace - to ensure that all of the people of Ireland are rid of the gun and the bomb from Irish politics for ever'. He pressed Mr Major to take the opportunity of his conference speech today to move the process forward. 'We are into the seventh week, and it is time the whole pace of consolidating the peace process was accelerated,' he said. In Bournemouth, Sir Patrick and Mr Major received a warm welcome from conference representatives, in spite of the leadership's decision not to allow a vote on whether the government should actively persuade Ulster's people that their best future lay in the UK. Yesterday's ceasefire move was announced at a press conference by the Combined Loyalist Military Command, representing the two main outlawed protestant paramilitary groups - the Ulster Defence Association and the Ulster Volunteer Force. The loyalists promised a cessation of 'all operational hostilities' from midnight last night. 'The permanence of our ceasefire will be completely dependent upon the continued cessation of all Nationalist and Republican violence,' the statement said. It also emerged that loyalist leaders had contact with the Irish government prior to the ceasefire announcement. Milestone on the long road to a lasting settlement, Page 9</p>

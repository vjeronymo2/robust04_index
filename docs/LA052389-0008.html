			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> June is "amnesty month" for parking ticket scofflaws, who owe the city $12.9  million in unpaid citations and penalties, the San Diego City Council decided  Monday.  </P> <P> Beginning June 1, drivers with unpaid parking tickets will be allowed to pay  their fines without being assessed penalties for overdue payments. An amnesty  hot line, 533-4053, has been established to allow drivers to determine how much  they owe.  </P> <P> About $3.5 million is owed by owners of the 9,518 vehicles that have received  five or more citations in the last 18 months. Another $5.9 million is owed by  drivers who have received three or more tickets.  </P> <P> Included in those totals is the city's current record holder, David Thomas, who  owes the city $3,642 in fines and penalties for the 87 parking tickets he has  received, Police Chief Bob Burgreen said at a news conference. During amnesty  month, Thomas could pay off the citations at a cost of $1,386, Burgreen said.  </P> <P> The grace period precedes the inauguration of the Police Department's  stepped-up parking enforcement campaign.  </P> <P> Beginning July 1, police will tow and impound any vehicle with five or more  outstanding parking citations. The city's 34 parking-enforcement officers will  implement the program with the aid of hand-held computers containing  information on all outstanding parking tickets.  </P></p>

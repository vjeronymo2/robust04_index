			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT;  </P> <P> AIRPORT-AREA LAND: UP, UP AND AWAY  </P> <P> So what's it worth, being near an airport?  </P> <P> A lot, says Robert Young, president of McDonnell Douglas Realty, the  Irvine-based commercial and industrial development arm of McDonnell Douglas  Corp.  </P> <P> "When we started our projects in Orange County roughly 15 years ago, we had a  small, almost rural, airport and we were doing two-story garden office  buildings across the street from it," he recalls.  </P> <P> "Now we're putting in a pair of 24-story towers connected to the airport by a  monorail."  </P> <P> Office rents next to the airport have soared to $2.50 a square foot from 50  cents a square foot in 1975, Young said.  </P> <P> And in 1966, when McDonnell Douglas Realty first started looking at airport  area land, "values in the area were $10,000 to $15,000 an acre," Young said.  </P> <P> In 1987, the company sold a 1.9-acre site less than 100 yards from the airport  for $1.99 million, or nearly 100 times the 1966 cost.  </P> <P> "I just saw it up for sale again the other day," Young said, "so I called the  agent and asked the price."  </P> <P> The owners are asking $4.1 million.  </P> <P> "And what has happened in the past is just a fraction of what we will see in  the future. Values will be triple or quadruple what we've seen," Young  maintains.  </P> <P> "Already, we are seeing low-rise offices being torn down to make way for  high-rises. And the development impact fans out for about 20 miles."  </P></p>

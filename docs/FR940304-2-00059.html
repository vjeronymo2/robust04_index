			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement, subject to final approval, to a proposed consent order from respondents Sonic Technology Products, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and W. Lowell Robertson and Brian Phillip Jobe, individually and as officers of the corporation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement and take other appropriate action or make final the agreement's proposed order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This matter concerns the labeling and advertising of the PestChaser, a plug-in device that is designed to emit sound in ultrasonic frequencies,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> frequencies inaudible to the human ear. The Commission's complaint charges that respondents' advertising contained false and unsubstantiated representations concerning the PestChaser's alleged ability to affect rodents and fleas. Specifically, the complaint alleges that respondents falsely claimed that the PestChaser: (1) Eliminates rodent infestations; and (2) eliminates or reduces flea infestations, or repels fleas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The complaint further alleges that respondents falsely represented that competent and reliable scientific tests have established that the above efficacy claims are true. The complaint also alleges that respondents lacked substantive for the claim that the PestChaser, when used in conjunction with other pest control methods, such as traps and poisons, will increase the effectiveness of the user's efforts to eliminate or reduce infestations of rodents or other pests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent respondents from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part I of the proposed order prohibits respondents from claiming that their ultrasonic pest control devices can or will: (1) Eliminate infestations of rodents; (2) eliminate or reduce infestations of fleas; or (3) repel fleas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part II of the proposed order prohibits respondents from misrepresenting the existence, validity, results, conclusions, interpretations or purpose of any test, study or other scientific data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part III of the proposed order requires respondents to possess competent and reliable scientific evidence for: (1) any claim that any ultrasonic pest control device will increase or assist the effectiveness of a user's efforts to eliminate or reduce infestations of rodents or other pests when the device is used in conjunction with other pest control methods; or (2) any representation referring or relating to the performance or efficacy of any ultrasonic pest control device. Part III further provides that, notwithstanding this requirement, respondents may truthfully represent, by use of the words ``Registered in Canada,'' that the Canadian Department of Agriculture has registered their ultrasonic pest control device, and permitted the sale of such device in Canada. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed order also requires respondents to maintain materials relied upon to substantiate claims covered by the order, to notify the Commission of any changes in corporate structure that might affect compliance with the order, and to notify the Commission of certain changes in the business or employment of the named individual respondents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed order also requires respondents to distribute copies of the order to any catalog company with whom respondents have done business since January 1, 1992, to present and future resellers of their ultrasonic pest control devices, and to their managerial employees and salespeople. Respondents must also file one or more reports detailing compliance with the order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donald S.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lei Xiping (7191 3588 1627), Director of the </F> Price Bureau, Autonomous Region: "Viewing Use of Price  Mechanism From Angle of Grain Purchasing"]    [Text] The price mechanism is the most important market  mechanism, or, to put it another way, it is the core mechanism;  it may be compared to an "invisible hand" possessing magic  power. Then, in the socialist market economy, how is the price  mechanism to be correctly used? At Quanzhou County, Lingui  County, Zhongshan County, Guijiang City, and Binyang County, we  began to understand all sorts of questions concerning grain  prices, and this understanding was very rewarding.    1. A contract without an agreement on specific prices  is very difficult to implement.    In our survey we found that the Grain Bureau of Quanzhou  County this year signed a contract with the grain department of  a certain province for the purchase of 25 million kg of wheat,  but in the contract no specific price was agreed upon.  Afterward, the supply side, seeing that the source of goods was  tight, set a price of 900 yuan per ton. The demand side  maintained that in this locality wheat was sold at 840 yuan  perton, but, considering that the quality of this province's  wheat was fairly good, it made a counteroffer of 860 yuan, which  the other side firmly rejected. As a result, the deal fell  through. It is said that the grain economic contracts signed by  our autonomous region's grain department with peasants, and the  grain economic contracts signed by producing areas with  marketing areas, also do not have specific prices agreed upon.  Contracts are important to a market economy, but prices are of  interest, and without a contract on the price it is naturally  difficult to honor the agreement.    2. Fulfillment of contract obligations mainly depends  on price.    On what does the purchasing side depend to fulfill its  obligations under a contract without an agreed specific price?  Ideological education, organizational measures, and  administrative methods are necessary and have an effect. As for  legal measures such as notarization and the contract, will, of  course, possess an extremely great binding force, but if the  contract does not have a specific agreed price, the two sides  will only agree on a time to consult on setting the price, and  once the consultations fail, there is no breaking of the  notarized contract! One year ramie was in great demand and its  price in outside provinces was high. To prevent an outflow and  ensure their own needs by forcing purchases at a low price, some  places did not hesitate to sent administrative law enforcers to  block an outflow, but they could only block the main roads and  could not block the mountain roads, could only block in the  daytime and could not block in the nighttime, and could only  block motor vehicles and could not block portable shoulder-borne  transport. In the purchasing of ginkgo, the situation was  similar. Commodities go toward places where prices are high,  just as water flows toward low-lying places. It is thus obvious  that the fulfillment of the obligations of an economic contract  mainly depend on economic measures, first of all, in economic  measures there is a dependence on price.    3. Commodities on which prices have been released  should be bought and sold in line with the market prices.    After commodities on which prices have been released are put  on the market, they should be dependent on market prices. In the  five counties (city) I went to, the purchasing prices of the  grain departments (including the ex-value add-on price) in  general was two to three yuan lower than the market prices and  one to two yuan lower than the individual householder prices;  some were even lower. Normally, the ex-value add-on price on the  negotiated purchasing price should be in line with the market  price. The ex-value add-on price is the price stipulated by the  state when a purchasing contract places an order for grain or  gives the peasant an award, and chemical fertilizer and diesel  oil is charged to the difference between parity and the market  price in the form of currency paid to the peasant at the time of  the signing of the grain-purchasing economic contract. Our  autonomous region stipulates that for every 50 kg of an economic  contract the ex-value add-on price is 3.54 yuan, and it is given  gratis by the central and local financial administrations and  passes into the hands of the peasant through the purchase of  grain. If it is lower than the market purchasing price,  resistance to it will be difficult to avoid.    4. Form regular market prices through fair  competition.    In line with market price exchange, regular market prices  should be formed under conditions of fair competition, but  currently there are distortions in the market prices. On the one  hand, some individual grain operators, when selling purchased  millet that had been processing into husked rice, give short  weight, adulterate (i.e., mix late rice with early rice), or  increase the water content. Therefore, if the state-owned grain  departments purchases 35 kg of millet, the individual household  pays out 36.5 yuan; when the grain department sits back and  receives the grain, the individual household itself pays the  transport fee to deliver the grain to the door. This unfair  competition artificially raises the market's purchasing price.  On the other hand, some localities have taken economic and  administrative measures to limit the amount of grain coming in  from other provinces and regions in order to control demand and  stop prices from rising in conformity with economic law. This is  also a form of unfair competition, and it artificially holds  down the market's purchasing price. Therefore, we must  strengthen the quality control of society's grain trade and curb  improper competition, and we must also break through regional  separation and protect proper competition in order to form  regular market prices for grain.    5. What the producer wants is a price that actually can  be taken in hand.    Even if the price is in line with the market, if there are  various deductions will the price be all right? Certain  counties and townships have stipulated that when a peasant has  an economic contract to sell grain to the state, 11 deductions  must first be made from the money paid for the grain purchase:  water fee, education add-on fee, health emergency fee, paddy  field fee, public security fee, disease prevention fee, militia  training fee, military martyrs and dependents fee, "five  guarantees" living fee, "five guarantees" sympathy and  solicitude fee, and aid to disabled fee. After the deductions  are made on the money paid for the grain sold by households that  sell fairly much grain, there is not much left; after the  deductions are made for households that sell little grain, there  is even nothing left or not enough left to cover the deductions.  This price is just an "empty price": it can be seen but not  obtained. To avoid this "chop," some peasants prefer to sell  their grain to individual households.    6. Price rigidity.    Except for the natural fall back in price because of market  changes, there is a rigidity to the profit on the price obtained  by peasants from the sell of grain to the state. The  abovementioned ex-value add-on price is based on calculating the  difference in the first half of this year between the parity and  the market price of chemical fertilizer and diesel oil, and the  time for using the fertilizer is between March and April next  year; if the price rises, it will be impossible to use this  year's price difference to buy back an equivalent quantity of  material objects, and the peasants owrrly that they will lose  their profit. When the Grain Department of Miaoling township  understood this situation, some peasants when delivering grain  had strongly reacted to it. They demanded that when one party  devlivers grain the other party should give it money and a  chemical fertilizer voucher, writing clearly on the voucher the  variety, quantity, price, and purchase at the beginning of  spring, all of which must be accurate.    7. A price that protects capital while obtaining profit  is demanded by the law of value.    Protection of capital while obtaining a profit, i.e., a  reasonable cost plus a suitable profit, is the monetary  manifestation of value. In 1992 in our autonomous region, the  average cost of production with tax of every 50 kg of early  long-grain rice was 21.64 yuan, but this did not include all  sorts of inappropriate expenditures by the peasants that were  discovered in the survey, so it was an incomplete cost; even  less was it the production cost for rice grown on low-grade land  (unlike the value of industrial products, the value of  agricultural products is decided by the average necessary time  in society to produce on low-grade land). In our autonomous  region this year, the protected price per 50 kg of early  long-grain rice was 24 yuan, obviously on the low side.  Actually, it is also difficult to say that the purchasing price  protected capital while obtaining a profit. The producer demands  that his capital be protected while obtaining a profit, and the  operator, when selling his grain, should also protect his  capital while obtaining a profit. If all sorts of limits are put  on the operator's selling price, there cannot be a situation in  which "the boat goes up when the river rises" -- particular  things improve with the improvement of the general situation --  and in this case purchasing will certainly be adversely affected.    8. Set up a price-regulating fund.    We must both follow the trade that is put on the market and  protect capital while obtaining profit, but if there is a steep  fall in the market price, one could get no profit and even lose  one's capital, because cheap cereal crops hurt agriculture; if  there is a sharp rise in the market price, the operator gets  staggering profits, not just appropriate profits, and the people  cannot bear the high price. This gives rise to the following  questions: when there is a steep fall in the market price, how  are the peasants to be compensated so that they protect their  capital and obtain a profit? When the market price soars, how  is it to be kept within a range in which the operator gets an  appropriate profit and the people can bear it. Besides the  necessary administrative measures, what is important is to set  up and make use of a price-regulating fund.</p>

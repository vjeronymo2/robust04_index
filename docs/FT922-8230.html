			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: New chief takes relaxed hold MR KEN Schofield, the newly-appointed chief executive at MTM, looked surprisingly relaxed yesterday afternoon after unveiling the chemical group's dire and long-awaited results. One reason for his relaxed state is the knowledge that he can start with a clean sheet and with no responsibility for the present predicament. That is no bad thing. MTM's stock market problems began in March with a profits warning only days before it was due to announce its results. The auditors, Binder Hamlyn, had problems with the application of some of the accounting standards. Analysts and the City were reassured, however, that there would be no impact on trading. Five days later , MTM was forced to make a second profits warning, this time suggesting that pre-tax profits would be 'significantly' lower than the City's expectation of Pounds 23m. What lay behind the fall appears to have been an inability of Mr Richard Lines, the founder chairman, to accept that the company he had successfully built had a trading problem and would not meet what he had promised shareholders at last year's rights issue. He had promised profits of Pounds 23m on turnover of Pounds 125m - a result that would have confirmed the wisdom of launching a Pounds 49m rights issue for the Pounds 62.5m acquisition of Hardwicke in the US. The shortfall in profits and turnover was a shock to managers, says Mr Schofield. Management information systems fell apart after August. After that date, the line managers never saw the management accounts. They and non-executive directors were not in a position to question the trading position. 'It's difficult when there is a strong, persuasive CEO who is seen to be successful,' explained Mr Schofield yesterday. 'How do you sign off from success?' Mr Schofield is also relaxed because he believes that he has sold to the banks the bones of his strategy to save the company. When he has fleshed his ideas out, he expects the banks to extend the credit lines until next January. He insists that the business is essentially sound and there are no rotten apples in the barrel. The main priority will be to reduce indebtedness, from about Pounds 106m at present to some Pounds 50m. Some businesses will be sold, admits Mr Schofield. However, he insists that the company is not bleeding money and there is no need for fire-sales. The company is anxious to obtain good prices for disposals, which cannot be achieved quickly. It was on the speed and scale of disposals that he disagreed with the Postern, the corporate management specialists called in to form a strategy for the group. He says they wanted to sell the group's crown jewels. Mr Schofield's plan also consists of focusing MTM on three core areas - research, fine chemicals and speciality chemicals. Mr Schofield expects the research side of the business to be a stand-alone operation by the end of the year and cash-neutral for the next 18 months. He also plans to build up larger inventories, so the business can be more responsive to customer needs. The fine chemicals business, particularly in the US, is also sound, says Mr Schofield. Although some of the businesses were running at only 50 per cent capacity earlier this year, he is confident that they will reach 85 per cent soon. The speciality chemicals business are highly cash-generative, he says. They require little capital investment, but expertise from qualified staff. He maintains that there has been no outflow of staff since the onset of the group's difficulties. However, he believes there had been a severe lowering of morale, which he expects to deal with by visiting the sites. 'Over 10 working days I've been with the company, I've been dealing almost exclusively with the outside world. I now need to visit some plants.'</p>

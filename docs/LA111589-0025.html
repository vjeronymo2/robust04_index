			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MOTORCYCLIST CHARGED WITH KILLING JOGGER WAS UNLICENSED TO USE VEHICLE  </P> <P> A Bonita motorcyclist charged with killing a woman jogger by running over her  was not licensed to operate a motorcycle, a state Department of Motor Vehicles  employee said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Jerald Covey, 29, was charged with vehicular manslaughter in the Nov. 5 death  of Stephanie Rossi, 29, a Bonita nurse who police say was hit head-on while  jogging on Sweetwater Road. California Highway Patrol spokesman Lance Mino said  Rossi died at the scene.  </P> <P> Covey, who is scheduled to appear in South Bay Municipal Court on Nov. 21, was  arrested at the scene, Mino said. The suspect is free on his own recognizance.  </P> <P> A DMV records clerk said Tuesday that Covey "has a clean record," but is not  licensed to operate a motorcycle. The only California license issued to Covey  was for non-commercial motor vehicles, she said.  </P> <P> Although the CHP is still investigating the accident, Covey's arrest and  subsequent release stirred considerable argument and some finger-pointing  between the CHP and the district attorney's office.  </P> <P> Investigators put the time of the accident at 4:45 p.m. According to Steve  Casey, spokesman for Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller, Covey was taken to Scripps  Hospital in Chula Vista by paramedics and arrived at about 5:20 p.m. Covey was  not accompanied by a CHP officer, Casey said, and walked away from the  hospital.  </P> <P> He was discovered missing at about 5:55 p.m. and was not arrested again until  about 9 p.m., when he returned home. Prosecutors were disturbed by Covey's  departure from the hospital, Casey said.  </P> <P> "It is my understanding that, once an individual is placed under arrest, that  individual is not shipped off to some other destination but remains in the  custody of law enforcement at all times, even in a hospital," Casey said.  </P> <P> Mino declined to respond to Casey's comment, saying that a final report on the  incident will not be available until later this week.  </P> <P> CHP officials also revealed that Covey was not given a blood-alcohol test until  "two or three hours" after the accident. At the time of his arrest, Covey was  charged with murder, felony hit-and-run, felony drunk driving and resisting  arrest. But the murder charge was later reduced to vehicular manslaughter and  the other charges were dropped, Mino said.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Mino said investigators are still awaiting the results of Covey's  blood-alcohol test, but argued that the delay in administering the test will  not hamper the CHP's efforts to pursue a drunk-driving charge against Covey.  </P> <P> "All indications show alcohol in his system," he said, without elaborating.  </P> <P> Sharp differences also arose between prosecutors and CHP officials when a CHP  spokesman charged that the district attorney's office downplayed Rossi's death  and failed to arraign Covey within 48 hours, as required by law.  </P> <P> "We're not interested in engaging in second-guessing, but the fact is that the  CHP accident report was incomplete," Casey said. "The (prosecutor) who reviewed  the report determined there wasn't enough information there to pursue a  prosecution."  </P> <P> Casey added that it was CHP officials who later reduced the murder charge to  vehicular manslaughter.  </P> <P> Mino attempted to smooth over the differences between the two law enforcement  agencies.  </P> <P> "We've got somebody working on it full time, completing the questions that the  district attorney has directed to us. We will have all that information  available when the final report is in. . . . We're making sure that everything  is complete," said Mino.  </P> <P> Rossi's husband, Tom Rossi, has also criticized the CHP investigation, Mino  acknowledged.  </P> <P> "We have contacted the family and assured them that we're doing everything  possible to complete the investigation," said Mino.  </P> <P> Tom Rossi could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

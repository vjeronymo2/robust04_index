			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (9): Committed to relaxing the rules of the game - Foreign Exchange THE introduction of new foreign-exchange regulations on October 1 will represent one of first steps taken by the new administration of President Kim Young-sam towards financial liberalisation. The deregulation measures are seen as a clear indication that the government is committed to introducing a free-floating foreign exchange rate system in 1997 by preparing the establishment of a sophisticated foreign exchange market. The recent easing of the strict rules on foreign exchange transactions is also closely connected to the opening up of capital markets to foreigners. The entry of foreign investors into the Korean stock market last year, for example, has increased the volume of foreign exchange trades as the inflow of capital from abroad grows. Domestic companies and banks welcome the relaxation of the rules. Companies have complained of difficulty in hedging against foreign exchange losses because of close government supervision of foreign exchange deals. Korean banks - seeking new sources of revenue in an increasingly competitive financial sector - see the prospect of growing earnings from hedging and speculation in the foreign exchange market. The government has heavily policed the foreign exchange market because it feared that currency speculation would cause volatility in the exchange rate and disrupt the country's export-dependent economy. Under the guidelines, companies will no longer be required to submit original supporting trade documents to banks for most forward foreign exchange transactions in order to prove they are hedging currency risks rather than speculating. Documentation will be exempt for all forward contracts between currencies other than the Korean won and be limited to deals of above Dollars 3m involving the won and other foreign currencies. Companies will also be allowed to settle trade transactions of Dollars 100,000 or less in won-denominated letter of credits instead of foreign currency. The abolition of documentation for most forward foreign-exchange contracts, the most common form of currency hedging, removes an obstacle that hindered corporate access to the foreign-exchange market and hampered their defence against currency losses. The central bank estimated that Korean companies suffered Won350bn in foreign-exchange losses last year. Losses are expected to more than double this year primarily due to the Korean won's 20 per cent fall against the Japanese yen. 'These measures will not bring about drastic changes to the foreign exchange market in the short-term,' says Kim Young-min of the Lucky-Goldstar Economic Research Institute. One reason is that the government retains effective control over the won's value against other currencies. Although the government has widened the daily interbank foreign exchange rate trading ban to 1 per cent from 0.8 per cent, Mr Kim says: 'We know from past experience that an expansion of the allowed range of fluctuation does not immediately cause a proportionate expansion of the actual range of daily fluctuations.' This is because the government dominates the foreign exchange market through the central bank. Nonetheless, the foreign exchange market in Korea has grown sharply in the past few years, although it remains small compared to those existing in the advanced industrialised countries. The average daily trading volume of foreign-exchange transactions has increased from Dollars 230m in 1990 to Dollars 1.2bn this year, with spot transactions accounting for Dollars 550m and forward transactions for Dollars 470m. Analysts believe that the foreign exchange market will grow significantly once the government implements additional financial liberalisation measures. Demand on the foreign exchange market will increase as the government raises the foreign ownership ceiling on domestic stocks and opens the bond market to foreigners by 1995 and the deregulation of overseas direct investments by Korean companies will bolster demand. The government has also announced that the exchange rate trading ban will be widened, forward contract documentation requirements will be further relaxed and the ceiling on the won-denominated settlement of trade transactions will be raised within two years. This should prepare the way for internationalisation of the Korean won and its widespread use in the settlement of visible and invisible trade deals after 1997. Although the government has emphasised that the principle of real demand should guide the foreign exchange market, it is considered inevitable that speculation and the increased flow of capital into the country will exert a stronger influence on the exchange rate. This will increase uncertainties and risks in the foreign exchange market, although it will give Korean companies greater autonomy in managing their forex portfolios. The government's willingness to accept greater fluctuations in the exchange rate will be a test of its determination to internationalise its capital markets and open up the economy to global influences.</p>

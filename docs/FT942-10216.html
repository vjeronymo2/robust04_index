			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shift in rate views takes Footsie sharply higher - Market Report London followed other European markets yesterday in turning strongly positive on the chances that the Bundesbank may cut German rates again while the US Federal Reserve is preoccupied with its Dollars 29bn refunding programme. With US bonds firmer and the Bundesbank due to meet this morning after trimming repo rates yesterday, British government bonds and stock index futures led UK equities to a 38-point Footsie gain on the session. A modest check to the advance came in late trading when uncertainties over the domestic political scene resurfaced. Share prices opened easier but were driven forward when the stock index futures market opened with a burst of strength. 'It is quite clear that the institutions are heavy supporters at the Footsie 3,100 mark,' commented one trader. The FT-SE 100 Index moved from 3,097.4 to 3,102.2 as soon as the June Footsie contract opened for trading. Equities then moved ahead steadily, taking their lead from UK bonds and derivatives and from the cut in German repo rates. At best the FT-SE 100 was 40.9 ahead. London received a further boost when Wall Street opened with a 20-point gain on the Dow and US Federal bonds moved higher. The final reading put the FT-SE 100 at 3,136.3 for a net advance of 38.5. Once again, the action in the stock index future put the focus on the Footsie stocks, and the second line issues played a more subdued role. At 3,753.3, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index finished 11.2 ahead. Stock Exchange statistics confirmed that selling pressure had been very light on Monday when the market came under pressure from bond prices. Monday's Seaq volume was only 480.6m shares and was worth a mere Pounds 912.9m at retail level, the lowest genuine daily investment total this year. Yesterday, Seaq turnover jumped to 728.9m shares and traders were confident that retail value, which will be known today, will show a similar increase. Analysts suggested that London, like other European markets, had shown clear signs yesterday that it was decoupling from US Federal bonds. But some pointed out that global markets are under special pressures this week. With many European markets closed tomorrow for a religious holiday and the Federal Reserve pinned down for two days by its refunding programme, today's Bundesbank policy meeting has a clear market horizon. Markets are hopeful for a 25 to 50 basis-point cut in the German discount rate. However, Thursday and Friday will bring a heavy flow of economic data in the US and this could renew pressure on the Fed to raise rates. Traders stressed that technical factors played a significant role yesterday. The very thin trading volumes recorded on Monday, when the market appeared to be below the bottom of its trading range, indicated that marketmakers had been unable to attract much business at these levels. Since marketmaking firms cannot prosper by avoiding business, they were ready to mark prices higher yesterday as soon as the clouds lifted. Any move today by the Bundesbank will have a positive effect on markets, but the more significant investment decisions may be held back until the end of the week when the Federal Reserve scans the statistics on US producer and retail prices, the consumer price index and jobless claims.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Half of exporters 'fail to gain from single market' Thousands of British exporters have failed to reap any benefit from the European single market says KPMG, the accountancy firm. A survey of 6,400 companies found that almost 50 per cent of respondents felt they had not received any benefits from completion of the single market on January 1 last year. Any benefits that companies might have received had been wiped out by increased bureaucracy, the firm reported yesterday. Mr George Michie, a partner with KPMG Tax Advisers, said: 'The aim of the single market was to foster more efficient trade through the abolition of fiscal and physical barriers. 'These benefits seem not to have yielded any marked improvement for companies and indeed savings in time and money were reported as negligible.' The survey found that deliveries were neither faster nor cheaper. More than 50 per cent of companies said cross-border delivery times had not improved. Only 19 per cent had experienced quicker deliveries, and of those, 56 per cent said no savings had been made. Companies had also experienced problems with red tape in dealing with other member states. In particular there were difficulties in obtaining numbers for value added tax and in coping with paperwork. The survey found that manufacturers and wholesalers bought more goods from Germany and France than from any other member country. Retailers reported that they dealt mostly with Italy, France and Spain. Mr Michie said UK Customs and Excise had done its best to educate and advise businesses on how to cope with the single market regulations, but it was clear that the rules were still too complicated.</p>

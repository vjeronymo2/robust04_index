Belov, Department of Meteorology and </F> Climatology, Moscow State University; UDC 551.510.42]    [Abstract] This article evaluates the concentration of  various harmful substances in the air using a trajectory model  based on a theoretical model of impurities transfer.  Concentrations of impurities were calculated at various  distances from Norilsk. Relief, vegetation, snow cover, the  season, and meteorological conditions were considered. Tables  present concentrations of various harmful substances in Norilsk  in adverse meteorological conditions during summer and winter  and the maximum one-time and average daily maximum permissible  concentrations of these substances and corresponding warning  levels.

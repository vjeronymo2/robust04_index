			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: SNC seeks to become full Tokyo member Smith New Court, the UK-based securities company, said it is seeking to become a full member of the Tokyo stock exchange when a seat becomes available. The Japanese Ministry of Finance has indicated it is unwilling to increase the number of seats from the current 124 and SNC will be unable to fulfil its ambition unless an existing member decides to sell a seat. Currently, 24 of the Tokyo stock exchange's seats are owned by non-Japanese firms, including five held by UK firms. Once purchase of a seat has been agreed, it would take six to 12 months before SNC could begin to take full advantage of its stock exchange membership. There has been growing pressure for deregulation of the securities industry in Japan, a move which could increase non-domestic participation in the markets there. SNC has operated a representative office in Tokyo since 1987 and has recently expanded its Asian securities operations. It has seats on the Hong Kong, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur stock exchanges and has applied to operate a representative office in Shenzhen.</p>

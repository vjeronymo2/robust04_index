			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS HAVE NO ROOM LEFT FOR OFF NIGHTS  </P> <P> The Sockers left overcast skies in Dallas and were greeted by the same in San  Diego Wednesday morning.  </P> <P> Perfect. It fit the mood, which wasn't necessarily down in the dumps or even  solemn. Just businesslike.  </P> <P> Sure, there were a few smiles. While waiting to get off the plane, some players  enjoyed looking at an incriminating newspaper picture of defender George  Fernandez grabbing Sidekick forward Tatu during the Sockers' 4-1 loss Tuesday  night. Front-page stuff, full color.  </P> <P> But in general, this was a serious group.  </P> <P> Midfielder Brian Quinn was asked what else can be said about this best-of-seven  series, which the Sidekicks lead, 3-2, and could wrap up tonight at 7:35 in the  San Diego Sports Arena. Quinn's response was concise.  </P> <P> "Just do it," he said.  </P> <P> The Sockers haven't done it the past two games. After a spirit-lifting,  come-from-behind, 5-4 victory Friday night, the Sockers find themselves in need  of two victories at home after losing Saturday and Tuesday. All this just for  the opportunity to defend last season's Major Indoor Soccer League title in the  championship series.  </P> <P> The big question is whether this wounded bunch can upset the odds as their  predecessors have. Twice in club history, the Sockers have pulled themselves  out of 3-1 deficits to win either a semifinal or a championship playoff series.  </P> <P> Last season, facing elimination by Kansas City in the Western Division final,  the Sockers won three consecutive games, advanced to the championship series  and ripped Cleveland four in a row. The latter was without the services of  Branko Segota.  </P> <P> In this series, Segota is playing, though he doesn't have his usual zest.  Injuries to his big toe and hamstring are still bothering him. He hit several  scorching shots Tuesday night but was unable to beat defenders one-on-one.  </P> <P> Quinn, bothered by a right hip strain, was limping slightly as he left the  airport Wednesday. Usually an effective passer and even a scoring threat,  Quinn, by his own admission, hasn't been up to snuff in the playoffs.  </P> <P> And defender Kevin Crow might be tiring. His duties have included marking the  ever-active Tatu and serving as the Sockers' sixth attacker.  </P> <P> Tired legs prompted Socker Coach Ron Newman to dress an extra field player in  two of the three games in Dallas in lieu of backup goalie Otto Orf II. Newman  was caught in a bind doing this once earlier this season and had to use a  defender, Ralf Wilhelms, in goal when starter Zoltan Toth was forced to leave a  game with a head injury.  </P> <P> History favors the Sockers to come back. The immediate past -- Saturday and  Tuesday -- might not.  </P> <P> The Sockers have been one game from elimination in a playoff series in each of  their four MISL championship seasons. But in the past two games, the Sidekicks  have tied down the Sockers' offense with superior defense, specifically shot  blocking. Of 150 shots the Sockers have taken, Dallas has blocked 77. Joe  Papaleo, one of two Sidekick starting goalies, is 3-0 against the Sockers in  this series and likely will start tonight.  </P> <P> In scoring one goal Tuesday, the Sockers tied the club record for lowest score  in a playoff game. Tuesday also was the first time the Sockers have lost the  fifth game of a playoff series.  </P> <P> At this point, statistics and records mean little. The Sockers accomplished a  mission of sorts in forcing the series to return to San Diego. But after  winning the first game in Dallas, the end result was somewhat of a moral  defeat.  </P> <P> "We're really disappointed that we didn't steal another one here," Newman said  after Tuesday night's loss. "I haven't really felt good all through the  playoffs. Maybe we're not as good as we think we are."  </P> <P> Or it could be this team is just like all the others, saving the best for the  final act.  </P> <P> "Maybe," Crow said, "this team is very similar to the last couple of years,  when we don't react until our backs are against the wall."  </P></p>

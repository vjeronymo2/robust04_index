			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I'd like to thank KTTV for its nearly complete presentation of "The Pirates of  Penzance." It certainly was enjoyable, and I hardly missed that 15-20 minute  block of story (including three songs) that the station chopped out of the film  in one piece to make room for commercials! Gee, I sure hope KTTV can maintain  its high standards in coming presentations of "The Two Musketeers," "The Three  Horsemen of the Apocalypse" and, of course, that old favorite, "Ali Baba and  the 31 (and 1/2) Thieves." Way to go, guys!  </P> <P> Mark Jones, Sun Valley  </P></p>

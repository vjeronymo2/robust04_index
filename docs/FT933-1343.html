			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Next steps for Mr Yeltsin BORIS YELTSIN seems to be winning his gamble. By cutting the constitutional knot ravelling Russia, he has given himself room for manoeuvre. But to succeed, he must now exploit it. When a country's constitution prevents it from being governed, extra-constitutional action is inescapable. In such situations, power resides with those who command the loyalty of the apparatus of coercion. President Yeltsin has this far proved to be that person. So long as his opponents remain ineffective, even ridiculous, Mr Yeltsin should scrupulously avoid doing anything to turn them into martyrs. But if they were to appear capable of thwarting the elections he proposes, let alone of starting an armed insurrection, he would have to prevent them. Even the possibility of such action would make many in the west uncomfortable. But the west's interests are inescapably aligned with those of Mr Yeltsin on the need for civil order and reform. If this sombre possibility is to be avoided, the Russian president must make his authority unquestionable. Often the appearance of authority creates the reality. Mr Yeltsin must use his present advantage, therefore, if he is to retain it. The first requirement is implementation of the elections for the new lower house both expeditiously and efficiently. According to Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, brought back into his former position as first deputy prime minister, the new lower house - to be known as the State Duma - will have 270 of its 400 deputies elected from single member constituencies and a further 130 elected by party lists. This last measure will give fledgling parties a role, and offer then a lever for exerting party discipline. Meanwhile, the upper house, or Council of the Federation, will not initially be elected. It is currently composed of the leaders of the regional and republican administrations and soviets, and will be transformed into the senior legislative chamber. In current Russian circumstances, these proposals seem rather sensible. The second requirement is early promulgation of a new constitution. At the moment there are two versions on offer, the parliament's, which unsurprisingly gives power to parliament, and the president's, which gives power to the president. The latter is at present the only basis for stable democratic rule in Russia. In the absence of parties or even a broad umbrella reform movement, a parliamentary system cannot produce stable, responsible government. Moreover, those who stand for the power of parliament are hostile to democracy, while the president's party contains most of those who believe in it. But a presidential constitution would need checks and balances, including a clear division of powers, entrenched individual rights and a new supreme court. The third requirement is rapid implementation of economic stabilisation and reform. The chief justification for Mr Yeltsin's action is that parliament was destroying all hope of rescuing the Russian economy. If the government fails to act decisively now, it will destroy the case for the president's actions. Mr Yeltsin must support Mr Yegor Gaidar, back as first deputy prime minister, and Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, in their attempts to control the budget deficit, restructure prices, reform trade and liberalise the economy. As and when such action is forthcoming, the west must promptly put its long promised financial support in place. Russia's long-awaited economic and political reform must start right now. The next year could then see election of parliament and president, introduction of a workable constitution and a start on economic reconstruction. This is the task Mr Yeltsin has set himself. For the sake both of his country and the world, he must succeed. The west, for its part, must do what it can to help.</p>

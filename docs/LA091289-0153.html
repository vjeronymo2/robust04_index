			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ETHICS PANEL APPROVES FRANK PROBE;  </P> <P> ATKINS EXCUSED FROM INVESTIGATION IN SEX-FOR-HIRE CASE  </P> <P> The House Ethics Committee today approved a preliminary investigation of Rep.  Barney Frank (D-Mass.), who admitted hiring a male prostitute for sex and then  employing the man as a personal aide.  </P> <P> Committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), who announced the  investigation, would not say whether the vote was unanimous.  </P> <P> Dixon also announced that the panel approved the request of one of its members,  Rep. Chester G. Atkins (D-Mass.), to withdraw from consideration of the Frank  case.  </P> <P> Atkins said Monday that he feared a potential conflict because he and Frank  could be opponents in the 1992 election because of congressional redistricting.  Dixon said another member would be named to serve in the investigation.  </P> <P> Frank, a leading congressional liberal and acknowledged homosexual, sought the  investigation of his conduct with the male prostitute, Stephen J. Gobie.  </P> <P> The committee resolution said the panel is "aware of assertions relating to the  conduct of Rep. Barney Frank in connection with his employment of a personal  assistant." The panel "has determined that the matters merit further inquiry,"  the resolution added.  </P> <P> Today's action begins only the first round of the House's disciplinary process  and determines whether a more complete investigation is needed. During the  preliminary phase, the panel can issue subpoenas and take testimony.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Potential Expulsion  </P> <P> If the probe goes beyond the initial stage, the committee could hold a  disciplinary proceeding and recommend punishment to the full House that could  range from a reprimand to expulsion.  </P> <P> Dixon said that despite Frank's request for an investigation, the committee  vote "was not based on his request but on our own motion."'  </P> <P> Frank said he used personal funds to pay Gobie as a housekeeper and driver from  July, 1985, through August, 1987. Gobie said he used Frank's Capitol Hill  apartment to run a prostitution ring with the lawmaker's knowledge, but Frank  repeatedly denied knowing about the operation.  </P> <P> Gobie, whose involvement with Frank was first reported by the Washington Times  last month, has publicly expressed willingness to testify before the Ethics  Committee if his lawyer approves.  </P> <P> Frank has admitted paying Gobie $80 for sex after answering a classified ad in  a Washington gay newspaper in the spring of 1985. The lawmaker said he then  hired Gobie, hoping to change his ways, but fired him after he learned of the  prostitution ring.  </P></p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Wagon shares fall 40p on first half warning WAGON Industrial, the materials handling and engineering group, comfortably met market expectations with pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 up 43 per cent from Pounds 12.7m to Pounds 18.1m. The shares, however, fell 40p to 377p after the group warned that results of European subsidiaries would be under pressure, especially in the first half. While relieved by the prospects of UK economic recovery and confident of the strength of its balance sheet with Pounds 14.7m of net cash, shareholders were told yesterday that 'the worst is not over for the European economies.' 'It is anticipated that for the year as a whole, results will be similar to those achieved in 1992-93, prior to any further restructuring costs that may become necessary at Forkhardt,' said Mr Paul Taylor, chairman, referring to the German engineering subsidiary. Such costs could amount to Pounds 3m, explained Mr John Hudson, chief executive. The absence of exceptional costs was one of two main reasons for the profits increase in the accounts, prepared under FRS 3. The previous figures, restated, carried exceptionals of Pounds 3.46m. The second was the performance of companies acquired during the year. They contributed Pounds 29.6m to total turnover of Pounds 248m (Pounds 230m) and added Pounds 2.09m to operating profits, which, without their presence, would have been Pounds 14.4m, against Pounds 15.6m. Earnings per share were 29p (19.95p) on capital enlarged by a rights issue to finance the purchase of Polypal, a Belgian materials handling company. An increased final dividend of 11.175p lifts the total to 17.308p (16.484p).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 28 Feb -- Journalists noticed today that one  of those freed from the Lefortovo prison, Andrey Dunayev, was in  the State Duma. He went to the 18th floor where the office of  Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin is situated.    For a comment on this fact one can quote Georgiy Satarov,  the  Russian Federation president's aide, who said today that after  speaking to Ivan Rybkin, it became clear to him that the  chairman of the chamber and its deputies feel that they are  responsible for the behavior of those whom they had freed. In  order to preserve their reputation of supporters of reforms, the  Duma leaders are apparently trying to obtain promises of  trustworthiness from the organizers of the October events in  Moscow.</p>

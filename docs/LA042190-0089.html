			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Reebok Tries Again: Reebok is back with its provocative "bungee" jumping  commercial for its "the Pump" athletic shoes.  </P> <P> That ad, which shows two men leaping from a high bridge with their shoes tied  to special ropes that are supposed to protect them from hitting the water,  caused a stir when it first aired last month. Reebok quickly pulled the ad. But  a new version of it -- with written warnings not to try the stunt -- is airing  again on CBS and ABC on "selective" programming after 10 p.m, Reebok said in a  statement. NBC still refuses to air the ad.  </P></p>

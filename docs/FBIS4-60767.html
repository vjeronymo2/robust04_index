			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 29, BNS -- The parties in Estonia's  governing coalition started a session of talks in the Lohusalu  seaside resort near Tallinn Thursday [28 April]. The two days  of talks were to focus on the priorities in legislative activity  and outlining the 1995 state budget.    Work goes on in a number of fields, such as farming and  social security, governmental spokesman Ain Saarna said. Also  discussed will be the implementation of the law on aliens and  extending the deadline for submitting the residence and working  permit applications for non-citizens.    "Neither political problems nor the government reform will  be  officially discussed. There is also no reason to think that  these issues would be taken for discussion at the Lohusalu  meeting," the spokesman said.    The meeting's atmosphere this time is much more serious and  business-like than it was at a similar meeting last year, said  MP Andrus Villem. "One can feel that people know what they want  and what they are doing," he said.    "There are no major differences in opinions within the  government coalition at present," Villem said, adding that all  disputes concerned only details of minor importance.    All political parties in the Estonian government coalition  take part in the two-day meeting. Also most of the Cabinet  members are present.    Thursday's meeting was presided by Prime Minister Mart Laar.</p>

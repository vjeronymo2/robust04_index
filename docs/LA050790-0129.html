			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LASIX FOUND TO AID HORSES' PERFORMANCE;  </P> <P> RACING: A STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT THE DRUG, USED TO CONTROL BLEEDING, DOES NOT  ALWAYS WORK. THE MEDICATION IS LEGAL IN SOME STATES BUT BANNED IN OTHERS.  </P> <P> A University of Pennsylvania study released today shows that Lasix improves a  race horse's performance but does not always have the desired effect.  </P> <P> The study, commissioned and funded by the Jockey Club, was the first to test  the effect of the medication called furosemide, used to control bleeding in  horses. Kentucky Derby winner Unbridled was one of five horses who ran on the  substance in that race.  </P> <P> The Penn research team, headed by veterinarians Corinne Raphel Sweeney,  Lawrence Soma and Abbey Maxson, administered Lasix to 76 non-bleeders at  Philadelphia Park Racetrack during the 1988-89 racing season. Using three races  in the study -- two without the medication being applied, the third with it --  the researchers found an improvement of 0.48 seconds or 2.4 lengths for a  one-mile race when Lasix was used. The greatest gain was found in geldings,  whose performance improved by 1.08 seconds or 5.4 lengths.  </P> <P> In a related test, the researchers also found the racing performance of 52  bleeders also was improved when Lasix was applied, although not by as much as  the non-bleeders. The average improvement among the bleeders was .26 seconds or  1.3 lengths with geldings again displaying the best gains.  </P> <P> In each case, colts showed minimal or no gains, but the researchers said they  felt the difference was related to age rather than gender since the geldings  tested were, on the average, older.  </P> <P> In an interesting sidelight to the study, Sweeney said that even after Lasix  was administered, 32 of the 52 bleeders, 62%, continued to bleed. Of 235  non-bleeders who ran on the drug, 62 bled following their races.  </P> <P> Bleeding is not an unusual condition for thoroughbreds and the Penn vets had to  screen nearly 700 horses to find 79 free of bleeding after three races who  could then be used in the research.  </P> <P> Ogden Mills Phipps, chairman of the Jockey Club, said the study was undertaken  following discussion by all segments of the racing community -- trainers,  owners, jockeys, veterinarians and officials.  </P> <P> "Nobody had ever defined the effects of Lasix on horses before," Phipps said.  </P> <P> "We wanted to get the facts. We've mailed copies of this report to every racing  commission in America. The Jockey Club opposes any artificial substance that  enhances the racing ability of thoroughbreds. We are not in a position to  dictate what the commissions should be doing. We are in position to inform them  of the information available.  </P> <P> "What the Jockey Club wants is to make sure racing is run fairly and perceived  by the public to be run fairly."  </P> <P> Lasix is banned in some racing states like New York but permitted in others,  like Maryland and Kentucky.  </P></p>

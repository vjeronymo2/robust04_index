			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / T&amp;N raises asbestos lawsuits provision to Pounds 21m T&amp;N, the British engineering and motor components group, said yesterday it had increased its liability provision for asbestos-linked legal action by 27 per cent after a flood of new compensation claims in the US. The Manchester-based group, formerly one of Britain's largest manufacturers of asbestos-based products, has set aside Pounds 21.1m to cover legal and settlement costs arising out of the claims, compared with a Pounds 16.6m provision in 1992. In spite of the increased provisions, T&amp;N said it expected its liabilities to decline. The issue has cast a shadow over the group's prospects for more than a decade. Claims, mainly in the US, from victims of asbestos-related diseases have left insurance companies - and the troubled Lloyd's market in London - with billions of pounds of losses and have forced some of the world's leading asbestos producers into bankruptcy proceedings. T&amp;N - formerly Turner &amp; Newall - said a class action under way in New York might significantly reduce legal claims. Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive, said T&amp;N had joined forces with 20 companies and their insurers to pursue the action, which is being overseen by the US Centre for Claims Resolution, a body that seeks to arbitrate legal actions. 'This is a watershed ruling. It would significantly limit our liability and progressively reduce our costs to zero over the next 10 years,' Mr Hope added. According to T&amp;N, the preliminary plan has been approved by a federal court judge and a final ruling is expected in the next two weeks. The action aims to alter US law so that future asbestos claimants would have to submit to medical tests and settle for fixed compensation payments linked to their level of disability or illness. Companies taking part in the action would settle claims more rapidly. Aware that such a class action is likely to succeed, US law firms are understood to have sharply increased the number of cases filed against such companies, attempting to extract settlements before the new system comes into effect. T&amp;N claimed the number of cases filed in New York against asbestos producers and their insurers was running at about 3,000 a month. In the past decade, T&amp;N has spent more than Pounds 130m on asbestos legal costs and settlements. Mr Hope said the company had also built up a balance sheet provision of Pounds 38.4m to cover longer-term legal costs. Those potential costs include 13 outstanding actions against asbestos products from buildings. T&amp;N ahead, Page 27</p>

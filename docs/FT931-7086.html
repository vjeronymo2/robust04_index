			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Growth hopes for invisible earnings UK COMPANIES expect invisible earnings from the European Community to grow by 10 per cent over the next six months, according to a survey out yesterday. British Invisibles, a trade group which promotes UK financial and other services abroad, said companies were 'cautiously optimistic' about invisible earnings. More than 60 per cent of the 99 companies surveyed thought the UK's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism was a positive influence on export performance, with only 7 per cent viewing it as negative. There was widespread concern about the possible impact of a stronger pound. The survey, which covered sectors including accountancy, banking, commodities and futures, consultancy, insurance, legal services and tourism, found 70 per cent of respondents forecast growth in their overseas earnings over the next six months. British Invisibles said the most important market was the combined region of the EC and the European Free Trade Association. Most saw this region growing, albeit modestly. Two-thirds of the survey's respondents considered the US to be their main competition in the Japanese market, with less than 10 per cent regarding France and Germany as significant competitors. The survey identified a number of perceived threats to the UK's performance. The banking sector was concerned about EC recession while the consultancy sector was worried about political stability in central Europe and the Middle East.</p>

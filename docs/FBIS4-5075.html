			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists  on April 4 brought overseas-based E-3 early warning plane, FA-18  pursuit-assault planes, AV-8 VTOL [vertical takeoff and landing]  assault planes and KC-135 tanker planes to South Korea for  provocative joint air war exercises against the Northern half of  Korea, military sources said.    Exercises, such as a surprise bombing on ground targets, air  attack and support of ground attack, were staged with the skies  above Chungju, Tanyang and Pyongchang as operational theatres.  They involved hundreds of fighter-bombers, assault planes,  observation planes and reconnaissance planes belonging to the  U.S. Airforce in South Korea and the puppet Airforce.    In another development, the South Korean puppets on April 4  and 5 fired shells and volleys of large-calibre machinegun and  automatic rifle bullets into spots near the Demilitarized Zone  in Yonchon and Paju Counties, Kyonggi Province, and Chorwon  County, South Korean Kangwon Province.    On the 5th of April, formations of helicopter gunships and  transport helicopters of the puppet Army staged missile strike  and airlifting exercises, making low- and ultralow-altitude  flights in the skies above Paju and Yonchon areas.    Warplanes mobilized in various air war games against the  North which were staged in skies above South Korea in two days  totaled more than 700.    Very ill-boding are provocative military moves of the U.S.  imperialists and the South Korean puppets which are becoming all  the more reckless.    They must act with discretion, clearly mindful of the  seriousness of the tensions created on the Korean peninsula.</p>

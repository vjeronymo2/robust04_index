			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miguel Lozano] </F>   [Text] Havana, 1 Mar (PL) -- A ranking Cuban official today  confirmed the Cuban Government's decision to go ahead with the  normalization of relations with emigres and to eliminate all the  stumbling blocks on the path to this goal.    Jose Ramon Balaguer, a member of the Communist Party  Politburo and head of the party's ideology department, told  PRENSA LATINA the government's decision is very clear and will  not be reversed.    Balaguer's assertions were made shortly after a meeting with  Amalio Fiallo, a Cuban resident of Venezuela, who recently  organized a workshop on participative democracy theories in the  city of Camaguey, approximately 700 km east of Havana.    The Communist leader said the Camaguey meeting, which was  also attended by Cuban emigres who reside in the United States,  besides examining an important topic like democracy, promoted  improved relations between Cubans on and off the island.    Now we have a better understanding of our differences and  diversity of concepts and also of the things that bring us  together, asserted Balaguer, who spoke highly of the workshop  and about two previous seminars conducted by Fiallo in Havana.    In Balaguer's opinion, these seminars are part of a process  to normalize relations with the Cuban community abroad, which  the government will not allow to be hindered by radical emigre  sectors or the hostility of the United States, where most Cubans  abroad reside.    Balaguer pointed out that it is not a matter of changing the  emigres' ideology: Our views can differ; that will not prevent  us from working with all Cubans who, regardless of where they  may be, desire the best for Cuba, he said.    Fiallo, meanwhile, noted that -- although he did not arrive  at there thinking this way -- the seminars on participative  democracy are also a means of preparing for the "nation and  immigration" conference scheduled for April by the authorities  and approximately 200 members of the Cuban community abroad.    This effort, he said, proves that the Cuban people can  sustain civilized conversations that begin with respect and end  cordially and this, regardless of the topic, will foster a  climate of rapprochement.    In the opinion of Professor Amalio Fiallo, director of the  Pro- Man Society of Caracas [Sociedad Prohombre de Caracas], a  process of understanding is taking place between Cubans on the  island and abroad which is viewed positively by both sides.    In his opinion, nevertheless, it is necessary to separate  the  majority of Cubans from a small group of radical exiles who  control the news media and are now intensifying their attacks in  view of the April conference.    Another participant in the conversation was Jerold Moser,  the  representative in Venezuela and the Caribbean of the Hans Seidel  Foundation of Bavaria, Germany, the organization that is  financing the seminars on participative democracy in Cuba as it  previously did in Madrid, Puerto Rico, Miami, New York, and  other U.S. cities.    Moser explained to PRENSA LATINA that his institution  sponsors programs in favor of dialogue and international  encounters and that he supports the plan presented by Fiallo,  which he views as a good example for the world, although it will  be carried out among Cubans.</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REVIVAL OF CITIZEN PANEL ON REDEVELOPMENT  SOUGHT  </P> <P> A small group of Hollywood property owners, claiming to have evidence damaging  to the Community Redevelopment Agency, has gone to court to reinstate the  Project Area Committee, the one-time official citizens advisory panel on  Hollywood redevelopment.  </P> <P> Hollywood Endangered Property Owners, an informal coalition of several dozen  landowners, filed a motion Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking a new  trial in a 15-month-old dispute over the status of the committee.  </P> <P> The committee had become the primary mouthpiece for critics of the 1,100-acre  renewal effort when the Los Angeles City Council voted last year to disband it.  A Superior Court judge upheld the council's action, but many committee members  have continued to meet. Members of the property owners group said they have  documents showing that the drafters of the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan  intended for the committee to remain in existence for the life of the 30-year  project. A hearing is set for Aug. 31.  </P></p>

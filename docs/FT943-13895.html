			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Bosnian Serbs may reject peace proposal Bosnia's rival assemblies - the republic's Moslem-led legislature in Sarajevo and the Serb deputies in nearby Pale - will today give their verdict on an internationally sponsored peace plan. And all the signs are that the Serbs will say No. Diplomats said yesterday that only a last-minute turnround, under the influence of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, could avert a resounding rejection from delegates in Pale. If they turn down the plan devised by a five-nation contact group, the Bosnian Serbs will by defying international opinion. In effect, they would be challenging the group to put into effect the threatened 'disincentives' for those who refuse to co-operate. The contact group has pledged to tighten economic sanctions against Serbia and possibly to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian government, if the Serbs say No and the government says Yes. United Nations and Nato commanders at the weekend met in Zagreb to decide possible responses if one side rejects the plan. Senior Bosnian Serb officials have defiantly predicted that the deputies who arrived in Pale over the weekend from all parts of their self-proclaimed Serb republic will turn down the proposals. In Belgrade, President Milosevic has not delivered a firm opinion on the peace plan but is believed to support it, if only to ease economic pressure on Serbia. But he claims to have only limited influence over his kinsmen in Bosnia, and he wants to avoid the humiliation he suffered last year, when the Bosnian Serbs ran counter to his advice and turned down the Vance-Owen peace plan. The latest proposals call for a Moslem-Croat federation to control 51 per cent of Bosnia, while the Serbs - who currently control 70 per cent - would pull back to a 49 per cent share. Mr Milosevic indicated to the British and French foreign ministers last week that he took seriously their offer to lift economic sanctions in return for co-operation. But Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, told the visiting ministers he had strong objections to the plan, mainly constitutional. He wanted the Bosnian Serb territory to be fully independent, while the plan called for both statelets to form a loose confederation. Politicians from the Serbian Democratic Party, the main political grouping in Pale, made it clear they intend to vote No. Some of the loudest rejections have come from representatives of regions that would have to be ceded to the Moslem-Croat federation under the peace plan. Bosnian Serb paramilitaries at the weekend rounded up Moslems who have remained in Serb-held territory. General Ratko Mladic, military commander of the Bosnian Serbs, has told Mr Milosevic he will never hand over such strategic positions as Mount Ozren in northern Bosnia.</p>

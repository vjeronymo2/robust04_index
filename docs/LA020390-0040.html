			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROSECUTOR FREES 2 IN DRIVE-BY SLAYING  </P> <P> Murder charges have been dropped against two suspected gang members accused of  killing a Pacoima man after he barred them from a birthday party in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> Robert Ayala, 19, of Panorama City and Tanya Dowdy, 18, of Sun Valley were  released from custody Thursday after prosecutors decided there is insufficient  evidence to prove they aided and abetted the Jan. 13 drive-by shooting of  Odilon Navarrete, 23, said Van Nuys Deputy Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Shellie Samuels. "We can prove only that they were passengers in the car," she  said.  </P> <P> A murder charge also was dropped against a third person, Karen Argott, 18, of  Arleta, who drove the car, Samuels said. But prosecutors said the charges  against Argott were dismissed for technical reasons and will be refiled.  </P> <P> An arrest warrant still is in effect for Walter Oswaldo Barillas, 22, of Canoga  Park, who prosecutors say fired the shots. A 17-year-old girl who was in the  car is scheduled to appear in Sylmar Juvenile Court on Feb. 28 to face murder  charges.  </P> <P> Twenty to 30 shots were fired toward Navarrete as he drove west on Oxnard  Street near Van Nuys Boulevard, police said. A passenger in the car,  Navarrete's girlfriend, Irma Ortega, 21, escaped injury when he pushed her to  the floor of the car, police said.  </P> <P> Navarrete had earlier turned away the three female suspects when they tried to  enter a private party at the Eagle Lodge on Haskell Avenue in Van Nuys, police  said.  </P></p>

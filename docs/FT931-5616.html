			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Recovery call by US envoy THE US expects Germany and Japan to take 'decisive, politically difficult' steps in the coming months to promote a world recovery, Mr James Dobbins, US ambassador to the European Community, said yesterday. They should follow the Clinton administration's tax and spending package, he said. A strong world recovery would help relieve trade tensions and combat pessimism in the EC. Speaking to Christian Democrats in Bonn, Mr Dobbins also sought to calm EC fears about the administration's trade policies and its apparent indifference toward the EC. He made clear that the US does not at present intend to re-open the accord on Airbus Industrie. It intended to claw back subsidies, but would aim to limit new subsidies in marketing and export finance and other areas 'on a multilateral basis'. Exchanges on trade would be 'vigorous' and 'occasionally sharp', Mr Dobbins predicted. But relations would be 'mutually productive' as Europe benefited from US growth and success in opening markets.</p>

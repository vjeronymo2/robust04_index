			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Leonid Kapelyushnyy report: "A Game of Patience with Eight </F> Aces. The Presidential Race in Ukraine Has Begun. But the  Elections of the New President Might Not Take Place"]    [Text] Odessa -- The presidential elections in Ukraine are  surrounded by sensation inadvertently triggered by Leonid  Kravchuk.    Long before the presidential race began he said in a radio  interview with a foreign correspondent that he will not be  standing in the future elections.    The nomination of election contenders took place in the  traditional, smooth way. At the allotted time the Central  Electoral Committee accepted the documents and issued signature  lists to Aleksandr Moroz, leader of the Socialist Party; Leonid  Kuchma, former prime minister; Vladimir Lanovoy and Viktor  Pinzenik, former vice premiers; Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the  last Supreme Council; and Nikolay Rud, a teacher at Kiev  Technical University and a complete unknown. On the last day  Education Minister P. Tapanchuk and V. Babich, president of the  Ukrainian Financial Group joint-stock union, entered the race.  Admittedly, it was known that in one rural rayon the assembly  had nominated Leonid Makarovich but he did not respond to that  at all.    It should be explained to the non-Ukrainian reader that the  presidential elections were initiated by Leonid Kravchuk  himself. This happened in a situation of deep crisis when the  country was inundated by a flood of demands for the resignation  of the president and the Supreme Council. Now a new parliament  has been elected. There are eight contenders prepared to fight  for the right to save Ukraine from imminent catastrophe. But  the newly elected deputies are beginning to be canvassed by  enterprising free agents who come bearing a letter proposing  that the presidential elections be postponed. June 26 is not  the right time. The old Supreme Council got its calculations  wrong and did not think things out well.    Leonid Makarovich has also issued a statement agreeing that  the elections simply must be postponed to a later date for the  sake of preserving political stability in the country.    Be that as it may, the sociologists are claiming that Leonid  Kuchma has the highest popularity rating among Ukrainian  politicians today. People remember his speeches as premier when  he simply screamed out loud about Ukraine's imminent catastrophe.    Ivan Plyushch said candidly in a recent TV interview that he  had not intended to stand for the presidency but had decided to  do so only after Leonid Makarovich had assured him that he would  not be putting his own nomination forward. "Since he is not  standing I have decided to!" I personally would have been more  impressed by the ambitious stance and hard-won convictions and  plans of the political leader had they not been dependent on  Kravchuk's decision. But that is the kind of man Ivan  Stepanovich is -- an energetic, somewhat rough and ready man who  plays the part of the kindly village uncle but who controls his  audience magnificently, steers the necessary decisions through  brilliantly, and demolishes the unnecessary ones expertly.    I. Plyushch was sincerely confused and did not hide his  resentment at Leonid Makarovich's sleight of hand.    L. Kravchuk does not have to account to anyone why he said  one thing yesterday but is doing something different today. In  Ukraine the president's legendary ability of being able to go  out in the rain without an umbrella and not get wet has been  confirmed once more. He worked things out with precision and  bided his time perfectly before entering the campaign to retain  the presidency. The nomination is not the main move but his  insurance, his fall-back position. Just in case the elections  are held.    L. Kravchuk believes that the present Ukrainian Constitution  does not contain a statute on the early election of the  president. There is a statute on the early termination of power  as a result of impeachment and -- on the initiative of the  citizens -- through a referendum. Thus the old parliament  exceeded its powers. And Leonid Markovich [as published] was  forced to accept that.    In Kravchuk's opinion the violation of the aforementioned  articles makes the new elections illegitimate. And the blame  for this situation rests on the old parliament which during four  years' work did not find the time to adopt a constitution -- the  only parliament in the Commonwealth not to do so.    If the new parliament confirms the decision of the old one,  all the responsibility will rest on it. Not for the elections  but for the fate of Ukraine as a whole. That is the president's  view. And he is absolutely right.    In the new Supreme Council 120 deputies have signed their  names to the protest letter against the presidential elections.  The rest have doubts. There is not a single fortune teller  prepared to guess how events will develop at the first session.    When setting out the deck of cards showing the presidential  contenders the voter can work out in theory which card is the  ace, but how can he tell which suit the trump cards will be?</p>

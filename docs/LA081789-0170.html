			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MCCOLL SETTLEMENT TALKS FAIL; CASE SENT BACK TO TRIAL JUDGE  </P> <P> Once-promising settlement talks over the city of Fullerton's potential  responsibility for the McColl hazardous waste dump have broken down, raising  the likelihood that the already-prolonged dispute will move toward trial.  </P> <P> Two other groups of defendants -- developers and oil companies -- reportedly  have already agreed to multimillion-dollar payments to settle their portion of  the case, making Fullerton the sole remaining defendant.  </P> <P> About a dozen lawyers met this week in a last-ditch attempt to salvage an  agreement in the last remaining portion of a second round of lawsuits involving  the McColl dump. But the effort was thwarted primarily by a dispute -- not  between Fullerton and the 700 homeowners near the site who are suing, but  between the city and some of its insurers, sources said.  </P> <P> The city's financial responsibility is the last major question mark remaining  in a dispute that is rooted in the World War II-era dumping of jet fuel waste  at the McColl site in the western hills of the city, a site still awaiting  cleanup four decades later.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Negligence Alleged  </P> <P> The lawsuits alleged that developers were negligent in building near the dump  and that the city issued construction permits for the developments and failed  to warn property buyers of the hazards.  </P> <P> Among the legal issues still in contention are guarantees being sought by some  of the city's insurers that they will be safeguarded from any future liability  arising from the McColl controversy, guarantees that the city did not offer,  sources close to the case said.  </P> <P> "We struck out," said Superior Court Judge Jerrold S. Oliver, who is overseeing  the settlement talks. "First we had a settlement, then we didn't have a  settlement."  </P> <P> Frustrated by the turn of events, Oliver said he is sending the case back to  its Superior Court trial judge, Tully H. Seymour. Seymour said Wednesday that  he will now have to proceed toward trial with the remaining portion of the  case.  </P> <P> Oliver, who is retiring from the bench next month, said a "fruitless" meeting  late Tuesday "was the last try at settling this thing as far as I'm concerned.  . . . There's got to be some change in attitude among the parties if they're  going to avoid a trial."  </P> <P> Attorney Richard G. Montevideo of Costa Mesa, representing Fullerton in the  dispute, said this week's settlement talks "didn't go well, but there's still a  chance. . . . It's always been a tough road to hoe in this case for the city."  </P> <P> The responsibility of the city remains the main hurdle in the resolution of  what has become known in legal circles as "McColl II."  </P> <P> An initial round of lawsuits resulted in total payments of about $14 million to  more than a hundred homeowners around the McColl site by numerous defendants,  including the city, the county, developers who put up housing tracts on three  sides of the site, and oil companies believed to have contaminated the area in  the first place.  </P> <P> A second group of homeowners not involved in the first lawsuits filed suit in  1986, also claiming that they should have been warned about the contaminated  state of the dump and the health problems it could cause. Residents near the  site in the past have complained of headaches, nausea and respiratory problems  and, in some cases, a high rate of miscarriages.  </P> <P> Developers and oil companies have agreed in recent months to make cash payments  to 701 residents in the second lawsuit. But exact terms of the agreements have  remained sketchy because the pacts have been sealed under court order.  </P> <P> Attorneys Manuel Hidalgo and Robert H. Sulknik, representing the residents,  declined comment on the progress of the McColl II case.  </P> <P> But Hidalgo, asked about the reported dispute between the city and its  insurers, said: "That's something we (attorneys for the the residents) have no  say in -- there's no fight over our end of the deal. . . . We're not the issue  anymore, and it's a very sad state of affairs."  </P> <P> He added: "I sincerely do not believe that this case will not settle. We've  come so close, it would be an economic waste."  </P> <P> No future settlement talks have been scheduled.  </P></p>

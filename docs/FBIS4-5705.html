			<p>BFN     [Text] On 12 April, North Korea claimed that the remarks  made by Pak Yong-su, the North Korean delegate to the  North-South working-level contact, regarding Seoul becoming a  sea of fire during the eighth North-South working contact on 19  March, did not mean that North Korea will start a war, and that  the South side created an atmosphere of war by disseminating his  remarks after distorting the meaning.    Appearing on a roundtable talk on a Pyongyang broadcasting  [Pyongyang Radio Pyongyang in Korean to South Korea] program,  Choe Song-ik, director of a department in the Secretariat of the  Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in  North Korea, said that Pak Yong-su's remarks meant that if South  Korea advances along the road of sanctions and war, all of the  Korean peninsula will become a sea of fire and in this event,  Song Yong- tae, the South side delegate, could not survive.  Thus, Seoul cannot but be reduced to a sea of fire. He  stressed that Pak Yong-su's remarks did not mean that North  Korea threatened that Seoul will be a sea of fire by starting a  war.    A relevant official of the National Unification Board  stressed that as the scene was recorded on video through closed  circuit cameras, distortion of the remarks regarding Seoul  becoming a sea of fire is impossible, and that North Korea's  claim is intended to shift the responsibility for the strained  situation onto the South.    This official pointed out that the North Korean attempt to  evade the responsibility for the remarks was prompted by its  realistic judgment that the remarks on Seoul becoming a sea of  fire, made as part of high-level psychological warfare, failed  to disturb our society and only heightened the hard-line  international atmosphere. He interpreted that it is highly  likely that North Korea, in the wake of resumption of contact  with the United States and the International Atomic Energy  Agency, showed such a change in its position as an advance step  for the contact.    Meanwhile, some people observed that the appearance of Choe  Song- ik, the deputy delegate, on the roundtable talk instead of  Pak Yong- su himself to explain the content of his remarks,  supports the recent rumor that Pak Yong-su was relegated.</p>

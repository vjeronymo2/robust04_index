			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOLLEYBALL;  </P> <P> TEAM CUP GIVES PLAYERS, CROWD A TASTE OF EUROPE  </P> <P> For all intents and purposes, the professional beach volleyball season is over.  </P> <P> And the international European leagues will not begin until October.  </P> <P> Attempting to fill the vacuum for the sport's aficionados is Team Cup  Volleyball, which ended after six days of competition Sunday night at the  Forum.  </P> <P> This weeklong competition of spikes and sets was a melding of the United  States' 32 best indoor and beach volleyball players divided into four teams.  </P> <P> Undefeated Team Redsand, led by Olympians Steve Timmons and Craig Buck,  dominated play throughout the week and won Sunday's final by defeating Team  Toyota, 30-27, 30-19, before 5,627.  </P> <P> A competition of this sort is necessary to promote the sport, the athletes say.  Volleyball is enjoying success as a two-person beach game.  </P> <P> With the U.S. men winning the 1984 and '88 Olympic gold medals, the sport also  has gained popularity indoors.  </P> <P> "But we're going through serious growing pains," said Timmons, one of America's  marquee players. "Our early goal was to sell the sport to the public. In a way,  we are still doing that."  </P> <P> In some respects, they have a way to go.  </P> <P> "We're still not getting the numbers to come out and watch the indoor game,"  said Jon Root, a member of the 1988 Olympic team.  </P> <P> These players know where the money is -- Italy. Timmons and Karch Kiraly, the  leaders of the U.S. Olympic movement in the last decade, have signed  half-million dollar contracts for the upcoming season.  </P> <P> Root does not command as high a salary in Italy, but he also is leaving next  week. So are several other U.S. stars. Most of the country's elite players live  in Southern California.  </P> <P> "This (competition) is a warm-up for us," Root said.  </P> <P> The players hope volleyball eventually will support a U.S. professional league.  Such enterprises have failed in the past, yet a twinge of hope remains.  </P> <P> "We think we could take this on the road," Timmons said. "L.A. is a tough  market. We could get a lot more fans in other American cities."  </P></p>

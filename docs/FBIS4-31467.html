			<p>BFN     [Text] Plzen, West Bohemia June 9 (CTK) -- Christian  Democratic Party (KDS) Chairman Ivan Pilip said today he did not  know the origin of speculation about the possible dismissal of  KDS Deputy Chairman Vaclav Benda. "But I must say that some of  Benda's statements disquiet me," Pilip said, adding that these  statements had harmed the KDS.    "I agree that the person of General Pinochet is far more  complicated than is pictured in some critical media reports  protesting against his visit to the Czech Republic," Pilip said.  He added, however, that presently it was necessary to "direct  attention towards important questions connected with the  transformation of the economy, health care and the educational  system and not to provoke speculation as to whether it is  appropriate to use military methods for solving the situation in  the country or not."    Information that Benda might be removed from his post at a  KDS Executive Committee meeting on Saturday [11 June] was  published today by the left-leaning daily RUDE PRAVO.    On June 5 Benda told NOVA Television that if he were in the  same situation as General Augusto Pinochet he would probably act  in the same way. He added he did not consider Pinochet a  criminal but a brave man who, through tough means but acting  against an enemy just as tough, saved his country at the last  moment from the horrors of communism or a long-lasting civil war.</p>

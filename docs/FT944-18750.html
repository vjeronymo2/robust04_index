			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / The noble rot at a society's core: Peter Aspden, at the RA's Venice exhibition, saw only the sad degeneration of a culture I guess it was just another tale of Piccadilly low-life; a succession of fleshy floozies catching my eye everywhere I turned, while their lusty men-folk patrolled the alley-ways looking for action. Some of them wore masks, but I could see through their cheap disguises. They were frightened. This was a society on the brink of collapse, and they knew it. It was a highly disturbing couple of hours. But when I left the Royal Academy's The Glory of Venice exhibition, the whiff of 'Chanel No. 5 crossed with aerosol room freshener', as the catalogue describes the pervading atmosphere, stuck in my throat: why this fascination with the 18th century? And if this really was the Age of Reason, the ultimate expression of man's rational mastery over the universe, why did its patrons surround themselves with the kitsch and glitter of these ghastly artefacts? Many speak of the joy, the sensuality, the celebration of 18th century art; at the Royal Academy, I saw only the sad degeneration of an entire culture, the noble rot at the core of a society intent on partying for dear life. Were its leading lights so blinded by the pellucid skies and arcadian visions that they failed to see the storm clouds gathering? Some of the paintings are religious, at least in theme; but their tone betrays them: Tiepolo's The Immaculate Conception, in which a curvaceous, knowing Virgin immodestly acknowledges the panting leers of the surrounding cherubs; Piazzetta's Guardian Angel, who gestures grandly above the camp theatrics of her adoring saints. Forget spirituality; more palpable in the exhibition is the douceur de vivre of this self-indulgent age, the air of pleasure and luxury which permeates even the smallest works. These mannered, stylised creations, beautifully painted though they may be, speak of an unbridled arrogance totally devoid of sacredness or humility of spirit, emblematic of a society utterly engrossed in its own affectations. Little wonder that the French, having captured Venice and the famous Lion which symbolised the city's supremacy, shipped the statue in small pieces back to Paris where it was re-assembled with its tail lowered and placed between its legs. But why the fascination? Could it be that the brazen excesses of the 18th century remind us, ever so slightly, of our own? The sharpest minds of that period described their cultural milieu in terms we are not unfamiliar with today: opulent, acquisitive, corrupt, philistine, insecure. It is a mistake to assume that all intellectuals of the Enlightenment celebrated the unqualified triumph of reason and science; did Alexander Pope not jibe at man's role as the 'Sole judge of Truth, in endless Error hurled: The glory, jest and riddle of the World]'? We too live in a cynical world which glorifies sensuality and revels in the ironic twists and turns of a post-heroic mentality; is a trip to The Glory of Venice simply an act of mass transference by which we can guiltlessly enjoy the corpulent delights of an era we identify with our own? That is why I felt a little sick as I wandered round the Royal Academy, hurrying past its dank allegorical tombs, its insipid canal views (can these continue to have any impact in an age of mass tourism?), those oh-so-naughty putti urinating out of the clouds, the chained Nubian slaves holding aloft their prized pieces of porcelain. Charming as a bucket of cold custard. The show ends with the cloying works of Canova; take a close look at the pious plaster bas-reliefs Teaching the Ignorant and Feeding the Hungry, then go and look at the Parthenon Marbles, and weep for what happened to Western Civilisation. Once out of the exhibition, however, there is no escape, for the shameless hedonism continues in the gallery shop: carnival masks, silk scarves, needlepoint kits, Bassano ceramics, Murano jewellery, multi-coloured pasta and charcoal-roasted artichoke hearts. A man approaches me to explain my chances of winning a holiday (overlooking, you guessed it, the Grand Canal) if I buy a lottery ticket for the Royal Academy appeal. It is all too much. I wonder which is more decadent, a society which splashes its decline all over a piece of canvas, or one which pretends it is not happening and keeps falling in love with its past. The Glory of Venice: Art in the Eighteenth Century, at the Royal Academy of Arts, London until December 14.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Top US judge quits Lloyd's US Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer has extricated himself from a controversial investment in a Lloyd's of London syndicate by paying about Dollars 100,000 for insurance to cover all future liabilities. The justice's investment has forced him to disqualify himself from a number of cases involving Lloyd's which reached the high court. Mr Breyer promised in his confirmation hearings last year he would leave the Merrett syndicate as soon as possible. Because Merrett 418 and other troubled syndicates will be rolled into one reassurance facility in 1996, thus closing off future risk, the justice could be paying Dollars 100,000 unnecessarily. However, a large chunk of the court's cases deal with insurance matters, and Mr Breyer's expertise on complicated business issues is considered desirable. Mr Breyer's nomination to the court was opposed by Republican senator Richard Lugar, who argued that he should be disqualified for showing 'poor judgment' in the investment.</p>

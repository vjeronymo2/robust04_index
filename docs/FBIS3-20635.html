			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Xie Ranhao [6200 3544 3185]] </F>   [Text] At a meeting recently held in Beijing, the President  of the China National Petroleum and Natural Gas Corporation,  Wang Tao, proclaimed that the string of natural gas discoveries  that have been made since the end of the "Seventh 5-Year Plan"  prove that China has reached a new stage in growth of reserves.    In the last three years, under the policy of giving equal  importance to oil and gas, the level of effort in gas-geology  research and exploration has been raised, and the growth of  reserve volumes has equaled that of the previous 40 years.  Because of a series of findings, China is now taking the initial  steps to create three new large gas regions.    One is the largest contiguous gas field ever found on the  China mainland, which is located in northern Shaanxi and covers  an area of over 2,340 square kilometers, where most recently, at  Ih Ju Meng in Inner Mongolia a number of industrial-grade wells  were drilled that foretell even greater expansion of the  gas-bearing area.    Two is a group of gas fields found in eastern Sichuan, and  high-output gas wells found in central and southern Sichuan that  forecast the existence of more major gas fields.    Three is the finding of geological indicators for natural  gas  reserves of considerable volume in the Turpan-Hami, Junggar, and  Tarim basins, including some in Tarim that are hoped will  continue to expand in scale.    Additionally, in the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai, a gas-bearing  region rich in natural gas has been confirmed.    Wang Tao said that it is expected that confirmed volumes of  natural gas will more than double over the next seven years. He  firmly believes that based on finds already confirmed and the  expected growth of reserves over the next several years that the  ground has been laid for a rapid development of China's natural  gas bases.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Batteries for globetrotters WHILE notebook PCs are frequently touted as tools for the business traveller, in practice few have enough battery power to last through a transcontinental flight, writes Louise Kehoe. This is especially true of models with high-quality displays and hard discs. Compaq Computer's latest 'notebook' computers, the Lite/25 and LTE Lite/20, go some way to overcoming this. They use the latest Intel 386SL microprocessors, which minimise battery drain by suspending operation of functions that are not in use. Compaq has also developed a low-power backlighting system for the display, normally the most power-hungry element of a notebook. The lighting system saves up to 50 per cent of the power consumed by earlier designs. Also included in the latest Compaq notebooks is a battery pack with a built-in microprocessor that monitors power use and displays the amount of power remaining on a battery gauge. These innovations enable Compaq's new LTE Lite/25 and Lite/20 models to run for three to four and a half hours - a 50 per cent improvement. Compaq Computer: US, 713 370 0670; UK, 081 332 3000.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax levy on trust My husband died five months ago and left his estate in trust. The trustees are myself and another person who is a named beneficiary. On my death, the trust fund is to be distributed to our four children. 1. What is the tax position of such a fund? 2. Can the trust continue to benefit from the tax advantages of a Tessa account, Pep etc. 3. Are there any constraints in the management of such a trust? I am assuming you are provided with a life interest so that all the income from the trust fund during your lifetime will accrue to you; and that, on your death, the fund is distributed equally to your children, writes Barry Stillerman. If this is correct, then there will be no inheritance tax to pay on your husband's death. There would, however, be IHT on the entire trust fund on your death. If your husband has not utilised the nil rate band, you might wish to consider a deed of variation so that up to Pounds 150,000 of assets are passed to your children now. As only individuals can invest in Peps and Tessas, these tax-efficient investments are not available to trusts. Unless there are specific conditions in the trust deed, the only constraints would be those provided by parliament in the various acts regulating the behaviour of trustees. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

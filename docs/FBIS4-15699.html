			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 68 (558): </F> Compiled by Nikolai Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] Speaking at a first meeting of the new government of  the Republic, President Mircea Snegur noted that he started his  activities "in a very difficult period." In this connection, he  singled out four main factors of the future activities of the  Cabinet.    First, organizational. "It is not enough when the government  gets corresponding authorities from the parliament. It should  be efficient, functional, take decisions in time, suggesting  draft laws, necessary mechanisms and implementing them," the  president said.    Second, time factor. In Snegur's opinion, the reorganization  of ministries and departmeent should be carried out quicklu and  with a considerable reduction of their personnel. The president  said that in the past four years the share of state clerks in  the total number of employed grew four times, state budget  spendings for maintainance of the personnel rose from 0.8  percent in 1989 to 3.2 percent in 1993, and their salaries  exceeded the average ones in the republic twice.    In the opinion of the president, this tendency is  characteristic for the controlling bodies. Snegur spoke in  favor of their reduction, pertinent to the need for the merger  of the state control bodies and the existing controlling bodies  attached to ministries and departments.    The president named the third priority: the preparation by  the government of its program for the next two-three years. In  his opinion, this program can be worked out by 1 July. The  president thinks that it should envisage acceleration of  restructuring and moderniation of the national economy,  activization of privatization and social support for the  population.    The president said the fourth priority is the personnel  issue. In his opinion, now "exact selection and professional  training of top executives" are important.    The government decided at its first meeting to recommend the  parliament in the near future to ratify the signed agreements on  Moldova's entry in the CIS and the Economic Union. At the moment  of the Presidential Bulletin's publishing, it was announced that  the parliament ratified on Friday the agreement on the creation  of the CIS with amendments proceeding from the republic's  legislation, as well as the treaty on the creation of the  economic union. The changes concern in particular the  non-alignment of the republic to military agreements, and  non-participation in setting up unified armed forced and the  ruble zone.</p>

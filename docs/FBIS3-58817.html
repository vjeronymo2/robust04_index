			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Deputy Prime Minister Guy Coeme was in principle  due to be heard at 1300 hours by the special commission of the  chamber in charge of dealing with the lifting of his  parliamentary immunity. But there was a surprise late this  morning. We first heard that Guy Coeme was going to make a  statement to the press at his office at 1215 hours, that is 45  minutes before his hearing by the commission of the chamber.  Then, at 1209 hours, a communique from the royal palace said  this: On the proposal of the prime minister, the king has  accepted the resignation of Mr. Guy Coeme from his post of  deputy prime minister, communications minister, and public  companies minister. Guy Coeme explained his resignation just a  few minutes ago. I invite you to listen to extensive excerpts  from his statement:    [Begin Coeme recording] I have decided of my own free will  to  renounce my ministerial duties. I was wrong to believe that  when one is innocent one has nothing to fear. I was wrong to  believe that I could work in serenity while defending myself. I  will have to face an increasingly fierce fight every day. It is  a political fight, because this affair has become political. It  is a fight against the media, which is fed by rumors, lies, and  slander. I am disgusted. As this climate is not my doing, I  think I cannot pursue my ministerial duties with the necessary  serenity.    I am clear-minded. I don't want the government to suffer  from this; I don't want my party to suffer from this, and, above  all, I don't want the population to suffer from this, because I  can no longer work under normal conditions to serve the people.  My freedom will allow me to defend myself with all my energy to  bring the truth to light.    My innocence will be proved. I am going to the special  commission of the chamber to reaffirm that there has been no  forgery and no use of forgery, that nothing illegal has been  done, and that there is absolutely nothing to blame me for. My  conscience is clear. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

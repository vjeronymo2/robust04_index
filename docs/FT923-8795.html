			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance minister attacks critics THE government went on the offensive over the economy yesterday. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, attacked those in favour of devaluation who 'hanker after a quick fix', and contrasted them with supporters of sound money, low inflation and sustainable growth rates. A speech by Mr Dorrell suggested that criticism of the government voiced by businessmen this week has rattled ministers. Last month Treasury officials indicated that comments from Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, insisting there would be no change in strategy, were the government's last word on the economy. The wide distribution of Mr Dorrell's speech to his Loughborough constituency signals that the government now believes more must be done to counter the growing lobby for devaluation or sterling's removal from the European exchange rate mechanism. Making the case that low inflation would generate confidence, Mr Dorrell said that sound money helped savers, allowed businesses to plan ahead and meant release from 'stop, go, boom and bust'. He added: 'The alternatives . . . such as devaluation or leaving the ERM, would wreck that framework and undermine confidence in the future of the British economy.' He argued that countries that had devalued found confidence in their anti-inflation policy collapsed. 'The end result . . . is higher inflation or higher interest rates or both,' Mr Dorrell said, adding that even outside the ERM the UK could not escape its influence. He said that since joining the ERM in 1990, a family on average earnings with a Pounds 30,000 mortgage had seen real disposable income rise 18.5 per cent or Pounds 35 a week.

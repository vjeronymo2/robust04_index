			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SETTING THE STAGE FOR PEACE  </P> <P> Al-Marayati and Ibrahim chastise Israel for the settlements on the West Bank as  an obstacle to peace. From 1948 to 1967, the West Bank was in Arab hands; there  were no Jewish settlements. That time was characterized by continual terrorist  attacks on Israeli citizens, buses, schoolchildren, markets and kibbutzim.  </P> <P> As for speaking with the PLO, it is no surprise that Israel chooses not to sit  down with a sworn enemy actively engaged in a sustained assault against it,  denying its right to exist, disavowing any negotiations and any peace. Let the  PLO demonstrate any good intentions of its words with actions; or, better yet,  let the Palestinian people elect representatives who do not hold office by  force, and let them offer Israel an opportunity to come to the negotiation  table without preconditions.  </P> <P> Every Israeli prime minister from David Ben Gurion to Yitzhak Shamir have  extended hopeful invitations, even please, to its Arab neighbors for direct  negotiations without preconditions. The Arab response has been consistent: no  recognition, no negotiation, no peace. This is, and has been, the essential  barrier to peace in the Mideast.  </P> <P> Israel is prepared to go the extra mile for peace. It is not willing to go to  national suicide.  </P> <P> SHELDON KRONFELD  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Hong Kong fears interference by Beijing PLANS by the agency of the Chinese government responsible for Hong Kong affairs to participate in a locally based investment company have raised fears in the colony about undue political interference in the operations of Hong Kong's economy and financial markets. Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO) is the leader of a group of mainland Chinese government bodies which may take up to 40 per cent of the New China Group. The principal activities of this company are stock brokerage, corporate finance and investment in mainland business ventures. The company was formed late last year by a group of Hong Kong investors led by Mr Tsui Tsin Tong, a businessman with long-standing mainland connections. Other investors include Mr Li Ka Shing, one of the colony's wealthiest men, Mr Cheng Yu Tung, chairman of New World, a property developer, Mr Stanley Ho, Macao's gambling tycoon, and Singapore's Trade Development Board. Chinese state and provincial companies have had a presence in Hong Kong since the beginning of the 1980s, and their collective investment in the colony is well in excess of USDollars 15bn (Pounds 9.9bn), but HKMAO's involvement in New China is the first time an overtly political entity has sought a business presence in Hong Kong. 'I think it is disgraceful,' said a Chinese merchant banker. 'This is a political body which is responsible for Hong Kong affairs. The current Hong Kong government has always kept out of business, except for regulation. This is a dramatic change in the way things have been done; we feel that we no longer have a level playing field.' HKMAO is directly responsible for the negotiations governing Hong Kong's transfer to China in 1997. Merchant bankers believe that HKMAO may be able, or be seen, to trade on price sensitive information. Merchant bankers have lobbied the Securities and Futures Commission, Hong Kong's financial watchdog, but it appears powerless to do anything.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> HOUSTON DWELLING ON DREAMS  </P> <P> Ugly giants and unsteady bridges are preying on Whitney Houston's mind these  days.  </P> <P> The 25-year-old singer said she has spent the time since two consecutive No. 1  albums making new friends, learning about business and trying to decipher her  recurring dreams.  </P> <P> In one, a statue turns into an ugly giant "8 or 9 feet tall, kind of  discolored," she said in the October issue of Life magazine. "He's always  running after me but never gets me."  </P> <P> Another dream has her crossing the George Washington Bridge between her home  state of New Jersey and New York City.  </P> <P> "The bridge starts swinging," Houston said. "It's raining and snowing and  sleeting. It's so windy the bridge turns upside down. But I'm making it; I'm  making it across.  </P> <P> "And when I'm almost there, a hand reaches out for me. It's a man with white  hair who says, 'He told me to come for you,' and lifts me up and puts me on the  other side."  </P></p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Observer: Painful A black day it was for Lloyd's of London chairman David Coleridge, and not simply because of new forecasts putting the insurance market's losses for 1989 at Pounds 2bn, a fifth higher than previous estimates. He's also chairman of Sturge Holdings, Lloyd's biggest agency. The news from Sturge was that it expected to cut its annual dividend by half, so trimming Coleridge's income from his 6.8m share stake by Pounds 559,324. But that's not all. Following a savage reaction from the market, which pegged the shares down 59p to 111p, the value of Coleridge's stake has plunged from Pounds 11.56m to Pounds 7.55m.</p>

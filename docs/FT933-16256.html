			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / The Week Ahead: Profit fall likely at Scottish &amp; Newcastle - Results due Scottish &amp; Newcastle is expected to report full-year pre-tax profits today of about Pounds 202m compared with Pounds 221m for the previous 53 weeks. The results will reflect lower property profits and exceptional costs of cutting staff. Growth at Center Parcs is unlikely to make up for tough trading in the brewing and retailing sectors. Dixons, the electrical goods retailer, is expected on Wednesday to report pre-tax profits of about Pounds 80m for the year to April, up from Pounds 70.8m a year earlier. Some increase in UK profits will be offset by continuing US losses. Investors hope to hear further plans for turning round the Silo chain in the US. At best a minimal dividend increase is likely given the low cover. Taunton Cider should brighten the market on Tuesday with forecast profits of Pounds 17.5m for its first full year after flotation. The cider market grew during the past year at close to 8 per cent against a 3 per cent decline in beer, and Taunton's brands were well placed at the premium end of the market. Greene King, the East-Anglian based brewer, is expected to report full-year profits little changed at Pounds 20.3m on Thursday. Growth in the free trade is believed to have slowed, and though the company's managed pubs have performed well, beer sales are down in the tenanted houses. Howden Group, the Glasgow-based engineering company, is expected on Wednesday to report flat annual profits of about Pounds 18m, after being adversely affected by exchange rate movements. Wednesday brings annual results from Budgens, the small UK food retailing chain in which Rewe, one of Germany's largest food retailers, bought a 26 per cent stake in April. Budgens is expected to have increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.5m to between Pounds 6.5m and Pounds 7m and to resume paying a dividend. Interest will focus on the Germans' intentions towards the group, which management is trying to reshape.</p>

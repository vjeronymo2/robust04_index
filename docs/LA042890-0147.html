			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> DANNEMEYER LETTER 'ABSURD,' GATES SAYS  </P> <P> When Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) protested to Los Angeles Police  Chief Daryl F. Gates last week about "absurd" police tactics in arresting  abortion protesters at a clinic, his letter was a fusillade of anger.  </P> <P> He accused Gates' officers of being "repeat offenders" in the use of "Bull  Connor" techniques to arrest nonviolent protesters.  </P> <P> The congressman accused Gates of playing favorites by using less aggressive  police tactics when the protesters were "the Hollywood Dog-and-Pony show (Jane  Fonda, Martin Sheen, et al)."  </P> <P> Dannemeyer also threatened to see to it that Los Angeles loses federal  community development grants over it.  </P> <P> Friday, Gates fired off his own volley of insults to Dannemeyer.  </P> <P> "Your letter . . . is so absurd that I almost decided not to answer it," Gates  began. The police chief went on to call the congressman's letter "an outrageous  diatribe, coming from a member of Congress."  </P> <P> Gates added that he knew about the federal law that can cause some cities to  lose federal funds if police are found guilty of mistreating abortion  protesters.  </P> <P> "I am well aware of the extortionary law that you and others like you put into  effect. . . ," Gates wrote. "You can investigate until hell freezes over and  you will find nothing in the actions of the Los Angeles Police Department that  would prevent Title II funds from coming to this community."  </P> <P> Nearly 250 people were arrested April 14 after anti-abortion protesters  descended on a mid-Wilshire clinic. More than 300 police officers controlled  the crowd and made arrests. Some of the protest leaders complained about police  brutality.  </P> <P> Dannemeyer suggested in his letter that if Gates' did not straighten up his  department, "the voters of Los Angeles will treat you like a batter at Dodger  Stadium and say 'Three strikes, you're out.' "  </P> <P> But Gates had him on that one.  </P> <P> "Unlike a congressman who sputters, blusters, threatens, and writes highly  inappropriate letters, I am not elected," Gates wrote. "I am just one of those  dumb bureaucrats who has had more strikes thrown at him than most. . . . I am  still not out, and your stupid letter will not drive me out. And unlike you, I  have a duty to all the people and not just one special interest fringe group."  </P> <P> Both Gates and Dannemeyer signed their letters: "Sincerely." JERRY HICKS  </P></p>

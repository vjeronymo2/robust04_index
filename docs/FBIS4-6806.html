			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] The daily MEDIA INDONESIA says the protests for  wage hikes in Medan that degenerated into rioting which was on  the verge of spreading elsewhere opened up a new dimension --  the extent to which policymakers and businessmen in the country  understand the meaning of welfare. According to MEDIA  INDONESIA, we have just implemented rules on minimum wages, but  our view of welfare remains very unclear and confusing because  the minimum wages are considered a maximum return.    The daily PELITA noted that some disturbing rumors were  circulating in Jakarta simultaneously. In this connection,  PELITA says the rumors about rioting in Jakarta should make us  realize the sensitivity of the matter, because it has exposed  other basic problems that should be resolved.    Meanwhile, the daily REPUBLIKA says the Jakarta rumors  pertained not only to rioting but also to a dollar rush.  According to REPUBLIKA, it would be disturbing if citizens were  provoked by various monetary rumors. Experience shows that a  public panic would lead to a negative monetary situation. Such  an unwarranted panic should be prevented. Of course, it will be  insufficent for the government to simply give a vague  clarification because this will again provoke citizens to be  speculative.</p>

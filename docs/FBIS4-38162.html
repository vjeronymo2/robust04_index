			<p>BFN     [Text] Senate President Ahmad al-Lawzi and Speaker of the  House of Representatives Tahir al-Masri today met separately at  the Parliament building with a visiting Yemeni parliamentary  delegation led by Deputy Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Kibsi. Details  in the following report by our parliamentary affairs  correspondent:    Mr. al-Lawzi told the Yemeni lawmakers that, led by His  Majesty King Husayn, Jordan has sought with all sincerity to  ensure a reconciliation that advanced peace and unity in Yemen  in the best interests of the country's people. Jordan, he  added, has carried and continues to carry the concerns and  causes of the Arab nation, particularly the Palestinian cause.  Al-Lawzi emphasized that His Majesty King Husayn is giving the  cause of Yemen top priority. He recalled the meeting held in  Amman by Yemen's leaders and representatives who signed the  accord document that has won widespread support throughout the  Arab world.    We have been deeply pained and distressed by the fact that  no  sooner had the Amman meeting ended than blood began to flow in  Yemen and dialogue and understanding gave way to war, he said.  The Senate speaker also recalled distressing events in  Palestine, the Gulf, Lebanon, Sudan, Somalia, and elsewhere.    For his part, Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Kibsi, the head of the  Yemeni delegation, emphasized that the Yemeni people understand  Jordan's stand on Yemen's unity. The delegation is visiting  Jordan to benefit from its rich experience in order to maintain  Yemen's unity, which is held by the country's people to be their  destiny. The war now raging in Yemen, he added, is not one  between north and south or between the General People's Congress  and the Socialist Party. It is a war pitting constitutional  legitimacy against a party that has defied this legitimacy, in  other words, a conflict between advocates of and deviationists  from national unity. Al-Kibsi said that by sponsoring the  accord document, which offered a political way out of potential  hostilities, Amman lit a candle of joy. He noted that all  Yemeni political forces showed up at the signing ceremony and  put their signatures to the document. Every Yemeni citizen --  from the far left to the far right -- appreciates that Amman is  anxious for Yemen to retain its unity, said al-Kibsi.    Al-Kibsi delivered a message from Mr. 'Abdallah al-Ahmar,  the  speaker of Yemen's House of Representatives, to Mr. al-Lawzi.    In his meeting with the Yemeni parliamentarians, al-Masri  emphasized that, led by His Majesty King Husayn, Jordan headed  the effort to heal the rift in Yemen. Our stance in Jordan  toward fraternal Yemen is known and has not changed, al-Masri  said. He said he hoped the hostilities and bloodletting would  halt so that Yemen may stay united in fulfillment of the will of  the country's people.    Al-Kibsi told al-Masri he appreciated and took pride in the  interest Jordan's king, government, and people have taken in  Yemen's unity since it was declared. He noted that as soon as  differences in Yemen emerged, Jordan and King Husayn moved to  smooth over these differences and then set up the meeting that  saw the signing of the accord document bearing the clear  fingerprints of Jordan.    Al-Kibsi handed Mr. al-Masri a message from Mr. al-Ahmar.</p>

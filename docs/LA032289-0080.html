			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: OFFICIAL SAYS IOC HOPES TO START RANDOM TESTS  </P> <P> The International Olympic Committee hopes to introduce random doping controls  in its bid to combat drug use in amateur sport, an IOC spokeswoman said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Michele Verdier, IOC director of information, also said that, despite  suggestions amateur sports bodies are losing the battle against drug use, the  IOC never will permit performance-enhancing substances to be legalized.  </P> <P> "Lifting the ban on drugs is absolutely not a consideration," she said. "We  need the absolute cooperation of everyone in sport for a program of random  doping control. We're looking at flying-squad labs and putting in more testing  labs.  </P> <P> "But that's a question of money and technology and in certain parts of the  world, we are facing some difficulties."  </P></p>

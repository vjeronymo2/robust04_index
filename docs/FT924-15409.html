			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Arts: Don Giovanni - Opera The latest English National Opera Don Giovanni delivers a great deal more than on paper it promised to. The cast, with newcomers to the Jonathan Miller production ranked alongside old hands, has not been schooled to impeccable vocal stylishness - only one singer, Glenn Winslade (an admirable and under-used tenor) as Ottavio, attains anything like the velvet-glove Mozart standard. The conductor, Andrew Greenwood, is lively, at times a bit brusque over rhythmic definition. The staging, now in the care of Francesca Joseph, goes well, in a rather obvious way; Miller's invention of a dark theatrical world, Goya-inspired and lit by flares of intellectual penetration, has been considerably diluted. But it is a performance of the opera freshly alert to the knots of relationship tied and untied during the opera's course. The leading septet is full of 'real people' - characters whose skins were (one feels) already fully inhabited before the curtain went up. Peter Coleman-Wright (the dashingly sardonic Giovanni) and Arwel Huw Morgan (the wrily witty Leporello), veterans of the previous revival, play to and with each other in excellently knowing fashion. Lesley Garrett's Zerlina, spunky, gullible and tender, is more adorable than ever, opposite the strong new Masetto of Christopher Purves. Most interestingly of all, the two female aristocrats are embodied and sung with unusual boldness and determination. Helen Field (Anna) and Linda McLeod (Elvira) both have appealing but at times unwieldy Mozart sopranos; the fact that both confront their difficulties rather than skating round them lends an edge of excitement to everything they sing. In the Coliseum, an unsuitably large theatre for Mozart, it is a rare and pleasurable event when Don Giovanni comes alive as vigorously it did on Thursday. In repertory at the Coliseum until November 5</p>

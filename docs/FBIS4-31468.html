			<p>BFN     [Text] Killarney, June 6 (CTK) -- "The Czech Republic is  trying to build up a competitive agriculture. Paradoxically,  this has been prevented by strong protectionist policy of the  European Union (EU) countries," Agriculture Minister Josef Lux  told the 19th FAO (U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation)  regional conference today.    Czech agricultural policy is striving for farmers'  competition in the world markets, but without the excessive  support by their economies, Lux stated. The Czech Republic will  participate in the main programmes the conference has defined:  international agricultural research, application of  environment-friendly technology, new patterns of food  consumption and changes in nutrition of the population, Lux  reported. On Tuesday [7 June] Lux will meet FAO Director General  Jacques Diouf.</p>

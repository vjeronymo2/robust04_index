			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (12): More than a beach party - Living and working LIVING and working in Bermuda is rather the reverse of the mythical ship-swallowing Bermuda triangle to which the island gives its name. Those who enter it do not sink without trace; instead they continually bump into one another. People talk of 'island fever' - a psychological, claustrophobia-like affliction of those who stay in the country for extended periods. It is, after all, just 21 miles long and a maximum of one mile wide, with less than 60,000 inhabitants. 'You see the same people all the time,' says one resident. 'It can get very tiring. It's like being part of a family, or on a boat in the middle of the water. You've got to be part of the crew.' 'You can hardly go to the toilet without someone knowing it; and most know how long you spent there too,' says Malcolm Williams, general manager-secretary of the Bermuda Monetary Authority. 'But it is not a bad place to be,' he adds, sweeping his hand to indicate the view of boats in the harbour behind the exclusive Yacht Club. For many expatriates, the situation may be relieved by business travel. For others, trips to Boston, New York and North Carolina to shop are common. Michael Blakely, managing director of World-Wide Shipping Managers, says: 'As long as you've got time away to look forward to, it's OK.' In spite of the close proximity of its residents, Bermuda remains racially segregated, with distinct areas dominated by blacks and others by whites. People in certain social circles may bump into each other all the time; but those in different groups rarely meet. The island has a good number of local attractions, including an arts festival each winter, several cinemas and a strong tradition of amateur dramatics. 'You could do karate in Czech here if you wanted,' says one resident. There is a zoo, aquarium and botanical gardens, as well as several museums. Much of this is sponsored by local business, perhaps often through a combination of philanthropy and fear that without voluntary contributions, the government may consider raising the necessary money through compulsory means. Ray Madeiros of accountants Cooper &amp; Lines says: 'We do not live in a cultural vacuum here. We can buy daily newspapers from overseas. We never feel totally isolated.' Bermuda's beaches offer potential for sun-bathers and swimmers. Many residents have boats and can sail to escape the crowded conditions onshore. Inland are eight golf courses and numerous tennis courts. The country's climate appears impressive on paper. But it becomes extremely humid in late summer and intense, short bursts of rain are not uncommon throughout the year. Most of the island is densly populated. Some of the houses may be luxurious, but even these generally have little garden space. And for expatriates coming in, the costs of renting and buying have rocketed. Coping with work permits can be problematic, with concerns for some as to whether they will be renewed. Even worse, spouses are not entitled to a work permit and are often unable to be employed. Travelling around can also be frustrating, since the island allows each family to use only a single car. Those coming from many parts of the world find driving on the left or negotiating roundabouts difficult and they are required to re-sit their driving test. A further frustration can be the extremely low speed limit. Bermudians claim to live in a tax-free existance. In fact, they pay a 'hospital levy' as a proportion of payroll expenses, as well as significant property taxes. Employers may also be often paying private medical health cover. These contributions may be relatively low, but the cost of living is also substantially raised through government levies on imports. Most expatriates seem content with the education system - both public and private - that can take their children as far as university entrance level for north America, although the schools no longer offer A-levels. Equally, the Edward VII hospital is well regarded. John Ellison of Conyers, Dill and Pearman, one of the country's largest law firms, says: 'In this kind of business you have opportunities for travel, talking to people all over the world: with the advantage that you don't have to wear silly suits, get stuck in traffic for two hours and get mugged on the way home.' Most executives highlight what is referred to as 'the usual boring list' to explain the ease of working in the country: an excellent infrastructure, good communications, a variety of courier companies, professional services such as lawyers, accountants and banks and a tightly-knit group of individuals with easy access to one another when decisions need to be made. But they are sensitive to suggestions that they take too great an advantage of the posting. Michael Drew of Schroders says: 'You get a lot of pressure. Because it's Bermuda, people get the idea that you sit on the beach all day with your gin and tonic. It's not like that. I have taken two Saturdays off in the past 10 years.' Michael Blakely adds: 'I hardly go to the beach although I have been here three years. Time seems to evaporate. To begin with you think you're on holiday. And other people come here and think that you are. But there are a lot more unpleasant places you could be.'</p>

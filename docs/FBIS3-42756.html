			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Statement by the Chairman of the National Security Council, </F> State President G. Ulmanis: "Statement by the National Security  Council"]    [Text] On January 10 of this year, during the process of  reclaiming Russian army properties in Riga, in the Vidzeme  Suburb, a sharp conflict arose between the Vidzeme Suburb  Council Chairman A. Rucs and two generals from the Russian North  Western Military Forces Group (NWMFG). At the time of the  conflict, A. Rucs ordered the municipal police representatives  to place both generals, one of which was the Deputy to the  Commander of the NWMFG, in handcuffs and transport them to the  Latvian-Russian border. Under guard, they were placed in a light  motor vehicle and taken in an undisclosed direction. At the same  time, Rucs gave the order to use firearms to repel any attempts,  even by security divisions of the Republic of Latvia, to free  the detainees. It was later learned that, under orders by A.  Rucs, also detained was the chauffeur and automobile of one of  the generals.    Commander Mayorov of the NWMFG reacted sharply against this  action. He personally contacted Latvian State President G.  Ulmanis, informing him of what had happened and warning that  --if the detained generals are not released, Russian army  operatives will become involved in the course of events.    At this same time, in the offices of the Latvian State  President, a regularly scheduled meeting of the Latvian National  Security Council was taking place, which was interrupted. All  state security structures were given the order to find and  release the detained generals. The matter was complicated by the  fact that A. Rucs did not wish to disclose the direction in  which the detainees were taken.    A. Rucs was summoned to the National Security Council (NSC)  meeting in order to provide an explanation of what had occurred.  At the State President's offices, A. Rucs did not wish to submit  to orders -- to turn over his personal firearms to the State  President's guard. Only after A. Rucs (according to his own  words) had conferred with Saeima Deputy R. Milbergs, did he turn  over two pistols to the President's adjutant.    Several times, A. Rucs, in the presence of Attorney General  J. Skrastins, stressed to the members of the NSC that his  actions were perfectly correct because "only in this manner --  from a position of power, is it possible to speak to Russia,  because it only recognizes power". A. Rucs performed all of the  described activities through the municipal police force,  inviting in the National Guard 13th battalion National Guards to  provide additional security.    Commander Mayorov of the NWMFG repeatedly turned to the  State  President. Today, in the name of the Russian government,  Russia's Extraordinary and Official Envoy to Latvia, A. Rannih,  presented a note and explained that, despite diplomatic  immunity, gun barrels were pointed at him on January 10 at 7:50  in the morning while he was on his way to the embassy as he  drove past the building at 9a. Nicgale Street.    Carrying out the NSC order, after several hours, it was  finally possible to locate and release the illegally detained  Russian army generals. Afterwards, Mayorov reported by telephone  that the detainees has suffered minor damage to their skin from  the handcuffs. Mayorov reported that Russia's President B.  Yeltsin had given the order to carry out energetic anti-actions,  and various relocated Russian armed forces divisions on the  Latvian border were already in full combat readiness, as well as  one military airforce division. To avoid any possible clashes,  President G. Ulmanis personally contacted the Russian State  President's Office by telephone.    This incident occurred as a result of the provocational  actions by Rucs, in which he overstepped his legally defined  authority. This could have resulted in a loss of lives. The  incident created by Rucs has undoubtedly harmed the prestige of  the state and has created international consequences, which may  be hard to predict. It has threatened the talks between Latvia  and Russia, which were supposed to resume today, as well as  possible higher level meetings.    Based on the aforementioned, we request that the Cabinet of  Ministers:    1) examine the facts of this matter;    2) relieve A. Rucs from the office he is holding;    3) carry out an official investigation of the National Guard  and municipal police;    4) prepare a response to Russia regarding these events;    5) define regulatory acts to regulate the procedure for  reclaiming Russian army property.    State President, National Security Council Chairman G.  Ulmanis. Riga, January 10, 1994.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOSEMITE FIRES  </P> <P> I am troubled by your coverage of the Yosemite-area fires ("Thousands More  Acres Blackened," Aug. 13). While I certainly sympathize with those who have  lost property, I would urge your writers and editors to realize that these  fires are not ecological disasters.  </P> <P> Fires have been happening for as long as there have been forests. Many species,  including the Sequoia redwoods, rely on regular fires to burn off other  competing foliage.  </P> <P> Ironically, man's success at putting out fires as soon as they start is  actually endangering the forests. Today, there ismuch more combustible material  on the forest floor than there would naturally be. This means that fires today  burn considerably hotter than they would if natural fires were allowed to run  their course.  </P> <P> I applaud The Times' coverage of ecological issues, and I urge you to educate  yourselves and your readers on this issue.  </P> <P> BOB ALTMAN  </P> <P> Hawaiian Gardens  </P></p>

Chinese sources in Beijing said yesterday the  power struggle among the Communist Party's factions had  intensified in anticipation of the absence of Mr Deng with a  campaign of innuendo against the senior leader's relatives and  his personal office.    The sources said Mr Deng, who left Shanghai for Beijing on  Saturday, was asked by his large team of medical specialists to  "take a good rest". They said even assuming that his health  picked up soon, it was unlikely the 89-year-old leader would  leave the capital again before spring. Sources in Guangdong  said the local leadership had not lost hope that the "patron of  the south" might still call on them.    Diplomats in Beijing said factions hostile to the patriarch,  including Maoists and ultra-liberal intellectuals, had started a  "campaign of innuendo" against Mr Deng's relatives and personal  office. "A widely circulated report in Beijing claims that some  of the patriarch's relatives are using Mr Deng's influence to  help their business interests--and that these relatives know  they must make the best use of the relatively short time that is  left," a diplomat said. "For example, a few of the facilities  that Mr Deng inspected recently are said to be related to these  business interests."    Another target of what has already been described as an  embryonic anti-Deng campaign is criticism of the "imperial  manners" of the patriarch's powerful personal office. In  theory, outside the party and government establishment the  office has tremendous clout because it controls the patriarch's  communications with the outside world. Criticism of the office  ranges from preventing certain types of in formation from  reaching Mr Deng to run-ins with local police and other  authorities over the kind of protection that should be accorded  the senior leader on the road.    Sources in Shanghai said Mr Deng's security guards had a  brief confrontation with a group of bus drivers last month,  partly caused by the "overzealousness" of his personal office.</p>

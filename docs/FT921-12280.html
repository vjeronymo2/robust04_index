			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: L&amp;G suffers sharp reductions in annual premium business LEGAL &amp; General, the life assurance group, yesterday announced substantial reductions in new regular premium life and pensions business during 1991. In common with trends for the industry, most of the Pounds 2.16bn taken in by L&amp;G last year was in single premium business. Using the industry's standard Equivalent Premium Income yardstick, which adds one tenth of new single premiums to the total of annual premiums for the year, worldwide business increased slightly from Pounds 327m to Pounds 332m. The UK's share rose from Pounds 256.3m to Pounds 262.3m. Annual premium business, affected by the recession with consumers reluctant to take on new commitments, fell from Pounds 210.5m to Pounds 170.1m in the UK, and from Pounds 266.5m to Pounds 225.1m worldwide. New business figures rose from Pounds 463m to Pounds 922m thanks to a strong increase in UK single premium business. Much of this came in one-off business from large pension funds. Mr David Prosser, chief executive, said: 'Legal &amp; General is not immune from current economic pressures. 'In particular, our regular annual premium business in the UK continues to be affected by a stagnant housing market - into which we sell our mortgage related policies - and a struggling business environment into which we sell out personal pension plans.' L&amp;G also said yesterday that it was going to reduce its exposure to claims from building and contents insurance by changes in its reinsurance programme, writes Richard Lapper. Following heavy losses in its non-life business from subsidence, theft and mortgage indemnity claims, Mr Prosser announced last year that L&amp;G wanted to cut back its involvement in more volatile general insurance business. The company is still negotiating its arrangements for 1992 with reinsurers but has already agreed a quota share proportional treaty to cede 40 per cent of its household property business. In proportional business insurers cede a share of their exposure for a proportional share of the premium receiving a reinsurance commission in exchange.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Tupolev airliner deal for Hunting HUNTING Aircraft, the UK aircraft support company, has been chosen by the Russian Aviastar aircraft manufacturing group to design and build the interiors for the new Tupolev TU-204 twin jet airliner. The UK group is also investing in a new Russian aircraft interiors company called Avinco, to be based at Aviastar's manufacturing complex in Ulyanovsk. The new Russian company will be owned by Aviastar, Hunting Aircraft and a subsidiary of Fleming Russia Investment Corporation. Modern interiors are regarded as essential to Aviastar's efforts to sell the TU-204 in the west. The new company would improve the TU-204's marketability and also produce and sell western certified interior products to the international market along with Russian certified products for the former Soviet market, said Mr Victor Mikhailov, Aviastar's director general. American Airlines yesterday withdrew an unfair competition complaint against Iberia Air Lines of Spain, AP-DJ reports from Forth Worth, Texas. The complaint, filed with the US Department of Transportation in February, alleged that Iberia and Air France were keeping American from selling its Sabre computer reservations system in Spain and France.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Francisco Gomez Maza] </F>   [Text] Division General Ramon Mota Sanchez, chairman of the  Chamber of Deputies Defense Commission, said arms trafficking in  the country "is nothing serious; it is a normal occurrence as it  is in all countries of the world. It is small-scale smuggling."    Mota downplayed the importance of weapons trafficking,  saying  he did not believe it was serious but, rather, just "something  normal, as it is in all countries of the world into which many  types of articles, such as food or clothing, are smuggled.  Weapons are also smuggled in, but this is something that has  always existed, and all countries take measures to try to stop  it." He said there have been no indicators leading one to  believe there has been some truly heavy weapons trafficking;  "there has been just the normal amount, the amount that has  always existed, the small-scale smuggling, as we call it."    Shortly before attending yesterday's meeting of the recently  created Consultative and Social Participation Commission of  Civil Protection at the Government Secretariat, the division  general, who is also a deputy, confirmed "the weapons smuggling  that exists (in the country) is on a small scale. It is the  common smuggling that exists in all countries that share  borders, and there is no need for alarm or anything." When  questioned on the front steps of the Government Secretariat at  approximately 1100, the following questions and answers ensued:    [EL FINANCIERO] Is the Chamber of Deputies Defense  Commission  conducting any investigation into the recent reports there is a  trafficking of large amounts of weapons?    [Mota] The commission has nothing to do with that. The  corresponding authorities are the ones who have presented the  reports, and they are probably conducting investigations, which  they do on a permanent basis.    [EL FINANCIERO] How serious is weapons trafficking?    [Mota] I do not believe it is serious. I believe it is  something normal, as it is in all countries of the world where  there is arms trafficking, and many types of articles, such as  food, clothing, and so forth, are smuggled in. Weapons are also  smuggled in, but this is something that has always existed, and  all countries take measures to try to stop it.    [EL FINANCIERO] Our society, then, should not be worried  about weapons trafficking?    [Mota] I do not believe so because the information (which  was  leaked about a possible heavy trafficking of weapons and which  authorities are investigating) is from February. From February  to the present, there has been no event, no indicator that would  lead one to believe there has been some truly heavy weapons  trafficking, just the normal amount, the amount that has always  existed, the small-scale smuggling, as we call it.    [EL FINANCIERO] Who generally engages in trafficking?    [Mota] All types of people who travel, especially, to the  United States and return with some type of weapon. This is why  I call it small scale.    [EL FINANCIERO] Do you have any statistics to report on arms  seizures?    [Mota] The Defense and Government Secretariats have just  published this report. I do not have the figures on hand, but  they are significant, especially those on drug trafficking.    The civil protection programs of the Government Secretariat,  which is headed by Government Under Secretary Socorro Diaz  Palacios, were analyzed at the meeting Mota attended.    People from various sectors that form part of the National  Council of Civil Protection also attended this meeting. The  objective of this council is to provide elements of analysis to  the Government Secretariat so that its civil protection  activities will reach more people.</p>

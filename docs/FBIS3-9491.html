			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Milan Kucan by Robert Hochner in </F> the ORF studio in Vienna -- recorded; Kucan speaks in Slovene  with superimposed German translation]    [Text] [Hochner] Good evening, Mr. President.    [Kucan] Good evening.    [Hochner] Mr. President, only 40 km south of your country a  war is still going on, even though now there appear to be signs  of a peaceful solution for Bosnia. How optimistic are you that  what now looks like the beginning of a peace settlement will  bring real peace to Bosnia?    [Kucan] We have to be optimists. What is currently going on  is still a consequence of the exhaustion caused by this  senseless war and of the world's bad conscience as a result of  its inadequate commitment. This should have happened long ago.  The fact remains that the solution to this crisis now involves  Brussels, Washington, and Zagreb, on the one hand, and Moscow  and Belgrade, on the other. These are now, finally, the proper  partners, who may be able to influence the course of the war,  and who may achieve the pacification of the area and turn war  into peace. However, this is far from being the solution to the  crisis in the Balkans.    [Hochner] You have come to Austria to ask for Austrian  support for Slovenia's ambition to join the European Union [EU].  From where does Slovenia's desire arise? Is it participation  in Europe's economic market or do security issues constitute a  decisive factor?    [Kucan] Slovenia's desire to be included in the process of  European integration is understandable and is related to the  desire of all former East bloc countries. It pertains not only  to economic issues but also to political issues and matters of  security policy, particularly as a result of the fact that you  mentioned at the beginning, namely that the war is still raging  only 40 km away from Slovenia. Still, we are interested in  getting closer to the EU primarily to achieve democratization of  relations within Slovenia, and to achieve the consolidation of  democratic institutions, also as far as relations between the  civilian state and the defense and military complex are  concerned.    [Hochner] The biggest political problem between Slovenia and  Austria, or rather the biggest problem in terms of economic  policy, is Slovenia's huge trade balance deficit with Austria.  In case Austria joins the EU do you expect that this would also  improve Slovenia's access to the Austrian market, and do you not  fear that, as a EU member, Austria would insulate itself more  strongly against Slovenia?    [Kucan] The trade balance deficit is indeed a major problem.  The two sides, especially the two governments, are determined to  solve this problem because it has reached a political dimension.  In December, Prime Minister Drnovsek paid a visit to Vienna and  the issue was discussed at great length. Nevertheless, there  are differing approaches to solving the problem, there are  several possibilities. Should Austria become a EU member on 1  January 1995, the solution would be of a certain kind, and if it  does not, then it might also make sense to discuss a free trade  agreement.    [Hochner] Looking at the difficulties within the EU in  connection with the enlargement by Austria and the three other  membership candidates, when do you expect the EU to be ready to  enlarge the community by countries in eastern and southeastern  Europe, notably Slovenia?    [Kucan] It is a question of interest and of clearer views on  what the future of Europe should look like. The more the EU  enlarges, the more intense internal relations will become. Any  enlargement also means a higher level of integration, which in  turn means that antagonistic positions on principles will  deteriorate, namely the principle of consensus as the basic  principle within the EU, and on the other hand, the principle of  efficiency. After all, if a union is not efficient its very  existence does not make sense. Still, in a democratic community  such antagonisms are not irreconcilable, but it is difficult to  solve such problems. I think that at the moment these  quandaries are occurring with Austria [words indistinct]  London-Vienna -- which only proves that enlargement and  integration will be very difficult.    [Hochner] Thank you very much for the interview, Mr.  President.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 38 (528) by </F> diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] President Mircea Snegur has said he will take all  measures so that the forthcoming parliamentary elections  February 27 pass democratically with the entire republic's  population taking part. At the meeting in Chisinau Wednesday  with the U.S. Ambassador Mary Pendleton he said that only a  competent and constructive parliament may further develop the  process of reforms, whose success will elevate the living  standards of the population.    A spokesman for the president has told Interfax that the  head  of state voiced confidence that the problem of Transdniester  could be solved if the region is granted the special legal  status. Snegur said that President Yeltsin had said about the  preparedness to be a mediator at the talks to settle the  conflict on the basis of recommendations by the CSCE standing  mission.    Snegur has confirmed his intention to propose to the new  parliament bills on granting a special status for the region of  the left bank of the Dniester and for that densely populated by  the Gagauz people.    Less than one thousand Transdniestrians took part since the  beginning of the week in the parliamentary elections in Moldova.  According to Snegur's decree, inhabitants of the Transdniestrian  Republic are allowed to vote on February 21-27 at the polling  stations on the right bank of the Dniester.    A spokesman for the Central Election Commission has told  Interfax, the authorities of the Transdniestrian Republic put no  serious obstacles to the people living on the left bank. The  Central Election Commission explains the low activeness of  voters by the shortage of transport for carrying people from the  left to the right bank, as well as by the fact there is still  time for taking part in the voting.</p>

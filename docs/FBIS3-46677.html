			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, December 31 (KCNA) -- The confirmation of  the 5,000 years long history of the Korean nation and its father  through the unearthing of the Tomb of Tangun is a marvelous  event that brilliantly adorned the first page of the nation's  history which had long remained a blanket, says NODONG SINMUN in  a by-lined article.    The article continues:    It was proved again that the Korean people with Tangun as  their father are a homogeneous nation proud of having lived with  the same blood, the same language and same cultural tradition  for 5,000 years. This has further hardened the will of the  fellow countrymen to put an end to the division of the country  at an early date and live as the same nation in a unified  country and also brightened the prospect of national  reunification.    Only when all the Koreans in the North, South and overseas  achieve great unity of the whole nation, irrespective of their  ideology, idea, political view and religious belief, can our  nation establish a unified state and live a harmonious life as  it did before.    The situation prevailing in Korea raises to the fellow  countrymen serious issues -- whether they will prolong the  national division forced by outside forces and antagonize and  confront with each other to fall a prey to outside forces or  unite with each other to defend the dignity of the nation and  pave the way of national reunification.    Under no circumstances we can make a choice to invite self-  destruction through a fratricidal war and allow outside forces  to profit therefrom.    It is the only choice for our nation to reunify the country  with great national unity. And it is also the only way for  coprosperity of the North and the South as the same nation.    The pride of the homogeneous nation that has been maintained  for 5,000 years with Tangun as its father and the common desire  of the nation for reunification -- this is a source for uniting  the whole nation closely on the road of national reunification.    It is the unshakable will of the fellow countrymen that if  they achieve great unity of the whole nation with the pride of  the homogeneous nation, they would be quite able to repulse  aggression and interference by outside forces, smash pressure by  big powers and win national reunification in the '90s.    All the Koreans in the North, South and overseas will  reunify  the country through the establishment of a pan-national unified  state, independent, peaceful and neutral, in the '90s, closely  rallied under the banner of the 10-point programme of the great  unity of the whole nation with the pride of the homogeneous  nation, thus adding shine to the 5,000 years long history of  Tangun Korea.</p>

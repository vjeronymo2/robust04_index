			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Business and the Environment: Sweet source of power - Sugar cane is being used for energy in Sao Paulo says Patrick McCurry Electricity produced on vast sugar cane plantations in the countryside of Sao Paulo, Brazil's wealthiest and most industrialised state, could help relieve a predicted energy shortage. Distilleries of fuel alcohol made from sugar have been generating their own energy for years by burning the crushed cane in large boilers which produce steam to power electricity turbines. Today an increasing number are seeking to sell their surplus energy to Brazil's electricity grid. The state of Sao Paulo produces more than half Brazil's harvest of around 220m tonnes of sugar cane. Most of the cane is used to produce fuel alcohol for cars under a government alternative energy programme launched in the 1970s. In recent years distilleries have been selling small amounts of excess energy to distributors, or 'co-generating', and during this year's harvest distilleries have begun selling energy to a distributor through long-term contracts. Companhia Paulista de Forca e Luz, which operates in the interior of Sao Paulo state, has been the pioneering distributor in co-generation. Eduardo Goncalves, CPFL chairman, says that an advantage of sugar cane energy is that the harvest - May to November - occurs when rivers, and Sao Paulo's hydroelectric capacity, are at their lowest. The state generates 60 per cent of its needs from hydro power and imports 40 per cent. But Sao Paulo faces increasing energy problems because there is less potential for increasing hydroelectric capacity. Nelson Garcez, a state energy official, believes the state will have to import 70 per cent of its needs within 15 years unless non-hydro energy sources are developed. Goncalves says that while the co-generation programme is relatively small it has important potential: 'There is a lot of talk about using bio-mass for energy in Brazil, but this is the first major project under way.' Two leading alcohol distilleries began supplying energy earlier this year to CPFL under 10-year contracts. A further eight have signed one-year contracts. One of the long-term contracts is with Vale do Rosario distillery, which crushes 18,000 tonnes of cane a day during the harvest. It supplies the distributor with a capacity of 4MW, enough to power a small shopping centre. Cicero Junqueira Franco, director of the distillery, says he intends to increase generating capacity by installing higher-pressure boilers and more sophisticated turbines. To increase capacity by 5MW would cost around Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.4m). But one obstacle to further development, he says, is uncertainty about the government's pricing policy. A government-linked organisation regulates the prices that distributors such as CPFL can pay for their electricity. The price for this year was Dollars 41 per megawatt hour - low by international standards, but enough to persuade the two distilleries to sign up long-term. After transport costs CPFL is paying virtually the same price to sugar distilleries as to import electricity from the huge Itaipu hydro plant on the Brazil- Paraguay border, although energy from the state's hydro plants is currently about 25 per cent cheaper. That price, however, is likely to increase because new hydro plants are in more remote - and therefore costly - locations. Many believe the trend in Brazil will move towards more flexibility on pricing, which could stimulate co-generation. Ademar Balbo, director of Galo Bravo distillery, says he hopes to negotiate a supply contract with CPFL after investing Dollars lm in a more powerful generator. This will increase the distillery's capacity to 9MW from 6MW, leaving a surplus of 3MW. 'The prices that are being paid by the distributor are not that good at the moment but it is a long-term investment. Brazil is growing and energy prices are likely to go up,' he says.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres told the Knesset  Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee today that Israel would  not withdraw from its security positions and would honor its  commitment not to uproot Jewish settlements within the framework  of the interim arrangement. Tamar Asalem reports from the  Knesset:    Israel will honor the agreements reached in Cairo in the  spirit of the Declaration of Principles, Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres said upon leaving the Knesset Foreign Affairs and  Defense Committee. The committee was interrupted twice because  of telephone calls from 'Arafat's political adviser Nabil Sha'th.    [Begin Peres recording] Mr. Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] and I  informed everybody about the agreements we reached in Cairo. We  stand by them. A person's word has to be honored. A debate is  legitimate until agreement is reached. After that, agreements  must be honored. [end recording]    [Later in the newsreel, Mr. Peres, after talking with  Sha'th,  said "`the conditions are not yet ripe for renewing the Taba  talks.' The two exchanged several more faxes, but the dispute  between the two sides has not yet been resolved. Peres told the  Knesset committee that Israel is demanding from the PLO that  there be no deviations from the Cairo agreements in future  negotiations."]    On the security of the settlements and the border crossings,  the foreign minister explained that there is no room for  compromise.    [Begin Peres recording] We are not asking for new  agreements. We are trying to understand how the Palestinians  feel, yet we insist on Israel's security. [end recording]    Responding to a question on Kibbutz Netzarim, Mr. Peres said  there might be a need to revise security costs for the isolated  settlement. He said Netzarim would not constitute part of the  negotiations with the Palestinians, but would be brought up in  an internal debate. We might have to ask ourselves about  resources and the size of the settlement, but I would not like  such a debate to be held in the shadow of the negotiations,  Peres added.    The foreign minister also referred to the upcoming  Clinton-al-Asad summit and said that despite the high  expectations in the United States, his expectations were sober.  Severing links between Syria and the terrorist organizations  would be a central issue in the negotiations with them, Peres  said.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNIONS SAY THEY MAY TRY TO BUY JUST PART OF UAL;  </P> <P> AIRLINES: THE LEADER OF THE BUYOUT EFFORT SAYS A NEW OFFER IS BEING PUT  TOGETHER -- AND IT MAY INVOLVE LESS THAN 100% OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK. THAT  OPTION WOULD CUT THE PURCHASE PRICE.  </P> <P> The unions at United Airlines might not try to buy all of UAL Corp., the leader  of the buyout effort said at a weekend gathering of union members.  </P> <P> Gerald Greenwald, the former Chrysler vice chairman hired by United's unions,  said the unions are revising their offer for parent UAL Corp., and it isn't  clear what shape it will take. "It is possible we could leave some (UAL stock)  with public shareholders," he said.  </P> <P> It was the first indication that the unions, whose members include the pilots,  mechanics and flight attendants, might not try to buy the entire airline. A  decision to buy only a portion of UAL's shares would reduce the cost of the  transaction.  </P> <P> Greenwald made his comments during a brief interview at a picnic Saturday that  was organized by United's San Francisco-area union employees. It was his first  interview since the unions began work on a revised $3.9-billion offer in recent  weeks.  </P> <P> The unions face an Oct. 9 deadline to present a fully financed bid to UAL's  directors. They have given 23 banks until Oct. 3 to decide whether they will  provide $2 billion in financing.  </P> <P> Between Oct. 3 and Oct. 9, Greenwald said, the unions will negotiate financial  support "from others (that) are not banks." Greenwald wouldn't identify the  other potential participants. But it is known that the unions have sought  support from aircraft and engine manufacturers, such as Boeing, Airbus  Industrie and General Electric.  </P> <P> Greenwald said it is possible that the unions might contribute up to $200  million in equity in return for special preferred stock. He said most of that  money would come from the pilots' retirement account, but that other employees  would be invited to contribute. A previous union offer included wage  concessions but no equity contributions from employees.  </P> <P> Even if the unions do get enough money for their revised $175- to $180-a-share  offer, it isn't clear whether UAL's board will accept it. When the board  accepted a $201-a-share offer from the unions five months ago, it indicated  that it would not accept a lower price.  </P> <P> Greenwald said the board would leave the airline open to corporate raiders if  it turns down the union's offer. One previous bidder for the airline, Los  Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis, recently expressed renewed interest in it.  </P> <P> A rejection would also frustrate United's unions, he said. The unions have open  contracts, and before the buyout effort, the flight attendants voted to strike  if mediation failed.  </P> <P> "I am confident that we will have an offer they (UAL directors) can say yes  to," Greenwald said.  </P> <P> Greenwald declined to discuss terms of the new offer, but other sources have  indicated that the revised bid includes $150 a share in cash.  </P> <P> The unions were forced to lower their offer after the crisis in the Persian  Gulf made it impossible to finance the $201-a-share offer. Greenwald said  Iraq's invasion of Kuwait forced the unions to revise their five-year economic  forecast for United, taking higher fuel prices into account.  </P> <P> The projections show that United can meet its obligations if oil prices go as  high as $37 a barrel, Greenwald said, adding he did not expect them to go that  high.  </P> <P> That projection, however, is optimistic compared to other forecasts. On Friday,  the World Bank said a Mideast war could send oil prices soaring to $65 a barrel  this year, and that they might remain somewhere between $30 and $40 a barrel  during the next five years.  </P></p>

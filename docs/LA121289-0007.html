			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHILIPPINE COUP ATTEMPT  </P> <P> What prompts me to write is my support of the democratic system of government  in the Philippines.  </P> <P> The attempted military coup in the Philippines will soon turn in a mangled mess  of issues. I am afraid that many will miss the central issue, and it is this:  The rebellion against the Philippine government is an act against the  democratic system of government.  </P> <P> In 1986 the Filipino people dramatically and at grave risk to their lives chose  Aquino to be president. They got rid of the Marcos dictatorship and reinstated  democracy in the Philippines. It is, therefore, not right for these rebels to  subvert the will of the Filipino people. If the people are dissatisfied with  the current government, let them speak; let them decide. There are venues for  change; there is a peaceful system for change.  </P> <P> Bloody rebellions should not be the vehicle for change.  </P> <P> CECILIA MANGUERRA  </P> <P> BRAINARD  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

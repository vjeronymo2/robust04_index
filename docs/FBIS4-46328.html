The new suspect was arrested upon arriving Hat Yai Airport.  Police refused to identify the suspect and would not allow the  press to cover the arrest.    Meanwhile Bangkok police chief Pol Lt Gen Chaisit  Kanchanakit  said the other Iranian, who was charged on Friday in connection  with the conspiracy had sneaked back into Thailand because he  was involved with a Thai woman.    But informed sources said police had not ruled the  possibility that Hossein Shahriarifar, 26, returned to Thailand  for a second sabotage attempt.    Chaisit said the suspect was "too complacent and thought  that  Thai authorities had given up their attempts to catch him".    Far was arrested on Friday night at the Inthra Hotel in  Songkhla's Hat Yai district.    The sources also said they believed those involved in the  plot still had a supply of C-4 plastic explosive hidden some  where in Thailand and believed to be in the possession of a Thai  woman.    Police have summoned more than 40 witnesses for questioning.  They have finished interviews with 10 of them, according to the  sources, who said investigators had been ordered to wrap up  their inquiries in seven days.    The sources added that police had reliable evidence  indicating that the plot was directed at the Israeli Embassy.  The evidence includes a bag that is the same as those  distributed at a Palestinian training camp.    Two other Iranians taken into custody during the same raid  in  Hat Yai are being held for questioning.    Shahriarifar is scheduled to appear in South Bangkok  District  Court on June 9.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Companies run the rule over regulator: Alison Smith reports on the cautious reaction by the financial services sector to the Personal Investment Authority Less than a week after the publication of detailed plans for the new retail financial services regulator, the first completed application forms have already landed. TSB Group, the UK's sixth-largest bank, has expressed its intention to join, and Standard Life has said that it is likely to do so in spite of its preference for a full-blown statutory system of regulation. But in spite of such encouraging signs there has been no concerted rush by independent financial advisers, life insurance companies, banks and building societies to stand up and be counted as friends of the Personal Investment Authority. Indeed, the call from Mr George Greener, chairman of Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, two of the UK's largest insurance companies, for a period of consultation, suggests that he thinks many in the financial services sector are uneasy about the proposals. Mr Joe Palmer, PIA chairman, insists that reaction has been more positive than merely grudging acceptance. 'People have been reassured to some extent by what they've seen in the prospectus,' he says. He acknowledges, however, that he cannot expect instant enthusiasm. 'These are very important decisions. People will need to study the documentation and then take the decision to their board. It's not a matter for an off-the-cuff reaction.' Many in the financial services industry would agree. There has been no word yet from Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer. Legal &amp; General, another leading life company, has made it clear it will not put its head above the parapet. Mr Michael Doerr, chief executive of Friends Provident, says he is disappointed with what he has seen in the prospectus so far although he has not ruled out the possibility of his company applying. The question will not go before the board until its meeting at the end of the month. Mr Palmer agrees that the prospectus can set out only aims and methods, and cannot provide conclusive evidence of how the PIA will operate. He says: 'The most important early test will be the effectiveness of the admission process.' However, the PIA has set no clearly defined targets for how many of the potential membership of 6,000 firms the organisation believes should fail because they do not meet the higher standards it intends to set. The development of training and competence standards in 1995 will be a further sign of its own effectiveness. In the meantime 'there's the kind of relationship we have with the industry, and disciplinary and other decisions coming through'. At this hesitant time, Mr Greener's proposal could act as a catalyst in crystallising the concerns expressed by some in the industry. These have focused on vagueness about how the PIA's committees will work and how they will be formed, and disquiet that the extra cost of the new regulator may not be reflected in higher standards. Mr Greener suggests that the PIA should be made up of a 12-strong board of public-interest directors, supervising an executive committee of 10 people working in the industry 'who know the nuts and bolts of the selling process'. As a designated agency under the financial services legislation, it would be scrutinised directly by parliament which would make recommendations to the government on how it should act. In drawing up plans on training and competence, the PIA would look not only at what knowledge sales agents or advisers had of the subject and their products, but their application of that knowledge in advice. While there is some support for Mr Greener's blueprint, it appears no more likely than the existing PIA prospectus to achieve a consensus support in a sector where incompatible views about regulation are strongly held. Only an immediate deadline seems capable of reconciling them.</p>

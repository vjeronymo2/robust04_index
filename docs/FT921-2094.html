			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / US exports fall for third month in a row US EXPORTS fell in January for the third month in a row, while last year foreign direct investment in the US fell to the lowest level since 1985, according to US Commerce Department figures. Exports, as one of the brighter spots in the US economy, have been billed by Bush Administration officials as 'an engine of growth' out of recession. But recession and slowdown overseas have begun to take their toll. In January exports fell to an estimated Dollars 35.5bn, down from Dollars 35.9bn in December and Dollars 36.9bn in November. The slowdown hit exports of manufactured goods, off by Dollars 0.3bn from December, while exports of advanced technology fell from Dollars 9bn to Dollars 8bn. On the plus side, the US trade deficit narrowed by 3.9 per cent to Dollars 5.8bn, the result of cheaper oil and weakened demand for imports. Imports shrank by 1.4 per cent from December levels to Dollars 41.3bn. Last year's fall in foreign direct investment into the US to Dollars 22.2bn contrasted sharply with the rates in 1988, when US assets were seen as a prime buy. Investment rose in 1988 and 1989 by Dollars 59.4bn and Dollars 70.6bn, respectively. But investors have had little to show for their US bargains. Last year total earnings amounted to only Dollars 361m, according to the Organisation for International Investment in Washington. The Commerce Department estimates that from 1983 to 1990, the rate of return on foreign direct investment in the US, based on market value, came to only 2.6 per cent. Most dramatic in the downturn was the fall-off in Japanese investment to Dollars 4.3bn last year, a decline from the Dollars 17.3bn annual average of 1988-90. The UK, the largest foreign investor in the US, added another Dollars 8.6bn last year. This represents a slowdown from previous years, however. Between 1987 and 1989 UK investments averaged Dollars 21.7bn.</p>

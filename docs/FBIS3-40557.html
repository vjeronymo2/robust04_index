			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Robin Raphael's Visit and Pakistan's Principled </F> Stand"]    [Text] The specific situation under which Ms. Robin  Raphael, the U. S. assistant secretary for South Asian affairs,  has visited Pakistan include such important points as political  and economic restrictions, the sensitive situation of the  Kashmir issue, Pakistan's role in it, nuclear policy, and  China's supply of missiles to Pakistan. All of these were  included to give the impression that newly elected government  under the leadership of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto will be  able to take care of this pressure. It was also hinted that the  present tension between the United States and Pakistan may not  end. By the end of the U. S. assistant secretary's trip, and  until her last speech, many incidents surfaced; however, Prime  Minister Benazir Bhutto demonstrated a high level of political  savvy and did not compromise our national interests and policies  in any agreements. Instead, she presented the interests of the  people of Pakistan in a better light. One proof of this is the  request to review the Pressler Amendment and reinstate economic  and military aid to Pakistan.    It is a fact that the United States has always considered  Kashmir a contested issue. However, in the present situation,  the way it has mentioned it openly and has hinted about  negotiations between India and Pakistan, as well as hinting to  Pakistan that it review its peaceful nuclear program, the United  States will not only resolve the Kashmir issue, but will also  create a positive atmosphere for reinstating economic and  military aid. The United States will also give political support  at the international level. In this context, the United States  has declared the presence of nuclear weapons in this region a  danger to world peace. It was also announced that if Pakistan  stopped its nuclear program, the United States would then also  pressure India to do so. The fact is that this strategy is being  used just to make Pakistan stop its peaceful nuclear program,  because India is not willing to review its nuclear program at  all. It has not accepted any restrictions or expressed any  willingness to sign an international pact. The whole world knows  that India's nuclear power is far ahead of Pakistan's peaceful  atomic program. India is working continuously for its military  use, and it also has a large number of atomic bombs. In  contrast, Pakistan wants to use its program just to alleviate  its energy problem. However, international propaganda is against  it. A specific international lobby is propagating that  Pakistan's program is for military goals, even though the  Pakistani government has denied it repeatedly. It has declared  its intention to participate in any agreement for establishing  peace in the subcontinent in which India is also involved. In  this context, Pakistan has also hinted at its willingness to  sign the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty]; however, India has  opposed such an agreement because of its malicious designs. It  does not support any plan that could result in peace in this  region.    The recent visit by the U. S. assistant secretary was part  of  the effort to pressure Pakistan again; however, Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto refused to accept any pressure in this context.  She instead welcomed any concrete efforts to stop nuclear  proliferation in south Asia. This was also reflected in the U.  S. assistant secretary's statement, in which she clearly said,  "Pakistan has presented its stand about its national security,  which will not change until India changes its attitude."    The Pakistan People's Party's [PPP] president and Pakistan's  prime minister have always taken a principled stand, according  to patriotic feelings. The U. S. assistant secretary expressed  her feelings in her statement. However, it is unfortunate that  our opposition leader, who, until yesterday, talked about a  third option for Kashmir, hinted about rolling back the nuclear  program, and has opposed the idea of negotiations with India, is  talking about starting a "campaign" over the Kashmir issue and  the nuclear program. This is a character flaw, and the people  see and understand everything. A decision about it will be made  in the people's court in the future. The fact is that the PPP  and its leader, Madam Benazir Bhutto, have never made a decision  that has been detrimental to national security, and they never  will.</p>

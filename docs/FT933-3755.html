			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Back from abroad . . . I AM A British civil servant who returned recently from a two-year secondment overseas where I paid no UK tax or national insurance. Should I now consider paying voluntary NI contributions for the period of my absence, and what is this likely to cost? I had been paying class 1 national insurance contributions for about eight years before my work overseas, and shall soon resume paying class 1 contributions for the foreseeable future. I am 32 years old. As you are now back working in the UK and covered by the state social security system, your prime concern is to ascertain how a two-year gap in the national insurance contribution record could potentially reduce your ultimate state flat-rate pension. If you have paid contributions from the first time you were employed in the UK, and have not had any other gaps overseas, it is possible that a two-year gap in your contribution record either will have no effect or one that is so minimal that you can ignore it. Write (quoting your national insurance number) to the Department of Social Security, Overseas Branch, Longbenton, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England NE98 1YX. It will be able to confirm the number of years credited to your contribution record and the number of prospective years left. If you ask, it will provide you with a table showing the number of years' credit that you will require to obtain full benefits and the scaling down effect of any shortfall. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

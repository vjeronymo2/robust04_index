			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Political Notebook: Mr Major's double-edged sword MR John Major cannot yet be sure whether next week's Edinburgh summit will turn out to be a triumph or a disaster. Those in Whitehall prepared to quote odds on a successful outcome suggest that they stand at present at slightly worse than 50-50. That may be deliberately over-cautious. It is in Britain's interests to play down expectations; its partners meanwhile are not ready to reveal their full hands. The prime minister's tour of European capitals is judged by his officials to have been a 'moderate success'. But, as at Maastricht a year ago, the most important bargains can be struck only by heads of government. Mr Major's principal hope for success rests on an assumption that has nothing to do with the detailed agenda: that his European colleagues will conclude they cannot afford to fail. Ratification of Maastricht has acted a lightning conductor for popular disenchantment with the Community. With the economic outlook ever more depressing, a row at Edinburgh would reinforce the perception of the treaty as an indulgent irrelevance. There is a practical dimension to the warning. It is being applied by the British presidency as a none-too-subtle form of blackmail. The financial markets, the argument runs, remain nervous and volatile - witness the latest bout of speculation against the French franc. The speculators are unconvinced still that central banks can hold the line within the European exchange rate mechanism. What chance would the ERM have if European leaders were seen to be incapable of agreement on the Community's future? It is a powerful argument - one that Britain believes has particular resonance in Paris, Madrid, Lisbon and Dublin. It is also a two-edged sword. Mr Major more than any other leader at Edinburgh needs a political success. If Europe is judged to have failed, then Britain will bear much of the oppropbrium. The list of issues that must be resolved is formidable. As of yesterday, the presidency could cite a dozen items that one government or another insists should be on the agenda. Alongside the core internal issues - future financing, Denmark, enlargement, the single market, subsidiarity and the economy - are a range of smaller but potentially obstructive items. Germany, for example, wants more seats in the European parliament. It is also determined that the heads of government address seriously the issue of nuclear safety in the former Communist bloc. Macedonia is demanding recognition by the Community. Greece is threatening a walk-out if it is given. All the summit leaders recognise they must be seen to be responding to the unfolding human tragedy in Bosnia. A crowded and complex agenda has obvious drawbacks. Deadlock on one issue could hold up agreement on everything else. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, for example, has indicated that the price of a deal with Denmark is a future financing accord with lots of what British officials refer to disparagingly as Spaingeld for Madrid. The eventual outcome may well depend on how obstinate Mr Gonzalez is prepared to be. Those two issues - the budget and exemptions to allow a second Maastricht referendum in Denmark - are judged by the presidency to be the key to success. Without an agreement on both, Edinburgh will be judged a failure. The links offer advantages as well as drawbacks. They provide the scope for trade-offs: compromise on one issue can buy a government concessions on another. It is a form of negotiation at which Mr Major, a master of detail, excels. There are more hopeful signs than the public rhetoric suggests. France has indicated privately that if Mr Major does not indulge in self-congratulation it will not provoke a row at Edinburgh on the EC-US farm trade deal. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has told the prime minister that he will do his best to ensure the summit is a success. British officials are confident that disagreement over the scale of any economic recovery package can be finessed by skilful drafting. The southern states have rejected out of hand as miserly the budget compromise proferred by Mr Major. Germany and the Netherlands insist it is too generous. The presidency sees scope for technical adjustments in the resources formula that might yet bring the two sides closer together. British officials hope also their compromise position on Denmark will meet Copenhagen's concerns while respecting the determination of others not to reopen the treaty. It suggests a range of instruments to give Denmark the opt-outs it seeks. It might all yet unravel. European leaders have been known before to prefer stubbornness to self-interest. Mr Major, however, will devote every ounce of his energy to ensuring that they do not make that mistake again. He has as much to lose personally as does the Community collectively.</p>

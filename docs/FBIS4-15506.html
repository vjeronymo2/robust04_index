			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia has granted Turkey's request to bring the  annual volume of natural gas supplies up to 10.5 billion cubic  meters by 1998. 2.5 billion cubic meters of this volume are to  be used by the heat-and-power plant to be built in Turkey under  Russian project. In addition, the two sides began to consider a  project for building Turkey's first nuclear-power plant with  Russia's direct participation. This might involve equipment  supplies worth hundreds of millions of dollars.    These and other issues concerning business cooperation  between Russia and Turkey were discussed in detail at the  session held on Tuesday and Wednesday in Moscow by the joint  intergovernmental commission on trade and economic cooperation.  The session was chaired by Russia's Minister for external  economic relations, Oleg Davydov, and by the Turkish Minister  for construction and population centers, Onur Kumbaracibasi.    The Turkish minister informed participants in the session of  his country's willingness to increase the worth of its requests  for the purchases of special property in Russia to 600 million  dollars. However this can happen only if Russia agrees to supply  Turkey with 260-million-dollar worth of helicopters and other  military equipment to repay Russia's debt to Turkey which  amounts to 320 million dollars.    As Interfax learned from a reliable source close to  government circles, a tentative agreement on such supplies has  been reached. However initially their volume will be somewhat  lower -- 60 million dollars.    Participants in the session paid great attention to the ways  to expand bilateral cooperation in the area of conversion,  investment and power engineering. They noted with satisfaction  that the turnover between the two countries grew rapidly and  reached 2 billion dollars last year.    Speaking at the ceremony of signing the final documents,  Russia's Minister for external economic relations, Oleg Davydov,  said that in the current year the volume of Russian-Turkish  trade may more than double and surpass the level reached in  Russia's trade with the USA.</p>

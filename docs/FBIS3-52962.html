Such a government  would represent the political parties and forces as part of an  approach to resolve the political crisis.    The weekly AL-HIWAR cites these sources as saying that the  new government will be entrusted with implementing the political  agreement which the coalition and opposition parties are  drafting to end Yemen's political crisis, tackle the country's  problems, work out development programs, and promote the unity  of the state.    Observers here believe that the agreement's articles will  ensure the bases for merging the two armies, end the military  manifestations throughout the country, entrench security, and  crystallize sound national action in the field of news media,  economy, and politics.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Kajima writes off Y50bn KAJIMA, the Japanese general contractor, will write off losses of Y50bn (Dollars 462.7m) arising from the liquidation of a wholly-owned subsidiary active in developing Australian properties. The decision by Kajima reflects a trend among Japanese construction companies, which acquired large property portfolios in the US, UK and Australia in an aggressive expansion during the 1980s. However the companies, including Shimizu and Kumagai Gumi, found overseas markets far tougher than they had imagined, and the burden of carrying loss-making properties has increased as profits from the domestic market have slipped over the past two years. The group's net profit forecast for the year to March was revised down from Y8bn to Y1bn, and the forecast for parent net profit was cut from Y18bn to Y10bn.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Police chief slams proposed Pounds 6m cut A Home Office plan to cut Pounds 6m from Lincolnshire's police budget would be a 'criminal's charter', Mr Peter Bensley, the county's chief constable, said yesterday. Leaked government documents suggest that Pounds 11m will be axed from forces throughout England and Wales. Lincolnshire would bear the heaviest blow with 'upwards of Pounds 6m' cut from its spending. Mr Barry Fippard, chairman of the Lincolnshire police committee, said the force appeared to be paying for success. Mr Bensley said the proposals were equivalent to closing police stations in seven towns. Lincolnshire police were being punished because of significant efficiency improvements.</p>

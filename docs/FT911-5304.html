			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / International Company News: First Chicago falls 28% FIRST Chicago, the eleventh biggest US bank, has posted first-quarter net income of Dollars 49.5m, down 28 per cent from Dollars 68.6m in 1990, as higher non-performing assets, particularly in real estate, put pressure on earnings. Earnings per share dropped 32 per cent in the quarter to 63 cents, in line with expectations. Mr Barry Sullivan, chairman, said the earnings reflected the overall sluggishness in the US economy. First Chicago's non-performing assets rose in the first quarter, mainly in the real estate portfolio. Non-performing assets at the end of March were Dollars 1.6bn, up from Dollars 1.4bn at the end of 1990. Barnett Banks, the leading Florida banking company with Dollars 32.1bn in assets, turned in first-quarter net earnings of Dollars 18.3m, or 28 cents a share, against Dollars 15.5m or 25 cents a year earlier.</p>

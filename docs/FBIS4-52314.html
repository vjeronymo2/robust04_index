The newspaper says  that Marxism- Leninism is part of the colossal treasure of  wisdom accumulated by human society. Marxist doctrine has  extraordinary value in the science of thinking and in the idea  of liberating society, human beings, and thinking. Marxist  doctrine has a long-lasting vitality. It is an open doctrine  that has been constantly supplemented and developed, and has  determined their path of national liberation, regained their  independence and freedom, and taken the initiative in renovating  their socialist thinking. It has increased production toward  the goal of building a prosperous people, powerful country, and  civilized society. We must firmly grasp the science of thinking  and the pattern of national development so as to bring  Vietnamese thinking to a new level on the basis of our guiding  ideology: Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought.    To study Marxism is to study his scientific method of  thinking and struggle to follow his example in dedicating our  whole life to our lofty cause.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, 3 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The European Union  [EU] today denied reports that it is going to sign a free trade  agreement with Mexico which, according to an EU spokesman, would  be viewed as "discriminatory" by other Latin American states.    The spokesman, as well as Mexican diplomatic sources, has  dismissed the possibility of including a special clause  pertaining to Mexico in the final document on Latin America,  which will be signed by the European foreign ministers at their  summit in Corfu. "It is unrealistic to believe that relations  with Latin America will focus on Mexico, because that could  create political problems with other states in the region," said  a spokesman for Manuel Marin, commissioner for EU development.    According to this source, there is "disagreement" within the  EU regarding Mexico's status within the context of relations  with Latin America, because of the North American Free Trade  Agreement that the country signed with the United States and  Canada.    Mexican diplomats have denied the existence of official  documents that substantiate the alleged negotiation of a free  trade agreement between the two countries, as the Spanish  newspaper "EL PAIS" reported in its Friday edition.    Nevertheless, the newspaper explained that within the EU  there are "groups" that have a specific political interest in  Mexico, but countries such as Spain and Portugal are opposed  because they fear a souring of relations with the rest of the  region. "It is very unlikely that Spain will support the  decision to give Mexico special treatment, because that would  prompt other Latin American countries to request similar  treatment," the spokesman told NOTIMEX.    Portugal, meanwhile, has said that it will request a special  agreement with Brazil if the European Commission decides to sign  a treaty of association with Mexico. According to EL PAIS, the  EU is planning to make qualitative changes in its relations with  Mexico during the summit of heads of government and foreign  ministers scheduled for 24 and 25 June on the Greek island of  Corfu. The newspaper asserts that plans are taking shape to  negotiate an industrial free trade agreement similar to the one  the EU is currently discussing with Morocco.</p>

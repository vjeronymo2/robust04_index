			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by R.W.: "CBOS on Strikes; They Are Caused by </F> Activists, Poor People Strike" -- diagram appearing in original  text not included]    [Text] The wave of strikes and protests across the country  will increase, according to almost half (48 percent) of adult  Poles questioned by the Public Opinion Research Center [CBOS] in  mid-March, a few days after "Solidarity," in line with its  February announcement, began a nationwide protest action.  Almost two-thirds (63 percent) of respondents agree with the  opinion that given the present situation, "staging a strike  actually does not provide any results," and 70 percent object to  the union's organizing a general strike. In comparison with  February, the number of people approving strikes has decreased,  which, however, does not apply to the group which most widely  takes part in such protests -- that is, among skilled workers.    Forty percent of respondents would be ready to take part in  an organized strike at their enterprise. Thirty-eight percent  of respondents might go on a so-called solidarity strike, that  is, a strike which backs protests at other enterprises; 41  percent would be prepared to participate in a general strike  against the government's economic policies.    Half of the respondents believe that strikes are most  frequently caused by union activists. Every fourth respondent  believes that activists announce strikes to avert an  uncontrolled outbreak of dissatisfaction. Why do people take  part in strikes? Almost half (46 percent of the respondents)  say that the reasons are, first of all, political -- an aversion  for the present government. A little fewer (40 percent) of the  respondents think that dominating factors are economic  considerations -- the desire to improve their material situation.    Regardless of the reasons, employees with low wages and  those  living on the brink of poverty (46 percent of respondents chose  this answer) take part in strikes more often than employees with  fairly good wages who would like to earn more (39 percent).    According to the respondents, most justified are the strikes  of health-care employees (opinion of 64 percent of respondents),  miners (55 percent), and teachers (43 percent). Support for the  protests of railway workers, metallurgists, or employees of the  arms industry is much weaker.    Among every hundred respondents, only eight believe that the  protests of postal workers are justified; six -- that the  protests of municipal transportation companies are justified;  and only two -- that strikes by employees of the power  engineering industry are justified.    Every second respondent believes that decisions concerning  strike demands in state-run enterprises should be made by the  directors of those enterprises; every fourth person thinks that  such decisions should be left to the government.    The poll was conducted between 10 and 14 March on a  representative sample of 1,228 adult Poles.</p>

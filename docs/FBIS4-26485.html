			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 22 (XINHUA) -- A high-powered  non-governmental organization was launched here today,  reflecting China's growing interest in international economic  cooperation and development in Northeast Asia.    The China Association for the Promotion of International  Technological and Economic Cooperation in Northeast Asia, with  members from the central government and provincial governments,  prominent academic institutions and major companies, is poised  to play a big role in mobilizing the countries and regions in  Northeast Asia to form closer links in developing the regional  economy.    "Though the countries and regions in northeast Asia differ  widely in terms of economic development, the region, with rich  labor and natural resources and a strong industrial foundation,  has the greatest growth potential and brightest prospects for  cooperation," said Ma Hong, honorary president of the  association, who heads the Development Research Center of the  State Council.    According to him, all countries in this region had expressed  strong desires to promote international cooperation within the  region.    The association has already established contacts with some  domestic and overseas economic and technological organizations,  social groups and investment groups and begun to explore ways of  cooperation with them.    Some enterprise groups in Asia, America and Europe have even  invited the association to launch joint ventures overseas.    "The expanded exchanges and cooperation will probably lead  to  the establishment of an international economic cooperation  organization in Northeast Asia in the future," said an  association official.    A specialists' committee will soon be set up within the  association to study key issues related to regional cooperation  and provide policy consultations for relevant departments of the  State Council.    The association also plans to hold a large international  academic symposium and trade fair in April or may next year, the  official said.</p>

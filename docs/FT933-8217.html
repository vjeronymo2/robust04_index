			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: HM launches rights and buys epos maker METRIC, a privately-owned UK company manufacturing electric point of sale terminals in Poland, is to be acquired by HM Holdings, a shell company, for between Pounds 700,000 and Pounds 4m in shares and warrants, depending on future profits. HM yesterday announced a 6-for-1 rights issue raising between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 2.1m, with an opportunity for investors to apply for a bigger number of shares and warrants. The warrants carry an entitlement to subscribe for shares at 1p between August 1 1994 and January 31 1996. The new company, to be renamed Metric Components, will seek to come to the market in the future. HM has tax losses and some sizeable shareholders such as the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund. Mr Job Maats, who founded Metric and will head the new company, said: 'We have a very skilled workforce who cost about a tenth of employees with similar skills working in the M4 corridor or in Silicon Valley.' With the closure of Polish steel factories and mines Mr Maats said Polish workers were 'very keen to work for realistic prices'. Metric, which employs 500 people in Poland, has been granted an option on the factory in the Silesia valley by the ministry of privatisation, exercisable within two years. While the epos terminals for the retail industry are manufactured in Poland, the software is produced in England. The initial consideration, comprising 70m ordinary shares and 70m warrants, is Pounds 700,000. Up to an additional 330m ordinary shares and 330m warrants will be issued if Metric meets certain profit targets. It either has to make Pounds 500,000 in the year to June 1994, or a bigger sum the following year to be eligible for the additional shares and warrants. Mr Maats has personally warranted that the average pre-tax profits of Metric for the next two years will not be less than Pounds 125,000 and has undertaken to pay any shortfall up to a maximum of Pounds 125,000.</p>

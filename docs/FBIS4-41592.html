			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business SNARK" file] </F>   [Text] Baku [no dateline as received] -- An advisory  committee headed by Geydar Aliyev had a session June 21 where  present problems in Azerbaijan economy were discussed.    The President certified that, though the necessary measures  were undertaken, the situation in economy is aggravated. Low  prices for fuel at domestic market, as well as easy-terms  credits played a destructive role in the social and economic  sphere.    In this connection, positively were estimated the  President's  orders on quarterly revisions of prices for oil and petroleum  products and on granting credits on easy terms.    Parliament Chairman Rasul Guliyev, appearing on the session,  observed that despite the President's order "On Liberalization  of Foreign Trade Prices", an enormous amount of goods in the  state warehouses remain non-distributed. Thus the Agricultural  Ministry has goods for $400m [million], State Oil Concern for  $100m, and State Metal Concern from $15m to $20m. Total price  of unsold goods is $600m. Every day products for a sum $5m to  $6m turn unfit.    Mr. Guliyev proposed to organize a special advisory  commission with powers to distribute the stored products in 6  months period.    The session also discussed the issue of privatization of  unfinished construction sites.</p>

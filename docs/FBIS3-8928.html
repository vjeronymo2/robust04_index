The meeting was chaired by Bosnia-Herzegovina Deputy Prime  Minister Edib Bukvic. Several suggestions were put forward in  the debate that will be conveyed to our negotiators. It is  expected that the Washington agreement will be signed by  Presidents Izetbegovic and Tudjman, to be subsequently ratified  by the deputies of our assembly.    The Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly session is expected to take  place at the end of this month.</p>

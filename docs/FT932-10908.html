			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard launches second palmtop PC HEWLETT-Packard has introduced a pocket-sized personal computer that can send and receive electronic messages as well as run standard PC programs. It is one of the first products to reach the market in what is expected to become a fast-expanding market for 'personal communicators'. The 100LX is H-P's second palmtop computer. It has already sold 'well over 200,000' of the earlier version, which was introduced two years ago, and which does not have the built-in communications capabilities of the new model. H-P has taken an early lead in a field that is expected to expand rapidly with the entrance of competitors such as Apple Computer, with its much heralded Newton, as well as AT&amp;T, IBM and Compaq Computer.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Russia's Choice Ecological Program: </F> V.I. Danilov-Danilyan on Program of National Ecological  Revival"]    [Text] The Russian minister of environmental protection and  natural resources, who was elected to the State Duma by a  federal list, said that there is "legal uncertainty" in the area  of ecology. The minister emphasized that it is necessary to  create as soon as possible "a legal base for environmental  protection activities that will be in keeping with the new  constitution." In his opinion, it should define the interaction  between federal authorities and federation components with  respect to natural resource utilization.    V.I. Danilov-Danilyan pointed out that the implementation of  ecological policy requires tremendous capital investment and is  only possible when the economy improves. Nevertheless, it is  necessary to beef up the environmental protection system--in  particular, ecological monitoring and expert evaluation. The  minister reported that development of programs for ecological  improvement of the regions has began. For instance, in Tula  Oblast.    According to the minister, in 1993 penalty payments by  enterprises polluting the atmosphere may possibly amount to  about 300 billion rubles. In his opinion it is not expedient to  increase the penalty rates, because it reduces production  efficiency and does not lead to an improved environment.    The minister refuted the rumor spread by the REUTER agency  that Russia had allegedly dumped into the ocean "half a  Chernobyl of radioactive waste." "In reality," he clarified,  "the volume was smaller by two orders of magnitude."    Russia's Choice plans a national ecological revival, said V.  Danilov-Danilyan, based on a considerable reduction in the human  and industrial impact on the environment. In particular,  bringing within the norm atmospheric discharges and waste water  dumping by industrial and agricultural enterprises, and  developing a "repair network" for ecosystems that have become  out of balance.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Arts: Mirthful mutations - Cinema THE MASK (PG) Charles Russell HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (15) Alex Cox PUBLIC ACCESS Bryan J. Singer In a startling raid on the American box office, a little-known man with a mask and array of vocal disguises has climbed to the top of the charts. Dislodging Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kevin Costner and Tom Hanks on the way, he has already made off with over Dollars 100m. The law - the law of movie probability, that is - stands helplessly by, seeking the breath to blow its police whistle. This has happened before: if only once in recent times. Two years ago a cartoon genie with a similar fondness for high-speed 'schtick' and smash-and-grab impersonations shinned to the top of the movie polls. But in that film, Aladdin, the protean lamp-creature was voiced by the crowd-pulling Robin Williams. In this week's The Mask we have Canadian-born comic Jim Carrey, whom almost none of us have heard of: or if we have, only as the man dusting for pawprints in the now forgotten romp Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. But the Chameleon Factor has worked again; 1990s audiences evidently go dotty for fast-track metamorphosis played for mirth. Carrey is humble bank employee Stanley Ipkiss, whose life is transformed when he stumbles on an ancient mask (never mind how) with the power to re-mould (never mind why), over and over and ad lib, its owner's appearance. Abracadabra. From a human worker-ant in 'Edge City, USA,' a fantasy town with a remarkable resemblance to Los Angeles, the Mittyish Mr Ipkiss can now mutate at will. Mostly he turns into a dashing, yellow-suited, green-faced lounge lizard with elastic limbs and organs - his eyes pop, his jaw drops two feet, even his heart jumps out cartoon-like at the sight of a beautiful girl - and a tendency to whirl tornado-like in and out of scenes. He gets the girl (blonde and sumptuous Cameron Diaz). He gets the crooks. He certainly gets the audience. The special effects are - no hyperbole - astonishing. They are by Industrial Light and Magic, the sorcery workshop founded by George 'Star Wars' Lucas. If the art of optical magic goes on like this, Roger Rabbit will soon seem like a flicker book from the Dark Ages and Snow White like a cave painting animated by guttering firelight. First cousin to Williams's genie, Jim Carrey gives as good vocally as he gets visually. Edward G. Robinson, Clark Gable, James Cagney and others pour from the larynx. (This is a 1940s-style crime plot with Carrey chasing a gang of Warners-style crooks, so do not expect up-to-date impersonations). And when our indestructible-when-masked hero performs a mock death scene before the hoodlums who think they have gunned him down, we get a full bouquet of 'famous last words' perennials in about 30 seconds flat. Twangy-sentimental cowboy valediction; Tiny Tim cockney; even Rhett Butler choking out 'Tell Scarlett I do give a damn.' Virtuosic. And directed likewise by Charles Russell, a fugitive from the Nightmare On Elm Street series. Our only quibble: a hundred minutes is a long time to sit there being strafed by one performer, even one kissed with talent, even one who slides in and out of the coat of many colours provided by the FX folks. A chittering demon inside the spectator says, 'Yes, but what is it all for?' The Mask is not so much a movie, more a feature-length demo reel for the wonders of digital conjuring on screen. You end up enthused by the product but wondering, before you take out your cheque book, whether you should not wait a little longer while they improve the story-packaging. We still have not quite answered the question. Why do today's audiences like this mach-2 metamorphic style so much? The other big hits of the summer in America have been The Lion King, the new piece de prestidigitation from the Disney animators, and Forrest Gump, in which Tom Hanks roams through time being magicked by trick photography into encounters with the famous. Have audiences become too quick, too screen-smart, to put up with the old narrative dawdle, let alone the old po-faced naturalism? If a film is slow - unless it is deep-down good - the cliches can be skewered and roasted by filmgoers who have sharpened their wits on video and computer games. If a film is un-self-aware, we have a generation who drank post-modernism with their mother's milk. They know that in the ludic 1990s you can now have your cake (disbelief-suspension) and eat it (munch on the make-believe tricks whenever they expose themselves). So we wonder if there is room for movies like the week's other duo, Highway Patrolman and Public Access. British director Alex Cox's career is a hard luck story. He used to make sportive films that broke the frame of illusionism - the spoof Western Straight To Hell, the anachronism-stuffed historical epic Walker - but they failed at the box office. So he has gone to Mexico and back to the drawing-board. Highway Patrolman (in Spanish with subtitles) is a straight-up genre movie: part action thriller, part moral melodrama. Will our rookie police hero (Robert Sosa) defy the corruption prevailing among his fellow cops and do the brave and decent things out there on the blistering tarmac? Like arresting drug dealers, shooting rabid dogs, and trying to find a joke in Lorenzo O'Brien's solemnly righteous screenplay. Cox provides a strong mise-en-scene, full of long takes and startling landscapes. The climax at a crack-in-the-earth desert location is marvellous. But in today's mercurial movie world, Highway Patrolman seems almost dottily old-fashioned. As we watch the protagonist gain one martyring handicap after another while the story racks up its reversals, from a facial scar to a bullet-ridden limp, we feel we are back in the days of On The Waterfront or The Defiant Ones: when good men did what they gotta do and audiences sat there dumbly, drinking in the moral lessons. Public Access is no better: indeed rather worse. Cox, we know, can make good movies (Repo Man). But debut American director Bryan J. Singer seems able to press only two letters on his creative keyboard. One is P for portentous, in this tale of a young stranger (Ron Marquette) taking over a small town's public-access TV network to spread malice, menace and finally murder. The other is S for stilted, as the film's shadowy-paranoid style - Marquette may be a right-wing provocateur - invokes the worst excesses of the sanctimonious 1960s/'70s (The Parallax View, Winter Kills.) Here it all is again. The belief that if you are not a decent liberal, you are an indecent (and probably homicidal) redneck; that if you swathe a film in chiaroscuro and score it for laconic dialogue, you have - hey presto] - a film noir; that by explaining nothing about your mystery anti-hero, you will make him a great existential icon. There are worse things than a film that takes itself seriously. But there are few worse things than a film that goes back to yesterday's fashions to do so and fails utterly to renew those fashions for today.</p>

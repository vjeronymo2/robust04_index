			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Nigerian elected governors sworn in To shouts of 'long live Nigeria', elected state governors took over from military officers yesterday at the start of a crucial period of power-sharing in Africa's most populous country, Reuter reports from Lagos. The governors were elected in all 30 states last month after bitter primaries involving two military-created parties.

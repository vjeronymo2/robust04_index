			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Tenneco to buy Germancar exhaust producer Tenneco, the diversified US industrial company, is expected to announce today that it will buy Gillet, a German automotive components manufacturer, for cash and assumed debt in a deal valued at Dollars 113m (Pounds 71m). The acquisition will boost Tenneco's European presence in the original equipment sector of the components market and give the company a foothold in emerging markets where Gillet is already supplying customers. Gillet, based in Edencoben, is Europe's largest maker of exhaust systems for new cars. It supplies parts to all of Europe's major carmakers. With 2,000 employees at 14 plants, including three in the UK, Gillet had sales of Dollars 275m last year. Tenneco is expected to merge family-owned Gillet into its Walker Manufacturing subsidiary, which produces exhaust systems as replacement parts in the US and Europe. Walker had sales of about Dollars 900m in 1993, including Dollars 219m from its European operations. Walker and Gillet combined will give Tenneco a leading position in Europe's original and replacement equipment markets. The purchase will be the third in a series of acquisitions aimed at bolstering Tenneco's three core businesses - natural gas, packaging and automotive components. It agreed last month to buy a US power generating and natural gas development company for Dollars 60m and said it would spend Dollars 73m to upgrade a US containerboard plant. Analysts expect Tenneco to report third-quarter earnings of about 74 cents per share today.</p>

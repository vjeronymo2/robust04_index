			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAY HIKE!: A STROLL THROUGH THE PINES: SAN DIEGO'S MIDDLE PEAK  </P> <P> Middle Peak, in the middle of the Cuyamaca Mountains in San Diego County, is  the place for a summer saunter if you like tall trees. Encircling the peak are  big specimens of silver fir and cedar, plus Coulter, sugar, Ponderosa and  Jeffrey pines.  </P> <P> The Cuyamacas' geographical location between coast and desert makes these  mountains an unusual ecosystem. The 4,000- to 6,500-foot peaks host rich  conifer forests. Cuyamaca Rancho State Park protects much of the mountains,  which are a delight for bird watchers because desert, coastal and mountain  species are all found in the range.  </P> <P> Centerpiece of the park -- and of the Cuyamaca Mountains -- is a chain of three  forested peaks: North, Middle and Cuyamaca. Cuyamaca Peak, at 6,512 feet, is  the highest summit in the range and offers the best views. Most of North Peak  (5,993 feet) is on private property. Middle Peak (5,883 feet) has the best  trail network and the tallest trees.  </P> <P> The hike around Middle Peak uses several trails; one good path that ascends the  north side of the peak is Sugar Pine Trail. Utilizing this trail and a couple  of others, it's possible to make several loops of varying distances around  Middle Peak.  </P> <P> Directions to the trailhead: This hike begins at a parking area off California  79 in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park. The parking area is opposite the Boy Scouts'  Camp Hual-Cu-Cuisi. If you're traveling California 79 south to the state park,  the trailhead is about 10 miles from Julian. If you're heading north on  California 79, the trailhead is located 5 miles north of park headquarters and  1 1/2 miles north of the entrance to Paso Pichacho Camp/Picnic Area. The  parking area is located at a nearly right-angle bend in the highway.  </P> <P> The end of the trail is easy to spot; it's the road across from the parking  area that leads through the Boy Scout camp. The unsigned beginning of the trail  is more difficult to find. Look on the left (west) side of California 79 for a  path that parallels the highway. Can't find it? Walk 75 yards or so north up  the highway, then head left, dip in and out of a roadside drainage ditch, and  you'll pick up the trail heading north.  </P> <P> The hike: Minshall is the name of the unsigned trail that parallels California  79. Looking east, the most obvious geographical feature is Cuyamaca Reservoir.  Before the dam was built creating the reservoir, Cuyamaca Lake, as it was  called, was a sometime affair. Indians never trusted it as a dependable water  source, and the Spanish referred to it as la laguna que deseco, "the lake that  dries up." During dry years like this one, there's more meadow than reservoir.  </P> <P> After half a mile, the trail skirts Lakeland Resort and turns west. Signs  inform you that you're now on the way to Middle Peak and that you're entering a  state park wilderness area. Your path, a retiring dirt road now known as Sugar  Pine Trail, begins ascending into the pines. At lower elevations, the pines mix  it up with oak woodland.  </P> <P> A short mile's ascent on Sugar Pine Trail brings you to a junction with Middle  Peak fire road. If a 3-mile loop is plenty for you this day, turn left on the  fire road and follow it down to the Boy Scout camp and the trailhead.  </P> <P> Otherwise, continue on Sugar Pine Trail past some fine specimens of Southern  California's largest native pine. The bark of these trees is reddish brown and  deeply furrowed into scaly plates. Sugar pines have larger branches and cones  than their somewhat similar-looking Middle Peak neighbors, the Ponderosa pines.  </P> <P> Nearing the halfway point of the hike, the trail passes the stone foundation  ruins of an old cabin, turns southwest and comes to a signed junction.  </P> <P> You join Middle Peak Loop Road, which at first curves west, then heads south.  Middle Peak itself is possible to ascend, but trees and shrubs prevent any kind  of view of Cuyamaca country.  </P> <P> Middle Peak Loop Road descends out of the pines to Milk Ranch Road. Bear left  on this dirt fire road, which crosses oak-dotted meadowland. You'll get a  feeling for the "rancho" part of the state park. The dirt road becomes gravel,  skirts the Boy Scout camp and brings you back to California 79 and the  trailhead.  </P></p>

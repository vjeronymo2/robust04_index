			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions THE LIST of sales is lengthening as the stock market tests new heights. Since coming to the market in April 1989, shares of the Capita Group - which specialises in information technology and systems consultancy - have more than trebled in value, although most of the gain has been achieved since the beginning of 1991. There have been previous sales by directors. This time, four of them, including the chairman and managing director, have sold a total of 303,000 shares at 410p, close to their peak level. Only one of the sales by Hanson directors resulted from the exercise of an option. The other two were straight sales and included a disposal by Lord Hanson himself of 2.55m shares. Interim results announced the previous week were at the lower end of analysts' forecasts. The consensus view is that this year's profits will fall for the first time in the company's history. David Spencer, chairman of Tay Homes, sold 2.1m shares at 220p leaving himself with 1.4m. The share price has moved sharply higher in the past few weeks. Polypipe directors have featured regularly in this column, always as sellers. Geoffrey Harrison has reduced his holding to 90m shares by selling 1m at 141p. In April, Kevin McDonald sold 1m shares at 113p. The only purchases of note were in British Petroleum - which is, ironically, now viewed as a potential takeover target for Hanson. Robert Horton, the chairman and chief executive, was buying shares in February. Now, two of his colleagues have bought a total of 36,500 at between 254p and 258p apiece.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            No of Company                    Sector     Shares   Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bowthorpe                    Elns    120,789     331         1* Capita Group                 BuSe    303,000   1,242         4 Conrad Continental           Text    240,000      19         1 Cooper Clarke                 n/a    124,432      45         1 Elswick                      Pack    139,492      16         1 Fine Art Developmt           Stor     50,000     219         1 Goodhead Group                Med    100,000      40         1 Guinness                     Brew     17,742     107         1* Hanson                       Cong  2,774,095   6,452         3* IMI                          EngG     35,000     105         1* Inchcape                     BuSe     79,592     403         2* Isle of Man Steam            Tran     18,000      34         1 Lloyds Abbey                 InsL      5,300      23         1 Mallett                      Stor     44,000      36         1 Morrison Spmkt               FdRe      7,000      25         1* Pacific Assets Trst          InTr     10,000      25         1 Pearson                       Med     10,000      89         1 Pifco                        Elec      6,000      22         1 Polypipe                     BdMa  1,000,000   1,410         1 Reuters                       Med     49,075     584         1* Sanderson Murray             Motr     33,780      42***      2 Spirax Sarco                 EngG      9,703      31         1 Tay Homes                     C&amp;C  2,100,000    4,620        1 Unilever                     FdMa      6,546       60        2* United Newspapers             Med     70,000      318        2*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aber Split Tr Cap            InTr    95,000      130         1 British Petroleum             O&amp;G    36,578       94         2 Conrad Continental           Text   230,400       23         1 Goodhead Grp                  Med   100,000       40         1 Quicks Group                 Motr    16,384       19         1 Sphere IT (Income)           InTr   200,000       32         2 Waste Manag't Int            Misc     3,100       20         1 Wholesale Fittings           Elec    18,000       52         1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

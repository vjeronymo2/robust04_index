			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Meeting Applicable Requirements of Section 110 and Part D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 28, 1983 (48 FR 57130), EPA fully approved California's SIP for the San Francisco Bay Area as meeting the requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 Act, with the exception of the I/M program which was approved on November 25, 1983 (48 FR 53114) and committed to specific implementation schedules for the San Francisco Bay Area. The amended Act, however, modified section 110(a)(2) and, under part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes of redesignation, to meet the requirement that the SIP contain all applicable requirements under the Act, EPA has reviewed the SIP to ensure that it contains all measures that were due under the amended Act prior to or at the time the State submitted its redesignation request, as set forth in EPA policy. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  EPA interprets section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) of the Act to mean that, for a redesignation request to be approved, the State must have met all requirements that applied to the subject area prior to or at the same time as the submission of a complete redesignation request. Requirements of the Act that come due subsequently continue to be applicable to the area at later dates (see section 175A(c)) and, if redesignation of any of the areas is disapproved, the State remains obligated to fulfill those requirements. These requirements are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Procedures for Processing Requests to Redesignate Areas to Attainment,'' John Calcagni, Director, Air Quality Management Division, September 4, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``State Implementation Plan (SIP) Actions Submitted in Response to Clean Air Act (CAA) Deadlines,'' John Calcagni, Director, Air Quality Management Division, October 28, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``State Implementation Plan (SIP) Requirements for Areas Submitted Requests for Redesignation to Attainment of the Ozone and Carbon Monoxide (CO) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) on or after November 15, 1992,'' Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator, September 17, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed earlier in this document, all of the SIP requirements must be met by the BAAQMD and approved by EPA into the SIP prior to final action on the redesignation request. In the event that these requirements are not met, EPA proposes in the alternative to disapprove the redesignation request. Based on CARB's July 21, 1994 letter to EPA, EPA is ``parallel processing'' certain SIP revisions in this document (contingency measures and 1990 emission inventory) and will address the other requirements (VOC RACT regulations, emission statement rule, new source review) in a separate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  document prior to final action on this revision. EPA's decision to parallel process the locally adopted contingency measures and 1990 emissions inventory reflect EPA's positive technical and administrative review. An EPA letter dated August 25, 1994 (Howekamp, EPA, to Boyd, CARB) finds the revised baseyear inventory complete (for parallel processing purposes) and rescinds the April 13, 1993 finding of incompleteness for the emission inventory. An approvability review was performed separately by EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. Section 110 Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although section 110 was amended in 1990, the San Francisco Bay Area SIP meets the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2). A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore, EPA believes that the pre-amendment SIP met these requirements. As to those requirements that were amended, see 57 FR 27936 and 23939 (June 23, 1993), many are duplicative of other requirements of the Act. EPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent with the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2). The SIP contains enforceable emission limitations, requires monitoring, compiling, and analyzing ambient air quality data, requires preconstruction review of new major stationary sources and major modifications to existing ones, provides for adequate funding, staff, and associated resources necessary to implement its requirements, and requires stationary source emissions monitoring and reporting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

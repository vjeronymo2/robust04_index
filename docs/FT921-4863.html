			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Ladbroke declines 29% to Pounds 210m REDUCED property values and a decline in betting-shop income lay behind a 29 per cent fall in annual pre-tax profit, from Pounds 296.5m to Pounds 210.4m, at Ladbroke Group, the UK leisure concern. Early 1991 was marked by warnings from Mr Cyril Stein, chairman, that the Gulf crisis had wiped out first-quarter profit in the Hilton International hotel chain. He was more upbeat about the start to this year. Ladbroke, which raised Pounds 464m in a debt-reducing rights issue in August, was also affected by recessions in the UK and US, with the property division the worst hit. It fell to a loss after interest of Pounds 12.4m, compared with Pounds 45.2m profit. Most of the turnround was accounted for by write-downs in values. A small profit was made in the second half through sales. Group operating profit declined 15 per cent to Pounds 312.2m on flat turnover of Pounds 3.79bn. Interest charges, including a supplement for convertible bonds, rose to Pounds 101.8m from Pounds 69.4m. There was a compensating reduction in capitalised interest to Pounds 34.1m, from Pounds 70.9m, as projects were completed and let. Hotels - 153 in 50 countries - remained the group's biggest contributor to operating profit at Pounds 163.8m, more than Pounds 10m down on 1990, with turnover reduced to Pounds 758.1m. The figures were helped by Pounds 43.7m of profits from hotel sales against Pounds 20.8m last year. Operating profit from Ladbroke's betting businesses fell 30 per cent to Pounds 64.5m on turnover of Pounds 2.25bn (against Pounds 2.3bn). The main area of weakness was credit betting, which suffered a 'loss of high-staking punters'. Star performer was Texas Homecare, the DIY chain second to Kingfisher's B&amp;Q. Retail operating profit rose 20 per cent to Pounds 47.5m on sales of Pounds 652.9m. Mr Stein said Texas increased market share to about 25 per cent of the DIY superstore sector and improved its margins. Net debt, benefiting from the issue proceeds fell to Pounds 1.12bn from Pounds 1.49bn, and gearing was 38 per cent. Capital spending came down from Pounds 490m to Pounds 220m, with Pounds 180m planned for this year. Writedowns in property and hotel values taken straight to the balance sheet amounted to Pounds 18.2m and Pounds 56.2m respectively. After a final dividend of 6.23p, the total rises 5 per cent to 11.15p. This is 1.4 times covered by earnings per share of 16.12p, down from 24.49p. Lex, Page 20</p>

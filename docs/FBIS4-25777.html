			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Evening Talk" by Yang Chu (5017 2612): "Is a World War To </F> Break Out?" -- On Korean Peninsula Situation]    [Text] A tense situation has arisen in the East, and  another in the West. The former is on the Korean Peninsula, and  a war seems to be erupting. The latter is in Bosnia, in  southern Europe, and Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev said that  if the situation were not handled well, it would result in a  world war!    As a matter of fact, whether the situation is more tense in  the East or in the West, it will only lead to an outcome, that  is, the situation will relax after a moment of tension, and no  war will erupt. Neither the situation on the Korean Peninsula  nor that in Bosnia will trigger a world war.    The situation on the Korean Peninsula is tense. After  seceding from the IAEA, the DPRK now is saying that it may  withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The United  States said that it would impose severe sanctions on the DPRK  and that if the motion is not adopted by the UN Security  Council, it -- together with its several allies -- would impose  sanctions on the DPRK. The DPRK's reaction, however, was that:  If you impose sanctions on us, it will mean a war.    It seems there is no leeway left.    Is this the case? The answer is no. Former U.S. President  Carter is now maneuvering in the DPRK. China too is persuading  various parties and hopes that the talks can be resumed to bring  about peace. Russia also took the stand of discussing and  settling the dispute through talks when it proposed the idea of  calling an international conference.    The most fundamental question is: Who wants to go to war?  Is it the DPRK? No, it cannot afford a war. In modernized  warfare, a small country with few soldiers will use up all its  strength very quickly, which is not worthwhile. What about the  United States? Clinton is full of worries and dares not make any  decision, even when thinking for a long time about dispatching  troops to Haiti to deal with the 7,500-strong Haitian armed  forces, who are equipped only with obsolete firearms dating back  to World War II, so he certainly will not provoke the DPRK  troops, who are more ferocious. If half of the more than 30,000  U.S. soldiers stationed in the ROK are killed, would he still be  President?    As said before, the DPRK really wants to open a dialogue  with  the United States, to win U.S. diplomatic recognition, and to  receive U.S. economic aid. In any case, no war will erupt as  long as no party really wants it. As the saying goes, one hand  alone cannot clap; now that neither hand wants to clap, how can  a sound be made?!    On the other hand, the U.S. Senate and House of  Representatives have adopted a resolution to lift the arms  embargo on Bosnia, but Clinton can use his presidential power to  veto it. The Congress needs a two-thirds absolute majority vote  to overrule Clinton's veto.    Now Russia is not the only country against lifting the arms  embargo on the Bosnian Muslims; Britain and Canada also object  to it. Clinton must seriously consider this.    Even if the arms embargo is lifted, it will not necessarily  lead to a world war. Who is going to fight the so-called world  war? Russia and the United States? A nuclear war? Their  strategic nuclear missiles are no longer trained on each other.  The United States is using its money and technology to help the  Russians dismantle their nuclear weapons, and U.S. experts and  journalists have visited Russian nuclear missile bases, which in  the past were kept absolutely secret. Moscow is placing its  hopes for economic restructuring on the West; how can it be in  the mood to fight a war! Kozyrev's bluff only lays him open to  ridicule!</p>

"Packard" and "Caterpillar" recently announced their wish to  participate on a joint basis with the Russian ZIL production  association to create new heavy trucks. The documents which are  planned to be signed during the summit meeting are to ensure the  start of the successful functioning of a new joint venture,  "AMOZIL," and safeguard U.S. entrepreneurs against financial  losses.    An official spokesman for the overseas private investment  corporation stressed that U.S. President B. Clinton and Vice  President A. Gore very much want to see this venture succeed,  since they believe that the development of transportation is a  key element in Russian economic recovery. He also noted that  the plan provides not only for the construction of a new truck  plant near Moscow, but also for the creation of a network of  stores and truck maintenance centers.    According to the leaders of the U.S. companies, truck  production is planned to start at the end of next year.  According to the agreement concluded between ZIL, "Packard,"  and "Caterpillar," the U.S. partners will produce chassis and  engines and the Russian plant will produce bodies for the heavy  truck.</p>

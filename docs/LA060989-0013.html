			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRIEVANCES OF POSTAL WORKERS  </P> <P> Regarding stress and trauma in the Postal Service resulting in murder, assault,  psychiatric breakdowns and disruption/decline in mail service and increases in  costs to the patient American who only enters a post office as a last resort --  and never suffers from occupational stress:  </P> <P> Poor babies. I never realized they are having such a bad time. When I am next  forced to stand in a long line for service with only one lethargic station open  (coffee break?) or segregate my mail box delivery because of misdirection or  dumping of multiple quantities of junk mail, I'll be more considerate of their  unique plight. Sure I will.  </P> <P> CHARLES P. REED  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Economic Watch: Sweden's GNP recovering Swedish gross national product fell by 2.1 per cent in 1993. This was the third successive decline, making the recession the longest this century. But an export-led recovery - which the government is depending on to save it in September's general election - got under way in the latter part of the year, with GNP rising by 0.4 per cent in the last quarter. Nordbanken predicted GNP would grow by 2.5 per cent this year and by 3.5 per cent next year. However, the domestic economy, burdened by a huge budget deficit, continues to lag, with household incomes falling by a record 3.8 per cent last year and employment by 5.6 per cent. Nordbanken forecast a further fall this year in both public and household consumption, while unemployment was set to stand at 8 per cent. Another 5-6 per cent of the workforce are on government training schemes. Foreign investment in Russia totalled Dollars 2.9bn in 1993, some 90 per cent of which came in the form of equity participation. Germany's trade surplus contracted to DM5.9bn (Pounds 2.3bn) in January from DM8.5bn a month earlier, while the current account deficit rose to DM5.7bn from DM800m in December. Denmark's preliminary unadjusted trade surplus rose to DKr43.01bn (Pounds 4.3bn) in 1993 from DKr34.88bn in 1992.</p>

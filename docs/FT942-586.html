			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Changes at top hit Reed A shock announcement that Mr Peter Davis, the chairman of Reed International, had resigned following what is widely seen as a power struggle within the group saw the shares slide 41p in early trading. The official company statement pointed to a clash of management styles and follows a shift nine months ago when Mr Davis was appointed co-chairman, with the executive role taken by the management committee. City analysts saw the stock's performance as a tribute to Mr Davis's management skills. One commented: 'If a company's share price is doing badly it is easy to blame the management, and when it is doing well it has to be worrying that the principal player leaves.' Over the past 12 months the company has outperformed the FT-A All-Share Index by about 12.5 percentage points. In late trading, Reed rallied with the market but still ended a net 9 off at 741p, with turnover unusually high at 3.3m. Elsevier shares were also marked down sharply in Amsterdam.</p>

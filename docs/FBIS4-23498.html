			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>   [Excerpts] Kigali, June 7 (AFP) -- Rwandan troops and  rebels exchanged fire on Tuesday [7 June] in the capital Kigali  and close to Gitarama, the interim government's base, as the  United Nations postponed a new round of peace talks planned for  Wednesday.    Heavy shelling and small arms fire rocked several parts of  the city in the morning as several empty UN trucks for Kabale on  the Ugandan border to load up with relief supplies flown into  Uganda's Entebbe airport Monday. Kigali airport has been closed  since Sunday when it was shelled by government forces just after  a UN flight had landed.    The fighting died down during the day in a city largely  deserted by its inhabitants, where the rebels are pitted against  the army and extremist Hutu militias who have holed up in the  southwestern Nyamirambo district.    Government forces also battled the Rwandan Patriotic Front  (RPF) about three kilometres (two miles) from Gitarama, 50  kilometres (30 miles) from Kigali, Colonel Mooen Ahmed,  operations chief in the UN mission, said.    The leader of the General Paul Kagame, late Monday said his  men had pushed back the government troops, who had begun what UN  officials described as a "major counter-offensive." Fighting  was also reported to the north of Kigali, in the direction of  rebel-held Ruhengeri. The army has sent reinforcements  northwards to try to halt rebel advances. [passage omitted on  previously filed material]    A UN spokesman announced that ceasefire talks planned for  Wednesday had been postponed for at least 24 hours because the  chairman of the talks, Ghanaian Gen. Henry Anyidoho, was out of  the country and had been unable to fly directly back to Kigali.  "Even if he arrives on Tuesday night, he'll need time to  prepare for the talks, which will now be held on Thursday or  Friday," UN civilian spokesman Pierre Mehu said.    Anyidoho, the deputy chief of the UN Assistance Mission in  Rwanda (UNAMIR), had left the Kenyan capital Nairobi for Kampala  in Uganda, flown by helicopter to the border and was to make his  way to Kigali by road, Mehu said.    Two sessions of UN-mediated talks took place last week,  enabling agreements to be reached on evacuating civilians and  providing food and medical aid amid the battle, but led to no  ceasefire accord. [passage omitted]    The international Red Cross has evacuated more than 700  orphans and abandoned children from Butare in the south, a town  still in government hands, to Burundi, a Red Cross official  said. [passage omitted] About a hundred more children, some  with dreadful injuries perpetrated in cold blood, arrived  overnight in Rome in an evacuation operation mounted by the  Italian Red Cross and government.    The children, some under a year old, were all taken to Rome  hospitals and will eventually find foster families, Maria Pia  Fanfani, president of the Italian Red Cross, said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev by </F> Mayak Radio correspondent Ilyas Latypov; place and date not  given -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Latypov] From the very beginning it was clear that  the reaction to the Russian-Tatarstan treaty from various  circles, both in Moscow and Kazan, would not be unequivocal.  Talking to journalists, you said you were receiving much  response to the treaty. What are people writing and saying to  you?    [Shaymiyev] An absolute majority of the population expresses  gratitude for signing the treaty. People regard it as a  guarantee of peace and stability; mind you, we never had any  destabilization between people in the past, but the treaty gives  them more confidence.    I would like to mention in particular the fact that we are  receiving a lot of letters and telephone calls from the Tatar  diaspora who are living in CIS countries as well as Russia.  They are saying that we have taken a great burden of  uncertainty off their shoulders. Certainly, the fact that the  treaty clarified and dotted all the "i"s in our relations with  the Russian Federation gives us confidence in our future.    [Latypov] One knows about the attitude by some members of  the  State Duma to the Russian-Tatarstan treaty. In particular,  [Sergey] Baburin [leader of the Russian Path parliamentary  group] said on television that the treaty was unacceptable. He  wanted to stress once again that Russia had nothing to agree on  with Tatarstan. On the other side, the opinions of radical  nationalists in Kazan are just as acrimonious. It seems to me  they have something in common, don't you think?    [Shaymiyev] I don't think it is anything -- in this  particular case they agree utterly and completely. This is a  demonstration of chauvinism, Russian on the one side and Tatar  on the other. This is unacceptable. These are extremes.    [Latypov] You said Tatarstan will not stop at this treaty.  What will happen next?    [Shaymiyev] We are resolutely in favor of decentralization  of  Russian economy. Without resolving this problem, we will not be  able to succeed in achieving further progress in the economic  reforms.    More opportunities should be provided so that the reforms  could be implemented on the ground. The fact that the treaty  was signed means we are approaching a democratic federal  structure in the Russian Federation.    One should pay tribute to the understanding demonstrated by  Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin. Both he and we have undertaken  great responsibility as a result of signing the treaty.</p>

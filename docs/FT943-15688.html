			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Russians 'now proto-member of a new G8' The Naples summit this weekend could mark a sea-change in western views about Russia's ability to re-emerge as a stable society with a dynamic economy, according to the authors of a projection of Russian trends to the year 2010. 'Russia will be participating in the Naples summit both as an object of the G7's concern and as a proto-member of the new G8,' Mr Daniel Yergin told bankers and oil industry executives at Lehman Brothers in London this week. 'The most important outcome is likely to be a shift in focus from the provision of aid to the encouragement of trade and investment in Russia.' According to this view Russia was 'no longer perceived as the Evil Empire but the newest of the emerging markets,' he added. Mr Thane Gustafson, co-author with Mr Yergin of Russia 2010, added that after months travelling the country he concluded that 'big private money in Russia is acquiring new political power, and this is the underlying factor behind the political calm which has appeared in recent months.' One under-appreciated factor working in Russia's favour was the way faxes and other modern communications technology could facilitate integration into the global economy. Other positive factors included Russia's well educated population, vast natural resources and the force of 75 years of pent-up demand. But one of the most important issues still facing Russia was how to attract back the Dollars 40bn to Dollars 50bn of flight capital which Mr Gustafson called 'hover-capital' - poised to return, provided the Russian government allowed a form of amnesty as advocated by Mr Victor Gerashchenko, chairman of the Russian central bank. 'Recent years have seen a vast transfer of wealth from the state to private hands. Russia now has several dollar billionaires, hundreds of millionaires and increasingly powerful banks. Most of these fabulous fortunes were accumulated when the rouble was heavily undervalued two years ago and assets flooded out of the country. Now the new capitalists are powerful and are starting to look for investment opportunities in Russia. They reflect the irreversibility of economic reform in Russia where the command economy simply no longer exists,' Mr Gustafson said. While capital flowed out of Russia in vast amounts, factory managers were becoming the new owners of Russian physical assets through the mass privatisation process. 'This means that the new owners of property, mainly factory managers, have property but no capital. What is needed is a marriage between the new proprietors and those who own capital now held overseas.' Mr Gustafson said the case for an amnesty was stronger because a nearly bankrupt government was unable to balance the budget or invest because it was only able to levy taxes on the captive state sector and was incapable of raising taxes from the vibrant private sector. 'The solution has to be found through private domestic and foreign investment not the state investment which played the key role in Soviet and Czarist times.' Until now, however, Russia had received less than Dollars 2bn in equity investment from the west, compared with more than Dollars 100bn that has flowed into China. Increasing this flow would require action and new thinking by both the government and investors, said Mr Gustafson. As G7 leaders in Naples prepared to discuss ways of making investment and trade more attractive, Mr Gustafson suggested to potential investors that the way to make profits was through 'hands-on management' by executives based in Russia and an awareness 'that the best protection is not a good lawyer but a good partner'.

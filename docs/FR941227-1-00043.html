The reason for this approach is that it is more effective to issue general decisions on the export of all specimens of a species harvested in a given State and season than to issue such decisions separately for each permit application. This is especially true for CITES Appendix II species that are frequently exported, such as the American alligator. On May 26, 1992 (57 FR 21896), the Service published rules granting export approval for American alligators ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Alligator mississippiensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> ) from specified States for the 1992&hyph;1994 harvest seasons. Subsequently, based on advice from the Office of Scientific Authority and the Office of Management Authority, the Service also approved the export of farm-raised American alligators from the State of Arkansas for the 1994 harvest season. The purpose of this current proposal is to develop a rule that will allow the export of legally taken American alligators (hides, meat, parts, and products) for the 1995&hyph;1997 harvest years from previously approved States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scientific Authority Findings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Article II, paragraph 2, of CITES establishes that Appendix II shall include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) All species which although not necessarily now threatened with extinction may become so unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulations in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Other species which must be subject to regulation in order that trade in specimens of certain species referred to in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph may be brought under effective control. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The American alligator is listed in Appendix II to respond both to problems of potential threat to the survival of the species [CITES Article II.2(a)] and of the similarity of appearance to other crocodilians that are threatened with possible extinction [CITES Article II.2(b)]. Article IV of CITES requires that an export permit for any specimen of a species included in Appendix II shall only be granted when certain findings have been made by the Scientific Authority and Management Authority of the exporting country. The marking of hides with specified tags, the marking and documentation of shipments of meat and parts, and the issuance of export permits specifically for American alligator parts and products is considered sufficient to address the issue of identification due to similarity in appearance between American alligators and other listed crocodilian species. Because the alligator is listed partly due to the potential threat to its survival based on previous population declines that have been reversed in most parts of its range in the United States, the Service must determine that allowing exports and thereby stimulating harvest will not be detrimental to the survival of the species itself.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Scientific Authority must develop advice on nondetriment for the export of Appendix II species in accordance with Section 8A of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended. The Act states that the Secretary of the Interior, ``shall base such determinations and advice given by him under Article IV of the CITES with respect to wildlife upon the best available biological information derived from professionally accepted wildlife management practices; but is not required to make, or require any State to make, estimates of population size in making such determinations or giving such advice.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guidelines developed for Scientific Authority advice on exports of American alligator under provisions of CITES Article II.2(a), are summarized as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

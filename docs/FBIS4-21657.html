			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 7 Apr -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin  today signed an edict dismissing Anatoliy Kuntsevich from the  post of chairman of the committee for conventional problems  relating to chemical and biological weapons under the Russian  president for infringing his professional duties. Kuntsevich  found out about this edict, or rather his staff did, through an  NTV television report.    You will recall that Kuntsevich led the committee for  destroying chemical weapons [CW] and his name was mentioned in  connection with the Vil Mirzoyanov case. The recently freed  scientist himself, and his colleague Lev Fedorov -- who had  revealed departmental secrets of the military-chemical lobby --  talk of Kuntsevich as being one of their main opponents.</p>

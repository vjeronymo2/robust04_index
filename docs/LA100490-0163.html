			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAY LABORERS SAY EMPLOYER CHEATED THEM  </P> <P> Thirty immigrant day laborers demanding back wages surrounded an employer's  truck on a downtown Los Angeles street corner Wednesday morning, pounding on  the doors and standing on the front bumper until police arrived.  </P> <P> Amir Abdoul said he had gone to Main Street and 14th Place, as he often does,  to hire one or two workers to move large rolls of carpeting and fabric for his  company, Express Delivery Service. Instead, he was confronted first by Javier  Felix, a 21-year-old Mexican immigrant, who said he had not been paid for a  day's work he performed last month.  </P> <P> Soon, half a dozen other laborers who said they had also worked for Abdoul  approached the startled entrepreneur, along with others showing "solidarity"  with their fellow workers.  </P> <P> Abdoul denied having cheated the workers and no arrests were made. But the  incident illustrates some of the tensions at the Main Street intersection,  where more than 100 men gather every morning, hoping to earn about $5 an hour  performing manual labor.  </P> <P> Competition for jobs is tough. When pickups and other trucks approach the  intersection, groups of men sometimes push and shove each other in a desperate  bid to reach the prospective employer first.  </P> <P> Unable to find employment for several days, at least a dozen men currently  sleep on the sidewalk along 14th Place. And even those able to find work say  they are sometimes paid as little as $20 for a full day's hard labor.  </P> <P> So, when Abdoul arrived at the intersection and was challenged by Felix,  several of the immigrant men said they saw it as an opportunity to release  their frustration and anger.  </P> <P> "He came in his truck, we saw him and we didn't let him leave," Rigoberto Rocha  said in Spanish as police officers questioned Abdoul and a handful of the  workers. "All of the raza (Latino men) surrounded the truck. How are we going  to let him get away with something like that?"  </P> <P> Felix said he had been hired by Abdoul three weeks ago. After working eight  hours lifting rugs at several sites downtown, he said he asked for the $40  promised him by Abdoul. But the boss was nowhere to be found at the end of the  day and Abdoul's other employees merely shrugged their shoulders when Felix  asked for his pay.  </P> <P> Abdoul acknowledged hiring Felix. But he added that the day laborer had worked  only half a day and then quit because Abdoul denied him a lunch break.  </P> <P> The entrepreneur said he was surprised to see Felix again Wednesday, this time  banging at the window of his truck.  </P> <P> Abdoul said he would no longer be hiring men at the intersection.  </P> <P> "I'm not coming here anymore. This is my last time" he said. "It's too crazy."  </P> <P> Police officers separated the angry day laborers from Abdoul, suggesting that  the workers go to the state labor commissioner's office on nearby Broadway to  file a complaint.  </P> <P> "We don't get involved, we just keep the peace," said Sgt. Barry Staggs. "As  far as we're concerned, it's a civil matter. It's for Judge (Joseph) Wapner (of  television's 'The People's Court') to decide."  </P> <P> As Abdoul started his truck and began to leave, a few day laborers waved at him  from across Main Street.  </P> <P> "Did you need any workers?" they shouted in Spanish and English.  </P> <P> Abdoul ignored them and drove away.  </P></p>

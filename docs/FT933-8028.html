			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Arts: A new 'Foscari' and a concert 'Cos' By the end of this decade there will be no such thing as rare Verdi. The Royal Opera's grand design of staging all the Verdi operas in time for the centenary of the composer's death in 2001 is already causing ripples of activity away from London, where the productions of some of the early operas are being seen first. I due Foscari is one of them - a co-production between the Royal Opera and Scottish Opera. Although widely neglected for being excessively gloomy, this is in fact one early Verdi work which British audiences have seen relatively recently, when English National Opera put it on in the late 1970s. On that occasion economy imposed an ironic twist upon the opera: painted backdrops were borrowed from Johann Strauss's comic operetta A Night in Venice with the result that Verdi's tragedy was played out in front of pretty picture-postcard sets. None of that here. The production team at Scottish Opera - Howard Davies (producer) and Ashley Martin-Davies (designer) - had shut out any glimpse of Venetian canals, piazzas and watery vistas. They stress the dark, indoor drama about the city's shady political activities with the Venetian Council of Ten meeting in secret session to pronounce harsh judgments on those who have transgressed its laws. Theirs is a Venice of austere simplicity. The same bare hallway affords access to the council-chamber and doubles as the dungeon, when prison-bars are lowered across the stage. For the council-scene itself rows of seats pop up through the floor, not without some mechanical hitches; coat-hangers conveniently descend from the ceiling when the councillors need to don their robes. As in so many Verdi productions at the moment, the councillors wear everyday clothes of the composer's period, but robe themselves for duty in medieval style (as though to emphasise Verdi's choice of a 15th-century story to clothe his 19th-century political views). No matter what they wear, the Scottish Opera chorus seems to sing splendidly at the moment and the orchestra was in no less fine form. Richard Armstrong made a name for himself early on with his Verdi conducting and this I due Foscari was vigorous, rhythmical, energetic. At a time when Verdi singers of calibre are hard to find, the company has not fared badly. The Chinese tenor Deng (no Christian name, easier to spell than Pavarotti) is an interesting addition to the ranks of Italian-opera tenors. He is no actor, though he enjoys himself staggering about as the condemned Jacopo Foscari, covered in tomato ketchup. His singing is confident, plausibly Italianate in sound, though not in vocal mannerisms. First-night nerves unfortunately had the soprano, Katerina Kudriavchenko, wandering all over the place in pitch during her poetic entrance aria. She has the quiet, floated top notes for it, though, and enough force in a venue the size of the King's Theatre to give Lucrezia's big moments some punch. Her Italian is indistinct. The young tenor Richard Coxon made his mark as Barbarigo; Nicolas Cavallier sang with firm, youthful bass tone as Loredano. The scene was set for a reasonable show, when fate intervened. The baritone Frederick Burchinal, the evening's Francesco Foscari, went down with bronchitis and elected to act his role while it was sung for him from the wings. This is never a satisfactory solution and it would surely have been better for everybody if Phillip Joll had been allowed to complement his proudly stentorian singing by playing the character, however simply, on stage. Scottish Opera's Managing Director announced wittily to the audience that this was a performance when they would get 'I tre Foscari' - a good line, but next time a different solution would be preferred. Otherwise Verdi was well enough served. (Sponsored by Hertz.) ***** When you go back to a masterpiece you know, you find that you don't know it. Its component parts add up to something new in your mind, and you find new meanings in it. This is probably more so with Cos fan tutte than with any other Mozart opera. The balance between delight and pain in its tale of love is always different. The women's betrayal of their fiances - cos fan tutte, all women do so - and the men's efforts to find them false: the degrees of feeling, folly, irresponsibility, heartlessness, in all this are forever shifting. When Charles Mackerras conducts Cos fan tutte, he often heightens your sense of unfamiliarity by his way with the text. He customarily adds ornaments, opens cuts, and chooses lesser-known alternative versions of certain numbers; and so it was in Monday's Usher Hall concert performance - employing a text different in several details from the Cos he conducted with Welsh National a few seasons ago. Guglielmo's first aria was given in a little-known version, Despina and Alfonso sang their duet, Ferrando sang all his arias, acres of oft-deleted recitative was restored. And all of it was alive, spontaneous. And sparkling. The opera's latterday commentators often exaggerate its quasi-tragic pains. True, if there is a key word in da Ponte's libretto, it is tradimento (betrayal); the women at the end admit that they deserve to die for it. But Mackerras reminds us that Cos, not least when dealing with betrayal, is both fun and sensuous. The libretto, after all, is full of oxymora - 'sweet pain,' 'dear sighs,' and so on. Those who enter this opera's cruel trap are also those who find most bliss there. The world-class cast was an appealing mix. At its core was Felicity Lott (ravishingly attired) as Fiordiligi: utmost elegance, liquid phrasing, gleaming tone, vivid diction, thrilling dignity, tenderest emotion - an ideal exemplum of multi-faceted sensibility. Marie McLaughlin (a potential Fiordiligi who has recorded Despina) sang Dorabella with Latin warmth and impulsiveness, equally natural in the tragedy-queen heroics of her first aria and the delicious erotic surrender of the second. (Both her gown and her hairdo had one idea too many, which could be in character.) Jerry Hadley plays Ferrando as a callous buffoon, a prat whose prank pratfalls himself. He brought off all three arias with fluency - but why so loud? He even orated the climactic seduction duet as if to a packed forum. Alessandro Corbelli, though often drowned by Hadley in ensemble, is a Guglielmo who illumined the rarely-heard 'Rivolgete a lui' and other passages with firm tone and vivid utterance. Nuccia Focile's pellucid, bright Despina and Gilles Cachemaille's detached, urbane Alfonso both know the way of the world so well that they hardly seem to steer events at all - they just nudge things along their natural course. All praise to the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, playing for Mackerras with panache, luscious tone and wit. Though the great solos and duets of this Cos were warmly applauded, its great events were its larger ensembles. These so fizzed with dancing rhythms and changing dynamics that we, spectators, became as helplessly involved as any participant onstage.</p>

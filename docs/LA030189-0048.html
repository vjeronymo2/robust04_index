			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELIZABETH TAYLOR'S DRUG DOSAGES PROBED  </P> <P> Several physicians are under investigation by state and local prosecutors to  determine whether they over-prescribed potentially addictive drugs to actress  Elizabeth Taylor, a Los Angeles County district attorney's spokesman said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Although the 57-year-old actress was not available for comment, she  acknowledged a year and a half ago that she underwent treatment for addiction  to painkiller pills and alcohol.  </P> <P> District attorney's spokesman Al Albergate would say only that the  investigation involves allegations that excessive amounts of various opiates,  barbiturates and stimulants were prescribed for Taylor. Neither the drugs nor  the doctors were identified.  </P> <P> The inquiry, Albergate said, is being conducted by the state attorney general's  office with the assistance of the district attorney.  </P> <P> "We're not talking about a prescription mill that prescribes for people off the  street," said Albergate. "We're talking about one patient -- who happens to  have celebrity status."  </P> <P> When the attorney general's office investigation ends, Albergate said, "they  will turn it over to us to make a decision on whether to file a criminal  complaint."  </P> <P> The district attorney's office, he said, could simply refer the matter to the  state Board of Medical Quality Assurance for disciplinary action.  </P> <P> The investigation reportedly began after state officials noticed that excessive  amounts of potentially addictive drugs had been prescribed for Taylor.  </P> <P> State Department of Justice spokeswoman Kati Corsaut said prescriptions for  Schedule 2 drugs -- those with a high potential for addiction -- must be  written in triplicate on forms provided by the attorney general's office.  </P> <P> Taylor went public about her addiction in August, 1987, when she told  Cosmopolitan magazine there was "no question" she would have died without  treatment at the Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho Mirage.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> Interview with Sergey Glazyev, former RF Minister of Foreign </F> Economic Relations, by Yuriy Kozlov, time and place not given]    [Text] Sergey Glazyev, formerly the youngest Russian  minister, was born on 1 January 1961 in Zaporozhye. He graduated  from MGU [Moscow State University] with distinction in the field  of economic cybernetics. He is a doctor of sciences. He has  published some 100 scholarly works and articles on issues of  Soviet and Russian economic development. Since the early 1990's  he has worked on problems of the structural crisis in the Soviet  and Russian economy and development of approaches to overcome  it. From 23 December 1992 to 21 September 1993 he was Russian  minister of foreign economic relations. During the time that he  worked in this post he was able to overcome the downward trend  in exports, increase the export of finished products, and reach  a stable positive balance of trade. He retired on 21 September  1993 in disagreement with Presidential Edict No 1400, entitled  "Constitutional Reform in Stages," which he believed violated  the Constitution. He is a deputy to the State Duma and chairman  of the State Duma Committee on foreign economic policy.    [Kozlov] Sergey Yuryevich, how would you describe the  present  state of affairs in the Russian economy?    [Glazyev] As not very reassuring. The paramount problem now  is the state budget, a draft of which is being reviewed in the  Duma right now. The actual economic policy which is concealed in  this draft will not help the country out of economic crisis and  gives no guarantees against plunging into hyperinflation and a  disastrous decline in production. The validity of the  macroeconomic hypothesis on which the draft budget is based  raises grave doubts. The budget itself does not fit this  hypothesis in its income and expenditure parts. For example, the  income part for foreign economic activity is greatly  understated. Budget income from the profit tax is exaggerated.    [Kozlov] And yet the budget was written by professionals...    [Glazyev] We can assume that they were guided by the 7-8  percent growth rate which occurred at the end of last year.  Beginning from this they calculated the approximate levels of  income and expenditures. The reality, however, proved much  harsher. According to expert estimates the drop in production  may be much more than expected and could be somewhere on the  order of 20-25 percent. Naturally, this will make it impossible  to reduce the rate of inflation and will put the country on the  brink of a plunge into hyperinflation. In January of this year  the drop in machinebuilding production reached almost 50 percent  compared with last year. Possibly this is not felt much in  governmental structures, but the workers whose enterprises have  shut down and the sectors whose production volume has decreased  several times over are undergoing a disaster today.    [Kozlov] Can we speak of even a rough balance in the budget?    [Glazyev] There is an obvious discrepancy in priorities in  the expenditure part. It is contemplated that enormous amounts  of money will be spent to maintain the fuel-energy complex and  agriculture, while inadequate amounts are envisioned for  science-intensive industry, conversion, and stimulating growth  in high-tech production areas. The obvious disproportions of the  budget message, its unreliability to put it one way, lead me to  think that we have to help the Government formulate a normal  economic policy and an acceptable budget.    [Kozlov] Isn't that what the Supreme Soviet, of sad memory,  was striving for?    [Glazyev] Well, so everything in life repeats itself. In all  likelihood we will propose to the Government that they join  forces with specialists from the State Duma. This kind of  initiative is in the spirit of recent steps of the Federal  Assembly, President, and the opposition to achieve civil peace  and consensus.    [Kozlov] When can we expect adoption of a refined and  amended  budget?    [Glazyev] We must try to see that the country enters the  second half of the year with a ratified budget for 1994. Then we  will immediately be able to begin work on the budget for the  next year.    [Kozlov] Incidentally, what happened to the recently  published anticrisis program of academicians Abalkin, Petrakov,  and Shatalin, the Saburov program, and indeed, your own program,  Sergey Yuryevich?    [Glazyev] They were certainly considered in preparation of  the President's Message to the Federal Assembly, but they were  not actually reflected in the Government's economic policy.    [Kozlov] What do you think of the term "Ukainization of the  economy?" Much has already been said about the similarity of  negative processes occurring in the Russian and Ukrainian  economies. What differences do you see?    [Glazyev] The term "Ukrainization" is improper from the  start. Objectively speaking, Ukraine is in a completely  different foreign economic situation than Russia. Russia today  has a stable positive balance of trade with a very significant  excess of export over import. Ukraine, on the contrary, has a  large and chronic trade deficit. It seems to me that without  large-scale foreign aid it will be hard for Ukraine to overcome  its economic crisis.    [Kozlov] What can you say about the current structure of  Russian export? The anticrisis program which you authored  envisions mechanisms to get back the many billions of dollars  which have settled in the foreign bank accounts of a small  number of Russians. How do you intend to do this?    [Glazyev] The structure of Russian export has now changed  for  the worse. Its raw material component has intensified anew. As  for domestic capital abroad, by last summer the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations had introduced a system to monitor  foreign currency revenue from export of raw materials. It was  fairly well thought out and had technical support, but  unfortunately, in the second half of the year it practically  ceased operations. We were not able to stop the leakage of  foreign currency income abroad. Generally speaking, there is  nothing difficult in monitoring export and import. The  appropriate instruments have been well-known for a long time.  Everything depends on the desire of the Central Bank, Ministry  of Finance, State Customs Committee, and Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations to take the appropriate measures. Judging by  everything, they still do not have this desire. But everything  is determined by the macroeconomic situation in the country.  Repressive measures produce little here. But if conditions for  stabilization are secured the investment climate will change for  the better and legal capital will begin to return. As for  investment by Russian natural and legal persons in physical  assets abroad, in particular in real estate, this capital is  lost forever.    [Kozlov] What is your attitude toward the method established  in Russia for determining the exchange rate of the ruble in  auctions at the interbank currency exchange? How well does the  rate that is formed correspond to the actual ratio of the ruble  and the dollar?    [Glazyev] It seems to me that determination of the exchange  rate should be a significant, independent element of government  economic policy. The rate today is established in a largely  unplanned way. It is subject to such fluctuations that exporters  and importers cannot make long-term or even medium-term  forecasts. It is essential to have an exchange rate policy that  is independent, intelligible, and predictable for all  participants in economic activity. I do not think that the  exchange rate of the ruble today is too low, though. That is, of  course, if you do not take account of non-commodity, embodied  Russian assets. The stock market, the market for capital still  has not started working in Russia. Therefore the exchange rate  is formed exclusively in the commodity market.    [Kozlov] The last 100 days of voucher privatization have  come. In your view, has it been possible to accomplish the  assigned tasks within the framework of the model chosen by  Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee on Administration of State  Property]?    [Glazyev] I do not think so. Effective ownership mechanisms  have not been created in the economy. We do not know who  three-quarters of the privatized enterprises today belong to. If  we consider the fact that 80 percent of the commercial banks  were formed by industrial enterprises, we will see that the  ownership system which has developed among them is the system of  an undeveloped market economy--the so-called "Yugoslav model."  It leads to chronic depression, galloping inflation, economic  disintegration, and separatism. Perhaps the time has come to  look around and move toward creation of an effective system of  market-based ownership relations and not carry this hopeless  scheme to its final "triumph."    [Kozlov] On the one hand everyone talks of consensus and  national reconciliation, while on the other they intimidate you  with another round of confrontation...    [Glazyev] The dividing line does not run between advocates  and opponents of the reforms. It lies between those who want to  establish order, attain economic success, and overcome the  crisis and those who continue to rock the boat, instill  radicalism in public opinion, frighten the people with civil  war, and stir things up, creating muddy waters which they  themselves take advantage of.</p>

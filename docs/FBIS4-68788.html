			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Pankov: "Communism Will Live. And We?"] </F>   [Text] As distinct from many other of the present  "members of the opposition," A. Lukyanov has been at the helm of  state. And this being so, he has to bear the responsibility, if  only moral, for the humiliating position in which our people  have found themselves. But do you hear in his words even a hint  of an apology or remorse? You do not.    We have before us a most experienced, resourceful  politician,  armed, what is more, with the skills of legal and verbal  tightrope-walking. But this is required in order to have been  able to come up with the lawyer's opus: Lenin is in practice  buried inasmuch as his body is below ground level. In this case  I will prove as surely as two and two make four that Lenin's  body lies above the level of any Moscow cemetery and,  consequently, cannot be considered buried.... And each homeless  person whose corpse lies in a basement may also be deemed to  have been committed to the earth?    Other arguments of the ex-chairman of the Supreme Soviet are  constructed on the same "logic" also.    Who now declares out loud that he is against reforms? Only a  political suicide, perhaps! Anatoliy Ivanovich has survived  Brezhnevism, Gorbachevism, and, judging by his ability to say  something or other or to remain silent, will survive Yeltsinism  also. You bet: He is, after all, for reforms! For good reforms.  Which the people need, which are to their benefit, not which  render them destitute. The poor people--to what have they been  reduced by the shock therapy!... And as though there was no  corrosion of the Soviet petrodollars, unchecked growth of the  military-industrial monster, degradation of the socialist  countryside, the extinction of an entire region--the center of  Russia--the squandering of national resources for the support of  doomed totalitarian regimes....    He is, apparently, for reforms, but pro-communist reforms.  And this, which is clear even to V. Anpilov, has nothing in  common with the actual changes that the people are awaiting. And  somewhere over there, on the periphery, a civil war is under  way, yet he, the ideologist of communism, here, in the center,  has no opinion on this. And some people there will not  understand the president's vain attempts to establish civil  accord.... Anatoliy Ivanovich is, it would seem, prepared  even....    All "new Russians," apparently, emphatically all, are  coalescing with mafia circles and, of course, serving Western  capital.... Yet I have still not forgotten the clamorous  criminal trials of the 1980's, when the closest connection  between mafia-socialist trade and our Communist Party was  ascertained. And how could a member of the CPSU Central  Committee Politburo completely forget that there are among the  "new Russians" many of those that leaped across into  entrepreneurs' chairs from the Central Committee and the state  structures and that are, perhaps, turning over "party money"? It  is not nice to smear one's class brothers.    Our compatriots, apparently, are characterized by  spirituality and... collectivism, not Western capitalism, which,  as the CPSU-Communist Party of the Russian Federation has  revealed to us, is absolutely aspiritual, and we are not to be  suborned by their jeans (A.I. did not say, it is true, what is  to be done with the Western K. Marx or what the Bolsheviks did  with our native, celebrated cloth and other pants).    Lenin, apparently, made the peasantry and the workers happy.  Which ones? Those from whom he took away after the victory of  Soviet power the land and the factories? Those whom he executed  and starved to death?...    Of all that the former all-Union speaker had to say, I  understood one thing: B. Yeltsin will not achieve peace and  accord inasmuch as socialism and communism will live.... Whether  we all will survive here does not concern true communists and  loyal Leninists. As in all the preceding years of their control  of a country of slaves.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "A Gathering of Talents, Prosperous </F> Scientific and Technological Undertakings--Warm Congratulations  on Inauguration of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and  Opening of the Seventh Academicians Conference of the Chinese  Academy of Sciences"]    [Text] The Chinese Academy of Engineering [CAE] was  officially inaugurated on 3 June at the opening of the seventh  academicians conference of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  [CAS]. This is an event for celebrating.    The founding of the CAE is a grand event in China  engineering  circles. Engineering is the summary of the great practice of  mankind's application of scientific theories to transform,  utilize, and protect nature. Over the past 50 years or so, the  pace and scale of growth of engineering has been unprecedented,  which, in turn, is an immense direct motive force pushing the  economy forward. It has increasingly attracted attention of  science and technology circles and policy decisionmakers of all  countries. Over the decades, the broad ranks of engineering  personnel have exerted their utmost efforts and scored marked  successes in economic development and national defense  construction. They have built a large number of key projects  and basic facilities which developed as unique advantages in  certain fields and enhanced the pride and unity of the Chinese  nation. The founding of the CAE and election of a number of  outstanding engineering experts who have made major and creative  contributions as academicians will enormously encourage the  broad ranks of engineering personnel and exert a positive,  far-reaching influence on China's science, technology, and  economic construction.    Since its founding in 1955, CAS has rallied the nationally  acknowledged best scientists, who play an irreplaceable role in  laying down the country's major science and techology policy  decisions and certain economic and social development  strategies. The conference of academicians is the first of its  kind since the title of academy member has been changed to  academician in light of international practice. The first group  of foreign academicians at CAS will be elected at the  conference. This is one of the signs indicating that China's  science and technology circles have opened their door wider to  the outside world and have stepped on the stage of world  science, which will play an important role in promoting  international scientific and technological cooperation and  exchanges and pushing forward China's scientific and  technological development.    Academician of the CAE and CAS is the highest academic title  in China's science, technology, and engineering circles. These  academicians are outstanding representatives of the 17 million  scientific workers and engineers. Among the academicians of the  two academies, there are masters of great learning and integrity  of the elder generation as well as young talented people who  have made outstanding contributions in their respective fields.  The gathering of talents at the conference of the two academies  manifests the prosperity of China's science and engineering  cause.    The reform of China's science and technology system is now  developing in depth. Reform means emancipation of productive  forces and, above all, rapidly developing science and  technology, and swiftly converting it into real productive  forces through all sorts of engineering. In the course of  deepened reform, it is necessary to correctly handle relations  between our own innovation and importing advanced technology and  between science and technology and the economy, dialectically  unite the two, and bring about a sustained, rapid, and healthy  growth of China's economy. We should invigorate work which  directly serves economic construction and concentrate picked  forces to stabilize and support work which represents the  Chinese nation in competing on the international stage of  science. It is necessary to stress a sense and spirit of  innovation in whatever work we do. Only in this way can we  catch up with the advanced and gain a foothold in the sharp  international competition. We hope that the academicians of the  CAS and CAE will unite, guide the science and technology workers  of the whole nation, and make new contributions to the  revitalization of the Chinese nation.</p>

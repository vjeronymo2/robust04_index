			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (4): A workhorse more liberal than Colbertist / Profile of Gerard Longuet GERARD LONGUET is one of the new government's workhorses. This energetic 47 year old has overall responsibility for industry and foreign trade, as well as posts and telecommunications for which he was minister in 1986-88. Les Echos, the economic daily, said of Mr Longuet: 'If there can be such a person as a liberal-Colbertist, it is him.' Economic liberalism favouring free trade and deregulation goes against the long tradition of French state intervention in industry established by Colbert in the 17th century. This apparent contradiction is likely to manifest itself in Mr Longuet's determination to shake up what remains of state-controlled industry and public utilities, after privatisation, while standing up for France's national interests in the EC and in the Gatt negotiations. It falls chiefly to Mr Longuet to watch over the 14 non-farm areas of the Gatt negotiations, where the Balladur government is now pushing so hard for progress. Do not expect from him any softness when it comes to imports of textiles from Asia or cars from Japan. Piloting the privatisation bill through parliament is the responsibility of Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister. But Mr Longuet's role may be crucial to bringing some of the weaker privatisation candidates to market. For instance, he has served notice that the government no longer has the means - even if the EC would permit it - to bankroll Bull, the state-controlled computer maker which has lost FFr15bn in the past three years, and that Bull, which is on the privatisation list, needs a new strategy. In general terms, Mr Longuet wants to bring capable industrial partners into state enterprises, before as well as during their stock market floatation, and would like to see privatisation accompanied by a capital increase. He has in mind Alcatel, which was worth FFr 6bn when it went private in 1987 as Compagnie Generale d'Electricite and is now worth some FFr 80bn (after considerable acquisitions). And he sees no reason why part of the big public utilities' activity - should not be subjected to competition, some of it from other EC utilities. Mr Languet has started out slightly more liberal than Colbertiste in tone. Deepening recession may, however, reinforce the latter tendency.</p>

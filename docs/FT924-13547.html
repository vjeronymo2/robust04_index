			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Further 121 NHS hospitals apply to join self-governing trusts A FURTHER 121 National Health Service hospitals and community health services in England have applied to join the fourth wave of self-governing trusts in April 1994, Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said yesterday. With 284 trusts due to be operating by April 1993, that will bring the total number of trusts to more than 400 - covering some 95 per cent of hospitals and community services in England. Dr Mawhinney said the creation of trusts had brought an 8.2 per cent increase in the number of patients treated during the first year.</p>

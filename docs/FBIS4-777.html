			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by A Thomson] </F>   [Text] Mmabatho April 14 SAPA -- Bophuthatswana Joint  Administrator Tjaart van der Walt on Thursday [14 April] night  refuted a report that the homeland was on the brink of going out  of control. A South African Broadcasting Corporation [SABC]  report quoted Dr van der Walt's co-administrator Mr Job Mokgoro  as saying dissatisfied policemen in Mmabatho were demanding  payment of their pensions, law and order was threatened and this  month's elections could be affected.    Reacting to rumours that some policemen loyal to the deposed  government of Mr Lucas Mangope were threatening trouble during  the elections, Mr Mokgoro said sentiments expressed at a meeting  with policemen in Mmabatho on Thursday morning confirmed the  possibility of loyalty to the old order. He said the  Transitional Executive Council had been informed about the  deterioration of the situation in the homeland.    Dr van der Walt said he had attended the meeting with about  500 policemen and he had "not the least doubt" that the  Bophuthatswana police were committed to being officers of the  law, with responsibility to the community. After hearing the  SABC report, Dr van der Walt continued, he had held talks with  the acting commissioner of the Bophuthatswana Police and the  acting chief of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force, as well as the  officer commanding the South African Defence Force contingent in  the territory. "They were unanimous that, of course, the  situation in Bophuthatswana is volatile, but definitely not out  of control," he said. "There are all kinds of political  tensions and we are very much concerned about the efficiency of  the public service but, for example, the crime rate is lower  than it was a year ago. There is no need for panic."    Regarding the elections, Dr van der Walt said: "If the  public  service isn't functioning effectively it will be difficult to  have free and fair elections. However, we are sure the tide is  turning."    On Tuesday the Executive Council Task Force on the Public  Service held talks with the joint administrators, and a council  for administration was established in the homeland.    "We are certainly making progress. Yesterday (Wednesday)  morning I met (Dr) Frank Chikane of the Independent Electoral  Commission and both of us don't have the least doubt we will  have free and fair elections. "We still have to solve some  problems, that we don't deny, but the situation has improved  over the past few weeks."    Dr van der Walt said he had not yet had the opportunity to  discuss the SABC report with Mr Mokgoro.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Airbus chief wants a Nasa for Europe THE HEAD of Airbus Industrie yesterday called for a European equivalent of the US National Aeronautical and Space Administration (Nasa) to be set up in order to fund research and development in European commercial aerospace programmes. Mr Jean Pierson, the consortium's managing director, said it was crucial for governments to give greater backing to commercial aircraft programmes at a time when the US, through Nasa, was increasing support for its aircraft industry. Such action had become all the more important with the sharp decline in the defence business which had traditionally supported research and development funding in commercial projects. Mr Pierson suggested that some of the Dollars 800m in launch aid which Airbus was due to repay this year should go to research and technology development for future commercial aircraft. 'The Airbus partners (France, Germany, Britain and Spain) must now invest in the longer-term future,' he said. 'If you want to survive, you must look ahead and invest.' Mr Pierson made his proposal as the European consortium rolled out its latest airliner, the twin-engine, wide-bodied A330. Company officials said the consortium's operations now directly employed about 60,000 people in Europe. In the UK alone, 300 companies were working on Airbus business. Airbus has become increasingly concerned by disagreements among its partners on significant aerospace projects, especially the European fighter aircraft (EFA), and new regional aircraft programmes. They warned that the dispute between Britain and Germany over the future of the EFA could have serious repercussions on European aerospace collaboration on the civil side. Mr Pierson said: 'We must be very careful to remain united in our goal to build up a successful commercial European aircraft industry if we don't want to lose out to our American competitors in 10 years' time.' Airbus this week announced a further scaling down in its aircraft production rate over the next three years in response to the slump in civil aviation. It has also delayed the launch of the A319, a shortened version of its A320 twin-engine, 150-seater. The consortium is expected to show another operating profit this year after reporting a surplus of about Dollars 250m (Pounds 145.3m) last year. Mr Pierson said the European partners could not 'just sleep' because of the commercial success of the consortium which had gained a 26 per cent share of the world commercial airliner market in the past 20 years.</p>

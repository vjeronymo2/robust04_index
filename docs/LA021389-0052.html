			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUATEMALA 'MODEL CITIES' PROVE MORE LIKE PRISONS  </P> <P> This tiny hamlet in the remote mountains of Guatemala is to be a model city,  government officials say, a place where people displaced by civil war can renew  their lives with all the services and security the government can provide.  </P> <P> But to many of the people who live here, Xexucap is a kind of prison.  </P> <P> Xexucap, pronounced Shay-shu-cup in the language of the area's Ixil Indians, is  the newest of half a dozen villages ordered built since 1983 to resettle  peasants hiding in the mountains as a result of Guatemala's war with Marxist  rebels.  </P> <P> About an hour's walk to the east, over the dirt path that connects Xexucap with  the rest of the world, lies Acul, one of the oldest and most complete of the  model cities. Acul appears to be an almost idyllic place -- neat rows of wooden  houses with red-tile roofs laid out on an orderly grid halfway up the  mountainside.  </P> <P> There is electricity (even a couple of television sets) and community water  taps within easy walking distance of every front door. Each house has its own  garden, and the residents share the fruits of a fertile common growing area in  the valley below.  </P> <P> But this is no Happy Valley. Most of the families cannot afford to pay for the  electricity, so they sit in the dark and too often drink the night away with  moonshine that rots the mind and body. After dark, the streets are an obstacle  course strewn with people passed out in the mud.  </P> <P> The Swiss-like order of the place offends most of the 1,600 residents, Indians  who for centuries lived far from their neighbors, free to farm their own small  plots, free to let their pigs and chickens roam, free to come and go at will.  </P> <P> None of this is possible in Acul or Xexucap, or in any of the other  resettlement villages. These people -- now totaling 4,600 -- were brought in by  force. They cannot live on their own land or leave the village without the  permission of the head of a civil defense committee appointed by the army.  Houses must be within a few yards of one another and livestock must be kept  separate from the village.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aid Seldom Delivered  </P> <P> Worst of all, according to many residents, the promised government aid is  seldom delivered.  </P> <P> "There is no work, no money, and the people are hungry," an Acul resident said.  He said his name is Juan, and like nearly all the people interviewed in the  villages, he asked not to be fully identified.  </P> <P> Another resident, Tomas, said that until 1982 he, his wife and their seven  children lived on their own land, a boulder-strewn plot of less than an acre  about 10 minutes' walk from Xexucap. They grew corn as a cash crop and raised  chickens and pigs for their table.  </P> <P> It was a severe existence, but for the Ixil Indians, who still wear the  brightly colored clothing of their Mayan ancestors and follow the ancient  customs, it was their way of life.  </P> <P> For Tomas, the war became a reality when guerrillas began operating in the  region and the army reacted. The army has a reputation for disregarding human  rights, to the extent that the United States has refused to provide military  aid.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Than 30 Killed  </P> <P> One night, troops purportedly looking for guerrillas worked over the area from  Acul to Xexucap, killing more than 30 people, including women and children, and  destroying dozens of houses.  </P> <P> "I went to a controlled area," Tomas said, referring to the mountainous areas  where the rebels held sway until the military, aided by helicopters armed with  bombs and rockets, recently drove the rebels away and reduced their strength  from 12,000 to about 1,200.  </P> <P> Even though "there was nothing to eat," Tomas and his family stayed with the  guerrillas until last February, when the rebels were forced to retreat and the  army bombed the camp where Tomas was living.  </P> <P> Government officials in Guatemala City say that people like Tomas were  persuaded to leave the mountains voluntarily after the army assured them they  would be safe and would be given health care, food, housing and job training.  </P> <P> But Tomas said he left "because of the helicopters."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Temporary Shelter  </P> <P> He spoke softly, aware of the government agent with a rifle who had quietly  edged up to the clearing in front of the hut Tomas had built from branches as a  temporary shelter, until the government provides building materials.  </P> <P> "They told us everything was all right," Tomas said, "but then they bombed us.  They bombed us one day for four hours. It was very close, and we were afraid.  Then they landed and took us out."  </P> <P> At first, Tomas and his family were kept in a military camp near the town of  Nebaj, where he was interrogated.  </P> <P> "We sat there," he said, "with no work, no food, no clothing."  </P> <P> This was followed by three months at a re-education camp called Xemamatze on  the outskirts of Nebaj, a muddy place about the size of a football field within  a horseshoe-shaped collection of dank, foul-smelling buildings with raw,  Sheetrock walls that can accommodate about 600 people and a couple dozen  heavily armed soldiers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Teaching Them a Trade  </P> <P> The government says the purpose of Xemamatze is to re-educate the displaced  people, to teach them a trade while restoring their health and, at the same  time, instilling in them a sense of patriotism. In the beginning, there were as  many as 300 people in the camp at any one time. Now there are about 70 at a  time.  </P> <P> The job training often ended up being work -- baking, weaving and repairing  roads. When the Indians said they wanted to be paid for this labor, the  government stopped the training programs.  </P> <P> "There were no courses in education," Tomas said. "We asked for lessons, but  there were only lessons on saluting the flag, lessons on the dangers of  communism."  </P> <P> With a smile that revealed his broken teeth and scurvy-shrunken gums, he said:  "We learned the national anthem. It didn't bring any pay or food, but I know  the national anthem."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Told to Build a House  </P> <P> Tomas said he was taken to Acul, without being asked, and told to walk to  Xexucap and start building a house on a plot chosen by the army. He said he was  told that building materials "would be brought to us."  </P> <P> Government officials in Guatemala City said that wallboard and other materials  will be sent in, but they had no idea when.  </P> <P> If materials are sent in, it will be no easy task to get them to the building  site. Because there is no road to Xexucap, the people will have to haul them on  their backs from the end of the road at Acul.  </P> <P> This is what happened at Janlay, a resettlement village on a site so steep that  getting to it requires ropes. The people of Janlay hauled up cement foundation  blocks and Sheetrock, one piece at a time. A road was built only after the  village was completed and President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo was ready to come up  for an inaugural ceremony.  </P> <P> Still uncompleted is a water-purifying plant and pump. The 1,200 residents are  served by a single water tap.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Windows, Rotting Walls  </P> <P> "Life is calm here," a man in Janlay said, "but the houses don't have windows  and the walls rot. We should have wood but the government wouldn't give us  any."  </P> <P> Another complained that "we can't make enough money" from the corn and fruit  they grow. To survive, the men in Janlay and the other villages work "on the  coast," as they call the lowland plantations near the Pacific coast. And they  have to get the authorities' permission to do so.  </P> <P> To get to the coast takes as much as eight hours on foot and by bus. Pay on the  plantations there is at best the equivalent of $2.40 a day.  </P> <P> There may be a lack of work in the villages, but the army, which is in charge  of all the resettlement villages, finds non-paying tasks for the men. Every  male age 16 to 60 is forced to join the civil defense committee, even though  Gen. Gonzalo Menendez, the government's human rights attorney general, said  that "service is voluntary; it is unconstitutional to force anyone to join."  </P> <P> Still, according to Tomas and others, they have no choice.  </P> <P> "When I arrived in Acul," Tomas said, "the military commissioner told me I had  to serve several days a month."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Form of Coercion  </P> <P> According to government officials, the civil defense committees organize  patrols to protect the villages from the guerrillas. But human rights officials  say it is really a form of coercion and control, a way to compromise the people  and make the rebels think they are government agents.  </P> <P> At bottom, though, the village people say their principal problem is the lack  of services.  </P> <P> "We have a clinic," a man in Janlay said, "but there is no doctor, no medicine,  no food, nothing."  </P> <P> There are no teachers for Janlay's newly completed school, so the children are  as illiterate as their parents. Instead of going to school, they work. Girls  and boys alike, some as young as 4, make their way to Acul with bundles of  firewood weighing 50 pounds or more, hoping to sell the wood for a bit of  money.  </P> <P> In all the villages of the area, there was general agreement with the  sentiments expressed by Tomas, who said:  </P> <P> "Coming here was not our idea. The army told us we were going to do it. Life  was hard before, but it was our life. Now it isn't."  </P></p>

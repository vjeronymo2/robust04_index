Borowski, presenting to the Sejm the governments draft  budget  for 1994, said that the size of the planned deficit at 83  trillion zlotys (about 3.8 billion dollars) was "within the  boundaries of the possibility of its financing by the banks." He  also noted that servicing Poland's foreign and domestic debt in  1994 would amount to 112 trillion zlotys out of total forecast  expenditure of 693 trillion zlotys. Gross domestic product  should rise by about 4.5 percent, he noted.    Borowski told the chamber that the aim of the budget was to  further reduce inflation to 27 percent by mid-year and 23  percent by December, to accelerate the tempo of economic growth  and the growth in exports, and to limit cuts in the public  sector. Also, support for agriculture would be increased.    The public sector is likely to absorb about half of total  expenditure, but radical improvements in this sector can only  come after fundamental reforms of the social security and health  systems. He said that the government would present draft  proposals on social security by June, and proposals to reform  the system of family benefit payments would be presented by the  end of the first quarter of 1994.    Borowski also announced that the government is considering  plans to introduce a small levy on stock-market transactions,  and is also examining the possibility of taxing stock-market  earnings. Critics of the government who are demanding this, and  are looking for major inflows from such a tax "treat the issue  as a test of the governments leftism."    In his opinion, however, the government had more to gain  from  seeing the continued growth of the stock market, since this  would help to accelerate the introduction of new companies onto  the exchange. He noted that the successful recent flotation of  Bank Slaski (BSK) had brought over 3 trillion zlotys (about 140  million dollars) to the State Treasury. If income tax is  levied, it could result in a fall in share prices, and thus a  fall, rather than an increase, in budget revenues," he said.    Also addressing the Sejm, National Bank of Poland (NBP)  President Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz said that the draft budget  "illustrated in all its drama the problem of servicing the  public debt." If the public debt is financed by increasing the  state's debt with the banks, this amounts to the emission of  uncovered money - ie, inflation. She added that the NBP was  concerned that a lack of control over rising budget outgoings  could lead to a short-term increase in inflation.    The NBP president also dismissed as "harmful and in no way  justifiable," speculation that there might be a deep devaluation  of the Polish zloty. In 1993 Poland fulfilled all the criteria  in her agreements with the World Bank, including the rebuilding  of the foreign currency reserves. She emphasised that it is not  anticipated there will be changes to exchange-rate policy.    Earlier on Thursday, Ms Gronkiewicz-Waltz said in a radio  interview that since October, Poland's foreign currency reserves  had been held steady at 300 million dollars.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Urges Japanese Authorities </F> To Stop Crackdown on Chongnyon and Apologize for It" -- KCNA  headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  DPRK Foreign Ministry in a statement today demanded that the  Japanese authorities ponder over the grave consequences to be  entailed by their reckless acts, immediately stop their  crackdown on the General Association of Korean residents in  Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan and apologize for it.    Some time ago, the Japanese authorities sent scores of  mobile  police vehicles and some 1,000 policemen who encircled the Osaka  Prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and forcibly searched  office rooms of the headquarters, residences of its leading  officials and branch offices. Earlier, rightwing gangsters  under the manipulation of the authorities swarmed to a central  organ of Chongnyon and its affiliated organizations and kicked  up a row, even murdering a businessman of Chongnyon.    "This is a hostile act of encroaching upon the sovereignty  of  Chongnyon and crudely violating the democratic national rights  of Koreans in Japan and a challenge to the DPRK which cannot be  overlooked," the statement says, and goes on:    "We cannot but take a serious note of the fact that the  Japanese authorities are intensifying their suppression of  Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan, while intentionally aggravating  the situation over the fictitious 'nuclear issue' of the DPRK at  the instigation of the United States.    "Chongnyon is a peaceloving organization whose activities  are  officially recognized by the Japanese authorities and the  Japanese law and which enjoys full support of many countries and  organizations in the world.    "There is neither reason nor ground for Chongnyon to be an  object of crackdown by the Japanese authorities.    "Moreover, Koreans in Japan are innocent people who were  forcibly taken to Japan and subjected to hard toil under the  brutal Japanese imperialist rule, and their descendants.  Therefore, special protection must be granted to them by the  Japanese authorities.    "Far from apologizing for and liquidating the past crimes  committed against the Korean people, however, the Japanese  authorities are engaging in suppression of Koreans in Japan and  their legitimate organizations. This is an unpardonable act.    "We will consider any crackdown on Chongnyon an encroachment  upon the dignity and sovereignty of our Republic and decisively  counter it."    The statement expresses the hope that all the progressive  personages and broad sections of people in Japan and the world  will continue to express support and solidarity for the  righteous activities of Chongnyon for its democratic national  rights and national reunification.</p>

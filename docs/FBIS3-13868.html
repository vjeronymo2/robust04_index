It is the first time the  possibility of a split in the Army has emerged since President  Major General Liamine Zeroual assumed power 31 January.  However, well-informed sources have pointed out to AL-HAYAH  that the talk of a split in the Army is exaggerated in view of  the staunch relationship between the new president and senior  officers and the mutual trust between them. The sources pointed  out that, if there are criticisms against Zeroual in the Army,  they are focused on the way his aides are chosen, as most of  them lack experience.    Algerian sources have stressed that President Zeroual is  determined to initiate a "serious dialogue" with all influential  parties on the Algerian scene, "without excluding anyone," even  the FIS, which the authorities disbanded after the abolition of  the legislative election results in January 1992. After that  the FIS resorted to underground action, launching a war against  state organs.    Numerous parties are opposed to the dialogue with the FIS.  In the executive authority there are Prime Minister Redha Malek  and Interior Minister Selim Saadi. Proponents of this --  including politicians, thinkers, and media officials -- say that  a dialogue with the FIS would weaken the prestige of the state,  which should not submit to pressure from the supporters and  perpetrators of violence. While the opposition of a major  tendency inside the military establishment to the dialogue with  the FIS proceeds from the fear that if the FIS came to power  this would mean a purge campaign or trials aimed against a  number of senior officers, the other tendencies' opposition  proceeds from the conviction that, if the FIS came to power  democratically, it would not relinquish it democratically.    The disagreement between those supporting dialogue and those  opposed to it has remained concealed within the regime over the  past two years. The tendency opposed to the dialogue remained  on the winning side until Maj. Gen. Liamine Zeroual assumed the  presidency. But this change in the pyramid of power did not  abolish the oppositionists, who are still inside the military  command and at the head of government.    Some sources say that parties linked to those opposed to the  dialogue are behind many of the acts of violence and revenge  witnessed in the country recently, as these parties killed  members of the armed Islamic groups or some of their relatives  to avenge the murder operations aimed against elements in the  security services.

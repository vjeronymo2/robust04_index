			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: Moody's may cut debt rating at Coles Myer Moody's, the New York-based rating agency, said it was considering downgrading the short-term debt ratings of Coles Myer, the Australian retail group, writes Nikki Tait. The long-term debt ratings were put under review on July 21, when the retailer said it would buy back the 21.45 per cent stake in Coles held by Kmart, the US discount and specialist store group, for around ADollars 1.26bn (USDollars 920m). Moody's said its review would consider the potential increase in short-term debt resulting from the buy-back, and any longer-term increase in Coles' borrowings ratio.</p>

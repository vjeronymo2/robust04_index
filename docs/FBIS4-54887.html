			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Panta Dzambazoski: "Ethnic or Civil Sentences"] </F>   [Text] There have been a lot of police interventions  in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]  that have been unnecessarily politicized and turned into  scandals; why the police are being accused of "ethnic  selectivity" by both Macedonians and Albanians and Serbs....    Ever since several political parties have been functioning  in  Macedonian political life, some of the parties have been  constantly obsessed with the police. The parties try to  interpret in their own way any significant action by the police.  The national parties in the Macedonian bloc, especially  VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary  Organization-Democratic Party of Macedonian National Unity], are  "diligent" in this regard, as well as the Albanians' parties,  the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] and the NDP [National  Democratic Party]. In the past they have frequently demanded the  resignation of the minister of internal affairs. Is it just  because Macedonia is in a period of transition, because of the  incomplete transformation of the police, or because of the  stance of the parties which represent "their people" that we  have so many incidents, and scandals, behind us? Or, to put it  more simply, are political circles trying to clarify police  actions that have already been carried out?    Radolista, the Bit Market, the "All-Albanian Army," then  Djordje Petrov, Kuklis, the Veles trial, Blue Bird, Duvlo, and  finally, Kuceviste, and so forth, are cases of action by the  police that were interpreted differently by the parties, and  after which there were demands that the head of the police be  held accountable. The issue of exceeding authority was always  raised.  <H5>  When One Has the Same Standard... </H5>   When 860 policemen entered the village of Radoliste in 1992,  on the basis of previous indications about the possible  organization of paramilitary formations, the police were fired  upon from several directions and from several houses. Even  before this operation, the police had discovered in the same  village, in one development in Struga, as well as in Feriste,  eight rifles (four automatic rifles and one sniper rifle), 12  pistols, ammunition, 1.6 kilograms of explosives, capsules and  slow-burning fuses, 12 gas masks, five pairs of binoculars, and  two camouflage uniforms, and 33 people were arrested, three of  whom were Albanian citizens. The police thus had grounds for  suspicion. The PDP, however, is speaking out in connection with  the case, demanding information about the incident, and noting  that the increased police presence is unjustified; the entire  course of events is being focused on what has already been  heard--that the police are conducting operations to intimidate  and put pressure on the Albanians, and trying to portray them as  terrorists, and in this context, they are allegedly trying to  portray the PDP that way as well.    Precisely these words were uttered recently when the police  arrested several Albanians who were found to be in illegal  possession of weapons. The charges filed refer to article 218 of  the Criminal Code--the illegal possession of weapons and  explosives. That in itself indicates that the latest arrests do  not have any connection (at least not according to the  statements made to date) with the arrest of the people accused  of Albanian paramilitary organization and of the creation of an  All-Albanian Army in Macedonia. The PDP and NDP, however, are  insisting precisely on that connection, and they are trying to  politicize the trial and portray it as a political one. The  Albanian deputies in the Tetovo Assembly are even putting the  latest case on the agenda (!), demanding that the people  arrested be released! Is this a matter of hasty conclusions,  pressure upon the Interior Ministry for more selective actions,  or even an attempt to persuade international factors that the  Albanians in Macedonia are, allegedly, in danger?    In the past, however, other citizens have also been held  accountable under that same article 218, and not just Albanians.    In that same year, 1992, Krum Cuskov and his son Goce  Cuskov,  as well as Djordji Kalauzarov and Petre Konevski (all from Titov  Veles) and Zarko Petrusev and Stojce Delevski from Tetovo, were  jailed because of grounds to suspect that they had committed a  crime under the same article 218. The defendants from Titov  Veles were charged with nine explosions that took place in the  city from 1989 to April 1992. The two defendants from Tetovo,  along with the Veles group, were planning to blow up the PDP and  NDP headquarters in Tetovo. It was precisely in order to prevent  that planned bombing that the police stopped pretending that  they were "naive," in order to "close the net" around other  "bombers" who were possibly involved. (Two more people were  later arrested, however.) The court later sentenced them to  prison. The "bombers" were members of VMRO-DPMNE, and Kalauzarov  was even secretary of the municipal committee. The party  disassociated itself from the defendants, while nevertheless not  neglecting to say that it was an action at the wrong time and in  the wrong place. Then, however, "chief" Nikola Veljanovski from  Ohrid was to say that the people involved in the Veles trial  were members of VMRO's Defense Committee, which had also issued  a death sentence against VMRO-DPMNE leader Ljupco Georgievski.    A few months ago, an individual who had "several weapons"  was  arrested at the Tetovo bus station. The defendant was a Serb by  nationality. That time the PDP and NDP kept quiet.  <H5>  Should the Police "Boast"? </H5>   The police can also "boast" of their actions in the Bit  Market, when there was an armed conflict with a large number of  Albanian citizens; of their supervision of a number of suspects  in the Albanians' rally in the Skopje square, when a map of "the  political and territorial autonomy of Albanians in Macedonia"  was presented, and when the propaganda material that several  citizens, who turned out to be relatives of deputy Mersim  Polozani, brought with them to Skopje, was controlled without  the use of force.    The police can likewise boast of the better-known actions in  Kuklis, when the VMRO-DPMNE went into the field with its  prominent representatives, or in Djorce Petrov, when "the  people" came out again, and the police utilized repression, a  case which was likewise politicized by the Macedonian national  parties. Skopje's Montenegro, or more precisely the village of  Kuceviste, is a place where there have been incidents with the  police several times to date, in which the participants were  citizens who were Serbs by nationality. The Democratic Party of  Serbs in Macedonia was the political factor which politicized  the incidents and spread ideas about the Serbophobia of the  Interior Ministry and the police's alleged ethnic selectivity  along those lines.    The "Blue Bird" scandal considerably disturbed the public  two  years ago. VMRO-DPMNE responded that "The SDB [State Security  Service] is using the perfidious insinuations of members of the  party in order to discredit it and compromise it in the eyes of  the public," and that "The members' ethnic identity is being  misused." The resignations of state President Kiro Gligorov and  Minister Ljubomir Frckovski were demanded, and it was also  demanded that the government be held responsible. It actually  had to do with a decision by VMRO-DPMNE's External Commission to  form an ethnic army (the MNG [Macedonian National Guard] or  guard), whose representatives were received at a high level in  the Republic of Bulgaria, where assistance in the form of a  10,000-strong army and special forces was promised. VMRO-DPMNE  was informed, and the "guardsmen" swore their oaths in a church  in Kuklis. The MNG's statute specified action only in the event  of foreign aggression against Macedonia. The period of the MNG's  creation coincided with the time of the withdrawal by the JNA  [Yugoslav People's Army] from Macedonia (15 April 1992) and the  establishment of the ARM [Army of the Republic of Macedonia].  Then contacts with the SDB and the ARM took place. There was no  criminal prosecution of the "paramilitary troops," since, as  Interior Ministry Under Secretary Slobodan Bogoevski stated  then, "the guardsmen have resigned, they did not commit a crime,  there is no basis for criminal charges," and "The SDB was  obligated to accept the contacts that were offered."    Perhaps the unclear and "semi-informative" scandal will go  down in the young state's history as a good-faith attempt by a  "group of patriots" to fight for its independent, but the case  has been profoundly politicized by VMRO-DPMNE. The fact that its  closure happened from the moment of the ARM's formation cannot  give the incident the same dimensions as the case of the  "All-Albanian Army," which is just being clarified. According to  the indictment, this has to do with actions that continued even  after the JNA's departure from Macedonia, while possible actions  during the JNA's presence are, in general, a mitigating  circumstance. The statements by local national leaders from  Bitola and Ohrid about the alleged "thousands of armed patriots"  (paramilitary ones) are nothing more than advertising, at least  according to official statements.    What is surely the essential thing, and a disturbing one at  the same time, is that the idea that the police are against the  people, or against the people "represented by" certain parties,  is still being encouraged. If one goes by the reactions of the  political parties, it turns out that the Interior Ministry  authorities exist only for themselves, but are also against all  citizens (depending on ethnic identity) in Macedonia.    Nevertheless, it is that way throughout the world--when  public law and order is threatened security measures are taken,  when necessary by means of repression as well. The illegal  possession of weapons and explosives is punished, and everywhere  terrorist actions have the same name and require sanctions.  Different views are discussed, and any abuse of power is  determined by the competent authorities.</p>

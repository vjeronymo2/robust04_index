			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> STEVE ALLEN LASHES TV TREND  </P> <P> Veteran comedian Steve Allen doesn't find anything funny about television's  trend toward stronger language and adult-oriented themes.  </P> <P> Allen lashed out at current television trends in an opinion piece published in  Monday's Los Angeles Times.  </P> <P> The "flow is carrying us all along right into the sewer," he wrote.  </P> <P> "The very sort of language parents forbid their children to use is now being  encouraged not only by anything-goes cable entrepreneurs but the once  high-minded networks," said Allen, host of the 1950s comedy-variety series "The  Steve Allen Show."  </P> <P> Shows that depict children and others using vulgar language only point up the  collapse of the American family, he said.  </P> <P> Allen applauded NBC's censoring of some remarks by comedian Andrew Dice Clay on  a recent "Saturday Night Live" episode. He called Clay "the prince of filth."  </P> <P> "The best humor, when it is not simply purely playful, says something witty and  wise about the issues it confronts," Allen said.  </P></p>

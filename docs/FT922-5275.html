			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / UN Sanctions Against Serbia: Penalties 'a devastating blow to Serbian economy' OFFICIALS and economists in Belgrade admitted yesterday, after maintaining only last week that sanctions would have no effect on Serbia, that the UN's comprehensive package could be a devastating blow to the economy. 'Some sectors of the economy will come to a complete standstill, and the entire economy will be forced just to survive,' said Mr Bozo Jovanovic, minister for foreign economic relations. 'Serbia would be reduced to conditions of war.' Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic held a closed session of the Serbian Chamber of Commerce late last week, aimed at boosting the morale of the business community, especially exporters. He brushed aside the threat of sanctions, saying Serbia would receive oil and energy supplies from Angola. But the total UN embargo on commodities and products means no country will be allowed to sell or supply oil to Serbia; western analysts in Belgrade believe the oil embargo is the most powerful weapon in the UN's armoury of sanctions. A report by Petroleum Intelligence Weekly late last year said Yugoslav oil output was 79,500 barrels a day, representing only 25 per cent of demand. Gas production was about 3bn cubic metres a year, or about 40 per cent of demand. Western diplomats believe a run-down of oil reserves, the extent of which are unknown, would affect the Serbian-backed Yugoslav army and the entire industrial sector. Industrial production in various sectors fell in the first quarter of this year by 25-40 per cent, against the equivalent period last year. Exports of Yugocars, Serbia's car-maker, are almost at a halt because of the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina and the virtual collapse of trade relations. All three of the former Yugoslavian republics provided car components, upholstery, white goods and electronics to Serbia. Diplomats and economists say sanctions may take some time to bite, but that the Serbian leaders will have to continue to print money to pay the workforce. This is likely to fuel inflation, now at about 100 per cent a month. Economists say that, with prices almost doubling daily, inflation is out of control. Lines of cars queued at many Belgrade petrol stations yesterday, and people were stock-piling food.</p>

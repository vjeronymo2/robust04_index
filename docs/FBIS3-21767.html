			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague Feb 26 (CTK) -- Josef Lux, chairman of the  coalition Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party  (KDU-CSL), will sue the responsible persons from the daily  LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE and demand public apology for the article  about "strange" financing of KDU-CSL activity published by  Saturday's [26 February] issue of the daily, the party's  spokesman Jaroslav Orel told CTK on Saturday.    Referring to sources in Prague and Italy, the paper wrote  that the KDU-CSL Chairman and Deputy Premier, Josef Lux, had  ordered last March the transfer of three million crowns (about  100,000 USD) sent to the Czech Republic in October 1992 by  Italian entrepreneur Leonello Mosca, 45, from Perugia, to his  party's account.    LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE wrote that Mosca had been arrested six  weeks ago on charges of cocaine trading, but later was released  on bail and was now living in an unknown place. The three  million crowns have never been returned to Italy, the paper said.    According to it, Mosca allegedly responded to a KDU-CSL  demand and paid three million crowns to the Ceska Typografie  publisher, to which LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE, then a press organ of the  Christian Democrats, owed millions of crowns.    Nevertheless the debts were paid by the later new owner of  the paper, Fidelis Schlee, and the three million crowns,  originally destined for the purpose, were later transferred by  Lux to his party's account.    Orel told CTK that in the summer of 1992 the KDU-CSL  concluded a preliminary agreement with Mosca's company on the  establishment of a paper publishing company, but withdrew from  the agreement in the autumn of the same year. The KDU-CSL has  also concluded an agreement with Mosca's company on a loan  repayable on September 30, 1994. The KDU-CSL has never  challenged the loan and will repay it as agreed, Orel said.    He stressed that neither the KDU-CSL nor its chairman "are  laundering money coming from cocaine trade and from night clubs"  as the daily alleged.    The KDU-CSL sees LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE's attack as reaction by a  person interested in the purchase of the state-owned publishing  company Pragopress, Fidelis Schlee, whose bid was turned down.  These are pressure methods which the KDU-CSL will never accept,  Orel said.    Lux along with another two KDU-CSL ministers--Defence  Minister Antonin Baudys and Economic Competition Minister  Stanislav Belehradek--voted two weeks ago against a  privatisation project under which Pragopress was to be sold to  Schlee and the direct sale could not be realised.</p>

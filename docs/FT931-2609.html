			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Lufthansa cuts losses as sales grow 4.5% LUFTHANSA, the struggling German airline, cut its pre-tax losses by DM31m to DM300m (Dollars 180.3m) last year. Its after-tax loss will be DM380m, a DM60m improvement on the previous year. Lufthansa said 1992 sales revenue rose by 4.5 per cent to DM15bn, lower than the 11.3 per cent increase in passenger volume announced earlier this year. It did not comment on current-year trading yesterday and will release full details of last year's figures in May. 'The market price for air transport services in 1992 was substantially below the previous year's level,' Lufthansa said. The airline was hit by intense competition and the strength of the D-Mark in the aftermath of last September's currency market turmoil. Lufthansa did not quantify the impact of currency changes for the full year, but the appreciation of the D-Mark hit profits by DM254m in the first nine months, Lufthansa revealed in November. The airline said that investment was reduced cut last year by 30 per cent to DM1.7bn, down from DM2.4bn in the previous year. Lufthansa said it had shed 2,000 jobs during the course of 1992, taking the workforce to a total of 42,292 people at the year-end. The reduced losses for last year had been expected after Lufthansa said last November that it had made a profit of DM280m in the third quarter of the year, having made its first monthly profit of the year in September. It warned at that time that it would revert to losses in the last three months of the year. The reduced losses are in part due to an accounting change under which Lufthansa now writes down aircraft over 12 years to a residual value of 15 per cent, as a result of which the annual depreciation of these assets will fall from 9.5 to 7.1 per cent.</p>

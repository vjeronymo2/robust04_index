			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Transport groups form alliance GERMANY'S Thyssen Haniel Logistic (THL) yesterday announced the first steps in a Europe-wide shipping and transport alliance. It is to link with Denmark's DFDS group and Austria's Schier, Otten. Further partners for THL Europa Alliance are being sought in Greece, France and Italy. Under the alliance, DFDS, which operates Scandinavian Seaways shipping services in the North Sea and overland haulage, will take over THL's overland transport businesses in the UK, Netherlands and Belgium. THL, part of the Thyssen group, will take over DFDS operations in Spain and Hamburg. The alliance will operate in Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Scandinavia, the UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland and Portugal. Mr Ole Frie, manager of the DFDS transport division, said the alliance was an alternative to the acquisition policy pursued by other major European haulage groups over the past few years. He said the alliance would yield the advantages of acquisition without the costs and the problems associated with integrating companies.</p>

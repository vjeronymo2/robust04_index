			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> DOCTOR GETS 3-YEAR PROBATION ON DRUG CHARGE  </P> <P> A former Torrance family doctor who surrendered his medical license after  pleading no contest to illegally dispensing diet pills was sentenced to three  years probation Thursday on a charge of cocaine possession.  </P> <P> Dr. Martin Bain, 62, pleaded no contest in May to the cocaine charge stemming  from a November, 1988, traffic stop by a sheriff's deputy, who told officials  that Bain was driving erratically on Palos Verdes Drive North.  </P> <P> After stopping Bain, the officer said he found a syringe, a vial containing  4.93 grams of liquid cocaine and other drug paraphernalia in Bain's car and  jacket.  </P> <P> Bain stopped practicing medicine last May after undercover medical regulators  charged that he prescribed diet pills for them without first conducting a  complete medical examination. He was fined $5,640 and placed on three years  probation in that case.  </P> <P> Bain told the judge on Thursday that he has retired from medicine, has put his  practice up for sale and is training to become a real estate broker. A  probation officer noted that he is living off more than $1 million in personal  assets.  </P> <P> Several friends, including Redondo Beach City Atty. Gordon Phillips, wrote  letters of reference for Bain, praising him as an upstanding member of the  South Bay community who took a bad turn after overworking himself for too long.  </P></p>

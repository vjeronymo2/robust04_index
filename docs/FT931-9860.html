			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Time for the UK to buck up The pessimism and self-hate about the UK economy has gone too far. Listening to British businessmen denigrating British business performance induces a desire to see what statistics of comparative performance really show. As I have often remarked, they show that the rapid growth of other European countries and Japan is mainly a catching-up phenomenon; and that in the 1980s relative UK performance started to improve. They suggest that it would be rash to interpret the prolonged recession as a sign of deep structural malaise. Of course statistics can and often do lie. But it is so difficult to assess anything as diverse as a country's total business and industrial performance by personal impressions that the available numbers should be used as at least a supplement. The most intensive scrutiny of the available evidence so far comes from a study by the distinguished economic historian, Professor Nick Crafts, in a paper for the Institute of Economic Affairs entitled Can De-Industrialisation Seriously Damage Your Wealth?. Because the paper neither echoes the gloomy talk about a collapsing industrial base, nor the once-more fashionable remedies of state aid for investment, it has been largely ignored. But it has far more to tell us than we can expect from the forthcoming report of the crystal-gazers assembled by the chancellor. In fact, Crafts has a better chance of convincing those on the fence than most other commentators. His paper is a survey of almost all the available quantitative research, not only his own. He eschews ideology and indeed speculative argument. So far is he from being a Thatcherite that he appeared as a witness for Peter Jay in a television debate against the proposition that there had been an economic miracle in the 1980s. Nor has he previously been an IEA writer. My only quarrel with Crafts is his use of the awful Harvard system in which bracketed references such as (Joachim and Heifetz, 1985) clutter up the text. They will not convince anyone who does not already believe the author's thesis and are out of place in all but highly specialised original studies. They should be replaced by plain English statements of the trend of recent scholarship; references can be given in the bibliography. In any case the substantive conclusion is that the gap in GDP per person employed between the UK and European competitors is much less than the gloom talk suggests. A table in Economic Viewpoint on November 19 suggested that there is no gap compared with Japan either. Admittedly, UK performance has lagged more in manufacturing than in the rest of the economy. The big gap here is still with the US. American manufacturing output per head was twice as high as Britain's in 1870, when Mr Gladstone was presiding over his first effective administration. The proportional gap was, at a maximum, around 1950 and has since been declining. The manufacturing gap with Continental Europe has never been so large as with America. German manufacturing output per head was indeed nearly 50 per cent above the UK's in 1977. But by 1989 the differential had fallen to 5 per cent. The gap with Japan (not shown in the chart) is similar. Crafts also nails the myth of 'de-industrialisation'. Numbers employed in UK industry have fallen more than in most other countries, but mainly because the starting point was so high. By the late 1980s, the UK had much the same proportion of the labour force in industry as several other countries with a similar level of income per head - for example, France and the Netherlands. It is Germany and Japan that are the odd countries out with their high proportion employed in manufacturing. Most interesting of all is his refutation of the supposed 'balance of payments constraint on growth'. He notes, without becoming bogged down in them, the arguments about the validity of the 'trade gap' estimates, or about how much of the gap is the result of inward investment, particularly by Japanese companies. Crafts is prepared to accept that although the share of British exports in world trade has more or less stabilised, the UK has an exceptionally high tendency to devote increases in the national income to imports. This can be offset by allowing the real exchange rate to depreciate by about 1 1/2 per cent a year. I should spell out that this need not mean a depreciation of the nominal exchange rate - that is the rate quoted in the newspapers - by this amount. If inflation by Britain's trading partners is, say, 3 per cent a year, then a lower UK inflation rate of 1 1/2 per cent in traded goods and services will suffice. On the other hand a larger nominal depreciation will fail to do the trick if it is offset by inflation. Crafts concedes too much to the Europhobic view that such adjustments would not be possible in the exchange rate mechanism, mainly because he expects German inflation to be zero, which would indeed be good news to the Bundesbank. A falling real exchange rate is not a godsend, but perhaps a necessary evil. It is normally accompanied by a deterioration in the terms of trade - that is, UK citizens effectively receive less in imports for a given level of exports. Crafts suggests that the effect is to reduce British living standards by 0.4 per cent a year. This is not a trivial offset to an underlying growth rate of 2 or 3 per cent, but hardly justifies the prevailing gloom and doom. Crafts devotes much attention to supposedly new theories which suggest that there are large returns to investments, which are not captured by the companies that make them, and that therefore government subsidy is justified. He accepts the theoretical possibility, but cites much experience showing that real world subsidies tend to retard rather than promote growth. An example is the advanced gas-cooled reactor programme which is said to have produced nothing of any commercial value over 20 years. Moreover, John Smith please note. 'German policies to subsidise high technology sectors like aircraft, nuclear energy and telecommunications have been no more successful than British ones.' Nor are these failures accidents. Politicians' incentives to win votes encourage excessive subsidisation of producer interests and this cannot be effectively monitored or deterred by the mass of voters on whom the costs fall. Crafts is very critical of some aspects of British business culture. The vulnerability to hostile takeover, unique in Europe, causes British companies to maintain dividends and forego investment opportunities in development and training. He also criticises the absence of long-term consensual relationships between UK workers and their companies. But on balance he believes the reforms of the 1980s improved matters. The main future emphasis should not be on subsidy for manufacturing or high technology but the pursuit of multilateral international agreements to reduce the extent of government support for industry and to promote freer trade. And if multilateral agreements are elusive, I would go for unilateral measures in this direction.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GDP per person employed (UK=100)*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          US/UK   Germany/UK   France/UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1870      95.1      48.8        53.0 1913     127.9      64.1        61.7 1929     154.0      64.3        72.7 1960     167.5      90.2        88.6 1973     151.6     104.7       110.2 1987     128.9     105.6       116.4  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  *Comparisons for each year with the UK; changes in position between years reflect relative growth not absolute levels of performance.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Prof Crafts  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

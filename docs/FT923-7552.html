			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / British unions consulted less than on Continent BRITISH unions and employees have been consulted far less about moves towards decentralisation and greater flexibility in industrial relations than their continental European counterparts, according to a study to be published next month. While most European governments have been promoting labour-market flexibility, the normal pattern outside Britain has been for such changes to be implemented in close consultation between unions and management, say Prof Richard Hyman and Mr Anthony Ferner of Warwick University. Analyses of trends in individual countries conclude that: 'Thatcherism' in Britain generally reinforced trends in industrial relations that were already under way rather than marking a change of course, and has not left British managers with a more strategic approach to industrial relations. In France, in spite of support for collective bargaining and stronger industrial relations institutions, unions have continued their long decline and employers are enjoying a resurgence in public esteem as wealth creators.

Industrial relations in Italy have undergone the most remarkable transformation over the last decade, with co-operation in change encouraged by increasingly formal union-management arrangements. The study challenges the thesis that union power is withering away. It concludes: 'In most countries unions are still robust and are important agents of industrial relations change, especially where national unions maintain strong links with workplace organisation.'

Sir Pat Lowry, former head of the Acas conciliation service, says: 'In the late 1970s the police were seething over what they considered to be their low pay and the Police Federation was under great pressure to amend its rules prohibiting strike action. 'The firefighters went on strike and the army was called out to cover for them.' Sir Pat, in the Institute of Personnel Management magazine PM Plus, says: 'If indexation is to go, we need an alternative in which the police and firefighters would have faith.'</p>

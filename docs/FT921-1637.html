			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / International Company News: Olympia &amp; York fails in bid to secure Dollars 220m Japanese loan OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the Canadian property group controlled by the Reichmann family, failed at the end of last year to raise Dollars 220m (Pounds 127m) of long term funds from Japanese investors, it emerged yesterday. Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, was retained by O&amp;Y to secure the finance from the Japanese. O&amp;Y believes that if Morgan had succeeded, it would have avoided some of the adverse publicity it has recently received about its financial position. Mr Peter Rosenthal, a spokesman for O&amp;Y, said: 'Morgan Stanley only told us they had failed to raise the funds at the very last minute in December. And while that was not what triggered adverse publicity about O&amp;Y, it was clearly a contributing factor.' O&amp;Y is shortly to meet its bankers to discuss a possible reorganisation of its huge borrowings. Morgan said yesterday that it informed the Reichmanns in December that the funds, which it had been retained to raise, would not be forthcoming because of a lack of investor interest. At around the same time, Morgan was exercising an option it had to sell to O&amp;Y a building, 25 Cabot Square, that Morgan Stanley developed and owned at O&amp;Y's Canary Wharf project. Morgan Stanley later brought a legal action against O&amp;Y to force it to pay the Dollars 240m sale price of the building. O&amp;Y said yesterday that Morgan Stanley's fundraising effort was 'designed to raise finance for the sale' by Morgan to O&amp;Y. But Morgan Stanley denies the link between the building's sale to O&amp;Y and the Japanese fund-raising effort. 'While it is true we were retained by O&amp;Y to raise the funds from Japanese and other investors, the sale (of the building) was not contingent on Morgan Stanley arranging the financing for O&amp;Y,' a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said. Morgan Stanley has brought a UK legal claim against O&amp;Y to seek the Dollars 240m payment. A UK court ruled in Morgan Stanley's favour earlier this month, but the decision was stayed pending an appeal. O&amp;Y said yesterday that it expected to make the Dollars 240m payment to Morgan Stanley 'on or before June 30, 1992.' Eric Reguly is New York correspondent of The Financial Post.</p>

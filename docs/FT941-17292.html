			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Bright spots in the gloom: Yoshio Suzuki sees a possible end to the Japanese recession In postwar Japan, the word 'recession' has traditionally meant not a decrease in real gross domestic product, but a 'growth recession', reflected in a lower growth rate. The present recession is different. Already in its third year, this recession is the longest since 1945, and GDP may contract in the year to March. Pessimists are forecasting another decline in GDP in the next fiscal year. More than a year ago, personal consumption began to decline. This trend  - unusual for a Japanese recession - was not caused by a drop in personal income, since both employment and wages were still increasing, and the unemployment rate currently stands at only 2.7 per cent, below the peak of 3.1 per cent registered in 1986, during the high-yen recession. Instead it is the result of a decline in personal consumption after four years of aggressive buying of durables, such as television sets and cars, during the late 1980s. Spending patterns have also been affected by the decline in the value of assets, such as land and stock prices, and the uncertain economic outlook. Even though this recession has been worse than past ones, it will really bite this year. Personal income could decline, and it is feared that the unemployment rate will exceed 3.1 per cent. In previous recessions, there was in-house unemployment under Japan's life-time employment system, which ensured that people had jobs even if they had no meaningful work to do. This time, companies may have to cut staff, in order to reduce costs and improve profitability. This would have a serious effect on consumer confidence and incomes, causing personal consumption to fall further, and creating a vicious circle of continuing GDP decline. Political uncertainty has also hit confidence. Last year, the Liberal Democratic party lost office for the first time in four decades. The new coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa staked its survival on two issues - political reform and the settlement of the Gatt Uruguay Round, including the opening of Japan's rice market - and the economy was not at the top of its list of priorities. The present political situation is confused, because the government is opposed not only by the LDP, but also by the Social Democratic party of Japan, formerly known as the Japan Socialist party, which is supposed to be a member of the government coalition. This awkward relationship within the government is delaying decisions on economic policy. Ultimately, however, the government is likely to include in its next budget an income tax cut amounting to more than Y5 trillion (million million) and an increase in public works spending. If all goes according to plan, the income tax cut, which may be made retroactive to January 1 this year, will be equivalent to 20 per cent of average income taxes, or 2 per cent of personal disposable income, which should have a positive effect on consumption. In the shorter-term, the tax cut will be financed by government bond issues. But the government plans to increase the country's consumption tax, the Japanese version of a value-added tax, from the present 3 per cent to 6 or 7 per cent after two years or so, by which time the economy should have strengthened. Another encouraging sign for the Japanese economy this year is the value of the yen. Last year it appreciated sharply, directly affecting Japan's export industries, including the automotive and electronics sectors - industries that were already under pressure because of the change in personal consumption patterns at home. In August, the yen almost topped Y100 to the dollar. However, it has already receded to about Y108 to the dollar. And as there is a time lag between the appreciation of the yen and a decline in domestic prices of imported goods, consumers will have a lingering increase in their purchasing power. The favourable turn in the yen's value has three causes. First, Japan's export industries have reacted to the strong yen by reducing domestic production and increasing production at overseas plants built during the high-yen phase of the late 1980s. As a result, the trade surplus has already begun to shrink in both volume and yen terms, and will continue to shrink in dollar terms from early this year. Second, until August last year, interest rates in the US and Germany were falling faster than Japanese interest rates, meaning that money was drawn to Japan and the yen, causing the Japanese currency to appreciate. Economic stagnation is expected to bring a further decline in Japanese interest rates, while interest rates in the US will rebound thanks to the improving pace of economic recovery. This will further ease the upward pressure on the yen. Third, US officials have realised that the strong yen has hindered Japan's economic recovery and not been in the interest of the US or the international economies. These officials, who were earlier this year keen to talk up the value of the yen, are unlikely to repeat their statements in the coming year. Another positive turn for Japan is that the Hosokawa coalition is the first Japanese government to advocate voluntarily the deregulation of the economy, something that the US has long sought in the hope of reducing the current account surplus. The US will be carefully monitoring the Hosokawa government's ability to carry out this policy. The Advisory Panel for Economic Structural Reform, under the chairmanship of Gaishi Hiraiwa, leader of the Keidanren business federation, has submitted a report to Mr Hosokawa recommending the promotion of competition through deregulation. But the successful implementation of medium-term economic reforms will depend on the Japanese economy's ability to avoid the more pessimistic of the economic scenarios this year, and return to a sustained growth path. The important factors will be the size and impact of the tax cut and the trend in the value of the yen. Once the Japanese economy starts to recover, corporate earnings should improve sharply thanks to companies' restructuring over the past three years. If all goes well, capital spending will be revived, further boosting economic activity.

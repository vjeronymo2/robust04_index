			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Consuming passion of Chinese shoppers: The sudden availability of imported goods has led to a spending spree by workers Young Mr Yang had no qualms about spending Dollars 50 on a pair of imported blue jeans, a month's salary for the average Chinese worker. Shopping this week at Beijing's smart, new Yaohan department store with its Gucci corner was, he declared, 'chic'. Mr Yang, who described himself as an entrepreneur - a new class of cash-rich Chinese - was doing what millions of well-heeled young consumers do the world over. The difference in China is that opportunities for western-style consumerism have been extremely limited. That is now changing rapidly, and the Yaohan store on Beijing's main boulevard is one of dozens of emporiums opening throughout China, offering a big range of imported items that have become status symbols in class-conscious Chinese society. Producers of 'brand-name' goods, who have long coveted the huge China market, are now flocking to the country in the hope of securing a niche. Among British companies seeking a stronger presence are Dunhill and Johnnie Walker. The stark contrast between the Yaohan emporium and the neighbouring state-run Friendship Store reveals the enormous shift that is taking place in Chinese consumer patterns. Since it opened its doors in the early 1970s, the Youyi Shangdian was the place to shop in Beijing. Access was restricted to foreigners and a Chinese elite with foreign currency. Ironically, the store, which had a virtual monopoly on items that foreigners might wish to purchase, was not very friendly at all. Staff exhibited a surly fuwu taidu, or service attitude, and little imagination was applied either to the display or range of goods for sale. Competition from the Yaohan store across the road and other modern shops has obliged the Soviet-style Friendship Store to become more competitive, and almost friendly, although old habits among the staff die hard. The management is finding the going tough, and is even talking about holding sales, something that would once have been quite unthinkable. It has also been obliged to open the store to the masses who were previously held back by stern guards and an iron railing. Said Mr Dai Zhi Guo, one of the store's managers: 'In order to survive in the sea of competition and business, we must open our doors.' A sign of the tougher times are attempts to sell off the pair of giant ornamental bronze lions that 'guard' the entrance, and have come to be regarded over the years as the store's trademark. Asked whether selling the lions - a price tag of Yn800,000 (Dollars 140,000) has been attached to one - is not a bit like pawning the family silver, Mr Dai replied: 'Actually, we regard these lions as commodities.' At the Yaohan, where smiling and helpful shop assistants operate in a modern environment, the contrast could hardly be greater. Business is brisk, the store is crowded and, if there is a problem, it is maintaining stocks. Among the frustrations of shopping in Beijing these days is that household items and electronic equipment sell out quickly, such is the weight of consumer demand. Items available one day are gone the next. There is hardly time to browse. A recent survey by the Hong Kong office of McKinsey's, the management consultants, forecast that if China's economic growth continued to surge, a target consumer population - those with annual income exceeding Dollars 1,000 - would grow from the present 60m to 200m by the year 2000, making it a huge market by any standards. Chinese consumers tend to have a relatively high percentage of disposable income, since housing, transport, education, and health costs are still heavily subsidised, although the authorities are intent on gradually phasing out subsidies. Mr Li Wei, a senior manager at the Yaohan - the store is part of a Japanese chain with outlets throughout Asia, in north and south America and in Europe  -said that on average between 50,000 and 80,000 customers passed through the store each day, with a peak of 150,000 earlier this year. Mr Li still cannot quite believe that the store is proving such a success, or that Chinese consumers will be able to afford imported items. 'I never expected to see things develop so rapidly. It's unbelievable,' he says. News this week that a state-controlled Beijing real estate developer is planning a Dollars 1bn commercial redevelopment of one of the city's main shopping streets is yet another indication of anticipated rewards from satisfying pent-up consumer demand - bearing in mind that for decades the Chinese were deprived of quality items from abroad and had to make do with shoddy local products. But that, too, is changing. Chinese-made goods have improved, although styling still remains deficient in many cases. The Friendship Store itself is due for a big redevelopment. Mr Dai said negotiations with a Hong Kong developer were in their final stages and he expected some Dollars 250m to be spent on redeveloping the store site, extending floor space from 9,000 square metres to 65,000 over five years. This pattern is being repeated in cities and towns throughout China, with old stores receiving facelifts, or being pulled down and replaced by joint venture projects. Nanjing road, Shanghai's main shopping street, is a good example of the rapid changes under way. Since the beginning of the year, Hong Kong's Sincere department store group has opened an emporium in Nanjing Road, and other outlets have appeared such as Benetton and Stefanel, among others carrying famous brand names. At the Yaohan store, meanwhile, young Chinese seem enraptured by the Aladdin's Cave in which they find themselves; and even though relative to salaries - average annual per capita income in China is about Dollars 350 - prices are extremely high, many seem determined to buy, if only as a token of their visit to a consumer wonderland. Typical was Miss Wei, who was visiting Beijing from a provincial town where gleaming temples of consumerism have not yet appeared. 'I've been here twice before, but both times I left empty-handed. This time, I'll surely buy something - a pair of stockings at least - even if I have to grit my teeth to do it.'</p>

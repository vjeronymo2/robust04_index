			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OBSERVERS EXPECT FEW DRAMATIC CHANGES UNDER DE KLERK;  </P> <P> S. AFRICA'S NEW LEADER A LIFELONG CONCILIATOR  </P> <P> Politics was an abiding presence in the close-knit De Klerk household in the  old days, and the oldest son, Willem, a renegade liberal, was frequently  embroiled in heated arguments with the father, Jan, a government Cabinet  minister and steadfast defender of apartheid.  </P> <P> As often as not, the confrontations were smoothed over by Willem's younger  brother, Frederik.  </P> <P> "He always tried to explain both sides to me and to our father, bargaining for  a conciliation between us," Willem de Klerk, now 60, remembered Tuesday. "Even  as a small boy, his role always was to find solutions to problems, to suggest  reconciliation over confrontation. He had a lot of success, too."  </P> <P> On Tuesday morning, Frederik W. de Klerk, the 53-year-old man whom friends and  even rivals describe as a gifted negotiator and pragmatist, was sworn in as  acting president of South Africa in a six-minute ceremony at Pretoria's hilltop  Union Buildings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Courage and Vision'  </P> <P> De Klerk, expected to guide South Africa into the next decade as head of its  white minority-led government, expressed the hope that South Africans will  "show the courage and vision required to break the cycle of conflict, tension  and isolation which has gripped us for so long -- and to work for a new, strong  and just South Africa."  </P> <P> The acting president also paid tribute to his 73-year-old predecessor, Pieter  W. Botha, who resigned Monday night after months of bitter feuding with his  Cabinet and his party over being unceremoniously forced earlier this year to  plan his retirement after parliamentary elections next month.  </P> <P> De Klerk, education minister under Botha, will take over as president in his  own right on Sept. 14 if, as is widely expected, the powerful ruling National  Party maintains its majority in the white chamber of Parliament after elections  Sept. 6.  </P> <P> Those who know De Klerk best say his presidency will differ significantly in  style, if not necessarily in substance, from Botha's.  </P> <P> Although De Klerk has called for a new constitution to give the disfranchised  black majority a voice in national affairs, he still supports the National  Party's longstanding policy of racially segregated residential areas, schools  and hospitals, as well as its opposition to the idea of one person, one vote.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, many political analysts here and abroad have pinned their hopes  for a peaceful resolution of South Africa's troubles on De Klerk's personality.  Where Botha was a dictatorial and ruthless ruler who created a one-man  executive government, De Klerk is a team player, highly intelligent, affable  and reasonable, analysts say.  </P> <P> "He's a lawyer's lawyer, a Mr. Fix-it and a master of parliamentary procedure  and rational thinking," said Robert Shrire, a professor of political studies at  the University of Cape Town.  </P> <P> In the months since his selection as Botha's heir-apparent, De Klerk has  consulted with world leaders, who have expressed high hopes for his presidency.  But many who have followed De Klerk's career warn against expecting too much  too soon.  </P> <P> "All in all, he's a tremendous improvement over what we've had," said Johann  van der Vyfer, a professor of law and a college classmate who was best man at  De Klerk's wedding. "But I don't see dramatic changes in government policy. He  will encourage an exchange of ideas, but he's always been an Establishment man.  And he still sits closer to the right side of Afrikanerdom than the left."  </P> <P> De Klerk's brother, Willem, whose liberal leanings caused him to break with the  National Party several years ago, says the new president's strength is his  ability to bring people together, which could be useful after Botha's repeated  failure to bring recognized black leaders to the negotiating table.  </P> <P> But "he's still very much linked to the National Party tradition," including  the notion that racial groups should be the building blocks of a new  constitution, said Willem, who is a professor of communications at Rand  Afrikaans University in Johannesburg. "I really hope that he will be  open-minded enough to realize that (maintaining) race groups is part of the  problem, not part of the solution," he went on.  </P> <P> The De Klerk brothers are scions of an old Afrikaner family with deep roots in  the country and in the National Party. Their grandfather was imprisoned by the  British during the Anglo-Boer War and later played a leading role in developing  the National Party, which instituted sweeping apartheid legislation after it  came to power 41 years ago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Father a Cabinet Minister  </P> <P> Former Prime Minister J. G. Strijdom was an uncle, and their father was a  Cabinet minister for 14 years in the 1950s and '60s, serving under two prime  ministers and helping write more apartheid legislation into the law books.  </P> <P> Frederik studied law at Pochefstroom University, where Willem, eight years  older, had acquired a reputation as a liberal Afrikaner. Friends say Frederik  embraced more conservative ideals in an unconscious attempt to move out of the  shadow of his respected older brother.  </P> <P> Frederik graduated with honors and briefly practiced law before entering  politics, where he quickly became known as one of the more conservative members  of the ruling National Party hierarchy. But political observers find him  difficult to label, owing at least partly to his ability to avoid mudslinging  debates, preferring instead to resolve disputes behind the scenes.  </P> <P> De Klerk has a Spartan, conventional life style and is an avid hunter and  golfer. He and his wife, Marike, have three adopted children, two sons and a  daughter.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Conservative Church  </P> <P> He is a member of the Gereformeerde Kerk, the smallest of three Afrikaner  churches, which is known for its rigidly conservative ideology and relatively  liberal politics, and he is the first Gereformeerde politician to ascend to the  presidency.  </P> <P> Despite their political differences, the De Klerk brothers remain close friends  -- and they still manage to discuss politics frequently.  </P> <P> "Sometimes we have loud arguments," Willem said. "But at the end there's always  a smile."  </P></p>

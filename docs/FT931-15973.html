			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Nervousness drags busy equities down THE FINAL trading session of the first full working week of the year saw share prices continue to lose ground following big falls in New York and amid persistent worries about the possibility of impending rights issues in London. News of disappointing trading at Boots was an additionally bearish influence on the market yesterday. Dealers also fretted about further conflict in Iraq. But hefty losses in the Footsie 100 list of stocks and in the Mid 250 list masked what some traders said was a fresh burst of buying interest by the big institutions. The Footsie 100 index ended another very busy session a net 17.3 lower at 2,799.2, only marginally above the day's lowest level, 2,797.9, reached soon after a disappointing opening by Wall Street. Over the week the 100-share index has fallen 47.3 points, or 1.7 per cent. The strong run by the Footsie Mid 250 index, which jumped more than 77 points until yesterday, was halted with the index slipping 7.6 to 2,932.7. Wall Street's overnight 36 point fall was the trigger for a weak opening in London, with the Footsie 100 kicking off more than 14 points lower. This was in spite of the latest UK takeover move; Laporte made an agreed offer for Evode and sent its broker, BZW, into the market to buy Evode stock. Laporte's move is the third bid this week, after Wassall's increased offer for Evode and Airtours' bid for rival holiday company Owners Abroad. Attempts by the London market to rally were offset by Wall Street opening some 30 points lower. However, dealers took heart from continuing heavy activity. Yesterday's turnover reached 773.1m shares with most of the business - 502.2m - transacted in the non-Footsie 100 stocks. Senior marketmakers were not gloomy about prospects: 'We've seen plenty of profit-taking but it would be foolish to take too bearish a view of the market,' said one. Sharelink, the largest private client stockbroker in the UK with more than 300,000 clients, reported strong buying all week. 'There have been only two days since the beginning of December when the amount of selling orders has matched buying orders,' said a Sharelink spokesman.

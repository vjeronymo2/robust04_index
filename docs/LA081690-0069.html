			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 DEPART E. GERMAN CABINET AS ECONOMY FALTERS;  </P> <P> REUNIFICATION: TWO MINISTERS ARE FIRED AND TWO RESIGN. THE MOVES COULD RAISE  TENSIONS IN A MULTI-PARTY COALITION AS MERGER WITH BONN NEARS.  </P> <P> In an attempt to cope with East Germany's rapidly deteriorating economic  situation, Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere fired two key Cabinet ministers  Wednesday and accepted the resignation of two others.  </P> <P> The dismissals were the first for East Germany's new democratically elected  government, and seemed certain to increase tension in the broad, four-party  coalition charged with the task of uniting East Germany with West Germany.  </P> <P> De Maiziere announced at a press conference that he had dismissed Finance  Minister Walter Romberg and Agricultural Minister Peter Pollack for failing to  deal effectively with the problems involved in restructuring East Germany's  centrally planned industrial and agricultural sectors and preparing them for  free-market competition under monetary union with the West, which was agreed to  in July.  </P> <P> Economics Minister Gerhard Pohl, heavily criticized for his role in failing to  deal adequately with the declining economy, and Justice Minister Kurt Wuensche  also left the Cabinet.  </P> <P> De Maiziere said none of the four would be replaced, that their portfolios will  be administered by subordinates.  </P> <P> For Pollack, a 59-year-old independent widely regarded as inept and  insensitive, it was an especially bad day. Hours before he was fired, he was  shouted down and pelted with eggs and vegetables as he tried to address a  demonstration of angry farmers in the Alexanderplatz protesting against falling  prices and shrinking markets.  </P> <P> One farmer who confronted Pollack as he tried to leave burst into tears of  frustration and rage at the apparent lack of understanding for the plight of  the farmers.  </P> <P> De Maiziere's move marked the latest in a series of crises that have plagued  his government as it staggers toward political unification with West Germany,  probably in October.  </P> <P> Serious differences over the timing of political unity, motivated mainly by  party infighting rather than national interest, slowed government business to a  crawl for nearly two weeks last month and threatened to destroy the coalition  led by De Maiziere's Christian Democrats.  </P> <P> Because Romberg was one of the more senior Social Democratic members of De  Maiziere's Cabinet, the dismissals seem certain to add new strains to  government unity.  </P> <P> The Social Democratic party chairman, Wolfgang Thierse, accused De Maiziere of  trying to wreck the coalition. He hinted that the dismissals could jeopardize a  treaty on political unity being negotiated by the two Germanys.  </P> <P> "I question whether Lothar de Maiziere still wants the coalition," Thierse said  in a televised interview. "Apparently he doesn't, and apparently he doesn't  want a unity treaty either, because for that he needs us."  </P> <P> The treaty deals with questions of finance in addition to such politically  touchy subjects as property rights and education and cultural policy.  </P> <P> Although the support of the Social Democrats is needed to approve the treaty,  observers questioned whether the party would have the will to withstand the  public pressure for swift unity.  </P> <P> With political union now expected around the time of East German elections,  scheduled for Oct. 14, a collapse of the coalition would further damage the  government's image, though it would not be likely to have any long-term  significance, observers predicted.  </P> <P> The unity process calls for East Germany to accede to West Germany, a step that  will effectively put an end to the East German government. Elections for the  first all-German Parliament since the Nazi era are scheduled for Dec. 2.  </P> <P> Although the Cabinet dismissals are likely to put additional strain on the  troubled coalition, political observers and many East Germans believe that they  were necessary if the economic tailspin is to be halted.  </P> <P> Figures made public Tuesday by the West German Bundesbank show that the East  German economy declined by 9.5% in the second quarter of the year, and that the  number of people employed in agriculture and industry declined by an additional  7%.  </P> <P> A sharp turndown in the East German economy has been widely predicted as the  country's over-manned, antiquated industry and agriculture adjusts to the  pressures of the free market. Economists believe that West German technical and  financial aid will eventually generate a strong recovery.  </P> <P> According to West German government sources, Romberg had consistently resisted  pressure to reduce the bloated government payroll and had demanded subsidies of  up to $60 billion for the five states that are to be formed in East Germany.  </P> <P> These sources said West Germany has offered about half that figure. They said  that Romberg, while seeking additional funds, had failed to distribute money  already allocated to cushion the transition.  </P> <P> Pollack had departed on vacation without submitting a plan to ease the  country's deepening agricultural crisis, which has seen farm income drop by  about 50% this year.  </P> <P> Some agricultural economists have predicted that as much as 75% of East German  agriculture could collapse if employment is not sharply reduced, efficiency  boosted, and product quality improved.  </P> <P> Wuensche's departure was said to be unrelated to the economic crisis. A Liberal  Democrat who served as justice minister under former Communist leader Walter  Ulbricht, he has long been a controversial figure.  </P> <P> De Maiziere's government suffered another setback Wednesday when Martin  Kirchner, general secretary of the Christian Democratic Party, was suspended  from office pending investigation of charges that he informed for the East  German secret police over a period of 15 years.  </P> <P> The accusation appeared in the West German weekly Stern.  </P></p>

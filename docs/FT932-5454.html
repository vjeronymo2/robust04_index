			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Survey of Korea (7): New president sets the pace - Clampdown on corruption DURING his first three months as South Korean president, Mr Kim Young-sam has presided over a bloodless revolution of the political establishment that promises to transform the country into one of Asia's most democratic societies. The sweeping changes initiated by Mr Kim, the country's first civilian leader in 32 years, are meant to eliminate the vestiges of the previous authoritarian system, while making the government more accessible and accountable to the public. Mr Kim, a former opposition leader, has accelerated the pace of political reforms that began with the downfall of the military dictatorship in 1987 and were continued by his predecessor, Mr Roh Tae-woo, a former army general with a strong commitment to promoting democracy. The changes he has introduced range from the symbolic, such as reducing the august trappings of the presidential office, to the substantial, including imposing firm civilian control over the military and curbing the domestic surveillance operations of the intelligence agency. An anti-corruption campaign, however, has produced the biggest impact. Corruption is pervasive in South Korea because the centralised and authoritarian government structure allowed officials to wield considerable power and extract bribes in return for favours. When Mr Kim recently ordered government ministers and MPs to disclose their assets, many were revealed to have amassed fortunes of several million dollars due to suspected corruption, including the use of inside information to engage in property speculation. The government audit agency, meanwhile, is investigating ministries for corruption, while senior bureaucrats will soon be required to reveal their wealth. A prominent target has been the military, with former service heads and other senior officers accused of accepting bribes for promoting colleagues. There are also allegations of widespread corruption involving the procurement of weapons. Four state-appointed bank presidents have been forced to resign because they demanded bribes for granting loans. Not even the respected education system has escaped unscathed, with administrators confessing they accepted bribes to allow students to enter universities without taking the entrance examinations. The anti-corruption drive is considered the main weapon in reforming the bureaucracy by curbing its abuse of power. The exposure of corruption is meant to destroy the use of government as a patronage system. Mr Kim's advisers argue that by depriving bureaucrats of the opportunity to exploit their positions for personal gain, they will have less incentive to retain control. This will weaken bureaucratic opposition to other proposed reforms, such as economic deregulation, while promoting more equality between citizens and the state. The new president has set an example by declaring he will not accept political contributions for the ruling Democratic Liberal Party in an attempt to break the corrupt relationship between government and business, which is the main source of donations. Business has welcomed the reform since an estimated 6 per cent of profits are paid as a 'quasi-tax' to politicians to ensure favourable treatment in government decisions. The anti-corruption campaign has earned Mr Kim immense popularity, with a 70 per cent approval rating. The anti-government student riots that were once a hallmark of Seoul in springtime have disappeared as long-time dissidents voice support for the new government. Mr Kim has also skilfully used the anti-corruption campaign to strengthen his political position. His opponents in the DLP, who are mostly associated with former President Roh, have been thrown on the defensive since they were forced to disclose their large personal fortunes. Several haves resigned their parliamentary seats, including the speaker of the National Assembly. The president's reform programme has also deprived the main opposition Democratic Party of a strong alternative message to attract voters. It was defeated decisively by the DLP in three parliamentary by-elections last month. If any criticism can be made of the anti-corruption drive, it is that Mr Kim has used it to settle some personal scores. The authorities, for example, are conducting an extensive tax audit of state-controlled Pohang Iron and Steel, whose former chairman opposed Mr Kim's presidential candidacy last year. More significant has been the prosecution of Mr Chung Ju-yung, founder of the Hyundai business group, for illegal election funding in his presidential campaign against Mr Kim. The charges against Mr Chung forced him to abandon the United People's Party, the political group he financed, leading to its virtual collapse as the country's second opposition party. The DLP has been able to attract some defecting MPs from the UPP, increasing the strength of the ruling party to 170 seats in the 299-member National Assembly. The aggressiveness Mr Kim has shown in tackling corruption has surprised most observers, who initially dismissed him as a politician of the old school despite his impressive record in opposing the military dictatorship. Doubts about Mr Kim arose after he abandoned the opposition in 1990 and joined the ruling party in what was regarded as a nakedly ambitious attempt to become the government's presidential candidate in last December's election. Some analysts now believe that Mr Kim's switching of political affiliation may be the source of his current success. 'His reforms are based on a compromise between the establishment and the opposition, with Kim having a foot in each camp,' says Mr Ahn Chang-ni, a professor of political science at Seoul National University. But it is expected that Mr Kim will inevitably confront a backlash from the old guard threatened by the reforms, especially if his popularity weakens. Mr Kim has already been forced to drop several ministers and a close aide who was leading the anti-corruption campaign after his opponents leaked information to the press about alleged ethical violations involving them. Moreover, questions remain about the sources of financing for Mr Kim's presidential election, which could prove embarrassing. More practical considerations could also limit the extent of the anti-corruption drive. The government, for example, has delayed banning financial accounts held under false names, which are used to hide money from tax collectors, because this could lead to a flight of capital from the country. There is concern that the anti-corruption campaign is slowing decision-making among bureaucrats who fear being accused of corrupt practices. The probe into military corruption may also be cut short on the grounds that it is demoralising the armed forces, although a more pertinent reason is that Mr Kim does not want to provoke the military. But Mr Kim also faces pressure from the public, which has come to expect a wholesale cleansing of government, to continue the reform process. Having opened the Pandora's box on three decades of official corruption, the new president may have difficulty in closing it again even if it is prudent to do so.</p>

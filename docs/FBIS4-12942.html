			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Nabil 'Amr] </F>   [Text] The Alliance of Palestinian Forces [APF] will begin  meetings in Damascus on 20 April. The APF includes 10  Palestinian organizations which oppose the Oslo and Cairo  agreements and all the resulting arrangements, including  arrangements to implement Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and  Jericho. The Alliance also includes such organizations as the  Islamic Hamas Movement, which rejects the achievement of a  political solution or any peace with Israel.    AL-DUSTUR private sources said that the APF organizations,  which met in the Libyan capital Tripoli last month under the  auspices of Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, have become closer  than ever before. This is especially true since they feel that  the PLO leadership, which is negotiating with Israel over  self-rule arrangements, has overlooked the issue of returning  deportees and releasing detainees. The PLO leadership is  listening to Israeli conditions which demand that the  Palestinian self-rule authority bans activities by Hamas, the  largest of the 10 APF organizations.    These sources said that the 10 organizations, which will  discuss the APF's bylaws, began to prepare their ideas for the  next stage of struggle in light of developments in the  Palestinian arena. They also began to formulate a popular and  organizational action plan inside and outside the occupied  territories. According to these organizations, this plan should  foil the mission of the Palestinian self-rule authority and  thwart the Oslo and Cairo agreements.    For his part, Ibrahim Ghawshah, official Hamas spokesman in  Jordan, said that Israel will not give the Palestinians anything  and that the Palestinian people inside the occupied territories  are now more prepared for a militant confrontation with the  Israeli enemy. This comes at a time when there are reports of  strong indignation within the Palestinian political circles.</p>

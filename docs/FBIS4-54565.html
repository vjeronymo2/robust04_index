			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Slovak newspapers on 28 and 29 April  publish reports on comments made by representatives of Slovak  right-wing and center parties on the meeting of these parties'  leaders in Bratislava on 26 April, which dealt with their  cooperation in the election campaign.    Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak on 28 April on page  3  carries a 200-word TA SR report on a news conference given by  National Democratic Party-New Alternative Chairman Ludovit  Cernak in Bratislava on 27 April. Cernak is quoted as saying  that the five parties attending the 26 April meeting "showed  interest in cooperating. They will agree on the form of this  cooperation by the end of May at the latest." Cernak reportedly  also said that all five parties "practically rejected the  possibility of postelection cooperation with the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia."    Bratislava SME in Slovak on 29 April on page 3 carries a  200-word "dos"-signed report on a news conference given by the  leadership of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) in  Bratislava on 28 April. Speaking about the 26 April meeting of  the leaders of "five right-wing and centrist parties," KDH  Chairman Jan Carnogursky reportedly described it "as unlikely  that all of these parties would contest the elections with a  single slate of candidates. He supposes, however, that the  number of slates of candidates will be under five."</p>

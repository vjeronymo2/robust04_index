			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Taking a shine to glare-free specs SPECTACLES with coatings to minimise glare from the sun are relatively common in many continental European countries. But in the fragmented UK and the US retail optical markets the cost of the coating equipment has hampered the take-up. Applied Vision, of Leicestershire, was set up to tackle this problem. The result is a coating machine which costs Pounds 80,000 to buy, less than a fifth of most existing models. It is also less expensive to operate. The machines uses a technique called ion sputtering, in which the surface to be coated is excited electro-magnetically, attracting the ions in the coating. The ions bombard the lens and stick to it. Each lens takes about one hour to coat, making the technique suitable for high street opticians who promote themselves on the speed of their service. Applied Vision: UK, 0532 304908.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / CU pleases with payout COMMERCIAL Union yesterday followed General Accident in announcing a turnround in first-half performance. CU, the strongest of the five composite insurers, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 65.5m, compared with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 18.1m. It said it was proposing an enhanced scrip dividend alternative to the interim dividend of 15.10p. This compared with last year's interim payout of 8.95p and a final of 15.10p - it was effectively reversing their order. CU added that the enhanced scrip dividend was worth 22.2p. Investors welcomed both the profits, which were slightly ahead of expectations, and the dividend announcement, marking the shares up 12p to 661p. Earnings per share amounted to 25.7p, compared with 34.9p. Both figures include realised investment gains. Like General Accident, which reported its turnround on Tuesday, CU's profit improvement was based on a revival in the UK market, where underwriting losses fell to Pounds 56.6m from Pounds 95.9m in the first half of 1992. In home and motor insurance - where rates have been increased sharply in the past two years - CU posted underwriting profits of Pounds 13.8m, compared with a deficit of Pounds 17.4m. Losses of Pounds 25m from the Bishopsgate bomb in April offset improvement on commercial lines. CU was hit by underwriting losses of Pounds 45.9m on its London market - marine and other specialised commercial - business, worsening from Pounds 37.5m. CU is the biggest insurance company in the marine business in London and, like Lloyd's, accounts for results in this sector three years in arrears. Overall underwriting losses fell to Pounds 165.4, compared with Pounds 202.2m in the first half of last year. Investment income net of loan interest amounted to Pounds 168.9m, against Pounds 129.4m. Earnings from associated undertakings fell to Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 7m). Life profits amounted to Pounds 57.6m (Pounds 50.7m). After taxation and minorities of Pounds 18m (Pounds 5.6m) and realised investment gains of Pounds 92.8m (Pounds 182.4m), profits attributable to shareholders fell to Pounds 140.3m (Pounds 158.7m). Shareholders' funds at June 30 amounted to Pounds 1.98bn, up from Pounds 1.5bn at the end of December, with the increase reflecting rights issue proceeds of Pounds 428m. A rise of Pounds 113m in investment values, after taxation, was partly offset by the adverse effect of exchange rate movements amounting to Pounds 31m. Lex Page 14 Details, Page 17</p>

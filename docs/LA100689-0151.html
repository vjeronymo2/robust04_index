			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CONVICTED EX-S&amp;L OWNER JAILED TO PREVENT HIS FLEEING  </P> <P> One day after he was found guilty of bank fraud and conspiracy, a former owner  of an Orange thrift was sent to prison Thursday by a federal judge after  prosecutors said they were worried he might flee the country given his past  conviction for passport fraud.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon lifted the $600,000 bail on John L.  Molinaro and ordered he be taken to Metropolitan Detention Center in Los  Angeles. Molinaro cursed deputy marshals as they handcuffed him and led him  away.  </P> <P> Molinaro, 48, had been convicted Wednesday on 33 charges of bank fraud,  conspiracy and causing false entries to be put into the books of Ramona Savings  &amp; Loan.  </P> <P> Jurors in an 11-week trial concluded that Molinaro and former co-owner Donald  P. Mangano Sr. had carried out a scheme to defraud Ramona of millions of  dollars. Mangano was convicted on 31 charges of bank fraud and conspiracy.  </P> <P> Ramona collapsed in 1986 and subsequently required a $65.5-million bailout of  depositors.  </P> <P> Molinaro, a former carpet salesman, served nearly two years in prison after he  tried to obtain a passport in 1986 using the birth certificate of a dead man.  Federal authorities, who have recovered $3 million from accounts Molinaro set  up in the Caribbean, allege in court papers that he was planning on fleeing the  country.  </P> <P> Prosecutors in the Ramona case feared he might make another attempt to leave  the United States.  </P> <P> Mangano, 52, remained free on $150,000 bail. He was ordered Thursday to remain  within the Los Angeles area until sentencing, which was rescheduled for Jan. 8.  Molinaro faces up to 165 years in prison and $8.3 million in fines; Mangano  could receive a 155-year sentence and $7.8 million in fines.  </P> <P> Kenyon also instructed Mangano not to talk to any of the people who testified  during the trial.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Army Commander General Reynaldo Caceres said  yesterday that the military units deployed in the Chapare region  are only carrying out their constitutional mission of watching  over the country's internal security. He made clear that he did  not authorize any large deployment, as had been reported by some  peasant leaders over the last few days.    He said that the social situation in that conflictive coca  growing region requires that the institutions in charge of  guaranteeing public security take the necessary measures to  fulfill their objective.    Gen. Caceres told PRESENCIA: "I don't know why they are  making a fuss out of some military movements there. I am the  one who gives the orders for the Army to move, and I have not  given any orders in that sense. There are some things, however,  that should be investigated, but this is a military matter."    He said that military deployment anywhere in the country is  fully supported by the Constitution, and that such action seeks  only to preserve the constitutional guarantees of the Bolivian  people.    Asked about the official who ordered the military deployment  in the tropical region of Cochabamba, Gen. Caceres said: "We  don't need to ask permission of anyone, because to fulfill our  mission effectively we need to move throughout the entire  national territory. We do that constantly and routinely, and  there is no reason why the public should be alarmed. Our  presence anywhere should not be reason for alarm."    He noted: "The Constitution clearly determines the mission  of the Armed Forces, and we only fulfill that mission."    Armed Forces Commander General Fernando Sanjines  corroborated  the comments made by Gen. Caceres, saying: "Of course the Armed  Forces can be in any place at any time, like all the people, but  basically there is no military deployment, and no order was  given in that regard."    On 19 May Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz said that the  intelligence services of the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN)  found indications of the presence in the Chapare region of  people linked to international drug trafficking, and that they  are reportedly encouraging the formation of armed irregular  groups in their service.    In this regard the Army commander said this possibility  should not be dismissed, and admitted that the Army intelligence  services are evaluating the preliminary intelligence reports.    Gen. Caceres said: "Nothing should be dismissed, as such  indications do exist, which is why we should evaluate and  investigate the reports. We cannot dismiss anything."</p>

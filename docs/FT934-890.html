			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Gas under control A more competitive gas market has long been a main priority for the Department of Trade and Industry. So it comes as no surprise that it has rejected a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report which urged divestment of British Gas's trading business but deferred the introduction of competition. Since the DTI is so single-minded, it would be fair to assume new entrants will be given a fair chance when their licences are drawn up. That makes yesterday's 3 per cent drop in Gas's share price understandable, even though many important variables, including the future price formula and permissible rates of return on transportation, remain unsettled. What is clear is that by April 1998, British Gas stands to lose 10 per cent of its UK domestic tariff sales, which last year were worth Pounds 5.8bn in all. Experience in the contract business suggests that when the tariff market is fully free, it will lose considerably more. There will be savings: the company will not have to pay for gas it is no longer selling. But the net shortfall is likely to be large in relation to profits which are currently around Pounds 1bn. Revision of the pricing formula is unlikely to afford much compensation. British Gas will thus be heavily reliant on cutting costs. It has already promised to take out 20,000 jobs, though presumably some fixed costs will have to be eliminated as well. There is no shortage of fat to trim, but the equity market must also consider the consequences in terms of provisions and cash outlays. Dividend cover is hardly ample at around 1.5 times. Cash spent on restructuring will not be available for investment in the high return overseas projects which Gas regards as essential for growth. That may constrain its flexibility despite the recent sale of Consumers Gas. Shareholders might have been better off if the company had been forced to divest its trading business after all.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Nato rejects Grachev call for new security order General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, yesterday urged the creation of a new European security order involving all European nations, but Nato was quick to quash hopes it might agree to substantial change. In a speech to his counterparts in Nato and eastern Europe, Gen Grachev chided western nations for underestimating the scope of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, a 52-member group which includes the US, Canada, all European states and the former Soviet republics. He called for the CSCE to be granted powers of 'permanent leadership and co-ordination' over Nato, the European Union and the Commonwealth of Independent States on security matters. In response Nato's Deputy Secretary-General Sergio Balanzino said the alliance would not conclude any formal agreement with Russia on special ties demanded by Moscow and Russia could not have any right to interfere with alliance decisions and action. Nato wanted to build 'step by step' a close relationship with Russia, he said, but was 'not ready or willing to give anybody a 'droit de regard' or veto over its actions ..There will never be a clause or understanding whereby Russia can interfere or have a say in Nato's life ..A formal document ..is ruled out by the council.' Gen Grachev had called for regular consultations between Russia and Nato on 'the whole spectrum of European and world security problems'. 'This mechanism would be a practical step towards forming a viable system of collective security and stability in Europe under the aegis of the CSCE.' Diplomats said the appeal was a deft move to recapture the political initiative and capitalise on euphoria created by Russia's promise to join Nato's Partnership for Peace plan. Nato is keen to encourage Russia to forge closer ties with the west after recent disagreements over allied action in Bosnia and arms control, but it wants to avoid suggestions of a privileged relationship which might harm the interests of eastern European states. Without withdrawing his pledge to join the programme, which calls for joint exercises and exchange of knowhow, Gen Grachev said a much broader spectrum of co-operation between Russia and Nato would be mapped out before Russia signed up to PFP. This contradicted Nato's stress on the need for countries to sign the PFP entry form first and elaborate details later. Some 18 countries have already joined the scheme.</p>

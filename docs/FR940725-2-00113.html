Description of the Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change will modify NSCC's Rules and Procedures relating to trade comparison. The proposed rule change is designed to support the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') and the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' in their efforts to implement trade-date comparison systems. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  To achieve trade-date comparison, the NYSE and Amex require their member organizations to submit trade comparison data to the NYSE and Amex rather than to NSCC for comparison processing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For information on NYSE's and Amex's trade date comparison systems, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 34153 (June 3, 1994), 59 FR 30071 [File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;08] (order approving proposed rule change) and 34298 (July 1, 1994), 59 FR 35397 [File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;13] (order approving proposed rule change). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to the NYSE and Amex implementing their trade-date comparison systems, NSCC received locked-in trade data from the NYSE and Amex and initial two-sided, uncompared trade data from its member organizations. The uncompared trade data from its members were matched by NSCC and were reported back to the members on contract lists. The locked-in trade data, which is compared at the point of execution by the exchanges, bypasses NSCC's comparison process but for record purposes is reported back to the members organizations on contract lists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the new systems, the NYSE and Amex will process the initial two-sided, uncompared trade data in their trade-date comparison system. When these trades do no compare, the NYSE and Amex will report such unmatched trades (known as ``questioned trades'' or ``QTs'' at the NYSE and ``don't knows'' or ``DKs'' at the Amex) to NSCC along with the matched, two-sided trades and the locked-in trades. The compared trades (including the locked-in trades and the matched, two-sided trades) will bypass NSCC comparison processing, but the unmatched trades will be included in NSCC's comparison process and in NSCC's trade correction process if necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSCC states that the proposed rule change will permit the NYSE and Amex to submit on behalf of NSCC members uncompared trade data relating to trades for regular way, when-issued, cash, next day, and sellers-option settlement in equity securities executed on such exchanges directly to NSCC for inclusion in NSCC's comparison process. Even though the NYSE and Amex require their members to submit their trade data to the exchanges, the revisions to NSCC's Rules and Procedures still permit NSCC members to submit such data directly to NSCC in order to have the data included in that day's processing. This authority is necessary because a member may miss the exchanges' submission time frames. NSCC notes that the NYSE and Amex have concurred in this procedure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As member organizations become accustomed to the NYSE's and Amex's trade-date comparison systems, NSCC expects that the NYSE and Amex will no longer permit members to submit data directly to NSCC. At the time, NSCC, upon the request of the NYSE and Amex, will file a rule change under Section 19(b)(2) of the Act eliminating the ability of NSCC members to submit such data directly to NSCC other than on an exception basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons discussed below, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Act and particularly with Section 17A of the Act. Section 17A(b)(5) of the Act states that the rules of a clearing agency should be designed to foster cooperation and coordination with person engaged in the clearance and settling of securities transactions, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the clearance and settlement of securities transactions, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(F) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

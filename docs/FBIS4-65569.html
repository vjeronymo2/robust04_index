			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["S.N." report on "Gruppo" opinion poll: "People's Party </F> Leads PSOE by 7 Percent in Voting Intentions for European  Elections"]    [Text] Madrid -- The People's Party would win the  elections to the European Parliament if they were held today,  according to the voting intentions shown in a "Gruppo" opinion  poll for ABC. Nearly 40 percent of the electorate would cast  their votes for the party led by Jose Maria Aznar, which would  mean a 17-percent increase on the 1989 European elections and  winning 26 or 27 seats out of a total of 64. The PSOE [Spanish  Socialist Workers Party] would come second, with 31 percent of  the votes and 22 European deputies. Abstention would be less  than 15 percent of voters.    The escape of the former Civil Guard director general, the  "Ibercorp affair," with the jailing of former Bank of Spain  Governor Mariano Rubio and former Madrid stock exchange trustee  Manuel de la Concha, the Filesa affair -- in short, corruption  -- could take their toll and cost the PSOE very dear if the  current voting intentions for the European elections persist.    According to an opinion poll conducted by "Gruppo" for ABC,  citizens' voting intentions have undergone a considerable change  since the last elections. Whereas in 1989 the PSOE prevailed  with 40 percent of the votes, while the People's Party won 21.7  percent, it would now be Jose Maria Aznar's party which would  win the support of 38.5 percent of the electorate, as against  the Socialist Party's 31.7 percent.    In terms of the number of seats, the People's Party could  see  the figure from the last elections increased by a dozen, since  it could hold 26 or 27 -- the same as the PSOE four years ago --  while Felipe Gonzalez' party would win 22, representing a loss  of five European deputies.    The other political parties would scarcely change their  position. The exception is United Left [IU], which, if the  voting intentions shown in the poll persist until 12 June, would  double its number of votes and seats. In 1989, Julio Anguita's  candidates won 7.3 percent of the votes, which enabled them to  hold four seats. The figures indicated by the poll are much  more encouraging; IU could win the support of 14 percent of the  electorate, which would be equivalent to nine or 10 seats.    Convergence and Union would also experience an improvement,  although less marked than IU's. Jordi Pujol's party could gain  a seat (rising to three from the two won in 1989), thanks to the  votes of 4.7 percent of the electorate.    The aforementioned four parties could share 60 of the 64  seats which Spanish citizens have to elect. The four remaining  seats would be distributed as follows: One for the Nationalist  Coalition (comprising the Basque Nationalist Party, the Canary  Islands Coalition, the Valencian Union, the Aragonese Party, and  the Majorcan Union), and between one and three for PEP  (comprising Eusko Alkartasuna [Basque Solidarity], Republican  Left of Catalonia, Comunero Land, and the Castilian Regionalist  Party), the Greens, and Andalusian Power. The Social and  Democratic Center Forum, with 0.8 percent of the interviewees'  votes, would secure no European deputy.    According to the opinion poll, only 13.7 percent of citizens  have expressed their intention not to vote. Hence the turnout  would be quite high, since 57 percent of voters, who have firmly  stated that they will vote, would go to the polls, plus another  18.4 percent undecided. In addition, the level of abstention  would not differ between men and women (13.7 percent of both  sexes), although 3 percent more men than women will go to the  polls.    Last, abstention will be greatest among the voters who voted  for IU in the last elections.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Observer: Big fish There seems to be something of a tradition of old Midland Bank hands ending up in retailing. Michael Julien, the former finance director, joined Storehouse (via Eurotunnel and Guinness) and John Harris, another former Midland high-flyer, spent a spell on the board of Great Universal Stores. Now Geoffrey Taylor, a former group chief executive and boss of the other two, has resurfaced as the new non-executive chairman of Fosters, a management buy-out from Sears. The 65-year-old Taylor has kept a low profile since he retired in 1986 after an unhappy period at Midland's helm. Apart from the chairmanship of Daiwa Europe Bank, he sits on the board of Y J Lovell and a Bermuda-based investment company. 'Clearing banking is partly retailing,' says Taylor, echoing a view commonly held during Midland's more go-go years. Whereas Midland is one of the Big Four clearing banks, the loss-making Fosters is a relative minnow in its industry with only 2.5 per cent of the UK menswear market and an annual turnover of not much more than Pounds 100m.</p>

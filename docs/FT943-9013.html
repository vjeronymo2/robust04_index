			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Fall in F &amp; C net assets - At a glance Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust reported interim results this week, showing a fall in net assets from 148p to 134.2p per share during the six months to June 30. The share price fell 10.9 per cent in the first half, which was not as much as the 13 per cent drop in the FT-SE-A All-Share Index. F &amp; C blamed fears of a higher inflation-rate and rising interest rates, particularly in the US, for the falls. It warned that stock markets may have difficulty in making progress, partly because of the rapid expansion of the US economy.</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Banham expects to create 40 unitaries Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission, told county councillors yesterday that he expected to create 'more than 40' English unitary authorities which will combine the powers now shared by counties and districts. He told the annual conference of the Association of County Councils in Leicester that there was overwhelming support for retaining a two-tier structure in four counties, according to opinion surveys carried out for the commission by the pollsters NOP. In Northumberland 86 per cent of respondents preferred the status quo, while there were figures of 65 per cent in Norfolk and 74 per cent in Suffolk. In Northamptonshire 34 per cent wanted a unitary Northampton while retaining two tiers for the rest of the county. A further 41 per cent wanted no change to the two-tier structure at all - although this was not an option presented by the commission. Sir John said: 'People are not willing to support an expensive gamble on the say-so of local politicians with a vested interest, and they have not been impressed by many campaigns - at public expense - designed to persuade them otherwise.' He added that by avoiding proposals for small unitary councils made by the Association of District Councils the commission had saved between Pounds 400m and Pounds 500m in transitional costs. However, Sir John said that proponents of unitary authorities would have the chance to prove their case 'on a massive scale'.</p>

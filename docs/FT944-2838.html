			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Karadzic offers new Bosnian plan Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic yesterday offered a six-point Bosnia peace plan which would include giving up some territory, releasing UN prisoners and allowing UN convoys to move unhindered, Reuter reports from New York. UN officials said Mr Karadzic's proposals were precisely those put to him by Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy in the Balkans. Mr Akashi said earlier he had won no commitment from Bosnian Serbs on a ceasefire. Former US President Jimmy Carter held out the possibility he would go to Bosnia.</p>

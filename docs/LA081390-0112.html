			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MARINE LIFTOFF EXACTS A TOLL -- WEDDING BELLS  </P> <P> A small wedding chapel 2 miles from the main gate of the Marine Corps base here  has done a booming business in the last week as American troops prepare to  leave for the Middle East.  </P> <P> "I've been doing weddings at 1 o'clock in the morning at home in my yard" to  accommodate last-minute requests, said Shirley Cowart, who conducts the  services.  </P> <P> Her phone now begins ringing for appointments at 5:30 a.m.  </P> <P> Since American troops began embarking for the Middle East last week, Cowart has  performed more weddings than she normally does in a month.  </P> <P> "It's very, very emotional. I think their happiness is just a cover-up. They  are all just very scared," she said.  </P> <P> Melinda Davis, 31, and Cpl. Lee Swain, 21, were among those who exchanged vows  at the chapel.  </P> <P> "Due to his deployment in several days, we've decided to go ahead and get  married," the bride said. "We'll have the big wedding when he gets back."  </P> <P> Deborah Castaneda, 30, and her new husband, Marc, 23, were wed Wednesday night,  even though they had planned a big church wedding for September. He left for  the Middle East on Sunday.  </P> <P> "I've been crying since Tuesday, the minute I found out that guys from  Twentynine Palms might be going and that my husband might be going with them,"  Castaneda said. "I spent my honeymoon preparing my husband's will and power of  attorney.  </P> <P> "He joined the Marine Corps to protect his country," she added. "I know why we  are there, but I want my husband back."  </P></p>

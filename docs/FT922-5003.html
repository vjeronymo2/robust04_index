			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London's robusta COFFEE market saw early gains erased in the afternoon, leaving the September contract unchanged from Friday's close. Dealers said there was little follow-through buying interest after Friday's advance in New York. The market could now settle down to trade in a narrow band ahead of the first set of negotiations for a new coffee pact on June 22-26. Dealers discounted some unconfirmed talk of cold weather in Brazil. LME trading was mainly influenced by fluctuations in the sterling/dollar exchange rate, with most metals ending below their highs. Three-month TIN touched a 20-month high of Dollars 6,460 a tonne after European trade buying touched off short covering and buy stops. While profit taking eventually pared gains, chartists are still looking for a near-term target of Dollars 6,500. Nymex PLATINUM futures were firmer at midday as the fundamental front continued to look bright. Analysts cited continued concerns over the availability of physical supply, particularly in Europe, as well as perceptions that European car companies are coming to market. The EC set the end of this year as the deadline for new models of gasoline-powered cars to have catalytic converters. Compiled from Reuters</p>

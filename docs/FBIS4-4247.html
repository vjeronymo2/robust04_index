			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- In the coming ten  years China will construct more than 70 local railways, with a  total length of over 7,000 km.    Xu Dakun, an official of the Local Railway Association of  China, said here today that these projects, distributed over 12  provinces, have already been listed in the Ninth Five-Year Plan  (1996-2000) of various localities.    Xu said that by the end of 1993, China had 81 operating  local  railways in 17 provinces and autonomous regions, with a total  length of over 4,800 km.    At present some 20 local railways are being constructed,  with  a length of more than 2,000 km.    China's local railways experienced a golden development time  in the past ten years, with over 2,460 km of track laid. The  total investment during this period was nearly 4.6 billion yuan,  of which more than 4.1 billion yuan was raised by the local  governments, while the Ministry of Railways put in 440 million  yuan.    China's local railways are differentiated from state-run  railways by the characteristics that the construction cost is  mainly raised by local governments, and the local governments  have partial or complete management rights. Local railways have  now become an organic part of China's transport network.    To ease the present strained condition of railway transport,  the Chinese Government has in recent years drafted a series of  significant policies to promote railway development, which  include preferential policies encouraging local governments to  construct railways with self-raised funds.    In addition, the Chinese Government also encourages local  governments to construct railways with overseas funds. So far  the world bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Japanese  Government and Taiwan have provided money for local railway  construction.    Xu revealed that six new local railways are prepared to  introduce overseas construction funds.    He said that since the founding of New China in 1949,  China's  railways have developed from 22,000 km to more than 54,000 km,  of which 41 lines, or over 3,100 km, have been constructed by  local governments and transferred to the state. Some of them  have now become an important part of the national railway  network.    By the year 2000, China's operating railways will exceed  8,000 km, with a freight transport volume of 100 million tons,  Xu added.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> MAN'S POCKET RADIO STOPS BULLET  </P> <P> A pocket radio stopped a bullet fired point-blank at a mugging victim's chest  early today, police said.  </P> <P> Gary Lee, 24, was in a telephone booth at Gage Avenue and Broadway about 1:10  a.m. calling for help after his car broke down when he was approached by two  young men, one carrying a handgun, Sgt. Doug Tantee said.  </P> <P> "They asked him for his wallet and he complied," Tantee said. "Nevertheless,  the one with a gun put it right up over the left side of his chest, right over  the heart, and fired once."  </P> <P> Lee reeled from the impact and collapsed to the sidewalk, thinking he had been  gravely wounded. But when paramedics ripped off his shirt, they found no  wounds. On closer inspection, they found the slug embedded in the radio in his  jacket's left breast pocket, Tantee said.  </P> <P> Lee, a security guard, was unharmed.  </P> <P> The assailants, described as 18 to 20 years old, escaped with the wallet, which  contained $100, Tantee said.  </P></p>

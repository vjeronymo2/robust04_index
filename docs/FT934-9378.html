			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Bare shelves and barely a choice: The grim outlook for the people of Serbia 'BUT who else?' is the brazen electoral slogan for the ruling Socialists of Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, as 2,000 per cent a month inflation plunges Serbia into poverty. Mr Milosevic last week boasted how 'the Serbian economy, in spite of the draconian embargo, is faring even better than countries which receive economic aid'. But even Mr Milosevic's optimistic remarks can no longer mask the impoverishment of the country's 9.8m inhabitants. While the Serbian president blames United Nations sanctions for economic collapse, the country's coffers have been emptied to pay for Serb armies in Bosnia and Croatia. The average wage has fallen below DM10 (Pounds 4) a month - which buys one kilo of meat. Serb officials claim that 70 per cent of economic activity is in the grey market, eluding tax collectors. Faced with a huge budget deficit, the cash-hungry government has flooded the market with dinars in order to boost hard currency reserves. In the most recent effort to lure people into converting their dwindling hard currency savings, the government 10 days ago lifted a three-month ban on converting hard currency through giro accounts - at a premium rate of up to twice the black market rate. On Tuesday, however, the government devalued the dinar by 98.5 per cent and made giro payments illegal. In the crucial run-up to parliamentary elections, set for December 19, the Socialists are keen to put a gloss on the grim economic picture. They need to increase pensions and wages, decimated by inflation, and return basic staples to grocery store shelves. Belgrade is also paying more than 1m workers sacked when their factories shut because of the break-up of the Yugoslav market and the sanctions. The powerful state television will convince Serbian citizens that there is no alternative to the Socialist party: a pitch borne out by the failure of the quarrelsome and disorganised opposition to pose a coherent challenge. The ultranationalist leader, Mr Vojislav Seselj, their lone political challenger, is being systematically discredited. A paramilitary commander who last year was accused of war crimes by the US, he achieved widespread popularity as the leader of the second biggest political party. At that point, his meteoric rise to power was aided by both the state television, and Serbia's secret police. But, after the collapse last month of his unofficial alliance with Mr Milosevic, Mr Seselj became the target of a smear campaign orchestrated by the state-controlled media and the secret police. The government of Macedonia yesterday arrested several ethnic Albanians, including two deputy ministers in the coalition government, on charges of preparing an armed rebellion. Macedonian police yesterday renewed their clampdown on Gostivar and Tetovo, mostly ethnic Albanian towns. The move could shatter the fragile ethnic co-existence between Albanians and Macedonians in the former Yugoslav republic. Albanians comprise 20 per cent of the 2m people.</p>

In the 1994 budget, the sale of these shares is  expected to bring in $900 million.    According to the latest decree's foundations, autonomous  corporations and state companies must turn over the minority  stock they hold to the National Privatization Fund, which is  managed by BNDES [National Bank for Economic and Social  Development], which will handle the sale. BNDES Director Elena  Landau stated in Rio de Janeiro that her bank is waiting for the  state companies to provide an inventory of minority stock that  they have in other companies.    The new decree was prompted by the failure of the first  attempt to force the state companies to sell the minority shares  they own. Put together, these shares are estimated to be worth  $900 million. Government experts believe the actual income from  the sale of these shares will surpass the initial estimate  because some of the state companies have been privatized since  the estimate was made and the value of their shares has gone up.  Thus, state companies that own shares of companies that have  been privatized will obtain more funds and this, in turn, will  improve the value of their own shares.    There are cases of government companies that are minority  stockholders in other companies because of fiscal incentives,  such is the case of Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation]  and Conab [National Supply Company], which own shares of hotels;  informatics corporations like Dataprev [Social Security Data  Processing Enterprise], which owns shares of a petrochemical  company; and Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications  Corporation], which owns shares of the Uberaba Water Supply  Company.</p>

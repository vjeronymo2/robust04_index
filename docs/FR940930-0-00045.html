Due to lack of industry understanding of the term ``shell homes'' and other circumstances, many sellers of factory-built housing have not viewed the Guides as relevant to their sales practices. The Guides, to be made up-to-date, also would require extensive revision. Although the revision and reissuance of the Guides might be warranted if there were evidence of significant marketing abuses covered by the Guides, the Commission has no such evidence. It appears that likely abuses, if any, could be adequately addressed by state and local housing code enforcement authorities. Accordingly, the Commission has determined that the costs associated with revising and reissuing the Guides would outweigh the benefits, and the Guides should be repealed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the Commission is eliminating the Guides, proceedings still may be brought against businesses under section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1), for engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce in the advertising and sale of these products. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> September 30, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Requests for copies of this document should be sent to the Public Reference Branch, Room 130, Federal Trade Commission, Washington D.C. 20580. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Joel N.

Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> As a part of its ongoing project to review all rules and guides, on September 11, 1992, the Commission invited comment on the Guides for Advertising Shell Homes, 16 CFR Part 230. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The notice contained six questions relating to the economic impact and continuing relevance of the Guides, any burdens relating to adherence to them, any changes needed to minimize their economic impact, their relation to other federal or state laws or regulations, and any changed conditions since they were issued and the effect of these changes on them. The comment period ended on October 13, 1992. In response, one comment was received. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> ``Request for Comments Concerning Guides for Advertising Shell Homes,'' 57 FR 41707, P924219, A&hyph;1, p. 41707. The record in this proceeding has been designated P924219 in the Commission's Public Reference Branch. A copy of the Commission's request for comments originally appearing in 57 FR 41707 is designated document A&hyph;1, and is filed in a single volume labeled P924219. There are three categories, ``A,'' ``B,'' and ``G'' for the materials in this volume. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> Comment of Marjory Wood, Chesterton, IN, P924219, G&hyph;1 (Sept. 25, 1992). Ms. Wood stated that around the time of the Great Depression her father, a civil engineer, had invented portable, demountable houses for emergency use. She suggested that his plans be revived to cope with the losses of housing occasioned by recent natural disasters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> To obtain additional information about shell homes, staff contacted representatives of the National Institute of Building Sciences, the Manufactured Housing Institute, the National Manufactured Housing Federation, and the National Association of Home Manufacturers. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Additionally, staff contacted nine randomly-selected manufacturers of factory-built housing from a directory of over 250 such businesses <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  and elicited comments and advertising materials from two manufacturers or sellers of factory-built houses or factory-built housing components. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  On the basis of the information collected by the staff, it appeared that manufacturers of factory-built housing, including manufacturers of housing the Commission has characterized as ``shell'' homes, are not familiar with the Guides. This is because, in part, the term ``shell'' homes is not adequately defined in the Guides and is not a classification used by any segment of today's factory-built housing industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> Report of telephone interviews by John Dugan, P 924219, B&hyph;7 (June 1, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> A.M.

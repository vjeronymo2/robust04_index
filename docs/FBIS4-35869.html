			<p>BFN     [Text] Border police have detained dozens of rioters and  stone throwers in Hebron and a curfew has been imposed on the  town center. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that two  explosive devices were hurled at an IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  patrol last night, but nobody was hurt. Disturbances broke out  a short time ago in Ramallah. A soldier sustained light wounds  from a stone and glass splinters when a military vehicle was  stoned in the center of town. One of the soldiers opened fire to  extricate the vehicle from the stone throwers. Border police  forces restored order with tear gas and rubber bullets. There  have so far been four people lightly wounded and they were  transferred to Ramallah hospital.    The IDF this morning prevented a group of Jordan Rift Valley  settlers from entering Jericho in a convoy bearing Israeli flags  thereby protesting the fact that at the weekend the IDF  prevented one of the settlers from passing through Jericho with  an Israeli flag. Earlier, there was a clash between Israeli  policemen and the demonstrators when the former tried to prevent  Palestinian vehicles from traveling with PLO flags along roads  in the Jordan Rift Valley.</p>

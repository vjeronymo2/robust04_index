			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Russia backs down in row over UK beef aid THE ROW over whether Russia would accept 2,000 tonnes of UK beef aid ended yesterday after British and European Community vets reached agreement with the Russians that it poses no threat of 'mad cow' disease. The deal, which makes shipments conditional on 'detailed documentation covering production of the meat', followed a two-day visit to Moscow by Mr Keith Meldrum, chief vet of the Ministry of Agriculture, for discussions with his Russian counterparts. EC vets were also present. A Russian statement said that the shipments would come from cattle less than three years old - born after the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) which hit Britain in 1988 - and slaughtered last year. In Brussels, the European Commission voted unanimously to continue to include UK beef in food aid allocations to the former Soviet republics. Brussels has made clear it cannot eliminate UK beef from consignments because this would risk a new consumer scare over BSE of the type which led to the near-collapse of the EC beef market over the past two years. It earmarked a further 1,500 tonnes of British beef for Russia, as part of the third Ecu85m (Pounds 60m) tranche of the Ecu200m food grants. Senior officials overrode departmental advice to avoid controversy by sending all the UK beef to St Petersburg, deciding instead that 500 tonnes would go to the Moscow authorities who originated the dispute. The Russians are said by Brussels officials to have been concerned not about the risk of humans consuming the beef, but of consignments going missing and being reprocessed for animal feed, thereby transplanting BSE to Russia. This is accepted in good faith in Brussels, but some senior officials remain convinced that sharp beef traders sowed the doubt in Russian minds, in order to position themselves for later sales, to be paid for by Ecu1.25bn in EC food credits to the former Soviet republics. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister in charge of the Russian economy, said yesterday that vets from the Russian Ministry of Agriculture would visit Britain to see for themselves how meat was treated to remove the danger of BSE contamination. As one of the first consignments of European Community emergency aid to help Russia through the winter, the rejection of an initial planeload of 118 tonnes of British beef provided an important test for the new Russian government. Mr Alexander Zhitnikov, deputy social affairs minister, said that the state had so far prosecuted 50 people in 39 cases of theft of aid.</p>

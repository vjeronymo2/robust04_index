			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont upbeat on recovery prospects IN ANOTHER upbeat assessment of the outlook for the economy Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, told the Commons yesterday 'the prospects for sustained recovery are good'. He emphasised that both inflation and the rate of increase in earnings were at their lowest level for 25 years, while productivity in manufacturing industry was increasing sharply. Mr Lamont acknowledged the need for 'firm control' over public expenditure in responding to concern expressed by government backbenchers and opposition MPs about the size of the public sector borrowing requirement. Stressing the need to bring the PSBR down, he assured the House that it was 'a very high priority' for the government. Ms Clare Short (Lab Birmingham Ladywood) accused the chancellor of 'pushing up' the sterling exchange rate and warned that it might result in the recovery being lost. Mr Lamont retorted: 'The pound is floating and we have no exchange rate target'. Further cuts in interest rates were urged by Mr Austin Mitchell (Lab Great Grimsby), who said the government should stop trying to 'talk the pound up again'. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, told Mr Mitchell not to put his faith in devaluation, which had never been a way out of Britain's problems. Underlining the importance of competitiveness, Mr Portillo said it was 'extremely encouraging' that while unit wage costs were falling in Britain they were continuing to rise in Japan and Germany. Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's frontbench City spokesman, called on the government to condemn the 'exorbitant' Pounds 10m a year reportedly received by a Royal Bank of Scotland executive while others less well off were being urged to take little or no increase in their pay. While refusing to comment on individual salaries, Sir John Cope, the paymaster general, insisted that ministers had set an example which he would like to see followed by others in industry and commerce.</p>

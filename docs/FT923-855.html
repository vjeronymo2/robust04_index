			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (13): Advantages of an implant - Case Study / Gray Dawes and Lloyds International COMPANIES ARE at last paying as much attention to their travel budgets as they have traditionally lavished on their advertising expenditures or their vehicle fleets. Lloyds Bank spends around Pounds 5m a year on travel, with just over Pounds 2m going on air tickets and almost Pounds 3m on hotel accommodation. Last year, just as companies ask for speculative pitches from advertising agencies, so Lloyds asked for proposals from 10 specialist companies on how best to run its travel purchasing. The winner would set up an implant, a four-strong travel agency, plus a messenger, inside Lloyds Hay's Lane building to handle the travel needs of the entire Lloyds group. After viewing four presentations, Mr Glyn Farrell, who manages Lloyds Personnel and Travel Services, chose Gray Dawes Travel. It was hardly surprising. The City-based Gray Dawes had first started to work for Lloyds International on an ad hoc basis 10 years ago. Five years ago it established its own team inside Lloyds. After inspecting the field Mr Farrell stuck with the travel specialists he knew. In three years' time he will keep Gray Dawes on its toes by repeating the trawl. Mr Farrell reckons that by using a specialist implant travel bureau Lloyds both saves money and operates more efficiently. Apart from local trips of up to about 40 miles, all the travel needs of Lloyds managers go through the Gray Dawes team, which issues tickets, makes hotel bookings, arranges currency, renews passports and obtains visas from an office alongside that of Mr Farrell. Soon there might be satellite offices which might also be capable of issuing tickets, etc. In his latest review Mr Farrell examined the cost of reviving an internal department, or of putting travel needs out to an outside agency (where there is the danger of being just one client among many) and concluded, as more and more large companies do, that the implant system is the most efficient. As well as the expertise of the travel team seconded to it, Lloyds saves on the personnel costs, such as pensions and financial perks, of employing its own staff. And if for any reason a face does not fit, Gray Dawes can switch the employee to another client. Mr Farrell might well see some of the airline or hotel representatives who visit him with tempting discount offers and pass on their suggestions to Gray Dawes, but they handle all the arrangements. Each month he is provided with a detailed computerised breakdown of Lloyds travelling expenses, which enables him to pinpoint which executive went where and at what cost. Over the years the travelling has increased but the budget has stayed roughly the same. Obviously, the recession has hit the airlines and the hotels hard and they have responded by chasing business customers with attractive offers. But not that attractive. Lloyds and Gray Dawes work with a limited number of airlines in order to secure discounts from achieving target expenditures but, on air travel, discounts rarely top 5 per cent of the listed price, although competition is forcing them marginally higher. However, Gray Dawes attempts to exploit all the Apex savings available from early booking. Currently British Airways, United, and Virgin (its new mid class is deemed attractive to executives) serve Lloyds' transatlantic requirements. For Europe the need for speed and the general absence of discounts mean that the most efficient flight is booked irrespective of the carrier. The opening up of the skies over Europe could greatly reduce business travel costs on the Continent. Like most companies, Lloyds is cutting back on first-class and business class travel. It not only saves money but conveys an appropriate cost trimming image for the times. Only 150 Lloyds executives are frequent international travellers and around 30 can expect to go first-class. In the last five years the company has reduced first-class travel by around 20 per cent. Expenditure on business class travelling has also been curbed, although if an airline makes a special promotional offer of upgrades for frequent business fliers (and the new American airlines crossing the Atlantic are particularly inclined to do so) Lloyds is happy to take advantage of the deals. It allows its executive to discover his or her good fortune on arrival at the airport. It does not want to encourage an upgrade mentality in the company. In the current business climate discounts of up to 50 per cent on hotel accommodation can be secured by Gray Dawes, and not only by dealing with the big international hotel chains. However, if executives complain about a hotel, it is quickly dropped from the schedule. Mr Farrell believes that many companies keep a close watch on their travel costs but waste money on the more expensive area of accommodation. It is not the travel department's task to fix the budgets: the various departments in Lloyds know their travel needs best. But Mr Farrell helps to police them and to ensure that they stay within the fixed limits and take advantage of any special offers that come on to the market. By having a travel company working exclusively in-house on its behalf, Mr Farrell believes that expertise, efficiency and effort are as good as doubled.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The military court in Nabulus has handed down 10  life sentences to 'Abd-al-Rahim Hasan Shadid, a 24-year-old  Fatah member from a village near Nabulus. He was convicted of  eight counts of murder of Palestinians who were said to have  cooperated with Israel and of wounding four others, as well as  three counts of attempting to attack Israeli soldiers. Rifles,  a machine gun, pistols, and grenades were found in his home.  Shadid confessed and said he had no regrets about carrying out  the violence.    Meanwhile, Fatah members serving life prison terms have been  freed recently in the framework of the Cairo accord. One of  them was sentenced to nine life terms for the murder of at least  nine Palestinians on the grounds they cooperated with Israel.    [Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 23 June on page 16  carries a report by David Regev adding: "Thirty-eight  Palestinian terrorists who were released in the last few months  as part of the agreement with the PLO and who resumed their  terror activities have once again been imprisoned by the  security forces.    ["Sources said the security forces are furious about the  releases and their inability to keep track of the discharged  prisoners, many of whom resume their terror activities."]</p>

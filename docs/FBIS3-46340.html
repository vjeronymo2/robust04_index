			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Teng Mei-ling (6772 5019 3781): "`Peace </F> Charter' Signatories Issue Statement Demanding Qin Yongmin's  Release and Abolition of Reeducation-Through-Labor"]    [Text] Qin Yongmin, "Peace Charter" drafter, was recently  sentenced by the mainland authorities to two years' reeducation-  through-labor on a charge of "disturbing public order and  security." The other 11 signatories of the "Peace Charter"  yesterday issued a statement, denouncing the authorities for  violating the civil rights of the people on the mainland as  specified by the mainland Constitution and trampling on the  mainland citizens' freedom of speech and assembly. Yang Zhou,  one of the signatories, said that while telling the outside  world that they were going to release prisoners, the mainland  authorities continued to pass reeducation- through-labor  sentences, showing that their deeds did not match their words.    In yesterday's statement, the "Peace Charter" signatories  stressed that the action by the mainland authorities was one of  trampling upon and mocking the mainland Constitution. The  statement strongly demanded that the authorities release Qin  Yongmin and abolish the reeducatioan-through-labor system. The  main points of the statement are as follows:    1. The contents of the "Peace Charter" did not go beyond the  limits allowed by China's current laws and regulations. Chinese  citizens have the right to make proposals on the state system  within the limits allowed by the Constitution. The persecution  of the "Peace Charter" drafters in any form is to rudely trample  upon and ruthlessly mock the laws in our country.    2. The purpose of the "Peace Charter" was to promote  peaceful changes. Democratic politics and the protection of  human rights represent the world trend. We shall never give up  our position and ideals and shall never yield to any pressure,  even if this means that we lose our personal freedom and lives.    3. We strongly demand that the authorities release Qin  Yongmin and guarantee that they will no longer violate the legal  rights of the citizens in any form. In view of the similar  unfortunate experience of such democracy champions as Qi Dashan,  Zhang Xianliang, and Fu Shenqi, we call for: The immediate  abolition of the reeducation-through-labor system and the  detention-for- investigation system, which go against the  existing criminal law in our country; and for stripping the  administrative institutions of the illegal power to deprive  citizens of their personal freedom without trial by the judicial  organs.    Yesterday, when answering reporters' inquiries, Yang Zhou  said that the action by the authorities had aroused indignation  among the people and he also felt that the action by the  authorities was extremely ridiculous. He said that the "Peace  Charter" was aimed at peace but it had been treated violently by  the authorities and he felt that this was rather ironic. He  added that the authorities sentenced Qin Yongmin without trial  and this was not the sort of behavior expected of the state in a  country exercising rule of law, thus it crushed the people's  hopes.    In addition, Lo Hoi-sing, who was jailed on  counterrevolutionary charges in the 1989 prodemocracy movement,  said yesterday: Although the mainland authorities have made  concessions on the human rights issue to the United States and  indicated that they would release some prodemocracy activists,  their basic attitude toward human rights and the prodemocracy  movement has not changed because, when talking about the  releases, the mainland authorities continued to arrest  prodemocracy activists and sentence them to imprisonment. The  action against Qin Yongmin was a good example. He held that as  long as the "old man" who held the paramount power in the  Chinese mainland continued to regard the prodemocracy movement  as an unstable factor, the mainland authorities will never  change this point of view.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 29 (CTK) -- Slovak Privatization  Minister Milan Janicina today said that coupon privatization  will be the chief method used in the second wave of  privatization in Slovakia. Slovakia needs a speedy reform of  the half-communist economic system, while having little capital  and also little time, Janicina told CTK.    He did not dismiss other privatization methods, including  direct sales, but said that in no case would they be used to the  same extent as by the Meciar government.    "A government coalition deputy cannot be allowed to carry  out  a survey and then pass the property into his party colleague's  hands," said Janicina. He sees direct sales linked mainly with  foreign investments.    Janicina also believes that lucrative enterprises, such as  Transgas or arms manufacturers, will be included in the second  wave of voucher privatization. Although nearly 60 percent of  Slovak enterprises are on the verge of bankruptcy and the real  value of their property is deep below its nominal appraisal,  Janicina sees no problem in selecting enterprises for coupon  privatization.    Property worth 100 billion Slovak crowns will be set aside  for coupon privatization. The government will seek to open the  preliminary round before the autumn parliamentary elections.</p>

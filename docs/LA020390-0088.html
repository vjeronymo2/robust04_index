			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EMPIRE LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LOS ALAMITOS HITS FREE THROWS TO SINK LOARA  </P> <P> Just when things started to get interesting Friday night, Los Alamitos High  School found the poise, patience and know-how to put away Loara one more time.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos hit 16 of 21 free throws in the fourth quarter and held off the  Saxons to win, 86-82, in an Empire League game at Loara High School. With the  victory, Los Alamitos clinched at least a tie for the league title.  </P> <P> The game looked like a rout for the first half, with Los Alamitos (18-5, 8-0 in  league play) holding a 19-8 lead after the first quarter and a 47-34 lead at  halftime. But Loara came back strong in the second half, rallying for a 76-74  lead with 2:40 left to play.  </P> <P> But that's as close as Loara (14-6, 3-5) would get.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos center Robert Conlisk made both ends of a one-and-one and three  other Griffins -- Kyle Hoffman, Jason Cunningham and Danny Stockwell --  repeated that feat to improve Los Alamitos' lead to 84-78 with 50 seconds  remaining.  </P> <P> "They proved why they're the league champions," Loara Coach Jerry Halpin said.  "We did exactly what we wanted . . . (but) they sank all their free throws.  They were dynamite."  </P> <P> Actually, Los Alamitos finished the game shooting 76% from the foul line. Loara  made 68% of its free throws.  </P> <P> "We were poised when it counted," Los Alamitos Coach Steve Brooks said. "I'm  really pleased to see them nail their free throws like that when they had to."  </P> <P> Brooks said that having never lost to Loara before, his team had the confidence  in needed to hold off the rally.  </P> <P> Judging by the first half, it didn't appear Los Alamitos would have to dig  deeper than average effort, especially compared to the last time these teams  met.  </P> <P> In that game, Los Alamitos managed a 93-91 victory, despite Tes Whitlock's 54  points.  </P> <P> This time around, Whitlock, who averages 30.5 points a game, was held to just  20, thanks to the defense of Danny Stockwell and an occasional extra Griffin  defender when Brooks felt double-teaming was necessary.  </P> <P> Jason Cunningham led Los Alamitos with 27 points, many on flashy drives through  traffic. Conlisk had 17 points -- including three slams -- and four blocked  shots. Stockwell added 15 points for the Griffins.  </P> <P> Joey Gaudio led Loara with 22 points, including six in a row to open the fourth  quarter. Kareem Collins added 19 and Charlie Gipson 10 for Loara.  </P> <P> In other league games:  </P> <P> El Dorado 95, Katella 57 -- Mike Bradach, a senior guard, scored a career-high  40 points to lead host El Dorado (13-9, 4-4). Bradach was 10 of 14 from the  field and 20 of 21 from the free-throw line.  </P> <P> He had 15 points in the first quarter, eight in the second, 12 in the third and  five before he came out in the fourth. Bradach also had 10 assists and seven  rebounds. El Dorado led, 42-27, at the half.  </P> <P> Cypress 66, Esperanza 55 -- Tied at 31-31 at halftime, Cypress went into a  full-court press and outscored visiting Esperanza, 21-6, in the third quarter  on the way to its first league victory. Cypress (8-12, 1-7) was led by forward  Courtney Smalley's 21 points. Kevin Smith and Jared Rice each added 18. Walter  Forcatto scored 15 points for Esperanza (14-10, 6-2).  </P></p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Japanese steel Interim losses from Japan's steel industry, the world's largest, were as the market expected: truly awful. The best that can be said is that the industry is at the bottom of the cycle. The companies believe losses will fall sharply in the second half. But the reprieve will only be temporary. Restructuring during the recession has been cosmetic by US and even European standards. Japan still has excess capacity of around 20m tonnes on most estimates. It would be too much to expect across-the-board capacity cuts during a cyclical upturn. But unless the industry uses the next few years to reduce capacity, the next downturn will be just as bad as the recent one.</p>

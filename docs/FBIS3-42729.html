According to the president,  the integral problem for him is organizational development of a  state in which the internal factor of stability is "balancing  the powers of the branches and their democratic renewal." At the  same time, Kravchuk assured those present that the presidential  structures will do everything possible to make the elections to  parliament happen and to ensure that "qualified and  conscientious people" work in the new parliament on a  professional basis.    However, in Leonid Kravchuk's opinion, elections to the  parliament do not represent the final step in the renewal of  authority, and Ukraine needs a wholesome system under which the  president would be taken out of the system of executive power  and would remain only the head of state speaking on its behalf.  "The president should not be placed above all--only outside the  executive branch. He controls it but does not interfere with its  work," Kravchuk summed up. He also supported the proposal to  combine in one person the jobs of the heads of local executive  and legislative authority and have the entire population of the  region elect such an official. As the only mandatory condition  Leonid Kravchuk named the right of the Cabinet of Ministers to  remove such officials without the concurrence of local soviets  in the event they violate the Ukrainian Constitution. "Unless we  have this, people will circle around such an official like a cat  around hot cereal but will not be able to do anything. Even the  president may be impeached, but we not have any mechanism to  remove officials in the regions," Kravchuk insisted, and the  speaker, Ivan Plushch, completely agreed with him.    Leonid Kravchuk also supported the idea of expanding the  regions' rights and said that he has already began to experiment  in this direction, giving eastern regions of Ukraine greater  powers in the matter of disposal of state property on their  territory. However, coming upon the problem of the Crimea,  Kravchuk said that it should be written into the new Ukrainian  Constitution that the executive branch of the autonomous  republic is formed on the basis of the Ukrainian Constitution  and laws, as well as on the basis of the Constitution of the  Republic of Crimea, which should be brought in line with the  fundamental law of Ukraine. In addition, Kravchuk proposed to  change the current Ukrainian Constitution in such a way that the  president of the country would have the right to cancel  decisions of the Crimean parliament if they violate Ukrainian  legislation. "Otherwise, why do we need to put there that Crimea  is a part of Ukraine?" asked Leonid Kravchuk and added that this  provision should not be used as a political screen. Speaker Ivan  Plushch said that the Ukrainian Supreme Council will definitely  change Article 114 of the Ukrainian Constitution, and the  conference participants wrote a respective point into their  summary document.    The president expressed doubts that the new constitution may  be adopted by the current Supreme Council. He urged that for the  transition period the fundamental constitutional provision for  organizing the state power proposed by the parliament be adopted  at the all-Ukraine referendum (simultaneously with elections to  the parliament). In his words, this document should become the  basis for the future constitution. "The main task of the  fundamental provisions is to balance responsibilities and rights  between the branches, to set the mechanism for their mutual  checks and balances." Kravchuk summed up and repeated his old  thesis on the need to remove from the future fundamental law all  provisions on the state language, symbols, the socioeconomic  system, and others that may exacerbate political confrontation  in the society. Closer to the end of the conference's work,  Leonid Kravchuk cheerfully informed all present that the  Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers has decided to cut the executive  branch apparatus at all levels by 25 percent.    The conference of council representatives approved the text  of the fundamental constitutional provisions on authority and  recommended discussing them at the parliament meetings, and then  later put them up to an all-Ukraine referendum on 27 March. It  looks like the current deputy corps will arrive at a similar  decision; therefore, it is safe to assume that the council's  conference, as journalists covering its work collectively  determined, was another attempt on the part of various circles  of the ruling central and regional nomenklatura to reach a  compromise in an unconstitutional but peaceful manner as they  approach presidential and parliamentary elections. They have  succeeded in doing this; however, the fate of the compromise in  the final count will depend on the results of both the  parliament election and the referendum--if it takes place. It is  quite possible that supporters of one or the other branch will  win the elections, who will then assume additional powers.  Another possibility is a victory of reformers, who will attempt  to remove the nomenklatura both from power and from conducting  privatization to its own benefit.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] London, April 22 (XINHUA) -- NATO today threatened  the use of air power against the Bosnian Serb Forces around the  Muslim town of Gorazde unless they pull back three kilometers  from the center of the town by 00:01 GMT on Sunday [24 April],  according to the BBC.    The ultimatum, issued after a meeting of NATO ambassadors at  the NATO headquarters in Brussels, also asked Serbs to stop  shelling Gorazde immediately and give U.N. personnel access to  the town, one of the six U.N.-designated "safe areas" for  Muslims in Bosnia.    NATO said that if all conditions were not met, it would  consider air strikes on Serb positions within a 20-kilometer  radius of Gorazde.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Industry sees 2.4% growth in Japan JAPAN'S Economic Planning Agency said a survey of leading industrial companies found that most expect the Japanese economy to grow by about 2.4 per cent this fiscal year - well below the official government forecast of 3.3 per cent. The survey of 1,882 non-financial companies listed on the country's three largest stock exchanges also found that only 2.5 per cent have resorted to early retirement schemes or dismissed workers as part of their cost-cutting programmes. Export-oriented manufacturers told the EPA that an exchange rate of Y124 to the US dollar was about the break-even point for their companies, though the Japanese currency has traded as low as Y113.30 over the past week and hovered around the Y114 level on the Tokyo foreign exchange market yesterday. Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, speaking after a meeting of regional branch managers of his bank, said there was no good economic reason for the sudden rise in the yen, as a recovery was unlikely until late this year. However, he cited an apparent lift in corporate confidence in recent weeks as a good sign for economic activity, which has been restrained by executives' generally gloomy expectations for consumer demand and capital spending this year. The EPA said companies responding to its survey planned to increase capital spending by an annual average of 2.8 per cent over the next three years - over the past three years, annual growth has averaged 10.5 per cent. EPA officials said Japanese companies did not want to lay off workers, but clearly believed they were carrying excess staff, notably middle-aged managers. About 67 per cent of companies said they had too many administrative staff, while 34.6 per cent claim to have too many managers in technical divisions.</p>

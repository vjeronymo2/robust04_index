			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz plans expansion outside Germany Mercedes-Benz, the automobile subsidiary of the Daimler-Benz group, is to increase commercial vehicle production outside Germany. The expansion will concentrate on the south American market as well as China and Indonesia, according to Mr Bernd Gottschalk, the Mercedes-Benz board director responsible for truck production, in an interview with a German newspaper. The plan is consistent with Mercedes' decision to shift production of passenger vehicles out of the high-cost German manufacturing environment but, according to Mr Gottschalk, the purpose of the expansion is to take advantage of new market opportunities and benefit from lower costs. The share of foreign production of commercial vehicles has risen over recent decades to around 50 per cent in 1993, in stark contrast with Mercedes passenger cars, all built in Germany. This is set to change following Mercedes' decision earlier this year to build a car factory in Alabama, but this month Daimler stepped back from further foreign production when it decided to locate production of a planned small car in Germany rather than abroad. Mr Gottschalk said that Mercedes planned to start selling light commercial vehicles, in south America. The group planned to invest about Dollars 100m in new production capacity in Argentina. The new factory will be used to assemble 15,000 to 20,000 new T1N trucks each year to be sold throughout South American, operating in tandem with the group's main production site for light commercial vehicles at Dusseldorf in Germany. The T1N will come to the market in early 1995. The executive said the group intended to strengthen its presence in China, where it already plans two joint ventures to manufacture buses and is in talks with a local manufacturer over a joint venture to build engines. This could lead to production of medium-weight commercial vehicles in China, he added. Mr Gottschalk, who mentioned plans for increased production in Indonesia as well, insisted that the expansion abroad would not be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany. He said the future of domestic plants was not black, so long as restructuring plans were implemented effectively. He said that commercial vehicle turnover would drop this year by about 5 per cent from DM26.9bn in 1992, while unit sales would fall 7 per cent to 255,000.</p>

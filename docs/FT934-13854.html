			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Russia spurns Japan's plea over dumping FRESH tension entered relations between Japan and Russia yesterday, when Tokyo issued a formal protest over Russian dumping of nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan. Mr Lyudvig Chizhov, the Russian ambassador to Japan, was summoned to the Foreign Ministry to receive a demand that no further dumping should occur. Mr Chizhov was reported to have replied that Russia did not plan to end the practice, because of inadequate storage on land. At the same time, the US lent Japan its support by urging Russia to honour an international moratorium on dumping nuclear waste at sea. The dumping, last Sunday, of 900 tonnes of low-level coolant and cleaning water from Russia's ageing fleet of nuclear submarines, has provoked widespread anger in Japan. It came only a week after strained relations with Russia looked set to improve, thanks to a diplomatically successful visit to Tokyo by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president. The Foreign Ministry asked Mr Chizhov to ensure that the Moscow government cancelled plans to dump a second load of radioactive waste by November 15 and repeated an offer to help Russia dispose of nuclear waste on its own territory. 'It is absolutely deplorable. We shall strongly protest if Russia goes ahead with plans to dump nuclear waste again,' said Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's foreign minister. The complaint was delivered after a cabinet meeting in which several ministers voiced anger. Officials from both sides are to meet in Moscow on November 11 and 12 to discuss the problem of radioactive waste dumping at sea. Russia informed the International Atomic Energy Agency in advance, an agency official confirmed yesterday. The moratorium on dumping only covers high-level waste, though signatory countries had also voluntarily decided not to dump low-level material, he said. The radioactivity of both loads of waste, as registered by the Russians, was within agency guidelines.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Letter: Customs and Excise displays an exceptionally long reach Sir, Tales of the treatment of the taxpayer by Customs and Excise are becoming legendary. The following is a case which we feel quite exceptional. A client company had only one director. Unfortunately the director, although only young, died of a sudden illness. At the time of death he was not in default with Customs and Excise. When we received the various papers to finalise the company's affairs some time afterwards, we also received a notice of assessment and surcharge. We wrote asking that this be suspended until the executors were in a position to deal with the situation. Subsequently we dealt with the final return and deregistration. We have now received a further surcharge notice in the sum of Pounds 52.31. After telephoning and reiterating the facts, we have been informed that we must appeal in writing. What does constitute reasonable excuse? Death, it would appear, does not qualify. More seriously, who is policing these people?

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / International Company News: Fall at French retailer BHV, the French retail group best known for its department store by the Hotel de Ville in Paris, suffered a sharp fall in interim net profits to FFr9.5m (Dollars 1.7m) in the first half of this year from FFr20.2m in the same period of 1992. The group, like other French retailers, has come under pressure because of the sluggish state of the economy. Consumer spending in France has been static for some time, reflecting the high rate of real interest rates and concern about rising unemployment. News of the decline in BHV's profits follows shortly after a gloomy announcement by Pinault-Printemps, another leading stores group, that its interim net profits fell to FFr189m from FFr330m. BHV's sales declined by 7.8 per cent to FFr1.89bn in the six months from FFr1.75bn at last year's interim stage. As a result,it remained in the red at the operational level with a loss of FFr21.2m, against FFr8m last year. The company attributed the fall in sales and its operational losses to the 'difficult economic environment'.</p>

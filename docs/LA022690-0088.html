			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIKER FALLS TO DEATH AS HUMAN CHAIN BREAKS  </P> <P> A hiker plummeted 125 feet to his death after losing his grip on a "human  chain" that was attempting to rescue him from a steep cliff in the Angeles  National Forest, authorities said Sunday.  </P> <P> Thomas Anthony Grijalva, 22, of Los Angeles was killed Saturday afternoon while  climbing up a cliff next to Switzer Falls in the San Gabriel Mountains, north  of La Canada Flintridge, Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators said.  </P> <P> Grijalva had already fallen once into a shallow pond at the foot of the cliff  and was trying to rejoin friends at the top of the falls when he fell a second  time, Sheriff's Sgt. Greg McHenry said.  </P> <P> Two witnesses said Grijalva fell at least 70 feet the first time, but was  apparently unhurt and started scaling the cliff.  </P> <P> "He said he was OK and he was going to come back up, and then we saw him  climbing . . . straight up," said Mark Grabfelder, 19, of Glendale, who was  with three friends in another hiking group.  </P> <P> When Grijalva became stuck near the top, he called for help.  </P> <P> "He was gripping the dirt. He said, 'Please help me,' " said John Lambert of  Glendale.  </P> <P> Grabfelder said he and another friend formed a human chain.  </P> <P> "We thought he might pull us over with him, but I sat down and gave him my leg  so he could pull himself up," Grabfelder said. "He grabbed my shoe, but then he  started to slip. I heard him scream and we watched him fall. . . . I was almost  too scared to climb across the rocks to go back to the car."  </P> <P> Grijalva was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities said the cliff is mostly  decomposed granite, which looks stable but gives way easily.  </P></p>

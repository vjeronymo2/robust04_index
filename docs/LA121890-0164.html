Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> DEBERG RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL  </P> <P> Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Steve DeBerg was released from the hospital  today, but said he did not know if he could play Sunday.  </P> <P> "It's throbbing right now," DeBerg said of the broken finger on his left hand  that he suffered Sunday. "Hopefully, the pain will lessen and I'll be able to  handle the pain part of it.  </P> <P> "I'm not exactly sure I can play this week. I think we're going to be able to  put something on it and protect it."  </P> <P> Officially, DeBerg was listed as questionable.

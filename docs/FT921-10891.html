			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Political initiative helps Nikkei to rise for the third day SHARE prices extended their gains to a third day yesterday. Buying by foreign investors and arbitrageurs lent general support to the Nikkei average in thin trading, and last Friday's political initiative for the equity market brought added interest in the afternoon, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei, which rose 2.1 per cent on Friday, added another 116.54 to close at 22,139.59. The 225-share average eased on arbitrage-related activity, hitting a low of 21,973.95 in the morning, but later rebounded to an intraday high of 22,340.92 in the afternoon. Volume fell to 200m shares from Friday's 330m, as activity remained dealer-led. Advances led declines by 604 to 356, with 158 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 1.68 to 1,632.62, although in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.6 to 1,251.07. The afternoon boost came from reports that the ministry of finance had accepted the leading Liberal Democratic Party's recommendations to consider a rescue package for the sluggish equity market. Last Friday, leaders of the LDP expressed their concern over the current stock market slump, and urged a review of dividend policies and the securities tax system. Price movements, however, were still dominated by futures-related activity, and the rally lost steam towards the end of the session after arbitrage-related selling. 'The underlying environment hasn't changed much,' said Mr Shiomichi Kawamoto at Nikko Research Institute. Foreign investors remained buyers. 'The foreigners were active buyers in January, and will remain so this month,' said Mr Brian Tobin at SG Warburg Securities. He added that the strength in the second section and over-the-counter market was an encouraging sign of real demand, rather than index-linked trading. Despite foreign support, average daily trading volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section fell to a 10-year low for January, at 217.4m shares. Bargain-hunting by foreigners lifted some high-technology issues. Sony advanced Y100 to Y4,340 and Pioneer Electronic gained Y110 to Y3,520. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y12,000 to Y713,000. Banking issues lost ground. Traders said that investors have been selling the sector due to concerns over the banks' exposure to real estate loans. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y10 to Y2,930 and Fuji Bank lost Y50 to Y2,250. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 75.88 to 23,714.35 in volume of 29.7m shares. After slumping on profit-taking in the morning, the index gained for the fifth consecutive day on buying in the drug and construction sectors. Ono Pharmaceutical gained Y280 to Y5,690. Roundup THE Pacific Rim was quiet ahead of today's Chinese New Year holiday. Singapore, Seoul, Taiwan and Kuala Lumpur were closed. HONG KONG saw active half-day trade, the Hang Seng index putting on 70.31 to 4,672.09 in turnover of HKDollars 1.64bn. Interest continued in the banking and property sectors, with bank results due out later in the month. Hong Kong Bank gained 75 cents to HKDollars 38.25, New World rose 40 cents to HKDollars 13.70 and Swire Pacific put on 70 cents to HKDollars 25.80. BANGKOK was quiet with turnover at Bt3.4bn down on the recent record highs: the SET index rose 3.74 to 767.19. The release of some 50 annual results had a mixed effect although banks gained: Bangkok Bank rose Bt14 to Bt554 and Thai Farmers Bank Bt12 to Bt422. AUSTRALIA ended lower despite economic news which was better than expectations. The release of December's current account deficit, the lowest in almost four years, and a rise in housing approvals pushed the market ahead before it fell. The All Ordinaries closed down 11.4 to 1,611.3 in turnover of ADollars 184.5m, down on last week. Coles Myer, the retailer, issued disappointing half-year sales figures and lost 40 cents to ADollars 11.70. The announcement by prime minister Mr Paul Keating that the economic statement would be on February 26 is likely to make the market cautious, analysts said. NEW ZEALAND showed little interest, with the NZSE-40 index up 4.02 to 1,459.07 in volume of NZDollars 19.8m. MANILA rose on investor confidence, buoyed by last week's sale of state-owned Philippine Airlines to a private group. The composite index closed 11.31 up at 1,267.28 in volume of 3.2bn (2.1bn). BOMBAY fell sharply after trading restrictions were announced. The BSE Index was off 29.73 from Friday's record close to 2,272.81.</p>

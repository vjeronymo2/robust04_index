			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gold Fields falls after production setbacks Gold Fields of South Africa reported a decline in after-tax profit to R392.3m (Dollars 106.6m) for the June quarter, from R441.1m in the previous quarter. The fall, which came in spite of a higher gold price received, was due largely to election-related work stoppages and public holidays which depressed production. Tons milled dropped to 3.19m from 3.31m in the March quarter, while gold production dipped to 29,721kg from 30,982kg. Working costs per kilogram rose to R25,265 from R23,410 and working profit declined to R543.3m from R582.2m, largely as a result of the lower throughput. Capital expenditure rose R70m to R203m. Mr Alan Munro, executive director, said that it had been an 'eventful quarter' and that the six public holidays had depressed production while increasing working costs because of extra overtime pay. Of the group's mines, Kloof performed best. In spite of a drop in ore milled, due to a 10-day work stoppage in May, it was able to take advantage of a higher yield and better gold price to maintain pre-tax profit at R194.5m, close to the previous quarter's R194.4m. Driefontein, the group's other big producer, was also affected by industrial action. However, a continuation of abnormally high yields at its East Driefontein division meant pre-tax profit dipped only slightly, to R396.8m from R405.8m in March. However, the group's two smaller mines had a harder time. Although it managed to increase tonnage, a lower yield meant Doornfontein reported a R12.6m loss on the quarter following a R4.5m profit previously, although this figure was distorted by a R6m payout following a court action by former employees. Deelkraal's after tax profit was up at R15.7m from R15.67m, but this was largely due to a R8m tax credit, and pre-tax profit was sharply down at R9.1m from R21.1m.</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Pound slips as sales fall hits hopes of recovery HOPES that consumers would help to lead the economy out of recession received a setback yesterday when it emerged that brisk Christmas activity failed to lift overall retail sales last month. The news sent the pound sharply lower against the D-Mark as investors weighed the possibility that the latest figures might encourage the government to cut interest rates. Sterling closed 2 pfennigs lower in London at DM2.4750, while in New York it finished at DM2.4760. Seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office showed a 0.7 per cent drop in the volume of shop sales in December compared with November, disappointing expectations for a small rise. A survey from the London Chamber of Commerce out today is likely to add to gloom about the economy with its message that there are no signs of recovery in the capital. The CSO figures showed that, although sales fell on the month, they were 1.2 per cent higher in December on a year-on-year basis. This followed only a marginal annual rise in November. The data underlined the disappointing results of a Confederation of British Industry survey published earlier this week which also showed a drop in the volume of December sales. But analysts warned against reading too much into a month's figures, particularly in December when seasonal adjustment is more open to error because of the effect of Christmas. In the three months to the end of December, sales rose by 0.3 per cent compared with the previous three months and were 1.3 per cent higher than in the fourth quarter of 1991. The month-on-month drop contradicted other evidence - including strong growth in the narrow money supply and higher car registrations - that spending increased at the end of 1992. A breakdown of the figures shows that food and mixed-retail sales held up relatively well. The sharpest fall was for 'other non-food' retailers, such as newsagents, off-licences, chemists, bookshops, florists and sports shops. Sales fell by 4 per cent in the latest quarter and were 7 per cent lower than a year ago. Clothing and footwear sales volumes were flat on the month and down 1 per cent on the quarter. Household goods sales fell slightly compared with November but rose by 1 per cent in the fourth quarter compared with the previous three months. Mr Hugh Clark, trading policy director of the British Retail Consortium, said the stronger sales of late December had continued into the new year, influenced by heavy price discounts. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said retail sales remained on an upward trend. 'We must not let one month's figures mask all the encouraging signs of activity in the economy,' he said.

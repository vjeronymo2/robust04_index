			<p>BFN     [Text] The Army General Staff has held a summit.  High-ranking Armed Forces officers from units and garrisons of  both Port-au- Prince and provincial towns gathered for a meeting  at Army General Headquarters on 24 May. The meeting lasted  several hours and focused on several current issues, said a  source close to the military leadership.    Approximately 30 unit commanders gathered around the Army  High Command to analyze the nation's overall situation. The  measures taken after this meeting are unknown. Nevertheless, it  should be recalled that the Haitian Army has been on maximum  alert since 20 May, a few hours before the total embargo ordered  by the United Nations against Haiti went into effect.</p>

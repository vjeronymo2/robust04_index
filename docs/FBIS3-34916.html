He went there at an  invitation from the community's leaders, who had decided -- at  his wish -- to stop the ongoing competition among themselves.  They all went to receive and welcome him. [passage omitted]    President al-Hirawi said that during all his meetings he  stressed Lebanon's future role and its people's ability to  occupy the forefront in the competition with Israel, which is  planning to invade the region. "I do not believe that we are  going to face any problem with Syria, contrary to what some  Lebanese allege. The statements I heard during one of my  meetings with President Hafiz al-Asad were frank. He said once  that Lebanon is in the forefront of the states capable of  competing with Israel. You have the qualities and conditions  that enable you to make it the Hong Kong of the Middle East."    Al-Hirawi adds: "We in Lebanon are not afraid of Syria,  which sincerely sees us as the lung through which it breathes.  It is helping us to maintain security. Our success in  uncovering the series of explosions that occurred in the north  and in east Sidon is attributable to Syrian security assistance.  Had it not been for it, we would not have been able to arrest  one of the network. Syria -- according to President al-Asad --  wants nothing from Lebanon. Let everyone be assured about that,  especially those constantly talking about fears and concerns.  All it wants is to protect its security rear and not to exploit  Lebanon or turn it into an arena harmful to its national  security. This is what we firmly believe. It has confidence in  Lebanon's future role in the region when peace is established.  And it sincerely believes that it cannot replace Lebanon, for  reasons attributable primarily to the system we have."    President al-Hirawi stresses that President al-Asad "talks  about Lebanon's future and praises its capabilities and the  services it can offer, not only to the Lebanese, but to all the  Arab states. He calls for safeguarding and protecting them."    The Lebanese president reiterates his position "not to allow  Lebanon to be turned into an arena for settling accounts." He  says that this position "is derived from the government's and  people's position. Southern Lebanon and west al-Biqa' can only  be recovered and liberated from the Israeli occupation on the  basis of the land-for-a-halt-to-resistance principle, since  resistance remains a legitimate right for the Lebanese as long  as the occupier is still on our territory. We did not go to the  peace talks except to achieve this Lebanese unanimity of  recovering every occupied inch."    On the fate of the negotiations, al-Hirawi says: "We attach  importance to the U.S.-Syrian summit between Presidents Bill  Clinton and Hafiz al-Asad. We went to Washington only after the  assurances vis-a-vis ending the occupation and implementing  international resolutions. We had hoped that the EC would exert  pressure on Israel, but it seems that France is currently busy  organizing its internal situations. This is what I sensed  during the talks I held with senior French officials who  attended the Ivorian president's funeral."    With regard to Pope John Paul II's upcoming to Lebanon,  President al-Hirawi stresses that "it is welcomed, and we expect  good from it." He revealed that Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac  visited the Vatican recently and urged that it take place.    Concluding, he stressed the "need to vigorously safeguard  security and confront anyone who tries to return the situation  to what it was." He emphasized that his call to the central  security council to convene under him in B'abda recently "was  designed to intercept anyone planning to tamper with security,  especially after the assassination of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib  al-Ma'ayitah, and to stress the need to pursue and punish the  perpetrators."

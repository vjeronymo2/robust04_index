			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / People: Millionaire moves on from Fine Decor to find more fun Mark Bates, 35, is a finance director in a hurry. Only a year after he helped Fine Decor, the fast-growing wall coverings group, get its shares listed on the stock market, he wants a bigger challenge. Bates, who had worked as a management consultant, joined Fine Decor in 1990 following a management buy-out. 'I started with 40 bin bags cleaning out the contents of the old chief accountant's office,' says Bates, who took no holiday in his first year with the company and worked every weekend. Since then, Fine Decor has been transformed from a fragile MBO to a successful company with its shares listed on the stock exchange, and although Bates has been well rewarded - he's a millionaire - he feels that the job of being finance director is no longer such fun. He leaves the company in August so that he can devote himself to 'looking for a major challenge to stretch me to the maximum'. Harry Morgan, Fine Decor's chief executive, describes Bates' decision to quit as a 'meeting of minds'. Bates was not a 'wallpaper man' and was somewhat younger than the rest of the executive team. David Timmins, 41, finance director of Northamber, the loss-making supplier of computer hardware and software, takes over from Bates. Nearly half of Fine Decor's sales are overseas and Timmins has been hired partly for his overseas experience. Before Northamber, he worked for Micropolis Corp and Matchbox Toys in the US and Germany.</p>

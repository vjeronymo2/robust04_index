Pawlak said he would like to translate the language of  treaties and accords into practical actions. He said he meant  primarily long-term agreements on strategic raw materials and  steps to build a gas pipeline from Russia to Western Europe, a  railway line and a highway linking Berlin, Warsaw and Moscow.</p>

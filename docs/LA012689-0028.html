			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BUSINESSMAN GUILTY OF ASSAULT  </P> <P> An Inglewood businessman, who sat on a city commission and the mayor's  anti-crime task force, pleaded guilty Wednesday to assault with a deadly weapon  for firing a shot last spring at an Inglewood policeman.  </P> <P> Francisco Avina, 40, will return to Torrance Superior Court on Feb. 21 for  sentencing.  </P> <P> Before the guilty plea, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki dismissed an attempted-murder  charge stemming from the same incident. Fujisaki said there was not enough  evidence to try Avina on that charge.  </P> <P> Inglewood police said the assault occurred last April when they went to a coin  laundry on South Prairie Avenue after a report of a disturbance. Patrolmen said  they heard loud noises inside the laundry and thought they had cornered a  burglar. Only later did they learn that the man crouching behind a row of  dryers was Avina, the owner of the laundry.  </P> <P> Avina ignored orders to surrender and fired a shot that narrowly missed an  officer, police said.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron L. Smalstig said that he will seek a four-year sentence  in state prison for Avina but that Avina has no criminal record and might be  sentenced to probation.  </P> <P> At the time of the incident, Avina was a member of Inglewood's Parking and  Traffic Commission and Mayor Edward Vincent's anti-crime task force.  Investigators said drinking and marital problems may have led Avina to the  confrontation.  </P></p>

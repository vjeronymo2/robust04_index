			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MCGUIRE SHUTS DOWN BIRMINGHAM IN STYLE, 6-0  </P> <P> Players dragged the field happily, rock music blared over the loudspeakers and  general merriment reigned at El Camino Real High on a bright, breezy Wednesday  afternoon. And why not? The host Conquistadores were celebrating a 6-0  whitewash of Birmingham in the City Section 4-A Division baseball  quarterfinals.  </P> <P> But any backslapping for catcher Bobby Kim, whose two-run home run in the first  inning provided the only necessary offense, had better be just that:  backslapping.  </P> <P> Don't slap his hand until Friday at least, when El Camino Real (20-2-1) will  meet San Fernando, a 7-3 winner over Kennedy, in the semifinals. Don't bruise  the tender paw that was on the receiving end of smoke-throwing left-hander Ryan  McGuire's seventh inning of terror.  </P> <P> "I thought he was going to break my hand," Kim said, only half-jokingly.  </P> <P> Three outs from closing his three-hit shutout, McGuire (7-1) accelerated  Birmingham's demise. He fanned Mike Malkin on three pitches, sat down Ruben  Flores on four, and, with two hard strikes on Mike Belasco, induced an  opposite-field bloop to end his performance with authority.  </P> <P> All heat-seeking missiles.  </P> <P> The display delighted the 400 in attendance and fairly burned Birmingham  (19-7-1), which didn't quite know what had hit it.  </P> <P> "We were trying to hit his fastballs," said Birmingham Coach Wayne Sink, who  coached his last game after 26 years at the school. "But he just literally blew  it by us. . . . He's the hardest thrower we've seen all year."  </P> <P> Kim concurred.  </P> <P> "Those were the fastest balls I've caught all year," Kim said. "I was giving  him the breaking ball and he was shaking me off. He was just pumping gas."  </P> <P> That McGuire, who finished his third shutout with six strikeouts, would even  start was in question up until Tuesday. It seems El Camino Real Coach Mike Maio  was leaning toward 6-foot-4 Pat Treend, he of the 11-0 record. But according to  McGuire, he and Treend ganged up on the coach.  </P> <P> "Coach wanted to pitch Pat," McGuire said. "But we had a discussion. He had all  his stats and numbers out. He's got more numbers and stats than the Elias  Baseball Bureau. He knows stuff about me that I don't know about me. He's like  Rain Man.  </P> <P> "But Pat and myself, we tend to go on how we feel."  </P> <P> McGuire had room to breathe after Kim's 380-foot-plus blast to straightaway  center field off left-hander Jason Mansfield (5-5). El Camino Real pushed  across a run in the second on Jeff Marks' fielder's choice with the bases full  and added two more in the fourth on Marks' two-run single. A sacrifice fly by  Josh Massey in the fifth closed out the scoring.  </P> <P> In lobbying for McGuire, wasn't Treend forfeiting center stage?  </P> <P> "Oh, no," McGuire said with a grin. "He gets the glory. He gets to pitch on  Friday."  </P></p>

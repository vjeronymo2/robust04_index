			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Esa Haermaelae, chairman of the Central Union of  Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners, MTK, thinks that the  domestic EU [European Union] subsidy for agriculture is too  small. In the subsidy package agreed by the government the  subsidy is about 5.5-6 billion Finnish markkas [FM]. According  to Haermaelae, the sum is much the same as that proposed by the  working group of officials, which the MTK calculated was FM700  too little per hectare. The MTK chairman points out that the  subsidy of FM15 billion to be paid out in the first year of  membership should not be seen in its entirety as an agricultural  subsidy, because other food producers benefit from it too.    The government agreed on domestic subsidies for farmers and  the foodstuffs industry during negotiations that lasted  throughout the night. If Finland becomes a member of the EU,  the subsidy to be paid in the first year of membership will  total FM15 billion, which is FM4 billion more than now. In five  years' time, the domestic subsidy to be paid out would be about  FM6 billion a year. The increase in the agricultural subsidy  will be compensated to the taxpayers in such a way that a  smaller value-added tax on food than planned will be payable;  initially 17 percent and in three years' time 12 percent.

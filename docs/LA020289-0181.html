			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Knight-Ridder's fourth-quarter net income fell 8% from a year ago to $45.6  million. Revenue from continuing operations totaled $574.6 million, a gain of  9%. For the year, net income totaled $156.3 million, up from $155.1 million in  1987, while revenue from continuing operations rose to $2.08 billion from $1.96  billion. Net income figures include income from broadcast operations, which  Knight-Ridder announced in October that it would sell. The Miami-based media  company said that while its newspapers had excellent growth in classified  linage and revenue, they were hit by industrywide downward pressure on retail  and general ad linage and higher costs for newsprint.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Panorama" program] </F>   [Text] [Announcer Yelena Berezovskaya] As we have already  reported, elections are being held in Kazakhstan today for the  Republic's Supreme Soviet and local councils. Viktor  Glukhovtsev, our Almaty correspondent, is now on the line to the  Mayak studio. Over to you, Viktor Ivanovich:    [Glukhovtsev] Hello.    [Berezovskaya] We can hear you.    [Glukhovtsev] First and foremost, Yelena, let me greet you  and all of our courageous women on the holiday; but here is what  I have to tell you about the election. This is the first time  in its history that Kazakhstan has held democratic elections in  which every citizen has had the right to stand for the country's  parliament. Many have made full use of this right. Public  associations, for instance, registered 330 candidates for the  Supreme Soviet election, but there are actually 30 more nominees  than that. Those are the fruits of democracy for you.    Here's another point that needs to be noted. This is also  the first time that foreign observers are monitoring the poll.  Twenty-four states in Europe, the United States, and Asia have  sent representatives to Kazakhstan, and they are scrupulously  recording the slightest infraction of the election rules. There  have not been many of these infractions, but there have been  some, unfortunately.    The election code stipulates that premises where ballot  papers are kept should be sealed and guarded by the militia.  Checks have shown, however, that this rule has not been  followed in some places. In some cases, packets of ballot papers  were found to have been opened, the seals broken. The same code  stipulates that each voter should vote in person and should turn  up with the document proving his right to vote, but this  stipulation has been ignored rather often in the scramble to  ensure that the official turnout is as big as possible. Such  violations of the electoral code are no credit to members of  constituency and polling station commissions. They cast doubt  on the legality of the final results.    Let me tell you a bit about the actual voting. According to  preliminary figures, over 9.5 million people were eligible to  vote. Voting began at 0700 this morning. By 1100 the figures  were as follows. Some 1,275,000 people had turned up at polling  stations to vote. This is 14 percent of the total. This is, of  course, not much compared with previous years. In the  republican capital, for example, only 11 percent had voted by  then. In Turgay, West Kazakhstan, and Aktyubinsk oblasts it was  even less.    [Berezovskaya] Viktor Ivanovich...    [Glukhovtsev, interrupting] Yes, yes.    [Berezovskaya] The latest figures may even have reached  Moscow sooner than they reached you. At the moment -- or rather  about two hours ago -- a third of the voters had already turned  out in the Republic as a whole, it is reported.    [Glukhovtsev] Well, the Central Electoral Commission told  me that in the Republic as a whole 58 percent of eligible voters  had already cast their votes by 1600. So I have fresher  information, so to speak. Those are the figures.    Well, that's all I have to tell you at the moment. This is  Viktor Glukhovtsev with a special report for the Mayak  "Panorama."</p>

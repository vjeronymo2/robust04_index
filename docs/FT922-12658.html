			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Alexander Russell optimistic of growth Alexander Russell, the quarrying, concrete and coal group, recorded a 9 per cent drop in pre-tax profit for 1991. This is the second year of downturn but 'we believe that growth has now resumed and will carry on strongly for many years to come', said Mr Russell Nicholson, chairman. Sales slipped to Pounds 37.7m (Pounds 38.8m) and profit fell to Pounds 1.66m (Pounds 1.83m) on a restated basis. Expenditure on rationalisation and closure of business in 1990 has been charged as exceptional, rather than extraordinary. Mr Nicholson said the reduction in quarrying turnover was limited to 6 per cent and profits to 14 per cent. In concrete, profits were up 5 per cent mainly because of an excellent performance of the roof tile business. The opening of the Burton-on-Trent plant increased tile sales substantially. Profits from the coal division were much improved. Rationalisation was nearing completion and had reached a level where steady profits were expected. Earnings per share were 2.59p (3.51p) basic and 3.32p (3.77p) fully diluted. The final dividend is 1.15p for an unchanged total of 2.15p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] New York -- Luis Inacio Lula da Silva yesterday  denied here reports that the Workers Party [PT] is seeking to  foment chaos through a wave of strikes with a view to  jeopardizing the government's economic plan and, consequently,  undermining the candidacy of Brazilian Social Democracy Party  [PSDB] candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Lula denied having  masterminded a maneuver to unleash election-oriented strikes.  He said that these strikes are just "a reflection of the  government's incompetence."    Lula said: "Instead of taking the appropriate measures the  government, out of sheer lack of competence, is trying to blame  us for something over which we have absolutely no  responsibility. It is absurd to charge the PT with fomenting  these strikes. The de facto regime used to make this type of  charge."    In Lula's opinion, the strikes are being motivated by salary  demands alone. He said: "The strikes are a result of this  faltering economic program. The problem is clearly economic; it  is devoid of any ideological content."    During a meeting he held on 11 May with Sterie Beza,  director  of the IMF Western Hemisphere Department, at the Inter-American  Development Bank (IDB) in Washington, Lula promised some sort of  future agreement should he be elected president. After hearing  Lula explain his economic program and asking for more details  about his stabilization and revenue policy, Beza, who supervises  all the IMF negotiations with the Brazilian Government, said:  "If this is the case, it will be great. Remember, however,  that if you win the elections I will expect you to keep your  promises."    Lula said: "Perfect. Just remember that I will remind the  IMF about the evaluation you have just made of our plan."</p>

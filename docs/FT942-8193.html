			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: US fears unsettle Lucas Engineering group Lucas Industries tumbled 15 to 175p, on fears that it may be forced to make provisions following a US press report alleging that Lucas equipment was to blame for 167 emergency naval jet landings in the last 18 months. However, a company statement just before the market close said the reports from the US were a 'misrepresentation' of the facts. Heavy trading in the stock brought turnover of 11m as researchers talked of provisions to cover a fine and the cost of correcting the equipment defects, if investigators find against Lucas. There was also talk that other work done for the US Government may also be in jeopardy. Total turnover from work carried out for the various parts of the US Government amounts to around Dollars 180m a year. The US press report said the Pentagon has proposed barring Lucas from future contracts after investigator's claims that its substandard aircraft parts posed a hazard to pilots. One analyst said: 'I think the shares will remain under a cloud until this issue is resolved or we know what the actual implications are. This may be a legacy of the old management. But it is also important to point out the strength of the balance sheet. '</p>

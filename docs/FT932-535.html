			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (8): French shake-out under way - 'This could be the industry's worst year of the decade' ON the surface, the French automotive components industry had a reasonable year in 1992, although there have also been some suggestions that the sector was heading for difficulties in view of such factors as the 'franc fort' pegged to the strength of the Deutschemark within the ERM; a shake-out of the number of suppliers to both Renault and the PSA group; and the downward pressure on the prices of bought-in components exerted by France's vehicle manufacturers. The most worrying factor for 1993, however, has been the steep downturn in vehicle output which has characterised the first few months. Staring at the abyss by late 1992, the components industry has seen production in France of passenger cars fall by 13.6 per cent in the four months to the end of April, as compared with the performance of the comparable period of 1992. In the commercial vehicle sector, production has performed worse still, with output falling 30 per cent. A succint statement from the Federation des Industries des Equipements pour Vehicules (FIEV - the Automotive Equipment Industry Association) says it all: '1993 has started very badly, and all the signs are that the year could turn out to be the most difficult of the decade.' According to FIEV, sales in 1992 by French automotive equipment manufacturers increased by a provisionally-estimated 5.6 per cent to the all-time record level of FFr78.8bn. Within this total, original equipment (OE) sales to French vehicle manufacturers accounted for a little more than half - with OE sales increasing by a provisionally-estimated 3.4 per cent. This was, however, below the 4.2 per cent increase in the number of vehicles manufactured in France last year, which was the first time this phenomenon has occurred - to the chagrin of the French components industry, this relative decline was made all the worse in view of the accepted trend of growth in the value of sales per vehicle manufactured in France. Price pressures from Peugeot, Citroen and Renault on their components suppliers was responsible, with French vehicle manufacturers under increasing pressure to reduce their costs. Renault suffered a pre-tax loss of FFr961m in the fourth quarter of 1992 owing in part to a FFr600m loss in franc revenue as a result of the strength of the franc against the lire and sterling. For 1993, Renault expects a further currency-induced reduction of FFr3bn in taxable income. First quarter 1993 income at Renault was only one-tenth that of the comparable period of 1992. PSA Peugeot-Citroen saw a 39 per cent decline in profits during 1992. As the auto equipment association says, 'since 1991 our auto-makers have increased their pressure on (components) prices, and the favourable trend from which we previously benefited has been destroyed by the reductions which we have been obliged to grant them.' Not all has been, or is, gloom for the French components manufacturers, however. During 1992, 'aftermarket' sales within France rose by 3.5 per cent after having effectively stagnated in 1991. This reflects the positive effect on parts sales of the introduction of mandatory vehicle-testing procedures. In addition, sales by French components producers to other (generally 'first-tier') suppliers rose during 1992 by 37.2 per cent to FFr1,100m in what looks like becoming, as a result of structural changes in the pattern of supply, a substantial area of business in the 1990s. Direct exports of components from France increased by 9.1 per cent in 1992 to a provisionally-estimated FFr26.6bn, although it is difficult not to wonder for how long such a performance is possible if the franc continues to remain one of Europe's stronger currencies (and especially in view of the German vehicle manufacturers' desire to reduce costs sharply and speedily). Even though relative costs within the French components industry are generally lower than those in Germany, they have become still lower in certain other countries since the ERM upsets of the autumn of 1992 (and most especially so in the UK). The Michelin group is by far the largest components manufacturer in France, as well as being the world's leading tyre maker, and it has been affected by the 'franc fort.' During 1992 global sales were steady in volume terms, but turnover fell by 1.2 per cent to FFr66.8bn as a result of the strengthening franc against the dollar, lire and sterling. In the second half of last year, adverse exchange rates were a big factor behind the group's move back into loss - another was a contraction in the tyre market. In the first quarter of 1993 the group saw volume sales of its tyres fall by an alarming 14 per cent. This has led the company to introduce an emergency rationalisation programme which has included short-time working in France and the announcement of a reduction of 2,950 in Michelin's French workforce to 1995 - which has come after 16,000 job losses worldwide over 1991-92. France's largest non-tyre components group, Valeo, was able to look back on 1992 with some satisfaction, although the company's chairman, Noel Goutard, has recently sounded a note of caution for 1993. In 1992 group sales increased by 4 per cent to FFr20.6bn, of which 56 per cent derived from outside France. Adverse exchange rate fluctuations, however, pared an estimated 2 per cent off turnover, which would otherwise have grown by 6 per cent. Group net profit in 1992 rose by 26 per cent to FFr753m. For 1993, as a result of the condition of the European motor industry, Mr Goutard has said that 'our customers are becoming more and more demanding. Valeo intends responding to these new challenges through cost-cutting, quality and innovation.' This is including a reduction in the number and/or size of Valeo's European industrial facilities during 1993. Over the first four months of this year, Valeo's consolidated sales fell 5.1 per cent as compared with the comparable period of 1992. The second-largest non-tyre components group in France is Epeda-Bertrand Faure - which is also the world's leading vehicle seating manufacturer  - which achieved a 15 per cent growth in 1992 automotive sales to FFr9.1bn (78 per cent of group total). Profitability of the group was affected in 1992 by such factors as exchange rate losses arising from the effects of the September currency devaluations. During the first four months of 1993 group auto sales were 9 per cent lower than in the comparable period of 1992. For the medium-term however, EBF has - in common with most of France's larger automotive groups - already moved to minimise geographical market and currency risks by establishing or acquiring a number of facilities in several vehicle manufacturing countries of the world. Domestic sales for French auto components in 1991 and 1992 were FFr50,214m and FFr52,200m respectively. Direct exports: FFr24,377m in 1991 and FFr26,600m in 1992. Total sales: FFr74,591m in 1991 and FFr78,800m in 1992. For a list of larger European component suppliers with auto-related sales of at least Dollars 1bn, see page three.</p>

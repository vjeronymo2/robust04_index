			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAZDA TO SELL FORD-BUILT EXPLORERS IN BID TO ENTER FUN-TRUCK MARKET  </P> <P> In a bid to capture a piece of the growing market for so-called fun trucks,  Mazda Motor of America said Thursday that it will begin selling its version of  Ford Motor Co.'s new Explorer sport-utility vehicle this fall.  </P> <P> Mazda's announcement marked the first time a Japanese auto maker will buy an  American manufacturer's vehicles and then sell them under its name in the  United States.  </P> <P> Generally, U.S. car makers buy Japanese- or Korean-built cars for sale under  their names.  </P> <P> The deal underscored the global melding by auto makers as they forge  partnerships to cut costs and remain competitive into the 1990s.  </P> <P> It also marked another association between Ford and Mazda Motor Corp. The two  have been financial partners since 1979 when Ford bought 25% of Mazda. The two  recently began collaboration on new vehicles. Mazda produces the chassis shared  by the Mazda MX-6 and the Ford Probe and builds the Probe for Ford at its plant  in Flat Rock, Mich.  </P> <P> Ford's all-new Escort and Tracer subcompact cars, which will debut later this  year, are heavily based on Mazda subcompacts already on sale.  </P> <P> The new Mazda sports utility vehicle, to be called the Navajo, was shown  Thursday at a preview for the Chicago Auto Show that starts a nine-day run  Saturday.  </P> <P> The truck essentially is the same vehicle as the Ford Explorer that will go on  sale this spring as a 1991 model to replace the Ford Bronco II.  </P> <P> Fred Aikins, a spokesman for Mazda Motor of America, the auto maker's  Irvine-based U.S. marketing and distribution company, said the Navajo's front  end and interior will be different from the Explorer's, however.  </P> <P> Aikins said the Navajo will sell in the $13,000-$18,000 price range -- about  the same as Mazda's wildly successful two-seat convertible, the Miata.  </P> <P> He said the company expects Navajo sales to hit only 15,000 to 18,000 units a  year.  </P> <P> Mazda decided to use a Ford-designed and built sports utility vehicle rather  than developing its own, Aikins said, "because developing any kind of vehicle  was quite expensive and Ford had a vehicle that was ready. We've been looking  into a sport utility truck design for several years now."  </P> <P> Auto industry analysts say that the fun-truck market for Jeep-like sports  utility trucks and for small pickup trucks is about the only one that is doing  well in the current depressed auto market.  </P> <P> The vehicles often are priced less than comparably equipped sedans and have a  definite identity in a market that increasingly is offering consumers  look-alike vehicles, said Jim Hillson, senior analyst with Phase One, an  advertising research firm in Los Angeles that specializes in automobile  marketing.  </P> <P> Mazda is in particular need of a new truck model because its truck sales have  been falling since 1986.  </P> <P> One potential problem Mazda faces with the Navajo, several analysts said, is  that it will market only a two-door version, while the Ford Explorer will come  in both two-door and four-door models.  </P> <P> Two other Japanese auto makers, both headquartered in Orange County, already  sell two-door sports-utility vehicles in the United States.  </P> <P> Daihatsu America, headquartered in Los Alamitos, markets the Rocky, while  American Suzuki Motor Corp. of Brea sells the Samurai and Sidekick models.  </P> <P> The market for four-door sports utility vehicles is generally considered to be  the healthiest.  </P> <P> Ford and General Motors are introducing four-door trucks to compete with  Chrysler Corp.'s Jeep Cherokee and with import models like the Toyota 4Runner.  </P> <P> But selling the Navajo allows Mazda to sidestep the 25% import tariff imposed  on two-door trucks while putting the auto maker into a new market segment.  </P> <P> "We need to be a full-line marketer," said Yoshi Taura, president of Mazda  Motor of America.  </P></p>

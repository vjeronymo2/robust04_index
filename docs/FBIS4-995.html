			<p>BFN     [Text] Swaziland's Defense Force says it knows nothing  about members of the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front]  apparently being trained in the north of the territory. This  follows allegations by a Swazi chief that Volksfront members  were receiving training in the area. The deputy commissioner of  the Swazi police, Mr. Esau Dube, said that an investigation in  this regard had proved fruitless.</p>

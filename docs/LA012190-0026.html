			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PET STORES  </P> <P> We recently put our family cocker spaniel out of his misery -- the poor dog had  developed cataracts and chronic ear infections. Hardly a normal condition for a  dog 6 years old; the vet credits congenital defects due to inbreeding of the  most popular breed in the United States.  </P> <P> He probably could have been nursed along for another few years on systemic  antibiotics, but there was no guarantee that the quality of his life would have  improved, nor did it seem quite right to spend so much money, given the far  greater needs we have as a society.  </P> <P> Next time we get a dog, we'll go to a private breeder, or better yet, adopt  from the pound. These animals so badly need a home, and "mutts" are often  easier to get along with than highly wired pure breeds. We've learned our  lesson, which basically boils down to responsibility on the part of pet  breeders and owners. Too bad people don't take a course in pet care so they  appreciate the full magnitude of the responsibilities and costs before buying  that adorable little thing in the window.  </P> <P> SHELLEY OJEDA, Downey  </P></p>

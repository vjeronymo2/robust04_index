			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by P. Shcherbakov: "The Debt is Being Repaid, But </F> Clearly in Devalued Form; 2.3 Trillion Rubles Allocated to the  Agricultural Sector by the Government -- A Late Payment For  Products Delivered Last Year"]    [Text] Last week on 3 February at a closed session the  Government of the Russian Federation examined the draft  resolution, "Economic Conditions for the Operation of the  Agroindustrial Complex in 1994," at a closed session. According  to this draft, it is planned to allocate 14 trillion rubles from  the budget to support agriculture. The resolution as a whole was  approved, but under the condition that finishing touches be put  on it and that certain figures and details be made more precise.  Judging by everything, the figures, which are nothing but  financial resources being directed into the APK [Agroindustrial  complex], will be correction in the direction of a decrease.    This decision reminded me of a recent reaction by some mass  media to a regional meeting in Orel, where a program for the  development of the regions in Central Russia was being  discussed. At that time, specific steps taken by the government  to effect the economic, social and spiritual rebirth of the  age-old Russian central regions were termed "political  demonstrations," "attempts to win authority by means of handing  out financial benefits to territories and the agricultural  sector" by some newspapers.    At that time, A. Zaveryukha, deputy prime minister of the RF  Government, held a press conference for Russian and foreign  journalists. He was forced to clarify, patiently and on a  popular level, the absurdities of the newspapers'  disinformation, as for example that concerning 2.3 trillion  rubles that were soon to be directed into the agrarian sector.  What money is this? However, government and non-government  consumers do owe a debt for products, including grain, acquired  from village goods producers. Moreover, this debt was incurred  in August to September, and it can be termed preferential with  complete justification. Add to it how much the ruble has been  devalued during the last 4-5 months. Is the suggestion being  made that we should not repay our debt to the peasant because we  must stabilize the budget?    A similar situation is developing with regard to the delay  in  signing the government document that is important for the entire  agricultural sector. Sowing operations are right around the  corner. How will kolkhozes, sovkhozes, farmers, joint-stock  societies, partnerships and cooperatives implement sowing  operations if all they have in their accounts is the debts owed  to them by the government and not a single penny cash? As we  know, oil producers, machine builders and chemical workers do  not sell their products for credit. Moreover, they demand a 100  percent prepayment.    We have untuned machinery standing idle in enterprises, and  mineral fertilizer storehouses remain empty although the  enterprises that sell these products stop production due to  overstocking. According to data from the agrochemical service,  in many regions of the country enterprises have acquired only  2-3 kilograms of mineral fertilizer of the amount needed per  hectare of plowland. This situation is threatening not only in  terms of a considerable underproduction from fields and farms  this year, but also, and this is especially important, in terms  of a catastrophic fall in land fertility. As we know, fertility  cannot be restored in just 1-2 years. And the expenditures that  will be required will not be comparable to today's so-called  preferential credit.    An especially alarming situation has developed in supplying  enterprises, regardless of form of ownership, with fuel and  lubricating materials and seed. This spring there will be a  significantly larger demand for these than last year. Last fall  because of the complicated weather conditions and again because  of the absence of money it was not possible to plow up late fall  fields or sow winter crops on many millions of hectares.    Judging by everything, in government not everyone is  concerned with current conditions within the country's  agroindustrial complex, especially since the course that has  been set involves self-sufficiency in food products. Here we  cannot do simply with declarations and assurances about devotion  to reforms. Specific actions are needed, particularly in  protecting domestic production.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Indirect taxation TUESDAY'S BUDGET showed that the government remains committed to two central elements of Mrs Thatcher's fiscal reforms. One is the aim of reducing the basic rate of income tax from 25 to 20 per cent by extending the 20 per cent band. The other is to continue shifting personal taxation from direct to indirect taxes, principally Value Added Tax. The storm over the extension of VAT to domestic fuel could, however, impede this, unless the government adequately recognises that low income households need additional help during such a transfer. Even in this most difficult of budgets, the chancellor has advanced the Conservative election manifesto aim of extending the width of the 20 per cent lower rate band. It will increase by Pounds 500 this year to Pounds 2,500, and by a further Pounds 500 next year. At this rate, it will be well into the next century before the 25 per cent rate entirely disappears. But the government is clearly determined to advance its manifesto aim year on year. The cost of these small extensions in the lower rate band is high - almost Pounds 1bn for the full Pounds 1,000 promised. This is more than covered by the restriction to 20 per cent of the reliefs on mortgage interest, the married couple's allowance and company dividends. However, the complete elimination of the 25 per cent band would require much larger sums. Some of the money might be found from further cuts in public expenditure. But the government's best bet would be a further shift to indirect taxation by widening the base for VAT. The imposition of VAT on domestic fuel will raise Pounds 2.3bn when fully implemented. Another Pounds 5bn could be raised by introducing VAT at 8 per cent on goods and services currently zero-rated, other than new building. There is justification for shifting from direct taxes to indirect taxes, which are easier to collect and harder to avoid. Such a shift may improve incentives, and can help reduce the poverty trap. And the difference between standard-rated items and those which are zero-rated is arguably so wide as to distort choices. However, any move to tax zero-rated goods reduces the progressivity of the VAT system. Low-income households spend a higher proportion of their resources on zero-rated goods such as food, public transport fares and domestic fuel. Those which depend on social security benefits will not benefit from tax cuts, unlike the better-off. For a switch to indirect taxation to be politically acceptable, steps must be taken to ensure that such households are not left worse off than before. Uprating benefits in line with the retail price index is insufficient, since the RPI does not reflect the importance of zero-rated items to low-income household budgets. Each time the VAT net is widened in this way, a once-for-all additional increase is needed to social security benefits that reflects the extra costs imposed on those who depend upon them.</p>

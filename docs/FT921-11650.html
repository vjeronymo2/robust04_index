			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Accountancy Column: Tangible difficulties of measuring intangibles CHRISTMAS may be gone, but the season of 'goodwill' is only just beginning. The members of the Accounting Standards Board, who today start to address the questions of intangibles and goodwill, could come in for a roasting as the debate progresses. Goodwill is defined as the difference between the net assets of a company and the price paid by its purchaser. Intangible assets, which may make up a large part of any goodwill on acquisition, are those non-physical elements of a business like brands and licences which can generate future earnings. There is nothing new about goodwill. As long ago as 1934, a court appeal made the distinction between 'cat' goodwill, which is loyal to the business and stays if it is sold, and 'dog' goodwill, which is loyal to the owners, goes with them and hence is lost to the business. Nor is the presence and continued value of intangible assets like brands a recent phenomenon. Croft and Gilbey, the alcoholic drink brand names, were registered as trademarks in 1876, for example, while Cerebos salt dates from 1894 and Hovis bread from 1895. But the debate came to the fore in the late 1980s, with the activities of a number of food groups. In early 1988 Nestle made a bid for Rowntree worth more than twice the company's market capitalisation at the time. Later that year both Grand Metropolitan and Ranks Hovis McDougall started capitalising brands that they owned or had acquired. Any attempt to cut down on the use of intangibles is likely to result in fierce opposition from businesses such as these, and from a growing army of accountants and other professional valuers. As a result, there is no doubt that the treatment of non-physical assets is one of the most controversial items currently on the ASB's agenda. The existing uncertainty is also causing difficulties to those involved in preparing company accounts. For the year to August 31 1991, the balance sheet of Blenheim Exhibitions, the exhibitions organiser, shows net liabilities over assets of Pounds 81.3m. However, the goodwill reserve contains Pounds 296.8m, much of it representing exhibition rights that have been acquired. The directors make a point of saying that they will not include these intangibles in the balance sheet while the ASB is developing its proposals. As the role of service industries with a large number of intangible assets continues to rise, the issues can only become more important for a larger number of companies and the users of their accounts. Mr David Nash, finance director of Grand Metropolitan, argues that the common practice in the UK of ignoring intangibles by writing off goodwill immediately on acquisition distorts the impression of gearing, return on capital employed and the value of the business making the purchase. 'The balance sheet presupposes that the intangible assets are worthless,' he says. 'In the majority of cases this does not reflect the underlying economic reality of the situation.' At the same time, pressure is mounting from other parties. Arthur Andersen produced a report* on Tuesday that addresses the valuation of intangible items. It suggests that a consensus is emerging on how to value them using rigorous methodologies. A paper++ is also circulating from Mr David Damant, chairman of MAP Securities, a stockbroking and corporate finance house. He argues that assets need to be valued at cost, not on the basis of future earnings generated by the assets. Otherwise, the logic is circular, since the valuer has to use a valuation of the assets in order to estimate these future earnings. Purchased goodwill, he adds, is simply a consolidation difference and not an asset in its own right. Meanwhile, not to be outdone, the ASB has commissioned a team of five academics led by John Arnold, professor of accounting at Manchester university, to consider the issue on its own behalf. The board has already started some tentative work with a pronouncement from its Urgent Issues Task Force in late December, which specified how goodwill from acquisitions that had been consolidated should then be written off on disposal. Under the ruling, the goodwill element must be passed through the profit and loss account, and not quietly dissolved through a movement in reserves. But the greatest efforts are yet to come. The task force has merely offered an interim statement to one pressing case. The ASB must now look at the issue of drafting and consulting on accounting standards to cover the topic both comprehensively and democratically. 'It's quite handy that all these things are coming at once,' says Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, diplomatically. 'We are all trying to work at this problem.' He suggests that the growing importance of service industries, and hence the intangible items that go with them, means the issue is going to become more important, and something the ASB can no longer wait to tackle. He says that the ASB is likely to draft statements of principles by Easter on both the definition of assets and liabilities in the accounts, and on their recognition. A further statement considering valuation of assets is likely to follow later in the year. A report on accounting for brands prepared by the London Business School in 1989 argued strongly that they should not be included on the balance sheet, or they could contribute to a 'potentially corrosive' effect on the whole basis of financial reporting. It says that their inclusion represents a controversial shift in what the balance sheet shows, from costs to values. It also highlights a series of problems with the valuation of intangibles: the methods used are inconsistent, subjective, and often theoretically questionable; the results are difficult to audit; and little information on how valuations are conducted is disclosed, which makes their assessment for a user of accounts impossible. This week's Andersen report argues that many of these objections have been overcome. Mr Hugh Collum, chairman of the 100 Group of finance directors of leading British companies, which supported the research, is keen to stress that the findings are only a preliminary step in the debate. Nevertheless, it hardly helps that the new study makes little effort to back up its suggestion of growing consensus with any figures. Nor that many of the organisations interviewed - and the sponsors of the report  - already rely heavily on brand valuations. Andrew Likierman from the London Business School, one of the authors of the 1989 report, remains unconvinced. 'This is an interesting contribution to the debate,' he says. 'I'm glad they have set out the issues, but it still leaves many of the basic questions unanswered.' *Arthur Andersen. The valuation of intangible assets.

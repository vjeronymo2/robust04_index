			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / White House rejects Congress role on Haiti The Clinton administration is determined to resist growing demands that any invasion of Haiti be made contingent on the prior approval of Congress. Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, said in an interview yesterday that Congress would certainly be 'consulted' but that it was vital that the president's 'constitutional authority be preserved.' He noted that neither Presidents Reagan or Bush had sought congressional backing before ordering US troops into Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1989, operations which he compared in scale with any intervention in Haiti. Over the weekend, Mr Ross Perot, the 1992 independent presidential candidate, lent his voice to Republican criticisms that any invasion would be principally designed to boost President Bill Clinton's sagging domestic popularity before the mid-term congressional elections in November. In a personal attack exceptional by even his own standards, Mr Perot said that because Mr Clinton had avoided service in Vietnam he was obliged to 'go to those people in Congress who understand what war is about.' His speech in Denver, the first in a cross-country tour designed to influence congressional elections, was conspicuous for its attacks on Third World countries. He suggested that Haiti was a country whose people 'like a dictator'. Mr Christopher dismissed these arguments as 'pure baloney' and flatly rejected suggestions that any military action be delayed until after the November elections. He was confident that, if and when any action was taken, the president would receive plenty of political and public support once the case for intervention had been laid out. Key reasons for action were the dangers posed by the Haitian military regime to hemispheric stability, the need to end human rights violations in Haiti and the credibility of the United Nations, which has directed that all reasonable steps be taken to restore democracy to the island.</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Campaign on disease is backed by TUC A CAMPAIGN has been launched to alert people with runny noses that they may be suffering from an industrial disease for which they can claim compensation from the Department of Social Security. Inflammation or ulceration of the mucous membrane, provoked by exposure to dust, liquid or vapours in the workplace, has been covered by government compensation schemes since the 1920s. But claims have been rare because sufferers often blame colds, hay fever or allergies. Now the condition - D4 in official terminology - looks likely to receive greater recognition because of a campaign led by the four Trades Union Congress Unemployed Centres in Tyne and Wear. The campaign is expected to be extended nationally. The move follows the Sunderland centre's recent success in helping a former shipyard welder to claim government compensation for mucous membrane disease. Mr Thomas Brown, who developed nasal trouble after working in tanks sprayed with polyurethane, was judged 15 per cent disabled and awarded a weekly pension of Pounds 17.68, plus Pounds 4,600 for backdating to 1982. The campaign immediately encouraged dozens of inquiries. The DSS does not keep breakdowns of payments for prescribed diseases and industrial accidents. It paid out a total of about Pounds 600m in 1991-92 in compensatory benefits, up from Pounds 520m in 1990-91. Sufferers from D4, which can cause nasal bleeding, hoarseness and a dry throat, may be eligible for sick pay, invalidity, sickness or disablement benefit or reduced earnings allowance.</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / EC duty-free gift limit is doubled EUROPEAN Community finance ministers yesterday doubled the value of duty-free gifts which travellers within the Community will be able to bring home from the beginning of next year. The ministers agreed to increase the outdated Ecu45 (Pounds 35) limit on duty-free purchases of watches, camera equipment and other gifts, to Ecu90. They also increased the tax-free allowances for gifts bought outside the Community from Ecu45 to Ecu175. Yesterday's deal leaves the allowances for duty-free wine, spirits and tobacco unchanged, but it will provide a consolation for EC duty-free shops as they wind up their EC activities. Duty-free shopping on journeys within the Community will end on June 30, 1999. Brussels had resisted prolonging duty-free sales within the EC, because it believed limits would be difficult to enforce once internal controls on goods were abolished on January 1, 1993. However, ministers agreed last year that duty-free shops could police the system themselves until its abolition in 1999.</p>

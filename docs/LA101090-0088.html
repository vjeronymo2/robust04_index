			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRAIT REPEATS AS ENTERTAINER OF YEAR;  </P> <P> COUNTRY MUSIC: NEWCOMERS DOMINATE THE LIST OF NOMINEES AND WINNERS AT 24TH  ANNUAL AWARDS.  </P> <P> George Strait repeated as entertainer of the year in the Country Music Assn.'s  24th annual awards ceremony Monday night in Nashville, but the emphasis  otherwise was on newcomers.  </P> <P> There were so many new faces among the key nominees and winners, in fact, that  co-host Randy Travis -- who has sold 10 million albums since his first Top 20  country hit just four years ago -- seemed very much an elder statesman.  </P> <P> Symbolic of the dramatic changing of the guard in the commercial ranks of  country music these days, most of the artists who dominated the competition  have had only one or two albums on the charts.  </P> <P> They included:  </P> <P> * Clint Black, a gritty, neo-honky-tonk singer who was named best male vocalist  after winning the best newcomer award last year.  </P> <P> * Garth Brooks, another member of country's growing new traditionalist  contingent. He won best newcomer and best music video awards.  </P> <P> * The Kentucky Headhunters, a quintet with a somewhat radical  backwoods/garage-band style that impressed voters enough to earn them the best  vocal group and best album awards.  </P> <P> To underscore the domination of newcomers in the balloting, which is determined  by the 6,000 members of the association, that threesome plus newcomer Alan  Jackson -- whose debut album, "Here in the Real World," has been in the country  Top 10 since June -- received more than a dozen other nominations.  </P> <P> So, it's easy to understand Strait's surprise when he was named entertainer of  the year, defeating a group of nominees that included Black, Travis and Ricky  Van Shelton (whose first hit was in 1987).  </P> <P> "I'm truly speechless. I really don't have a speech," said Strait, accepting  the award during a two-hour telecast from the Grand Ole Opry House.  </P> <P> Backstage, Strait, a 38-year-old former cattle rancher from Texas, added, "I  was pretty surprised. Two times is pretty awesome. It was very stiff  competition."  </P> <P> Black also mentioned the strong competition -- and the new crop of country  stars -- during interviews backstage.  </P> <P> "There's a whole wave of country artists coming out . . . ," he said. "But you  always want something new, and that's what's happening now. There's more new  country in the stores than you can buy in one day."  </P> <P> There was still room in the balloting, however, for some more veterans. The  Judds were honored as best vocal duo, marking the sixth straight time that the  team of mother Naomi and daughter Wynonna has been named either best duo or  vocal group. And Kathy Mattea was declared best female vocalist for the second  straight year.  </P> <P> In one of the evening's most emotional moments, Lorrie Morgan accepted the  "vocal event" award for " 'Til a Tear Becomes a Rose," on which she sang with  her late husband, Keith Whitley.  </P> <P> Vince Gill's "When I Call Your Name" was judged the year's best country single,  while Jon Venzer and Don Henry's "Where've You Been" was named best song.  </P> <P> Tennessee Ernie Ford, who had more than a dozen Top 10 country singles in the  1950s and '60s, was named to the Country Music Hall of Fame. Ford, 71, was also  a popular television performer who helped expand the audience for country  music. His biggest hit was "Sixteen Tons," which was No. 1 on both the pop and  country charts in 1955.  </P></p>

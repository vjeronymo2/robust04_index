			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: Sterling the focus in budget week - Currencies Sterling will be a focus of market attention this week, with the political tribulations of Mr John Major and the presentation of the 1995-96 budget on Tuesday providing a focus for traders. Although the chances of the government falling today over a vote of confidence on the European Union finance bill appear remote, analysts say that last week's row over the EU has placed a lid on sterling. A further question mark hanging over the pound will only be removed on Wednesday when it emerges whether or not Mr Major will face a leadership challenge this year. Tomorrow's budget is not expected to have much impact on sterling. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is widely expected to announce a substantial cut in spending totals, while maintaining revenue neutrality. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, said sterling appeared to be comfortable in the DM2.40-45 bracket. Two other political events which will occupy markets will be the outcome of today's referendum in Norway on EU membership, and the ongoing tribulations of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister. Contrary to the position in Denmark, Sweden and Finland - which have all voted in favour of EU membership - opinion polls in Norway have always shown a majority of voters against the EU. Although the vote promises to be close, analysts say the outcome may not have much bearing, other than in the short term, on the krone. Mr MacKinnon said volume analysis of Citibank clients suggested that most of them anyway held long D-Mark positions against the krone, suggesting that the downside from a No vote would be limited. A Yes vote might bring short-term appreciation, but Mr MacKinnon said: 'As we saw in Sweden, a Yes vote doesn't guarantee you currency appreciation.' Last Friday, the lira hit a record low of L1,038.25 against the D-Mark. Continued uncertainty about the future of Mr Berlusconi's government, and the impact this will have on the budget, have led some analysts to predict that the lira will weaken to L1,050 or, in extreme cases, to L1,100. After the Thanksgiving break, dollar watchers will this week have some fresh data to focus on, principally in the form of November's jobs report. Sentiment towards the dollar has improved appreciably recently, but it is sensitive to market perceptions about whether monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive.</p>

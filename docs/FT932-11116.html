			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / IG Metall to step up action after talks break down IG METALL, Germany's powerful engineering union, will today step up strikes throughout eastern Germany following the breakdown of negotiations in Saxony. A further 24 enterprises, including four steel plants, will be targeted, and a strike ballot will be held next week in the metal and engineering sectors of the three remaining states of Saxony-Anhalt, Berlin-Brandenburg, and Thuringia. More than 30,000 workers in 24 enterprises are on strike. If it continues, IG Metall could bring what remains of eastern German industry to a standstill by calling out all its 400,000 members. Yesterday's negotiations in Dresden broke down after failure to agree which enterprises might be excluded from paying wage increases of more than 20 per cent, or a postponement of the income parity timetable. The union wants Gesamtmetall, the metal and engineering employers' association, to reinstate a contract signed in 1991 which would have brought wages in eastern Germany to western levels by next year. The employers cancelled the contract because of the recession. The strike has hit factories throughout the former Communist state. Volkswagen, which has a greenfield plant in Mosel, Saxony, said production for the Golf car was at a standstill. The plant employs 2,600, and produces 380 vehicles a day. But production at Mosel accounts for only 8 per cent of Volkswagen's Golf output. Production at a subsidiary of electronics group AEG has also been halted, with a third of the 900 workers on strike. The company said loss of component supplies from the Dresden plant was costing it about DM400,000 a day. The plant accounts for 1.7 per cent of AEG's turnover. Siemens, which employs 17,000 people in eastern Germany, said yesterday that 2,600 were on strike. It expected turnover of DM5bn (Pounds 2bn) in the region this year, a small percentage of its total turnover of DM78bn. All its plants had offered 9 per cent rises, as recommended by the employers. But BICC, the British-based international cable company, committed to investing DM80m in its KWO Kabel plant in eastern Berlin, said it was determined to make the company competitive, and link wages to high productivity levels. 'We have offered our 2,200 employees a pay rise of 18 per cent. We have already paid for April,' it said. IG Metall has not responded to the offer.</p>

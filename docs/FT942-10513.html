			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: MIM to sell coal projects MIM Holdings, the Queensland-based metals group which is trying to prune its investment portfolio and discard assets deemed 'non-core", is putting three undeveloped coal projects up for sale, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. Two are in Queensland - Rolleston in the Bowen Basin and Chinchilla in the Surat Basin - where MIM holds 100 per cent interests. The third is the Denman project in New South Wales' Hunter Valley. This is a 50:50 joint venture with Agipcoal Australia. MIM said the deposits were in 'an advanced state of evaluation' and contained around 1bn tonnes of coal resources, suitable for domestic and export steaming coal markets. It said it would consider outright purchase or joint venture arrangements.</p>

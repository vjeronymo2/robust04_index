			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Matsushita to Buy U.S. Chip Plant: National Semiconductor Corp. said it had  signed a letter of intent to sell its Puyallup, Wash., chip making plant to  Matsushita Electronics Corp. for $86 million plus debt. National, of Santa  Clara, Calif., said the sale would allow it to trim excess production capacity  created by its decision in August to exit the market for ultrafast computer  memory chips known as SRAMs.  </P> <P> The struggling chip maker, which lost $165.5 million in the first quarter ended  Aug. 26, said it expected the sale to close by March, pending national security  and antitrust reviews. The sale would give Matsushita, a unit of the Japanese  electronics giant of the same name, its first such plant in the United States.  </P></p>

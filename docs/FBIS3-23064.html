According to security reports received from a non-Sudanese  party, the Sudanese security forces were forced to arrest three  persons, one of them a diplomat from the Iranian embassy and two  Lebanese. In addition, they seized pistols equipped with  silencers and poisoned daggers. The whole case was shrouded in  complete secrecy until the conference was over and then the  three were deported.    The conference cost 320 million Sudanese pounds and was  attended by representatives of 27 Islamic organizations in  Egypt, China, Kashmir, the former Soviet republics, Morocco,  Nigeria, Ivory Coast, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda. The  conference was held at two levels: an open one held at the  Friendship Hall and a secret one held at the camps center in  Sawba. These secret sessions focused on studying the  development of terrorist operations. Ayman al-Zawahiri [one of  the leaders of the Islamic Group in Egypt] addressed the  conference and stressed that his organization recognizes Hala'ib  as Sudanese. He attacked the Sudanese opposition and said  anyone who opposes the Islamic regime in Sudan is a traitor. He  also said that his group is ready to liquidate the Sudanese  regime's opponents in Cairo if the Sudanese government asks it.    At its secret sessions the conference discussed the status  of  the Islamic movements in various countries. It agreed that the  Islamic movement in Libya should improve its relations with  Colonel al-Qadhdhafi's regime in order to gain a measure of  stability and legitimacy and become the alternative if any  changes occur.    The conference also discussed the possibility of Iran giving  direct and practical support should an Islamic movement start in  the United Arab Emirates.    It was also announced at the secret sessions that much  backing has been given to the terrorist movement in Algeria  through the dispatch of weapons across the Algerian-Libyan  borders.    The conferees strongly criticized the Islamic movement in  Tunis because its tactics are not compatible with the situation  and because of its refusal to use overt violence. The conferees  were informed that armed action will start soon, after a number  of trained Tunisian terrorists have been smuggled into that  country. Agreement was also reached on supporting the Islamic  movement in Uganda.    A committee with al-Fatih 'Urwah as chairman and Colonel  'Abd-al-Rahim 'Abdallah 'Ali and Sudanese Ambassador in Ethiopia  'Uthman al-Sayyid as members was formed to manage the terrorist  operations against the regimes in Ethiopia and Eritrea. The  conferees decided to exert pressure on Pakistan to prevent it  from extraditing the "mujahidin" or deporting them. The  conference also decided to set up an "International Jihad Fund"  headquartered in Sudan under Ibrahim al-Sanusi with the aim of  funding and coordinating terrorist actions in various countries.    Iran announced it will contribute $10 million as a first  installment.    From the secret sessions it emerged that Ayman al-Zawahiri  and Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Aziz Musa are residing in Sudan, contrary  to what some believe, and have full freedom of movement. We  have also learned that Tal'at Yasin, whom Egyptian authorities  believe to be in Peshawar, succeeded in returning secretly to  Cairo some time ago and was one of the ones who planned the  attempts to assassinate [Interior Minister] Hasan al-Alfi and  [Prime Minister] Dr. 'Atif Sidqi.    The actual number of Egyptians who were in Afghanistan was  2,500, of whom 600 had left Pakistan before the Egyptian  security delegation arrived there. Most of the others had  travelled to Sudan and Yemen. A secret committee chaired by  Ibrahim al-Sanusi has been formed to take charge of providing  them with a livelihood, continuing their training, and smuggling  them into Egypt.</p>

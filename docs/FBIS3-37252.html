This  was stated at an enlarged collegium of the Ministry of Fuel and  Energy of the Russian Federation by first Vice Premier Oleg  Soskovets. "The miners deliver coal to metallurgists who give  metal for cars which are now in great demand. If the directors  come to an agreement among themselves, it will be possible to  pay the debts both to the metallurgists and miners after selling  these cars." Such is the opinion of the vice premier.    He said that this year nobody would forgive debts to  anybody.  However, "there is no going away from this problem any longer,"  said Soskovets and added that "it is useless to harbour  illusions that somebody will come and do everything for the  directors of enterprises."    As an example of the non-balanced work of the Directors'  Corps Soskovets adduced the fact of purchasing 700,000 tons of  pipes in Japan, Italy and Austria, while the Russian  pipe-producing plants had to cut their output last year.</p>

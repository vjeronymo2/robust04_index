			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Observer: Aladin's lamp in Grozny What was the chief of Jordan's military intelligence - Ahmad Aladin Arsala - doing recently in Grozny, the Russian-besieged capital of Chechnya? To say that he was having a cosy chat with Russif Shamsuddin - Chechnya's Jordanian-born foreign minister - hardly clears up the mystery. The waters are further muddied by news that one of Jordan's leading parliamentarians has now begun enlisting volunteers to help the Chechnyan resistance fight Russian troops. For an insight, step back to the early 19th century, when the Ottomans set up a military garrison in (what is now) Amman, employing conscripts from the Caucasus. When Prince Abdullah, King Hussein's grandfather, became the first ruler of the emirate of TransJordan in 1921, he won Circassian and Chechen hearts and minds by giving important government posts to their nationals. Today, Jordan's 80,000-strong Caucasian community remains fiercely loyal to their adopted country; an elite group acts as the ceremonial bodyguard to King Hussein. But they also retain strong feelings for their Caucasian roots. Since the Russian-Chechnya conflict erupted, many more than usual have taken advantage of the resumption of flights to Moscow by the Royal Jordanian airline - including a delegation of Circassian political figures from Jordan, accompanied by Ahmad Aladin Arsala. This plot is positively congealing; even Jimmy Carter may need more than a couple of days to square the Circassian circle.</p>

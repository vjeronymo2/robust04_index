			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 17 (XINHUA) -- The video made by Henry  Wu and a reporter of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)  on the No. 2 Prison in Xinjiang, televised by the BBC yesterday,  was sheer fabrication, a Chinese Government spokesman said today.    The spokesman for the Judicial Department said that the  video  was created by means of substituting one thing for another.    He said that the film showed the gate to the Xinjiang No. 2  Prison, located in Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang Uygur  Autonomous Region.    He said that the gate is near a street, with a number of  shops and booths nearby, all of which are not related to the  prison.    But the producers of the video pictures deliberately  montaged  the gate with these shops and booths, he said.    They also claimed that the leather jackets and children's  clothing available in the shops and booths were export products  made by the prisoners, he added.    The fact is that a factory attached to the prison only  produces some toothpaste for use in the prison, and that the  factory has never turned out any leather jackets or children's  clothing.    The spokesman pointed out that the pictures showed some tomb  sites and a few tomb tablets, with the intention of giving  viewers the impression that they were prisoners' graves.    But the recognizable inscriptions on tablets, bearing words  such as "the tomb of Wu Jiafeng's mother," and similar  inscriptions, proved that they are tombs of local residents.    The video pictures even claimed that more than ten million  Chinese prisoners were now serving prison terms in Xinjiang, he  said.    He said that there are some one million prisoners serving  prison terms in the whole of China, slightly more than one-tenth  of the figure alleged in the story.    Xinjiang has a population of 15 million. "So how could it be  possible that ten million prisoners are serving their sentences  there?" he asked.    " It's really ridiculous for the video makers to make such a  fabrication," he said.    The video also said that one-third of goods available in the  shops and stores in Xinjiang were products from the region's  prisons and they account for half of the exports of Xinjiang,  but the film did not show any of these alleged exports.    That means that Henry Wu was just spreading rumors, he said.    He pointed out that this was not the first time that Henry  Wu  had come to China using different names and making sensational  news by cutting and matching unrelated pictures, so as to  achieve ulterior purposes.    The stand of the Chinese Government is clear and consistent  on the issue of prison-labour products, the spokesman said,  adding that it is only futile for Henry Wu and others to spread  such rumors on that issue.</p>

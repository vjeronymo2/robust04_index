			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> KIDS;  </P> <P> ORGANIC BABIES  </P> <P> SIMPLY PURE FOODS baby products are so pure that tiny diners can eat everything  but the container (even the label is nontoxic). And the wide-mouth, screw-top  glass jar is definitely a plus for mommies and daddies.  </P> <P> Simply Pure Foods, headquartered in Bangor, Me., is heading into its fourth  year, not coincidentally, the same age as founder Sarah Redfield's son,  Alexander. Redfield, a Harvard Law School graduate, had become concerned that  youngsters under 5 are at high risk from pesticide residues. Unable to find  organic baby food for her newborn, she decided to shift career gears and make  her own.  </P> <P> All of the fruits and vegetables used in Redfield's 100% organic products for  babies and toddlers are fresh and grown on acreage kept free of pesticides for  at least three years. Also, the products contain no dyes, preservatives,  fillers, artificial enhancers or added salt, sugar or vitamins.  </P> <P> These strained baby foods come in six varieties: applesauce, pear-applesauce,  beets, carrots, winter squash and green beans -- and sell for about 65 cents to  $1. (Green beans and carrots and potatoes also come in half-inch diced finger  food.)  </P> <P> Other organic products, including dry cereals and additional finger foods for  children, are currently in the works, the company says. And both Alexander and  Simply Pure Foods are healthy and growing strong and quickly.  </P> <P>  Simply Pure Foods products are available at Gelson's and Vons Pavilion markets  and at many health-food outlets.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) submitted these revisions to EPA on the following dates: May 13, 1991, April 5, 1991 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 19, 1992, respectively. The revisions concern Yolo-Solano APCD's Rule 2.24&hyph;Solvent Cleaning Operations, Ventura County APCD's Rule 74.6&hyph;Surface Cleaning and Degreasing, and Placer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> County APCD's Rule 216&hyph;Degreasing Operations. These rules control emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from surface cleaning and degreasing operations. The intended effect of proposing approval of these rules is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated each of these rules and is proposing to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before May 4, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments may be mailed to: Daniel A.

On September 12, 1979 EPA promulgated a similar list that included the Placer County Area. 44 FR 53801; 40 CFR 81.305. Because these areas were unable to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California requested under section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. 40 CFR 52.238. On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended Act, that the above districts' portions of the California SIP were inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. In amended section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Lake Tahoe portion of Placer County is in attainment for ozone and was not subject to the SIP call.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified as marginal or above as of the date of enactment.

This document addresses EPA's proposed action for Yolo-Solano APCD's Rule 2.24&hyph;Solvent Cleaning Operations, Ventura County APCD's Rule 74.6&hyph;Surface Cleaning and Degreasing and Placer County APCD's Rule 216&hyph;Degreasing Operations. These submitted rules were found to be complete on the following dates: Rule 2.24, July 10, 1991; Rule 74.6, August 27, 1992; and Rule 216, May 21, 1991.

VOCs contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. The rules were adopted as part of each district's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and Part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA's interpretation of these requirements, which forms the basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 2. Among those provisions is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents, as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). The CTG applicable to all of the rules in this document is EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;77&hyph;022, ``Control of Volatile Organic emissions from Solvent Metal Cleaning.'' Further interpretations of EPA policy are found in the Blue Book, referred to in footnote 2. In general, these guidance documents have been set forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Yolo-Solano County APCD's Rule 2.24, Solvent Cleaning Operations, includes the following significant changes from the current SIP: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

Deleted Air Pollution Control Officer discretion for selection of test methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Added recordkeeping requirements and test methods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. With regard to cold solvent cleaning, changed all reference points from vapor pressure to initial boiling point of the solvent which is more easily measured (as determined by ASTM D&hyph;1078&hyph;78). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ventura County APCD's Rule 74.6, Surface Cleaning and Degreasing, includes the following significant changes from the current SIP: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Added an applicability section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Expanded the ``Definitions'' section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Added recordkeeping requirements, i.e. records for solvent makeup, solvent disposal, and total solvent used by type.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Added specific test methods approved by the EPA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Expanded operating requirements for the different degreasing operations through the incorporation of Ventura County APCD Rules 74.6.1, 74.6.2, and 74.6.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Incorporated the initial boiling point of solvents (as measured by ASTM 1078&hyph;78) for determining applicability in place of vapor pressure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Included more stringent vapor control and emission collection provisions for open top vapor degreasers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Placer County APCD's Rule 216, Degreasing Operations includes the following significant changes from the current SIP: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

Added a requirement for immediate repair of leaks or system shutdown.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Removed the exemption for small vapor and conveyorized degreasers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Added an exemption for small cold cleaners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Deleted APCO discretion in determining equivalency of equipment or procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.

Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. E.P.A. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225) as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation.

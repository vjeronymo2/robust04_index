			<p>BFN     [Text] Irbil, Iraq, June 5 (AFP) -- Iraqi Kurdistan's main  leaders, Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani, met here Sunday for  the first time since fierce clashes broke out between their  rival factions a month ago.    The meeting in the northern Iraqi town of Irbil took place  at  the initiative of the Iraqi National Congress (INC), a coalition  of Arab and Kurdish groups opposed to President Saddam Husayn.    The INC announced after the talks that a new joint operation  room was being formed to implement a ceasefire between Barzani's  Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Talabani's Patriotic Union  of Kurdistan (PUK).    The PUK leader, abroad when the fighting broke out in early  May, was airlifted back to northern Iraq last week on board a  Turkish helicopter to overfly KDP-controlled areas.    After several ceasefire accords, calm returned to most of  Iraqi Kurdistan at the end of May. But fresh clashes erupted  Saturday in the regions of Halabjah and Qal'at al-Dizah, near  the Iranian border, according to the CNI.    The CNI says more than 600 people are believed to been  killed  in the power struggle between the PUK and KDP, which have  controlled northern Iraq in defiance of Baghdad since the  aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War.</p>

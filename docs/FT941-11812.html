			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: BMW chief enthusiastic about future of the Mini - BMW/Rover Deal 'I personally am sure there is a market for the Mini under the Metro as an up-market small car,' says Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW's chairman and the man who holds the future direction of Rover, the carmaker, in his hands. With its limited financial resources Rover was never able to make a business case for developing a successor for the 35-year-old Mini,but Mr Pischetsrieder is enthusiastic. 'Sure they will have the resources now,' he says, 'others can manufacture minicars but only Rover can manufacture Minis. This car has a unique position in the world outside the US. To give that away would be foolish.' He insists that the takeover of Rover is based on maintaining BMW and Rover as two separate entities, although the UK carmaker will now be able to draw on BMW's extensive engineering resources. 'BMW engineers know what a BMW is, but they would have difficulties developing a Jaguar. They would think it was imperfect. If you asked them to develop a competing car they would again develop a BMW.' The BMW chairman has still to discover exactly what resources Rover has of its own, but he says 'it is a fraction of what we think you need to develop a proper motor car'. 'Does Rover have a wind tunnel? We have a test track in the south of France that Rover engineers can use. We have experts in suspension settings, in noise reduction and in electronics. They are now available to Rover. Mr Pischetsrieder says that the first project that BMW will start at Rover will be the development of a successor for the Rover 800 executive car, which was originally launched in 1986 and was largely engineered by Honda as a sister car of the Honda Legend. No joint project had been started with Honda to replace this car, and it is the obvious part of the existing Rover range, where BMW can begin to gain significant cost savings through the use of BMW components. Mr Pischetsrieder says that the new generation 800 will be derived from the chassis platform of the next BMW 5-Series, which is due to be launched in 1995.</p>

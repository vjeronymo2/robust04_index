			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> MEXICO VOWS TO BATTLE DRUG TRAFFIC  </P> <P> Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari told a joint meeting of Congress  today that his nation intends "to eradicate drug trafficking at its very  roots."  </P> <P> But Salinas, who is on a state visit to the United States, warned that "at the  world level, we are losing." He said that is unacceptable and called for  greater cooperation between governments to turn the tide.  </P> <P> While vowing an all-out effort to curb drug trafficking, Salinas firmly ruled  out joint U.S.-Mexican military operations to fight the traffickers.  </P> <P> "The responsibility for the fight in our country is exclusively ours," he said.  "There will be no joint military operations on our soil."  </P> <P> Salinas, who met on Tuesday with President Bush, said there is now greater  acceptance in the United States regarding the importance of greater efforts to  reduce the demand for drugs.  </P></p>

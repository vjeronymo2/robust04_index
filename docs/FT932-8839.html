			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Yes please, Denmark IT IS IN the interest of Denmark, of Britain, and of the European Community as a whole, that Denmark should vote Yes tomorrow in the country's second referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Those who desire the opposite outcome hope that a second Danish No might kill the treaty. In a narrowly legal sense, that may be so, but all that can be said with certainty is that even after a No vote, the EC's future would have to be negotiated. It is unlikely that other member states, especially the original Six, would acquiesce in a Danish veto. Rather, some or all of them would seek to bypass the obstacle by replacing the Maastricht treaty with a new arrangement. The legal difficulties might be considerable, but one way or another a No vote would mark a parting of the ways between Denmark and the core countries. It would be a step backwards in a world which cannot avoid the struggle to construct effective international political institutions. A Danish Yes vote is firmly in Britain's interest, because it would increase the pressure to get the Maastricht treaty through parliament. There have been hints that should the the Danes say No, ratification might be abandoned on the grounds that the treaty would then be 'dead'. This would be a serious error. If Mr John Major were to abandon Maastricht, his influence on a successor to the treaty would be severely weakened. It cannot be excluded that Britain, too, might manoeuvre itself into an outer circle of the EC. None of this is to make exaggerated claims for the treaty. As soon as it is ratified, the EC must face the task of making the new union larger, more accountable, more transparent and more efficient. It will also, as Mr Jacques Delors has recently recognised, have to turn again to the dangers of Eurosclerosis in an ever more competitive global economy. Maastricht's most detailed element, the programme for Economic and Monetary Union, has been shaken by upheavals in the currency markets. It is likely that it will either be revised or confined to an inner core of countries. The treaty's second most important objective, a common foreign and security policy, has been shown by the Yugoslav crisis to be more urgent but more difficult than previously appeared. Yet nothing has happened in the months spent ratifying Maastricht to alter the fact that Europe must have a dynamic, outward-looking economy and a self-confident polity capable of influence beyond its borders, especially to the east. As recession grips Europe's heart and its political leaders stumble, it is tempting to blame the EC and Maastricht for all that is wrong. But the Community's ability to evolve through negotiation between democratically elected governments remains its most creative characteristic. That process will be most effective with Maastricht unanimously ratified.</p>

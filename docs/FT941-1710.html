			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Big Four pension managers dominate The so-called Big Four UK pension fund managers outperformed the average in 1993, but by a far smaller margin than in recent years, Combined Actuarial Performance Services, which measures pension fund manager returns, reported yesterday, Norma Cohen writes. The four are Mercury Asset Management, Schroders Investment Management, PDFM and Gartmore. The Big Four earned total returns on their portfolios, exclusive of property investments, of 29.3 per cent. The median market return was 29.3 per cent. But in the five year period 1989 through 1993, the Big Four earned median returns of 18 per cent per year while the median return was 17.2 per cent.</p>

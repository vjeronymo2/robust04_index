			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / World Trade News: G7 summit 'crucial' to Uruguay Round CONFLICT over international trade liberalisation will provide 'a major test of post-cold war leadership' at next week's Tokyo summit of the Group of Seven industrial countries, according to Mr Peter Sutherland, the new director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Predicting that the summit will be a 'crucial catalyst' for rescuing the stalled Uruguay Round talks on international trade liberalisation, after months of 'obfuscation and paralysis', Mr Sutherland said that if leaders failed to reach agreement, the round would be 'a pipe dream'. 'I don't see any point in fooling ourselves about the seriousness of the situation. It will be extremely difficult - even utopian - to deliver the Uruguay Round by the end of the year if the G7 fails.' A successful agreement could generate Dollars 200bn (Pounds 133bn) in new trade each year. Failure is almost certain to trigger damaging tit-for-tat protection among industrial powers. Noting that he was 'increasingly apprehensive' about setbacks in the past week between trade negotiators on market access for manufactured exports and on the US-Japan trade relationship, he said: 'So much rests on the G7, I can only hope the negative feelings of recent days are not the reality. 'It is simply not good enough for the G7 to make general protestations in favour of trade reform, as they have for the past five summits,' he said: 'We need a detailed communique that allows negotiators to move on to a multilateral treaty. If the outcome is unclear, it is negative.' France has in recent days set increasingly stringent conditions for any G7 agreement on trade reform. Mr Sutherland would not comment yesterday on his talks with French President Francois Mitterrand: 'France is the world's fourth largest exporter, and the second largest exporter of services. It has a crucial interest in a satisfactory outcome of the round, whatever the temporary pressures for protection: the inexorable logic of this should be as clear to the posers that be in France as it is to us.' Mr Sutherland, speaking on his first day in office at the head of Gatt, was emphatic that his own role was limited: 'I can't be presented as a magician. I am a facilitator. There is no point in lecturing about banging heads together if the basic will is not there.' He plans to meet Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign minister, in London today, as part of a flurry of briefings with G7 leaders ahead of the G7 summit.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Interest cut helps Davis Service rise to Pounds 8m DAVIS SERVICE Group, which has now all but severed its links with motor-related activities, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.06m to Pounds 8.03m in the six months to June 30. In July 1991 it sold three of its four motor dealerships for Pounds 6.69m to a management buy-out and in early April this year disposed of its Godfrey Davis (Contract Hire) business to NWS Bank, a subsidiary of the Bank of Scotland, for Pounds 5.75m. Pre-tax profits of the continuing businesses grew to Pounds 8.22m (Pounds 6.65m). Mr George Boyle, finance director, said that contract hire carried a large amount of 'back-to-back' borrowings. As a result of the sale, borrowings were sharply cut to Pounds 8.3m at the end of June. At the beginning of the half year they had stood at Pounds 77.8m. The only outstanding motor-related activity is the dealership in St Albans. Interest payable for the contract hire side totalled Pounds 2.75m in the half, leaving group interest charges at Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 5.83m). This in turn offset the fall in overall operating profits to Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 12.9m), though for continuing businesses there was a rise to Pounds 8.22m (Pounds 7.68m). Group turnover fell to Pounds 124.7m (Pounds 155m), but for continuing activities, it rose almost 6 per cent to Pounds 112.2m. By division, the textile maintenance side, which accounts for about 55 per cent of the group, was hit by the effects of the recession on the hotel industry in the Sunlight Textile Services segment, and by employers controlling costs in Sunlight Workwear Services. In site services - about 22 per cent of the group - improved demand from local authorities for temporary classrooms offset falls in the construction sector, which accounts for 40 per cent of the division. Government policies of compulsory tendering and 'contracting out' helped ensure a good performance in support services, which provides cleaning and maintenance staff. Earnings grew to 6.39p (5.61p) per share and the interim dividend is maintained at 2.73p.</p>

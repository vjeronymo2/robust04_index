			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (22): Heavyweight challengers VIAG: Has extensive cable and optical fibre network, but used almost exclusively for internal voice and data transmission. Has founded TB&amp;D Telekommunikation subsidiary which has been linked up with the internal network of Bayerische Hypobank. Believed to be trying to extend network through deals with regional electricity distributors, but has no stakes in other telecoms businesses and nil experience of operating in private sector. Aims to win a 7 per cent share of domestic private telecoms market (DM600m-700m) by 1998. RWE: Actively building stakes and interests in promising consortiums and partnerships, with plans to invest DM1.5bn by the end of the decade and reach break-even a year earlier. Entire telecoms interests recently bundled together in RWE Unitel AG. Analysts suggest relatively constipated progress is due to the conglomerate's bureaucratic, politicised planning mechanisms. The group is controlled by local governments from the Ruhr region, with dozens of important posts filled by civil servants or politicians. VEBA: Would-be telecoms power house among the power companies. Plans to invest DM6bn by 2003, looking for foreign partner for its newly-formed Vebacom subsidiary which bundles together its stakes in nine separate businesses spanning the whole telecoms spectrum from cable TV to satellite communications. Veba's projects, pushed through against resistance from traditionalist board by new chairman, Mr Ulrich Hartmann. They are also being enthusiastically promoted by one of the most effective investor relations teams in Germany.</p>

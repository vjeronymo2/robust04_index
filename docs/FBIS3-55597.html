As Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs has explained to  INTERFAX, the cabinet found such a discussion "premature" before  January 10, when NATO will open its summit.    Western leaders are to work out a common position toward the  prospects of integration in the alliance of Central and East  European states, the Baltic republics included.    As has been reported, President Algirdas Brazauskas of  Lithuania formally applied to NATO for membership on Tuesday [4  January].</p>

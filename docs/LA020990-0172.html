			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LAND DIVIDED: THE ARMENIA/AZERBAIJAN CRISIS;  </P> <P> CHAPTER 2: THE FIGHTING;  </P> <P> ETHNIC ARMIES BEGIN TO MOBILIZE  </P> <P> The initial orgy of violence in Baku quickly spread throughout both Azerbaijan  and Armenia. Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported new atrocities in  the Azerbaijani capital -- including two Armenian men being burned to death  just 20 yards from a police station -- and the Soviet government declared the  first of many states of emergency in the region.  </P> <P> The declaration had little effect on rabid combatants bent on blood feud. Even  as the state of emergency was being announced, agitated bands of Azerbaijani  and Armenian men were breaking into police offices, military barracks and  warehouses, searching for and seizing an impressive cache of weapons for their  budding ethnic warfare.  </P> <P> Irregular militias in both Armenia and Azerbaijan were swiftly formed and  equipped with some of the best weapons in the Soviet arsenal -- late-model  Kalashnikov assault rifles, medium and heavy machine guns, rockets, missile  launchers, armored vehicles, even helicopters.  </P> <P> Armenia immediately deployed some of its volunteer troops to defend Armenian  villages along the Azerbaijan border and in Nagorno-Karabakh, while others were  being prepared for a 250-mile helicopter ride to protect Armenian civilians  still in Baku. Azerbaijan, meanwhile, dispatched guerrillas to attack Armenians  both in Nagorno-Karabakh and in the Khanlar and Shaumyan regions to the north  of the disputed enclave.  </P> <P> Ill-equipped and out-manned Interior Ministry defense forces were no match for  the advancing ethnic armies; indeed, the conventional Soviet forces often found  themselves forced to call in large numbers of airborne troops just to fight  their way out through the swarming irregulars.  </P> <P> Almost immediately, the Azerbaijanis moved to sever all rail lines that pass  through their territory into Armenia, thereby denying Armenia 85% of its food,  fuel and building supplies. Fully 224 operational trains were bottled up, and  another 109 trains were unable to move for lack of locomotives. Within days,  fuel shortages begin to curtail cooking, heating and public transport in  Yerevan.  </P> <P> Ferries continued to evacuate Armenians from Baku at the rate of several  thousand each day. Between occasional spasms of violence, the city appeared  eerily calm, according to witnesses reached by telephone from Moscow. Outside  observers were barred from the city, where it was said that 1,000 apartments  had been sacked -- including some belonging to Soviet Army officers -- and  their owners, if they were unlucky enough to be at home, were beaten or killed.  </P> <P> Yerevan, on the other hand, bristled with activity. The Armenian capital looked  like a city at war. Streets in the center of city were blocked off to all  traffic except buses and trucks moving men and supplies to what many in the  city now call "the front." Men in crisp new army fatigues keep order among the  milling throngs of curious, slogan-shouting bystanders. Others, less grandly  outfitted, dutifully loaded trucks or filed onto buses with their rifles and  their bedrolls.  </P> <P> These volunteers were boys still in their teens, puffed-up college students,  rough-bearded men down from the mountains and a few real soldiers who had  deserted the Soviet Army to defend their homeland. Some had modern automatic  weapons, others made do with scrounged hunting rifles -- a few carried antique  muzzle-loading muskets. Some had only their knives and their courage.  </P> <P> The Armenian nationalist Karabakh Committee stoked the flames of Armenian pride  in a rally of 300,000 people jammed into the square in front of the opera  house. Bring us clothes, people were asked; bring us food and medicine for  those fighting "the Turks." But most important of all, speaker after speaker  said, bring us your guns and your sons.  </P> <P> Those appeals were aided greatly when, on Tuesday, Jan. 16, Yerevan started to  receive the first of the wounded survivors of the pogrom in Baku. Their  firsthand tales of the violence fueled the war tensions. Coincidentally or not,  Armenians raided 16 more police stations, army posts and other government  weapons caches that day, the Soviet Interior Ministry reported.  </P> <P> With industry and commerce crippled by the rail blockade, many Armenians simply  stayed home and listened to the radio or watched television for news of  Azerbaijan. The news was not good. As combatants from both republics poured  into the contested central region of Azerbaijan, fierce fire fights involving  sometimes hundreds of men broke out. Small localized fighting that had dragged  on uneventfully for months were suddenly flashing into full-scale battles in  which armored vehicles dodged anti-tank rockets and heavy machine guns blasted  away at helicopters.  </P> <P> It took a good map or a great memory to keep track of the erupting battle  zones: throughout Nagorno-Karabakh; along the Armenian borders with Azerbaijan  and its allied autonomous region, Nakhichevan; and especially in the  aggressively contested Khanlar and Shaumyan districts, where Azerbaijanis had  laid siege to several Armenian villages. Strategically important hilltops and  ridges were fought over for hours, in anticipation of a protracted mountain  war.  </P> <P> Soviet authorities scrambled to head off full-scale civil war by arresting  26,000 people -- fully a fifth of the population of Nagorno-Karabakh -- and  seizing 3,000 weapons. But the value of such actions was not immediately  apparent.  </P> <P> Soviet troops landing in Azerbaijan found roads effectively blockaded with  trucks and buses filled with civilians; when the soldiers tried to vault the  roadblocks by air to avoid bloody confrontations, their helicopters came under  heavy fire from stolen anti-aircraft guns. Snipers also harassed Soviet troops  at regular intervals.  </P> <P> In one illustrative case, a squad of eight Soviet troops that had been  dispatched to defend the Armenian village of Manashit were overrun with heavy  casualties by Azerbaijani guerrillas. Squad leader Capt. Viktor Spiridonov  later said from a Yerevan hospital that the Azerbaijanis were not the rustic  "bandits" his soldiers had expected, but were a well-organized, heavily armed  partisan force.  </P> <P> At the same time, Azerbaijani guerrillas took the fight to the front doors of  both Armenians and the Soviet government. In one raid, they opened fire on  Armenian villages within 20 miles of Yerevan killing six Armenian farmers.  Meanwhile, Azerbaijanis laid siege to Soviet government buildings in Baku and  several other cities, demonstrating against central government authority and  Communist Party legitimacy.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev eventually abandoned all hope of finding  a political solution to what he believed to be essentially a political problem,  and he put the Soviet Army on "full war footing." But the army's inability to  immediately halt Azerbaijani aggression led to potentially devastating  political problems -- Azerbaijan and Armenia both threatened to secede from the  Soviet Union. Azerbaijan did so apparently with the idea that it had the  military capability to repulse any Soviet attempt to keep it in the fold, while  Armenia said it had no option but secession if the Soviets could not protect  its people.  </P> <P> "If the government does not support us in our struggle -- if it does not  protect us from this terror and anger -- then it is very possible that the  movement will take power into our own hands," warned Hambartsum Galstyan, a  leader of the Karabakh Committee. "We fully accept responsibility for what we  are doing, but we have no way out."  </P> <P> Considering their sad fate over the centuries at the hands of Persian, Greek,  Roman, Mongol, Russian and Turkish invaders, most Armenians -- upon learning  about the Baku atrocities and subsequent attacks -- undoubtedly did believe  they had no way out but to stand and fight for themselves.  </P></p>

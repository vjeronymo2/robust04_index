			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: AT&amp;T leads way with Dollars 28m Polish plant investment AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications company, has taken a big step in the Polish market with the purchase of 80 per cent of the country's Telfa telephone equipment plant in Bydgoszcz. The US group will pay Dollars 28m for its stake. The purchase is the first by a western investor in Poland's telecommunications sector, with AT&amp;T promising to invest Dollars 45m in the loss-making plant as well as increase its capital by a further Dollars 7.2m. Poland has an ambitious telecommunications development programme, funded in part by the World Bank, which is aimed at tripling the country's 3m lines by the end of the century. The market is being fiercely contested by western equipment suppliers, such as Northern Telecom of Canada, Alcatel of France, Siemens of Germany and Ericsson of Sweden which bid unsuccessfully against AT&amp;T for the Telfa plant. The Poles have decreed that 50 per cent of the value of the telecommunications equipment installed in the country should be sourced domestically. Yesterday Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the privatisation minister, said the home market was large enough for only three main suppliers. AT&amp;T said yesterday it had won a legal battle in its campaign for greater pricing transparency in the long-distance market. It said a US court of appeal had ruled that all long-distance carriers, and not merely AT&amp;T, must publish their prices, in accordance with the Communications Act of 1934. This reversed a ruling by the Federal Communications Commission, which oversees the industry, which allowed AT&amp;T's rivals not to publicly file their rates. AT&amp;T said this put it at a competitive disadvantage, when trying to reach contracts with business customers. AT&amp;T said following the ruling it might seek damages against MCI Communications, its main rival in the long-distance market, over its pricing policy.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANAGEMENT  </P> <P> Lee Iacocca is right on target (Op-Ed Page, Nov. 21) when he deplores American  corporate management's obsession with short-term profits at the expense of  long-range goals.  </P> <P> But his solution to this problem is out to lunch. If Iacocca's management  cannot see the benefits of long-term commitment to building up the industrial  base and to capturing a solid market share without Uncle Sam providing bribes  in the form of special tax benefits, there isn't much hope.  </P> <P> Maybe the real solution is to curtail tying management compensation to last  year's profits, and to provide private incentives to pursuing long-term  performance. The function of taxes should be primarily the raising of revenue  for the government, not providing incentives to good management which is  something good managers should be doing on their own. If they won't do that,  they shouldn't complain.  </P> <P> GIDEON KANNER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Members of the Association of Southeast Asian  Nations (ASEAN) have agreed to file a resolution resisting  social clauses in trade agreements with the International Labor  Organization.    Labor officials of the nations who attended the ASEAN  Sub-Committee on Labor Affairs (ASCLA) meeting decided to bring  up the matter during the International Labor Conference (ILC) in  June.    ASCLA Chairman Bienvenido Laguesma said the social clauses,  which are standards or conditions imposed on developing  countries before they are granted trade access, are "stringent  standards for developing nations."    He said "the ASEAN countries' stage of development is not  sufficient enough for us to be able to comply with the  conditions they have made."    "We also have to consider the cultural differences of each  country involved. A practice in our country may be considered  child or forced labor by other countries when, in fact, our  culture dictates otherwise which only shows that we have a  different situation from them," he added.    Last February, the European Parliament issued a resolution  which provides for the inclusion of social clauses in  international trade agreements designed to combat child and  forced labor .    Mr. Laguesma said "the motive is good but the standards are  too high. It's one way of keeping developing countries from  gaining trade access and competing against developed countries."    He also said the move of ASEAN countries to file the  resolution is "important because this could mean that the ILC  will he adopting several measures as instrument to resolve the  issue.    He added that last year, ASEAN attempted to file a similar  resolution. Unfortunately, it was not tackled because there  were other more important issues on the agenda.    At the same time, the member countries agreed to consider  the  possibility of holding dialogues with the International Trade  Secretariats (ITS) to diffuse the tension between the parties.    ITS are countries or group of countries that regulate or  determine which imports could enter their market.    If standards of the ITS are not met, they can impose trade  sanctions, either by reducing the quota or banning the  importation of products from the countries that have not  complied with the conditions.</p>

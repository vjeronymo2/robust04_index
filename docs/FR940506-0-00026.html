			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Objection To Posting the Amount of Operationally Available Capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> TGPL requests rehearing of the requirement to post the actual quantity of unscheduled capacity. It contends the posting of detailed information on unscheduled capacity will serve only to reduce the value of interruptible and firm service, because potential shippers can use the unscheduled capacity information to demand the lowest price for the capacity. It asserts the regulatory obligation to post interruptible capacity could be satisfied by the pipelines simply indicating that interruptible capacity is available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission denies TGPL's rehearing request. The Working Groups reached a consensus agreement to provide unscheduled capacity, and TGPL is the only party raising an objection. Moreover, a marker indicating that interruptible capacity is available is not sufficient to comport with the regulatory requirement to post available capacity. Under the Commission's open access regulations, pipelines cannot withhold available capacity, and shippers, therefore, have the right to know the amount of capacity available. Moreover, shippers need to know the amount of interruptible capacity available in order to make a reasonable determination of whether interruptible service is sufficient for their needs or whether they need to seek released firm service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Derivation of the Estimates of Operationally Available Capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Order No. 563, the Commission stated that the data for operationally available capacity could be estimates, and left to the Working Groups the issue of whether an additional field would be needed to describe how the estimates were derived. Working Groups 1 &amp; 2 reached agreement that a new field was not needed. They suggest a good faith effort by each pipeline to provide a commercially reasonable estimate using internally consistent methods is sufficient. The Commission, therefore, will not require the additional field at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Unsubscribed Firm Capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> KGPC requests clarification that the Commission's reference in Order No. 563 to pipelines' posting their available firm capacity in the offer data set does not require any change in its current practices for posting its available firm capacity. KGPC states that, because it is a grid system with thousands of receipt and delivery points, it cannot post in the offer data set the myriad configurations of firm capacity paths that might be available. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Instead, it states that it posts on its EBB the capacity available at each point and the subscribed capacity at each point. Potential shippers then request possible combinations of capacity paths, and if KGPC determines firm capacity is available along these paths, the resulting firm service will be posted in the capacity offer section of the EBB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The offer data sets would require the pipeline to define the points between which the capacity is being offered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1000 GMT on 1 March carries in its  regular 5-minute newscast several more reports on the fighting  in the Republic. Reception is fair.    The Bosnia-Herzegovina 3d Corps Information Center reports  that "the peace agreement between the Croatian and the  Bosnia-Herzegovina sides which, to judge by yesterday's air  raids by the chetnik air force and the shelling of Zavidovici  and Bugojno, is a thorn in the side of Karadzic's Serbs, has  generally been holding. The ustasha who do not want peace  yesterday violated the cease-fire in the Busovaca region, where  they fired one explosive device from the direction of Zega at  Duboki Potok. They fired with a portable rocket launcher at the  Gornji Vakuf defense lines. The ustasha snipers opened fire from  Relej in the Novi Travnik area at the fire brigade that was  putting out the fire caused by the chetnik air raid. The fire  was eventually put out and there were no casualties. The ustasha  violated the peace in the Vitez region with sporadic small arms  fire at the defense lines. By the way, as part of the gradual  implementation of the peace agreement, yesterday the experts  from the UN Protection Force entered Stari Vitez and started  clearing the mine fields around the access points to this town.  The next move should be the erecting of checkpoints between  Stari Vitez and Zenica. There were no ustasha attacks in the  area of Zepca, but they have been cooperating with the chetniks  in their own way. They have simply turned over most of the  dominant and strategically important facilities around  Zavidovici to the chetnik aggressor."    Reporting from Kalesija, Abdulah Ridjanovic says that  "fierce  aggressor's artillery attacks against the defense lines and the  free territory continued yesterday. Over 200 shells were fired.  The Tuzla airport was also targeted with tanks and howitzers, as  was the village of Donje Vukovije, where large material damage  was inflicted."    In his report from Zvornik, Nijaz Banjanovic says that  "yesterday afternoon the chetniks from Klisa, Kitovnice, and  Parloge launched a heavy artillery attack on the free Zvornik  territory. Tanks, howitzers, and mortars landed on the  civilians of Zaseok, Nezuk, and Kobilice. One woman was killed  in the shelling. The night passed in provocative fire with  antiaircraft weapons and small arms at the defense lines, while  this morning the sniper activity from the surrounding hills has  intensified against civilians."</p>

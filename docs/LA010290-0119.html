			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> NCAA TO MOVE INTO NEW HQ IN FEB.  </P> <P> The National Collegiate Athletic Assn. plans to move into its new headquarters  in Overland Park, Kan., in February, but the visitors' center in the building  won't be open until September, officials say.  </P> <P> The association's executives had hoped to announce the NCAA national basketball  tournament pairings at the new visitors' center in March. But design of video  displays and other items in the center have taken longer than expected, Rich  Hunter, NCAA director of operations, said.  </P> <P> "It's a highly technical area," Hunter said. "There are going to be a lot of  interactive computer videos. The design of those things and how they fit into  the space is something that has delayed the opening."  </P></p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Small companies A pan-European market for smaller company shares of the type being discussed by Nasdaq, the US market, is an attractive idea. Institutions tend to be interested in the minnows only at the top of the investment cycle, so retail investors are required to underpin liquidity. Yet no single European country has a deep enough pool of retail money to allow the lower echelons of national markets to flourish. Harnessing interest across Europe might provide enough liquidity to replicate the success of Nasdaq in the US. But in practice it is not clear that European investors have the same enthusiasm for equities as their US peers. And though the technology to run such a market is available, persuading national exchanges to back the venture will be hard. The London Stock Exchange for one is determined to go it alone. Even if a number of existing markets could be convinced in principle, ticklish problems of accounting harmonisation and regulation would have to be overcome. None of this amounts to an argument against trying to establish such a market. But there are powerful reasons to doubt whether it is an idea whose time has come.</p>

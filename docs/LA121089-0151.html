			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EWING FLEXES MUSCLES AND CELTICS LOOK LIKE 92-POINT WEAKLINGS  </P> <P> Most basketball experts expected powerful Patrick Ewing to become a dominant  force soon after he entered the NBA.  </P> <P> When the 7-0 center of the New York Knicks failed to show any tendency to take  charge in four seasons, many figured he never would.  </P> <P> They should have waited just a bit longer.  </P> <P> The former Georgetown standout has finally, in his fifth season, become a  force.  </P> <P> Ewing took over in the third quarter Saturday night at New York, broke open a  close battle and led his team to a 124-92 romp over the Boston Celtics.  </P> <P> The Celtics, who beat the Knicks Wednesday night at Boston despite 32 points,  nine rebounds and three blocks for Ewing, had just pulled to within 49-48 on a  rally to open the second half.  </P> <P> Nine minutes later, the Knicks were cruising, 81-64. Ewing had scored 19 points  in the nine minutes and completely turned the game around.  </P> <P> The victory gave the Knicks a 12-7 record and a 1 1/2-game lead in the Atlantic  Division.  </P> <P> Ewing played 36 minutes, and in the other 27 minutes he had only seven points.  He also had eight rebounds. Robert Parish, the Celtics' 36-year-old center, got  in foul trouble trying to stay with Ewing and played only 16 minutes.  </P> <P> "I did more watching than playing in this game," Parish said. "When I went out,  Ewing just went crazy."  </P> <P> Larry Bird had 25 points and 10 rebounds for the Celtics, who have won only  three games in the last three years on the road against teams with better than  .500 records.  </P> <P> Detroit 121, Indiana 93 -- The Pistons, still angry over a loss Friday night at  Philadelphia, took it out on the Pacers at Auburn Hills, Mich.  </P> <P> The upstart Pacers, the surprise of the NBA early season, never had a chance.  They fell behind early and by halftime were out of it, trailing, 59-38.  </P> <P> The Pistons' backcourt of Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars simply took command.  Thomas had 20 of his 30 in the first half, and Dumars finished with 24. Between  them they made 25 of their 36 shots from the field.  </P> <P> The Pistons ended the Pacers' five-game winning streak and cut their lead in  the Central Division to half a game.  </P> <P> Chicago 125, Philadelphia 105 -- Speaking of players who can control a game, of  course, brings to mind Michael Jordan.  </P> <P> Jordan scored 15 of his 29 points in the third quarter at Chicago and the Bulls  coasted to their sixth win in the last eight games.  </P> <P> While Jordan was having a big game, which included nine rebounds and nine  assists, the 76ers' two big men weren't.  </P> <P> Charles Barkley, recovering from a virus, had only six points and played just  20 minutes.  </P> <P> Rick Mahorn, who turned in an emotional performance in the victory over the  Pistons Friday night, was flat. He was one for five and had eight rebounds in  27 minutes.  </P> <P> Denver 106, Charlotte 93 -- Alex English, who has been complaining about a lack  of playing time, produced 25 points in 38 minutes at Charlotte.  </P> <P> The Nuggets, who have won nine of their last 11 games, led almost all the way  and handed the Hornets their seventh loss in a row.  </P> <P> "I hope this means I will get more playing time," said English, who was 11 for  17 from the field. "I know I can still help this club. I'm all excited about  the way we are playing. When you play an expansion or second-year team, you  have to keep the pressure on."  </P> <P> Atlanta 104, Minnesota 91 -- With his Hawks held even at home for a half by the  Timberwolves, Dominique Wilkins decided to go to work.  </P> <P> Wilkins scored seven of his 33 points in a 13-0 run that opened the second half  as the Hawks won their sixth in a row.  </P> <P> San Antonio 109, New Jersey 92 -- David Robinson continues to play like a  veteran and the Spurs are hot.  </P> <P> The rookie center had 26 points at San Antonio to lead the Spurs to their sixth  consecutive victory.  </P> <P> The Nets, who upset Houston Friday night, made a game of it until the third  quarter, when Robinson had 12 points and the Spurs built an 88-69 lead.  </P> <P> Utah 104, Houston 90 -- The Rockets, who fell apart at home against the Nets,  didn't improve at Salt Lake City.  </P> <P> The Jazz held the Rockets to eight points in the first quarter and with their  one-two punch of Karl Malone and John Stockton setting the pace, it was a romp.  </P> <P> Malone had 25 points and 14 rebounds, and Stockton had 16 points and 10  assists.  </P> <P> Cleveland 108, Sacramento 101 -- Larry Nance came back just in time to help the  beleaguered Cavaliers.  </P> <P> Nance, who missed the first 17 games because of foot surgery, scored 12 of his  14 points in the fourth quarter at Sacramento to bring the Cavaliers from  behind.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers, who are without center Brad Daugherty, had lost five in a row.

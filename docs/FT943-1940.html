			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / US clamps down on violence by Haitian police The US signalled a sharp switch of policy in its mission to restore democracy to Haiti when it authorised its troops to use force last night to halt violence by Haitian police. The change in its rules of operations came a day after US troops had been forced to look on without intervening as police clubbed to death a man taking part in a demonstration against Lt Gen Raoul Cedras, leader of the republic's military junta. Further cases of violence, including the shooting of a child by a Haitian paramilitary, were reported yesterday. President Bill Clinton condemned police brutality yesterday, saying 'such violence cannot and will not be tolerated'. He added: 'Our armed forces cannot and will not become Haiti's police force. But they can work to see that the Haitian military and police operate in a responsible and professional manner.' Mr Clinton said more than 1,000 military police had arrived on the island yesterday. Meanwhile, US troops began dismantling the Haitian military's heavy weapons unit. The Camp D'Application military base outside Port-au-Prince is to be jointly occupied by an American Special Forces battalion and by Haitian soldiers, and the US forces will train Haiti's police in riot and crowd control. Haitian radio reported that the so-called attaches, or militia, would be disarmed, starting today. Earlier, Haiti's exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide appealed for calm and announced the formation of a transition team to pave the way for his return before October 15. In a striking reversal from the frosty tone of his statement on Tuesday, Mr Aristide also thanked the US for its actions. He urged the people of Haiti to 'be vigilant and guard against provocation', and called on Haitian elected officials to resume their offices in preparation for his return to power. After being briefed by top US military officials on the progress of the US occupation, Mr Aristide told his supporters at home: 'In less than 24 days I will join you in Haiti. Then we will continue working as peacemakers, peacekeepers and peace lovers.' He warned that the success of the US mission was 'directly tied to the process of disarmament' of the Haitian military and paramilitary forces. Gen Hugh Shelton, the US commander, said 'the co-operation, the teamwork (between US and Haitian soldiers) has just been splendid'.

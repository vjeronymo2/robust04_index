			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Debt workout dangers Norman Lamont's analysis, in his speech on Friday, of the various deceptive quick fixes for getting around, or out of, the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) constraints should be read in full. It can be obtained from HM Treasury Press Office, Parliament Street, London SW1P 3AG. Tel. 071-270 5238; Fax 270 5244. Mr Lamont is enough of a politician to know how much he is putting himself out on a limb and that the official Treasury would not hesitate to leave him as a scapegoat if it changed its mind about the appropriate policy regime. I shall say nothing more about the ERM until after the Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday, and instead turn to a problem that could weaken the whole industrial world and, with it, debilitate the ex-Communist countries and the third world as well. This is an aspect of the debt problem. It is often said that recovery is held back because people and businesses prefer, whenever they receive some cash, to reduce debt rather than buy more goods and services. The problem is acute in the US and Japan and therefore cannot be blamed on the ERM. The nature of the threat is little understood. If it were just a question of people wanting to get their indebtedness down while incomes remain the same, before resuming normal purchases, it would not be the end of the world. Economic growth never has been and never will be an entirely smooth process. But it could be worse. Let us take a closer look at the process of repaying debt. Is it just working off the excesses of the previous boom? It would be easy to understand the need for it if there had been great physical mal-investment in the wrong industries or processes - the extreme example being the obsolescent and polluting plants in the ex-Communist states. I have to pinch myself, however, to see excess debt in a similar light - why people should be unemployed and capacity unused because of entries on balance sheets. A possible reason is moral hazard. If imprudent, or even just unlucky, borrowers are always to be bailed out by official policy, they would have every incentive to do it again, which can hardly be good for the long-run development of the economy. The purpose of leaving people to work through their own debt is to teach them that there is no such thing as free or riskless credit. There is, however, a precise way in which the debt workouts can go too far. One person's spending is another person's income. If I cut down my spending too far, your income is reduced and with it your ability to service your debt, which in turn will hit your expenditure. A cumulative downward process  -which might be called the debt repayment multiplier - is thus a possibility. If it were to happen, it would not necessarily show up fully in the savings ratio, as incomes would be reduced as well - a subtlety that is usually missed. We are talking of dangers not actualities. There is little sign of such a downward multiplier in operation. There are plenty of cushions which normally prevent it. Moreover, it is normal at the end of every recession for some people to fear that the economy is entering a new long-term depression just when it is about to turn upwards. The OECD Economic Outlook showed that gross national product (GNP) in the main industrial countries has risen by an estimated 5 per cent per annum in nominal terms in the first half of 1992. By no standards is this a cumulative downward spiral. Those who think otherwise still suffer from the delusion that governments have the power to manage demand in real terms, irrespective of what happens to prices and pay. Even after Britain's anti-inflation success, the underlying RPI has still only moved down to 4.8 per cent per annum - enough to take up nearly all of a normal 5 per cent increase in spending, leaving little room for real growth. It is always wise to be prepared. The boy who was disbelieved because he cried 'wolf' too often would have been better employed drawing a sketch so that his family would have known what to look out for. What is lacking among the leaders of the Group of Seven is a recognition of their responsibility to maintain - but not to inflate - world demand in nominal terms. This may not be easy, if people react perversely to such stimuli by saving all the more. There could in the end be a need for New Deal strategies which might guarantee certain kinds of credit. But we are far from being there yet. So far, the G7 leaders have not even recognised their responsibility for managing nominal demand jointly. The ones who talk about demand and growth - mainly the Americans - forget the little word 'nominal' and still believe that they can influence directly the real economy. But many of the others do not seem to recognise any responsibility for demand management and have thrown out the Keynesian baby with the bathwater. We all need to get out our sketch-books and look out for wolves.</p>

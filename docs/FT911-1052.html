			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: New charge card issued by Deutsche Bank DEUTSCHE Bank, Germany's leading financial institution, is launching a new plastic card in association with the German Tennis Association, in further signs of new life being injected into the domestic bank card market. While cash and cheques continue to be the Germans' preferred form of payment, there have been some important developments recently, indicating competition in the realm of bank cards is sharpening up. Since the beginning of the year, the big German banks have begun issuing their own Eurocard (Mastercard) products - hitherto the preserve of a central issuing cartel - and some have started for the first time selling to customers of other banks. The cards, however, remain charge cards, with no revolving credit facility other than any arrangement clients may have with the bank. Deutsche Bank's first 'co-branding' agreement with the Tennis Association is designed to give the bank, which services some 5m customers, access to a wider field of perhaps 6m tennis players. The card, a gold Eurocard costing DM140 (Dollars 79) a year, will be marketed by the Tennis Association, and will carry the names of both institutions. Meanwhile, the German banks' recent surge of activity is putting established card issuers on their toes. American Express, for instance, recently announced that it would lower its annual fees for the green card to DM100 from DM140.</p>

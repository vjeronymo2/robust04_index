			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> THE SPIRIT TAKES ROOT;  </P> <P> HARD WORK HELPS OVERCOME NIGHTMARE UNDER TRAIN WHEELS  </P> <P> Margarito Sanchez planted more than 1,000 tomato plants last year, in between  fixing fences, growing cacti, feeding donkeys and repairing the roof of his  stepdaughter's three-bedroom home in Jamul.  </P> <P> For any other hard-working tomato farmer, it might have been just an average  year. But, for Sanchez, 39, who lost a leg and severely injured the other in a  train accident two years ago near Tijuana, it was an exceptional year.  </P> <P> Despite having to rely at times on a wheelchair and on a heavy, home-made,  wooden leg, Sanchez manages to climb trees to cut away overgrown branches,  repair water lines for neighbors and clamber up ladders to paint houses. In  December, Sanchez, a Mexican national, was granted temporary amnesty.  </P> <P> But he knows that to stay among his beloved tomato plants he will have to  convince immigration authorities that he can support himself.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fixes Everything  </P> <P> "Now, working is the principal thing, my No. 1," said Sanchez, whose temporary  amnesty expires at the end of the year. He lives with his stepdaughter, a legal  resident, and her husband, a U.S. citizen, and hopes to be granted permanent  amnesty.  </P> <P> His stepdaughter, Leticia Sullivan, said Sanchez, who grew up in Mexicali,  fixes everything around the house. "Electricity, water, he never complains . .  . . He can't stay lying around the house. He's so hyper.  </P> <P> "He's not afraid to go fishing. He goes out in a boat by himself. He built his  own room in the garage, because he wanted to live there. . . . He does  everything. He even washes his own clothes and he makes good flour tortillas."  </P> <P> Before the accident, Sanchez was a truck driver, fisherman, mechanic and  odd-job man, but his life changed forever on a set of railway tracks in the  Mexican town of La Mesa, near Tijuana, when a San Diego and Imperial Valley  Railroad engineer spotted him too late to stop the train. The freight, which  goes through Tijuana at least six times a week and makes a run to Tecate twice  a week, originates in San Diego.  </P> <P> The train tore off his right leg and pinned his left leg against the track.  Sanchez said that, if he had had a pistol, he would have shot himself, the pain  was so bad. Sanchez conceded that he was drinking the night of the accident.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Screaming and Screaming'  </P> <P> "I was screaming and screaming until I couldn't scream anymore," Sanchez said  through an interpreter. It took authorities more than an hour to free him. He  was taken to a public hospital in Tijuana where he said "they treated me really  bad, gave me a bed and that was it."  </P> <P> Both his stepdaughter's husband, Gene Sullivan -- a Los Angeles County  probation officer who lives in Jamul three days a week -- and a Spring Valley  chiropractor who later treated Sanchez speculate that he drank until he passed  out on the tracks. Leticia Sullivan thinks someone slipped something in one of  her stepfather's drinks.  </P> <P> Sanchez, who says he no longer drinks, believes the train was heading to  Tecate, but records show it was going the other way. Either way, follow-up care  was poor and Leticia Sullivan is bitter that doctors did not work harder to  save her stepfather's left leg.  </P> <P> From the room in Tijuana where he spent time recovering, Sanchez used a pair of  binoculars to watch illegal aliens crossing the border. A few months later,  after family friend and chiropractor James A. Wilson wrote immigration  officials saying he would treat Sanchez's injuries without charge, authorities  allowed him to enter the United States for medical care.  </P> <P> "One of the first things he did when he got here was ask me for a block of wood  so he could start carving a leg. . . . He calls it a bionic leg," Gene Sullivan  said.  </P> <P> The second thing he asked for, Sullivan recalled, was a packet of tomato seeds.  Sanchez had crossed into the United States illegally several times before to  work in the fields.  </P> <P> Since his injury, he has worked hard to make the Sullivan's two-acre plot on  Lyons Valley Road home, raising tomatoes, cacti and geraniums, and fixing  anything that needs repair.  </P> <P> Soon, Sanchez will have to tie each tomato plant so that it grows straight.  There are 900 plants now, but more will be planted. Before the harvest, when  some of the plants are 6 feet tall, Sanchez will have had to tie each plant  three times. He hand-fertilizes each plant with horse manure and, if necessary,  a handful of commercial fertilizer. Using his arms to drag himself from plant  to plant, he also picks off any bugs he sees.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sadness Is Gone  </P> <P> Asked if he harbors resentment about the accident, Sanchez said, "I don't feel  anything. The sadness is gone. The only thing I know is I cannot walk."  </P> <P> Smoking a cigarette during a break from installing a new irrigation system,  Sanchez told a visitor that he draws his strength from watching his plants grow  and bear fruit.  </P> <P> "My strength comes from my mind; the body is not as important," he said. "In  the beginning I felt bad. But working, you don't think about it. Keep busy.  It's the best thing you can do. If I'm just lying there, I'm going to think  (about) depression."  </P> <P> Wilson, the Spring Valley chiropractor who offered Sanchez his services, said:  "He's got a fighting spirit. . . . He wouldn't be here without it. He would  have been dead a long time ago. A lot of people lay down and expect society to  wait on them. He's not one of those people. He's no burden to anybody."  </P> <P> Sporting a sea-green work shirt, faded jeans and a pair of denim cutoff shorts  -- so as not to wear out the seat of his pants -- Sanchez grinned as he  remembered making a bus trip to Sacramento alone.  </P> <P> He earned enough money from the $1,200 the Sullivans took in last year -- after  selling more than 4,000 pounds of tomatoes -- to visit his sister and  brother-in-law for several months. While he was there, he took up temporary  employment in a print shop. Back in Jamul afterward, Sanchez repaired cars,  fixed washing machines, built geranium planters, erected greenhouses and pulled  down fences. From his wheelchair he even shot rabbits that dared eat his tomato  plants.  </P> <P> In his spare time, which is rare, he likes to eat a steak-and-tomato dish  called bistec ranchero, watch Western movies, read mysteries and collect hats.  He makes it to a pancake restaurant in El Cajon about once a week. He thinks  about planting watermelon, and he hopes to win the California Lottery.  </P> <P> "It's OK to lose a leg, two legs. But not your eyes," he said. "Then you cannot  see the beauty of the world."  </P></p>

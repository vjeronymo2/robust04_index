One soldier was injured in West Belfast when a  bomb was detonated as a military patrol passed along Andersonstown Park, a  Roman Catholic area, a police spokesman said. A second soldier was injured in  the northern city of Londonderry when a bomb went off in Butcher Street, also a  Catholic area. Meanwhile, in the northern village of Crumlin, police foiled a  bomb attack on an unmanned police station after opening fire on a group of  people who had been acting suspiciously, authorities said. An army expert  defused a device containing 2.2 pounds of explosive found after the men fled  from the scene. One woman was arrested at the scene.  </P></p>

This task was assigned to the Main Military Budget  and Finance Directorate.    The audit, which was carried out in a number of districts  and  at central supply and purchasing bases and industrial  enterprises in the military trading system, exposed a number of  blatant violations of existing legislation on entrepreneurial  activity, of financial and executive discipline, and of  regulations governing the conduct of trade. The wide-ranging  economic rights granted in recent years to military trade organs  in the center and provinces have not been properly exercised to  improve the quality of trade and consumer services to servicemen  and their families. The necessary radical measures to reform  the military trading system have simply not been taken.    Despite the fact that, following the Union's disintegration,  the number of enterprises has sharply decreased and the number  of personnel in the military trading system has been halved, an  unjustifiably cumbersome and ramified structure for  administering it has been preserved to this day. With the  organization of direct ties between military trade enterprises  and suppliers, many supply and purchasing bases have been left  with practically no work. But the chronic shortage of  circulating capital and the poor stocking of stores with  essential goods have not prompted the Ministry of Defense Main  Trade Directorate to cut superfluous levels or identify ways to  economize. On the contrary, administration organs'  establishments are inordinately inflated, while their staffers  -- officers and civilian personnel -- have received premiums  exceeding their basic pay in addition to their wages.    It has become the practice to hold back at bases the most  popular goods in order to sell them for less than their market  value in inflationary conditions through the trade network to a  narrow circle of people, which has caused indignation and  complaints among servicemen. Considerable sums of money have  been diverted into nontrading activities. A total of around 20  billion rubles was deposited in bank savings accounts, which  adversely affected the procurement of industrial and food goods  for sale in stores.    In all military districts and fleets instances of giving  consumers short measure and overcharging them, concealing scarce  goods, and deliberate inflation of prices have been discovered.  Overcharging occurred in one-half of the control purchases made.  These outrages were most prevalent in the Pacific Fleet, the  Siberian Military District, and the Western Group of Forces.    Work to bring down the cost of food is not being conducted  actively enough. Even when, under the defense minister's  directive No. D-34, military units and institutions are  providing the military trading system with transport, premises,  and free electricity, fuel, water, and other utilities, the cost  of food in military trade cafeterias remains very high, and in a  number of cases higher than in the open public catering network.  For example, in Volgograd Garrison (North Caucasus Military  District) prices in military trade cafeterias were 1.2-1.6 times  higher than prices in the city's cafeterias. It is no accident  that lately the number of officers and staffers using military  trade cafeterias has decreased by between one-third and one-half.    The Russian defense minister has issued an order based on  the  results of the audit of the military trading system's financial  and economic work. It notes the aforementioned and other  serious shortcomings, punishes the culprits, and outlines  radical organizational and economic measures to improve the  military trading system's activity forthwith. This question  will be discussed in the near future at a Defense Ministry  Collegium session.</p>

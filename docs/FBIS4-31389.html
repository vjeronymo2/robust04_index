			<p>BFN     [Text] A three-day visit by a Romanian delegation to our  country has resulted in the signing of three important  interstate treaties. This has confirmed our good interstate  relations, but has also opened up the possibility to extend  overall economic cooperation between the two countries. The  Romanian prime minister and members of the Romanian state  delegation also met Croatian President Franjo Tudjman.    President Tudjman and Romanian Prime Minister Vacaroiu had  talks about political relations between the two countries, the  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Croatia's occupied areas.  They dwelled in particular on efforts made by the two countries  and the international community with regard to achieving a  negotiated end to the conflicts as soon as possible, and fully  reintegrating Croatia'a occupied areas into the state and legal  system of the Republic of Croatia.    In addition, Prime Minister Vacaroiu briefed President  Tudjman on the talks being conducted between the Romanian  delegation and Croatian officials and businessmen, and also on  contracts about to be signed.    The possibilities and stimuli to the extension of  comprehensive cooperation, particularly economic, were the main  topics of the concluding round of talks between representatives  of the Croatian and Romanian Governments. On the occasion,  proposals were supported for setting up joint commissions and  contact groups, which will be tasked with considering the  establishment of larger-scale forms of economic cooperation.  This refers to the founding of mixed enterprises and joint  participation in third markets, and also to the conclusion of  treaties on free trade between the two countries.    Transport, ferrous metallurgy, shipbuilding, the power  industry, and almost all branches of light industry were  highlighted as areas of particular interest. The Romanian  partners are particularly interested in our experience in the  operations of the free zone in the port of Rijeka.    The first step in widening cooperation was made by signing  three important interstate treaties: on maritime transport, on  stimulating and protecting joint investments, and on cooperation  in health and medical science. Both prime ministers, following  the official talks, stressed the friendly relations between the  two countries and the importance of the signed treaties toward  the development of comprehensive cooperation in the areas of  science, education, culture, and sport. Prime Minister Valentic  stressed that these negotiations have opened the way to full  economic cooperation, adding:    [Begin Valentic recording] Romania is a large country in  central and eastern Europe, and an important factor for peace  and stability in Europe. Therefore, we believe that good and  friendly relations between Croatia and Romania will make a  considerable contribution toward peace in the entire region. We  have accepted with great pleasure an invitation by the president  to visit Romania, and we have set a date in September, when the  Croatian Government is to send its delegation, including a large  number of businessmen, to visit Bucharest. [end recording]    The Romanian prime minister stressed that his talks with  President Tudjman, Prime Minister Valentic, and Croatian  businessmen were very sincere, and that a mutually expressed  wish for even better cooperation in all areas would soon be  realized. Vacaroiu added that the Romanian Government wishes to  intensify its presence in resolving the crisis on the territory  of former Yugoslavia through political means, and that it urges  the observance of borders of the newly created states in this  area. Romania, according to him, wishes to join the  reconstruction of war-ravaged areas of Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Both prime ministers announced that interstate treaties on  the avoidance of double taxation and on cooperation between  chambers of economy are being drawn up. These documents are  likely to be signed during the aforementioned visit by the  Croatian delegation to Romania.</p>

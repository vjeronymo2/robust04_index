			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Markets Report: UK rate fears subside Fears of an imminent rise in UK interest rates yesterday proved unfounded as the Bank of England dealt at established rates in its daily money market operations, writes Philip Gawith. The dominant view in the market now is that a decision was taken at last week's monthly monetary meeting not to raise rates. There remains, however, a great deal of caution and uncertainty. The September short sterling contract closed at 94.08, suggesting that the market is looking for short term rates close to 6 per cent when the contract expires on September 21. Rates also remained firm in the cash market, with three-month money offered at 5.75 per cent. The last move in interest rates - the 25 basis-point cut in February - also coincided with the publication of the quarterly inflation report, which is again released today. The gloomy prognosis that the pound would be heavily sold if policy were not tightened proved unfounded. Sterling gave up all the gains it made on Friday, but was fairly steady throughout the day and ended in London at DM2.4221, from DM2.4413 on Friday. Against the dollar it was barely changed at Dollars 1.5386, from Dollars 1.5366 on Friday. The dollar held up fairly well in spite of the US launching trade sanctions proceedings against Japan. It closed against the D-Mark at DM1.5743, down from DM1.5888, and against the yen at Y98.85 from Friday's Y100.175. In New York it finished at DM1.5797 and Y99.445. The balance of opinion in UK money markets remained that the Bank of England had mishandled the Treasury bill auction last Friday. But there was also a readiness to admit that the market had been insufficiently attentive to the messages the Bank was trying to send. The Bank clearly signalled its intentions yesterday when it offered an early round of assistance after declaring a Pounds 1.1bn market shortage. The forecast was later revised to a Pounds 900m shortage, and the Bank provided Pounds 893m of assistance. Analysts said it was Bank convention to offer an early round of assistance if the shortage was greater than Pounds 1bn. It could have kept the market in suspense by forecasting a lower shortage and then delaying when it first offered assistance. Although last Friday's flurry of concern has now largely subsided, there is anxiety that this Friday's Treasury bill tender will see a repeat performance. Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at brokers GNI, said: 'The signal they are trying to send the market is that the Treasury bill tender is not an instrument of monetary policy. But I am afraid that the market is not getting the message.' This was shown by the three-month sterling LIBOR rate staying at 5.75 per cent, and the poor performance of short sterling. Although the September contract finished 13 basis points firmer at 94.08, traders said they had expected it to trade closer to 94.20. The December contract improved marginally to finish at 93.30 from 93.27. Volumes in the futures market were fairly good - the September contract traded 28,371 lots and December 32,109 - but a long way short of Friday's record levels. Mr Robert Thomas, head of research at NatWest Markets, said the continued high level of rates in the money market showed two things. First, that it was not possible for the Bank to immediately douse the run-up in interest rate expectations at the end of last week. Second, the market believes that a tightening of policy is inevitable - if not now, then at least fairly soon. The US currency held up fairly well in spite of the sanctions announcement. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America, said the key issue was that the policy of the US Administration now seemed to be structured towards a stronger dollar. He commented: 'The market is now happy in the idea that the White House does not want to see a weaker dollar.' Against this background, Mr Hawkins said: 'If the authorities were to invoke sanctions anyway, they could be seen as an alternative to a strong yen, not as a compliment.' Taking a less sanguine view was Mr Malcolm Barr, international economist at Chemical Bank. He said that although there had been a clear desire between the US and Japan to reach an agreement, the market had not fully considered the implications of sanctions. This would almost certainly involve the repatriation of funds by Japanese investors from the US, with negative implications both for markets and the dollar. The D-Mark was fairly firm in Europe, though attention was mostly elsewhere. The lira remained weak against a background of political uncertainty in Italy. The currency finished at L1,003 per D-Mark, off a low for the day of L1,008.75. German call money rates fell back to 5 per cent, from 5.50/5.75 per cent on Friday. Banks said the month-end liquidity squeeze had not been as severe as in recent months. The repo rate is currently fixed at 4.85 per cent.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Plan to protect home shoppers Brussels proposed a battery of rules yesterday to protect shoppers as companies turn to high-tech ploys such as 'dial-up' television commercials to sell goods in the home instead of the high street, Reuter reports from Brussels. Common rules for all EC countries will boost consumer protection as the 'distance-selling' business expands and households face a barrage of offers to buy goods by mail, phone or fax machine, a Commission spokesman told reporters. Among the proposals would be a seven-day cooling off period in which the consumer could decide to pull out of a purchase contract settled by credit card or other means. Companies which offer goods on television, for example, would have to ensure they were delivered within 30 days.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Chairman of French bank sees sale by end of 1995 Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French banking group, could be ready for privatisation by the end of next year, according to Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman. 'We should be able to think about privatisation towards the end of 1995, but first the bank needs to be put on a profitable footing,' said Mr Peyrelevade, who last week announced details of an emergency FFr44.9bn (Dollars 7.8bn) financial rescue package for Credit Lyonnais and also disclosed that the group last year made a FFr6.9bn net loss. The French government's rationale for backing the rescue, which includes a FFr4.9bn cash injection from the state and other shareholders together with the transfer of FFr40bn of property loans to a new company, was to prepare Credit Lyonnais for privatisation. But the scale of the restructuring has sparked a political row. A number of politicians have already called for an official inquiry into the management of Credit Lyonnais, including Mr Francois d'Aube, a conservative who wrote a controversial book on the bank entitled Argent Sale, or Dirty Money. The French government last night declined to comment on speculation that Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, who chaired Credit Lyonnais from 1988 to last November, was to be dismissed from his new post as chairman of Credit National, a smaller state-controlled banking group. Mr Haberer, who orchestrated an aggressive policy of international expansion and lending at Credit Lyonnais, has been widely blamed for the bank's problems. He issued a statement yesterday calling for an inquiry into the management of Credit Lyonnais and claimed that he had been subjected to 'a real media lynching' over his role.</p>

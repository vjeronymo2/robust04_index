			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Arts: Cat on a Hot Tin Roof - Theatre The Birmingham Stage Company at the reopened Old Rep Theatre has staged a fine production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof for its first birthday. The Old Rep will soon be enjoying the same success as the folks up at the New Rep. The Old Rep is a middle-sized traditionally shaped theatre from 1913, England's first specifically designed repertory. Tennessee Williams (1911-1983) was barely talking then, but he has made up for it with this wordy play, a companion to Streetcar (1947) and The Night of the Iguana (1961). Williams changed the ending for the Broadway director, Elia Kazan: 'I was fearful that I would lose his interest if I didn't re-examine the script from his point of view' he wrote coyly about rewriting in 1955. But the Birmingham director Graeme Messer opts for the original unaltered version. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is quintessential Williams; it has heat, claustrophobia, lusty and vigorous characters at odds with life, and plenty of bourbon. Maggie and Brick are stuck in a sexless marriage, she is lithe and sexy, while he is uninterested and alcoholic. The action runs throughout one evening on the family plantation where Brick's father, the old patriarch Big Daddy, is dying of cancer. Who will get the 28,000 acres of fertile Delta land when Big Daddy dies? It takes alchemy to make steamy Mississippi from a wet night in Birmingham. Only the cicadas are missing. The simple set catches the feel of the plantation and Williams' wonderful stage informality. 'Anything else I can think of? Ah yes, fanlights,' he writes in his stage directions. The acting is patchy, but there are three highlights. Sandra Reinton as Maggie makes a very fine professional debut: she has poise, presence and an ability to make the passion believable. Opposite her, Marcus D'Amico as Brick plays the cool husband who turns marriage into a test of will and life into a battle with the bottle. He manages to pitch this difficult character exactly, part honest, part feckless, wholly drunk. Big Daddy (Burl Ives in the Broadway premiere) is well played by Barry Stanton, by turns passionate and sentimental: 'Hold on to your life. There's nothing else to hold on to.' The brilliance of Williams is his ability to create tension out of loosely paced action and the easy drawl of his characters. If the direction here were more relaxed, the play would benefit.

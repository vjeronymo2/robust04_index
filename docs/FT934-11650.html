			<p>931030 FT  30 OCT 93 / MPs give support to women priests MPs yesterday voted overwhelmingly in favour of the ordination of women priests in the Church of England, in spite of opposition from three government ministers. If the measure is approved by the Lords it could come into force early next year. Ministers who opposed the measure were Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, and Miss Ann Widdecombe, employment minister.</p>

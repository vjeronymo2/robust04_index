			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Revived Major targets spending Mr John Major last night sought to capitalise on the recent upturn in his fortunes within the Tory party with the promise of a renewed squeeze on public spending to pave the way for income tax cuts. In a confident end-of-term address to Tory MPs, the prime minister pledged to put 'clear water' between the Conservatives and Labour before the general election due by mid 1997. Confirming the rightwards tilt in his political strategy, Mr Major said the government would begin preparations for its election manifesto as early as this autumn. Policy committees would be established to reconnect the party's priorities with the preoccupations of its grass-roots supporters. His comments, ahead of a planned cabinet reshuffle within the next two weeks, attracted strong applause from a packed audience of backbench MPs. In spite of a sideswipe against the extreme Thatcherites who have suggested that the party needs a period of opposition to restore its ideological fervour, the general view on the Tory right was that Mr Major had heeded warnings not to fight Labour for the political centre ground. Erstwhile enemies on the Euro-sceptic right said the prime minister had further diminished the prospect of an autumn leadership challenge. Anticipating the election of Mr Tony Blair as Labour leader, Mr Major said his aim would be to give clearer definition and distinction to the Tory message. That meant a 'compact' legislative programme for the next session of parliament in the autumn focusing on a number of key priorities. Mr Major described Mr Blair as 'one of those politicians who likes climbing up the ladder of opportunity but kicking it down for others'. He gave no timetable for the implementation of tax cuts but MPs at the meeting said he left the deliberate impression that some reduction would be possible before the next election. The prime minister indicated that those lower down the income scale would be the first beneficiaries of a reduction in the tax burden. Foreshadowing another cabinet battle over priorities in this autumn's spending negotiations, Mr Major said that the Pounds 15bn which the government had cut last November from spending plans over the next three years was not enough. The cash targets set in the November Budget would be further reduced. Mr Major also said he would continue to press the case for a flexible rather than centralised European Union. He dismissed as 'futile' arguments over whether Britain should be in Europe's fast or slow lanes insisting that 'people cannot be taken too far or too fast in a direction they are instinctively loathe to go'. Instead Britain would insist Europe took the 'right track'. Joe Rogaly, Page 16</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Letter: Consultants in DTI scheme are capable Sir, Sarah Hegarty ('Consultancy and fool's gold', August 18) does considerable disservice to the DTI's Enterprise Initiative Scheme. I am sure most small and medium-sized enterprises using the scheme have found that the quality of consultancies reflects not only the quality of the consultant but also their own commitment to, and involvement in, the exercise. Any director or manager who thinks he can lie back and be 'cured' by a consultant will be disillusioned. Successful consultancy on a smaller scale is a partnership between willing participants. The key elements of successful consulting with smaller companies are painstaking briefing, close collaboration and scaling objectives to the capabilities of the client. He, in turn, must enter the relationship knowing that he has to take up the issues raised after the consultant has left. The selection and management of consultants are, rightly, rigorous. We are competent and often highly qualified, and deserve better from your newspaper. Brian Mascall, Lanchester Consultants, 47 Fairfax Road, Teddington, Middlesex TW11 9DA</p>

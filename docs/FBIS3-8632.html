Three of the attacks were on the Teslic front, south of  Doboj, where the Moslems disregarded their festival of Bairam  and engaged in strong offensive activities against the Serb  positions.    Another abortive attack was launched on the south sector of  the Trebava front, east of Doboj, which the Serbs beat back,  suffering no casualties in the process.    Yet another futile effort to break through the Serb defence  lines was undertaken on the western sector of the Ozren front,  south of Doboj. Here, the Serbs also neutralised a Moslem  terrorist group in an attempt to be infiltrated behind Bosnian  Serb lines.    Serb villages on Mt. Ozren were subjected to strong  small-arms fire by Moslem forces, which have been observed to be  regrouping.    One Serb soldier was wounded by Croat small-arms fire from  the direction of Orasje in the north after midnight, Serb  military sources said.    Bosnian Serb positions were exposed to provocations also  elsewhere in the Sava River basin during the night, but did not  respond.    The Bosnian Serb army command in Herzegovina reported  reduced  Moslem operations and only sporadic fire from small-arms and  anti-aircraft guns from the direction of Gorazde in the east.    In the coming days, Moslems are likely to launch assaults on  Cajnice, Ustikolina and Kalinovik in the southeast and Borci in  central Bosnia, the source said and attributed the present  comparative lull in the fighting to the Bairam festival.</p>

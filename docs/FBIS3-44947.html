			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Yesterday [5 January] Gansu Radio held a  meeting in Lanzhou on 1994 press and propaganda work.  Provincial party Secretary Yan Haiwang, Acting Governor Zhang  Wule, provincial party Deputy Secretary Sun Ying, and Shi  Zhongyuan, chief of the Provincial Party Committee's Propaganda  Department, attended the meeting. [passage omitted]    Secretary Yan Haiwang pointed out: In press and propaganda  work, prominence should be given to the main theme of  patriotism, collectivism, and socialism.    [Begin Yan recording] Broadcasting and television constitute  an important front in our ideology and propaganda and are an  important component of our party's ideological and political  work. The task for the next step is becoming heavier, like those  on other fronts. This is because since the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics should  be implemented with great strides. In particular, next year  will see the biggest step in reform measures over the the last  15 years concerning the establishment of the socialist market  economic structure. We can also forecast that next year's  economic development rate will be the fastest.    But we are facing complex problems and there are many new  situations, maybe we will encounter many new problems. The  deeper the reform, the more serious the frictions between new  and old structures and between long-term and immediate or local  interests. Our broadcasting and television, the entire media, as  well as the ideological and propaganda front, are facing the  heavy task of how to comply with central requirements in  controlling the orientation of the media and giving prominence  to the main themes. It is also an arduous task to propagate the  party's policies and principles more extensively and more  correctly, and to use new, inspiring things emerging in reform  and economic construction to educate the masses and boost mass  and cadre confidence and enthusiasm. Apart from party  committees, which should guide, protect, and bring into play  cadre and mass initiative in reform and economic construction,  all entire ideological work should also engage in this, and it  should be regarded as the most important task in ideological  work. Everyone should further emancipate their minds and  continue to display the fine tradition of hard struggle. I  believe we will fulfill our work better and make greater  contributions to the development of Gansu's trades and  undertakings. [end Yan recording]</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> JIMMY HEATH QUARTET AT EL CAMINO COLLEGE  </P> <P> Though it was not to be expected that Jimmy Heath's Quartet would fill the  spacious Marsee Hall at El Camino College Thursday evening, what could be  anticipated was a program of music diversified enough to sustain the interest  and reaffirm the reputation of the 63-year-old tenor saxophonist.  </P> <P> With them were his brother Tootie on drums, Ben Brown on bass and guitarist  Tony Purrone, who for 12 years has been a virtual adopted brother of the  musical Heath family.  </P> <P> Heath's warm tone and personal vibrato placed him in a middle ground,  post-Dexter Gordon but pre-John Coltrane. He brought buoyancy and spirit to "On  the Trail," "Hi Fly" and his own composition "Sassy Samba" (written 10 years  ago and dedicated to Sarah Vaughan).  </P> <P> Variety was assured through Heath's occasional use of flute or soprano sax (the  latter most effectively on "Round Midnight"), and by the always remarkable  facility of Purrone, one of the most underrated guitarists on the  mainstream-modern front.  </P> <P> Ben Brown played a hand-held electric bass that was almost all neck and no  body, producing a heavy, thudding sound, though his ideas at times transcended  the instrument's built-in handicap. He and everyone else reached a zenith of  excitement on the Sonny Red tune "Bluesville."  </P> <P> Tootie Heath, always a propulsive and sensitive drummer, displayed some  dazzling brushwork on "Heart House."  </P> <P> Jimmy Heath, now regularly active as a teacher and clinician, conducted a  workshop for El Camino earlier in the day. The concert offered proof of the  eloquence with which he can still practice what he preaches. LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

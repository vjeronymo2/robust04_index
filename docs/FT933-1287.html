			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Swissair reveals loss in report on merger SWISSAIR, which is in the middle of intense negotiations on co-operation with three other European airlines, has published consolidated interim accounts for the first time. They reveal a loss of SFr65m (Dollars 46.1m). The airline prepared the figures to present to financial analysts. However, the sensitivity of the negotiations with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System and Austrian Airlines forced the cancellation of the presentation. The four airlines were due to sign a memorandum of understanding on the so-called Alcazar project by the middle of this month. The negotiations, however, have run into difficulty on three issues: the location of a head office; the selection of a US partner airline; and the valuations of each airline. Also, Austrian is still considering whether or not to ally itself with Germany's Lufthansa instead of with Alcazar. Fresh opposition to Alcazar has arisen in the Swiss financial community this week on the grounds that the proposed shareholdings undervalue Swissair's financial strength. Swissair has replied that analysts must take into account two prospective competitive disadvantages it faces: being outside the EC, and facing increasingly severe aircraft movement restrictions at its home airport in Zurich. Swissair revealed that its flight operations in the first half lost SFr43m, its hotel business lost SFr22m, and its catering and other activities were at break-even. Last month, it reported a first-half parent company loss of SFr125m. This suggests it made about SFr60m on aircraft sales. The consolidated balance sheet at June 30 showed total assets of SFr9.19bn, financed by SFr2.8bn of shareholders' funds and SFr5.6bn of debt. Swissair said it continued to hope to break even in the full year.</p>

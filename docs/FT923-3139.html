			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Martial music sets scene for No vote rally: Nationalist sentiment and Gaullist values are swelling the anti-Maastricht camp IN A futuristic structure on the edge of a Paris science theme park, resembling a huge indoor tennis court, giant TV screens carrying anti-Maastricht slogans, a 6,000-strong rattle-waving audience and stereophonic martial music set the scene for a three-hour demagogic spectacular in France's European union referendum battle. It was the first time since the beginning of the campaign that the three musketeers of the rejectionist camp  - Philippe Seguin, the neo-Gaullist intellectual, Charles Pasqua the Gaullist traditionalist and former interior minister and Philippe de Villiers, a dynamic young centrist member of parliament  - had shared a platform together. A roar welcomed them as the search-lights picked them up. To dispel the impression that all the support was coming from the regimented faithful, bussed-in from around Paris and the provinces, if not the French overseas territories, a cohort of ageing former political dignitaries were massed in serried ranks behind the speaker's pulpit. That some were still alive would have been sufficient reason for the acclaim they received. They included Mr Maurice Couve de Murville, General de Gaulle's veteran foreign minister and short-lived prime minister, Mr Michel Poniatowski, former President Giscard d'Estaing's unpopular interior minister and, of course, Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, the incarnation of his father's combat for French national independence and sovereignty. It came as no surprise that all the speakers should extol these typically Gaullist values as being radically opposed to centralised government from Brussels by faceless international technocrats, who could only see their powers enhanced by the Maastricht treaty. 'What stopped Hitler?' Mr de Villiers asked. 'The British nation and the French nation embodied in the Resistance. Every time an attempt is made to suppress the nation, it provokes a popular revolution.' In spite of the vociferous xenophobic reactions of the militants in the hall, the speakers did their best to distinguish opposition to the Maastricht treaty from opposition to the European Community. 'We love France and we want to construct Europe,' Mr Pasqua said. 'But we feel strongly that, with the Maastricht treaty, we have to choose one or the other. It is no longer a question of pooling or associating our efforts. What we are being asked to do is to merge and to integrate, that is to water down and divide our national contributions.' In spite of some sarcastic references to Mr John Major, the British prime minister, for allegedly urging the French people to vote 'yes' to Maastricht while himself refusing to commit Britain to economic and monetary union, the British government's attitude to European co-operation was held up as an example to be followed. Mr Major, Mr Pasqua maintained confidently, would be ready to sign a new treaty. 'We have to admit that a treaty of Oxford or Cambridge, without any technocratic elements but with a greater democratic content and providing for an opening to eastern Europe, would be a different matter altogether and might be something in which we could believe.' Mr Seguin, for his part, extolled the virtues of a common, as distinct from a single currency, co-existing with national currencies, on the lines proposed by Mr Major and Mr Edouard Balladur, the former French finance minister. However, the organisers of the meeting could not hide the fact that their objective was by no means confined to sinking the Maastricht treaty  - 'this indigestible pudding', in the words of Mr Pasqua. Constant chants by the militants of 'Mitterrand, fous le camp]' ('Mitterrand, get out') were a clear indication of the difficulty that voters have in separating European and domestic political issues in this referendum. 'Our opposition to the treaty and our opposition to the socialist government springs from the same principles,' Mr Seguin said with frankness. 'Moreover, we are not naive. We know only too well how much a victory of the Yes vote would profit Mr Mitterrand. The ratification of the Maastricht treaty would be above all his victory. In the eyes of history, it would erase all the errors of the past. That is for us another major reason to vote No.' For many French people, it has become increasingly clear, that will be the principal reason for their negative vote.</p>

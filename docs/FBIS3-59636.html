A simple and, moreover, inexpensive  method has now been developed at the Dortmund Institute of  Hygiene.    "I might well imagine that Germany's dual system will soon  not just cost money, but even yield profits." With this rather  unusual prognosis, Prof. Harry Rosin, the head of the Dortmund  Institute of Hygiene, summed up the advantages of a new process  for recycling plastics, electronic scrap, and composite  packaging materials. The trick to turning "Gelbe Tonnen"  [recyclable] waste into recyclable secondary raw materials that  are nearly completely sorted into categories is supposed to be:  deep freezing to -160&deg;C.    The "Dortmund mixture," consisting of gaseous hydrocarbons  and which Rosin has already successfully recommended as a  refrigerant free of chlorine and fluorine for refrigerators, is  also to be put to use in the form of a similar compound for the  treatment of waste. Propane, ethane, and methane take care of  the removal of heat--even from a container filled with plastic  waste.    The characteristics of the materials are known: Propane  liquefies at -42&deg;C, ethane at -88&deg;C, and methane at  -161.4&deg;C. Each of these materials--this is the principle the  process is based on-- vaporizes in separate cycles, extracts  heat from the surrounding area, and is reliquefied. In the  process, the liquefier of the lower degree of cold is cooled by  the vaporizer of the higher degree of cold until a temperature  of -160&deg;C is reached.    Rosin is convinced that at this temperature any plastic,  even  unmanagealbe teflon, becomes brittle, like thin glass. The  temperature at which the most commonly used plastics become  glasslike is about -110&deg;C. The various materials become  brittle at different temperatures, which causes composite  materials to fall apart or break up during the cooling process.  Metals in electronic scrap would almost break away from the  plastic by themselves because of the different expansion  coefficients alone.    In any case, it is anticipated that a simpler way of  crushing  the material that consumes less energy will be produced by  making it brittle. By means of which separation techniques the  frozen plastic mixture can be processed is yet to be studied.  According to Rosin, sieves, winnowers, and also flotation  techniques are currently being tested for their suitability.    Rosin places particular importance on the great cost  effectiveness of his process. Hans-Friedrich Hinrichs, the head  of the Office for Communal Consultation on Technology in  Oberhausen, estimated operating costs at 18 pfennig per  kilogram--with reference to a plant that processes five tons of  plastic waste an hour and 40,000 tons [as published] a year. And  this is not taking into account the proceeds from sales of  separated raw materials. Rosin: "This in comparison with the  50-85 pfennig required at the present time by the dual system."    Waste incineration would also benefit from this process.  Namely, if the plastic waste is burned as powder, a higher  calorific value is obtained than is with the incineration of  large pieces.    The deep freeze process has its limits if a plastic is, for  example, mixed with fire retardants--like computer housing  units. According to Rosin, they are at present engaging in  intensive discussions with superregional waste disposal agencies.</p>

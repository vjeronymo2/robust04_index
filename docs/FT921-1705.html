			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment: Nordic Countries (14): Useful role as a go-between - Nordic Investment Bank THE Nordic Investment Bank has at least one positive attribute at the moment. It is the only bank in the region which still enjoys a triple A rating for its bonds from the leading credit rating institutions Moodys and Standard &amp; Poors. Established on August 2 1976 with a head office in Helsinki by the governments of the five Nordic countries, the NIB'S aim is to finance on normal banking terms investment projects in and outside the Nordic area. Its lending facilities are financed by borrowing on both Nordic and international capital markets. During the first eight months of last year, the NIB made a profit of SDR25m or Dollars 34m. Its total assets were SDR6.058bn while its interest income stood at SDR326.1m. The bank is suffering from no credit losses although it has SDR3.420bn in outstanding loans. But as Mr Jannik Lindbaek, the NIB's president, explains, the bank is not competing with high street or savings banks. It covers only investments that have an interest normally covering more than one Nordic country and these tend to have strong financial support from both the public and private sectors. 'The NIB has been a dynamic force in cross-frontier integration in our region', says Mr Lindbaek. 'In the past five years we have doubled our lending portfolio'. He sees the bank as a complement to other sources of finance in the Nordic area. The NIB is interested not in short-term funding but in medium and long-term loans with maturities of between five and 15 years. Just over half the NIB's disbursements go into manufacturing projects with an estimated 40 per cent of loans in 1990 made in the funding of corporate acquisitions inside and beyond the Nordic region. Increasingly environmental projects have become a dominant concern for the banks lending policy. They accounted for 20 per cent of all NIB's disbursements in 1990. This is due not only to the genuine anxiety about pollution levels felt throughout the Nordic region but the recognition that loans are available from the NIB to clean up the environment even if an investment scheme affects only one Nordic country directly. The NIB explains: 'The reasoning behind this is that most types of pollution do not stop at country borders'. Recent loans in the environmental sector have included a SKr300m contribution in the Swedish paper group MoDo's SKr1.5bn project designed to reduce emissions of oxygen-consuming and chloride particles into the Gulf of Bothnia and Baltic sea from four facilities on Sweden's east coast; a DKr29m contribution to the DKr80m development of a waste water purification plant in east Jutland, Denmark; and a FM29m loan for a desulphurisation facility in an energy plant at Espoo in Finland. In October 1990, the NIB established the Nordic Environment Finance Corporation with the purpose of providing share capital or loans for joint environmental ventures of central and eastern Europe. It has had a modest beginning with an authorised capital of SDR36m for a six-year trial period. Ten years ago, project loan investment facilities were started by the NIB with SDR100m of long-term loans of up to 20 years disbursed each year to credit-worthy developing countries in the Third World as well as central and eastern Europe. The NIB has also been involved in a Nordic region government-based task force set up in September 1990 after an environmental conference at Ronnerby in Sweden. The task force is examining ways of financing projects to purify the polluted Baltic sea by encouraging co-operation between the Nordic countries and their eastern neighbours. So-called 'hot spots' have been defined where pollution is the most severe and the financial needs are the greatest. The area of greater St Petersburg as well as the industrial regions of Katowice in Poland and Ostrawa in Czechoslovakia have been highlighted as 'super hot' and in need of urgent action. The NIB is not alone as a source of financial support in the wider environmental picture of northern Europe. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank are also involved. But the NIB is being used to draw attention to the desperate need for capital infrastructure investment on the edge of the Nordic region. It has produced, for example, two invaluable studies of investment plans and needs in the three independent Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. The idea of creating a Baltic Investment Bank with access to the international money markets jointly owned by NIB and the Baltic countries is being floated. Mr Lindbaek stresses that NIB has only limited resources and cannot become a large multilateral lending institution. But even while it remains modest, the NIB can still perform a useful role in acting as a go-between for the Baltic countries as well as in the Third World where many aid schemes received the bank's support.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Afghan President Sebghatollah </F> Mojaddedi by Salih Qallab in Peshawar; date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Qallab] Do you deal with  Rabbani now on the basis that he is the president of Afghanistan  or the leader of an armed faction?    [Mojaddedi] I do not deal with Rabbani at all, nor do I  recognize the government as a legitimate government.    When Nawaz Sharif was prime minister of Pakistan, he made  his  well-known initiative. So we, representatives of all Afghan  organizations, met and secured a solution. Then we went to holy  Mecca and swore on the Koran that we would implement it. Then  we went to Tehran. When I signed the agreement, I made it a  condition that Rabbani's presidential term should not last more  than four months. And I said that legislative elections should  be held. But Rabbani has abandoned all these obligations and  imposed himself as president for all this time through his  organization only and against the will of all the other Afghan  factions.    I would like to say once again that Rabbani's government is  illegitimate, I do not recognize it, and I cannot deal with it.  Rabbani tried to offer the organization I lead two ministerial  posts in his present cabinet but I turned down the offer.    [Qallab] If Rabbani's term ends in two and a half months and  he does not resign, what will happen?    [Mojaddedi] There is nothing except war; there is a war  raging now, and it will continue.    [Qallab] There is a cease-fire in Kabul at present?    [Mojaddedi] It lasts for an hour or two, a day or two --  which is futile. The cease-fire was agreed in Kabul but the war  has continued in many other provinces.    [Qallab] It is clear that Rabbani will not resign, nor will  Ahmad Shah Mas'ud. So what are you going to do?    [Mojaddedi] The war will continue.    [Qallab] For how long?    [Mojaddedi] Until they are forced to relinquish power. I  tell you here that they cannot last long, as they are in a weak  position. They have been moved out completely from the northern  provinces of the country. They have been eliminated completely.  Therefore, if they are moved out of the part they control at the  moment, they will be finished completely. [passage omitted]    [Qallab] Whom does Iran support in this war?    [Mojaddedi] Iran supports no one. If it supports anyone, it  will support the Shiite group (al-Wahdah Party). These people  are poor people and facing numerous problems.    [Qallab] Is there any thought of widening the alliance  between Abdul Rashid Dostam and Hekmatyar?    [Mojaddedi] As far as I am concerned, I am in this alliance.  There is a shura council for these people, and the organization  I lead is represented in this council. And I support their  moves.    [Qallab] Abdul Rashid Dostam was minister in Najibullah's  government, so why do you ally yourself with parties that were  communist?    [Mojaddedi] That is wrong. Dostam was in Najibullah's  government, but he discovered the truth and separated from and  turned against it. Had it not been for Dostam's stance against  that government, it would not have been possible to topple it,  and it would have stayed for 10 more years. [passage omitted]    [Qallab] It is said that a large number of "Afghan Arabs"  have moved to Afghanistan, where they are now in camps to  rehabilitate them and send them to the Arab countries to create  conditions like those in Algeria and Egypt. Is that true?    [Mojaddedi] That is an issue in which we are very  interested. In fact, we are embarrassed when anyone asks us  about it. Because over 15 years -- even though the Soviet  aggression was very clear -- none of the Afghan factions  committed any action against diplomatic missions abroad. We did  not try to bomb any Soviet embassy. Nor did we try to  assassinate any Soviet ambassador. We fought the Soviet Army  occupying our country. But we did not commit any terrorist  operation.    Regrettably, immediately after the victory of the Afghan  revolution some brothers -- and they are known -- opened camps  for Arab volunteers, trained them, and then sent them back to  their original country to carry out acts like those you talk  about, like what is happening in Egypt and Algeria. I saw some  of these camps with my own eyes. And there are still camps on  which millions are spent in order to launch terrorist operations  against Arab and Islamic states. [passage omitted]    [Qallab] What is your opinion of what is happening in  Algeria and Egypt?    [Mojaddedi] I said that we do not interfere in others'  internal affairs. I am against killing innocent people. It has  nothing to do with Islam at all. I believe the proper thing is  to focus on the Islamic call [al-da'wah al-islamiyah].    [Qallab] That means that you are against violence in Algeria  and Egypt?    [Mojaddedi] Yes, I am against violence. People should use  logic and persuasion, not explosives.</p>

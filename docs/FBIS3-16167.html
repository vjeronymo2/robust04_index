Incentives for  Domestic Producers May Cause Importers' Apathy"]    [Text] The unapproved Russian draft budget for 1994 has  been passed to the State Duma. Its main figures confirm that  the government plans to offset the reduction in direct tax rates  and the VAT [value-added tax] primarily by raising import  tariffs. The tight protectionism in favor of domestic  producers, who have still now not given up hope of converting  their products into full-fledged commodities, may cause a  situation, however, where actual budget revenues will be  significantly lower than what is planned. A high import tariff  is effective only if there is something it can be imposed on.    The attached table shows the overly high level of estimated  budget revenues in 1994. According to estimates made by the  Finance Ministry, which had drawn up the draft budget, the  relative increase in the share of indirect taxes to be received  by the federal treasury as a percentage of GDP is attributable  to the imposition of a new type of tax (a charge for the support  of the agro-industrial sector and the coal industry), the  increase in the excise rates on imported alcoholic drinks (by 30  percent) starting 1 January 1994, and a change in the  distribution of VAT revenues between various levels of the  budget system. In the Finance Ministry's view, the change in  the share of direct taxes as a percentage of GDP has been caused  by amendments made to the taxation and budget legislation  (calling for new tax rates to be levied on individuals and legal  entities).    The Finance Ministry explains the increase in revenues from  foreign economic activity in the GDP by the fact that starting  from 1994 foreign currency funds are taken into account together  with ruble revenues, but in order to estimate the total amount  of revenues they are converted into rubles at an exchange rate  forecast for the end of 1994 (to all appearances, Finance  Ministry specialists hope that it will be kept at 3,200 rubles  per dollar). In addition, the Finance Ministry hopes to collect  the bulk of its estimated revenues from foreign economic  operations by raising import tariffs.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Percentage of GDP                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |1993, in real terms      |1994, forecast           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Federal budget revenues, |10.6                     |16.2                     |  |total,                   |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |including:               |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1.

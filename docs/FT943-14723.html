			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Arts: Today's Television Large parts of this evening's schedule on BBC1 and ITV will be occupied by the semi-final matches in The World Cup. If the light of your life seizes the remote control and insists upon spending hours watching men booting a bladder around the park, do not despair; there are treats to be found elsewhere. The opera relayed Live From Covent Garden on Radio 3 is Massenet's 'Manon', with Romanian soprano Leontina Vaduva returning to the title role which won her the 1988 award for most outstanding contribution to opera. The story (of people always on the brink of taking holy orders, but meanwhile having a ripping time) is told in five acts. In the first interval James Naughtie interviews conductor Colin Davies (6.55). If your tastes run more to folk music, Instrument And Tradition brings together folk fiddlers from around the world (8.00 Radio 2). Fin de Siecle investigates the state of Britain after the Wars Of The Roses (8.45 Radio 4). And Robert Robinson begins a new series of his programme Ad Lib, this time in Australia, talking to makers of Chardonnay (11.30 Radio 4).</p>

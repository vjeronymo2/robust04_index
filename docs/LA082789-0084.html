			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAT SLAYINGS ALARM W. HOLLYWOOD PET OWNERS  </P> <P> Mildred Maiorino had just returned from a family outing last November when a  neighbor came over with the bad news.  </P> <P> Her pet cat -- a 2-year-old, part-Siamese she had rescued from the streets of  West Hollywood as a kitten and named Squeeky -- had been found dead on a  neighbor's front lawn.  </P> <P> "Its body was cut neatly in half, as if sliced by a surgical knife," recalls  Maiorino, her voice cracking with anger. "Only a fiend would do something like  that."  </P> <P> Since then, authorities say, the carcasses of eight other pet felines have been  found in roughly the same area of West Hollywood, between Fairfax and La Brea  avenues on the city's east side.  </P> <P> Most of the cats were mutilated, and a few had their hearts and other organs  removed, said Sgt. Finn Petersen of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Department.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Animal Predators  </P> <P> After performing necropsies on two of the animals, a county veterinarian  concluded that the deaths were probably the work of a coyote or other animal  predator.  </P> <P> The findings, by Dr. G. H. Ford, were apparently enough to convince sheriff's  investigators -- who had explored the possibility that the killings might be  related to a satanic cult -- that they were not dealing with a serial killer.  </P> <P> "We've turned up no evidence to suggest that some crazed person is going around  killing these cats," Petersen said.  </P> <P> But in the 10 months since the killings began to attract public attention,  alarmed pet owners and others in West Hollywood who suspect that the acts are  the work of humans have not been convinced otherwise.  </P> <P> After the City Council recently voted to offer a $2,500 reward for information  leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever is responsible, the debate  appears to have intensified.  </P> <P> Pet owners and animal rights advocates quickly praised the reward as holding  out a possible breakthrough in solving the killings, saying it reaffirms their  long-held suspicions that humans are responsible.  </P> <P> "I never bought the idea of a coyote doing the killings for a minute," said  Barbara Hameker, a magazine writer whose pet cat was found mutilated in a  neighbor's yard in May.  </P> <P> "The manner in which my cat died, the precision of the cuts beneath the neck  and down the body, always told me that this wasn't the work of an animal, at  least not the four-legged kind," she said.  </P> <P> Councilman Paul Koretz sponsored a resolution in July declaring West Hollywood  a "cruelty-free zone" for animals and suggested the reward. He said it  "provides a chance to pry loose some information, if the killings are the work  of humans and there is anyone out there who knows anything."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Keeps Open Mind  </P> <P> Koretz described himself as having an open mind on the matter, but added, "I  think you have to face the fact that, regardless of what the (Sheriff's  Department) investigation has turned up, a lot of people believe that someone  out there is killing these cats."  </P> <P> However, Ford, the county veterinarian, criticized the reward as "an  ill-advised idea" that "serves only to elicit paranoia on the part of cat  owners and others when there is no evidence to suggest these are anything but  predator-related deaths.  </P> <P> "These things tend to get blown out of proportion," he said. "I've seen it  happen in Montana when I worked there, and most recently, we've seen it happen  in Orange County."  </P> <P> Despite widespread speculation that satanists were responsible for the deaths  of 67 cats in Orange County during June and July -- 36 of them in the city of  Tustin -- federal wildlife officials have concluded that the killings were the  work of animal predators.  </P> <P> </P> <P> West Hollywood's Coyotes  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies say that it is not uncommon to spot coyotes in densely  populated West Hollywood after dark.  </P> <P> "They come down out of the hills looking for water and food. You see them  roaming from time to time," said Rod Shanks, who investigated several of the  West Hollywood incidents.  </P> <P> He said that in each of the incidents, the cats appeared to have been killed  during the night, and that their remains were usually found on yards and  driveways.  </P> <P> The first two deaths were reported last November, with the others occurring at  irregular intervals since then, the latest in July, investigators said.  </P> <P> "We don't see any patterns," Shanks said. "We even consulted an expert in the  occult to try and determine if the dates the cats were killed had any  significance, but there was nothing."  </P></p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Ford of Europe back in the black FORD of Europe, wholly- owned by the second largest US car maker, hopes to break even for the whole of 1992 after losing Dollars 1.08bn last year, chairman Mr Lindsey Halstead said at the weekend. But this would depend on a new car sales recovery in the UK, which usually accounts for around 40 per cent of Ford's European sales. Last year the UK market fell by 20.7 per cent to 1.59m cars, after a 13 per cent drop the previous year from 1989's record 2.3m units. Within the 1991 total Ford's own share fell to 24.24 per cent from 25.25 per cent the previous year. Ford hopes the market will reach 1.65m this year, although to do so means the market rising to an annual rate of 1.8m in the third quarter. 'That would be one hell of a turnaround, so I'd be delighted if we could do it,' Mr Halstead said in an interview with Reuter in Barcelona. The European subsidiary has started the year relatively well, making a first-quarter net profit of Dollars 84m compared with a loss of Dollars 129m a year before. It operated profitably in most of its main European markets, including the UK, and reduced operating losses of Jaguar  - now a direct subsidiary of Ford US, not Ford of Britain  - into Dollars 90m from around Dollars 130m. However, Mr Harold Poling, chairman of the parent Ford US, has warned that Ford of Britain itself must narrow its productivity gap with continental Europe. All Ford's UK factories suffered from historic inefficiencies, including productivity rates and amount of time worked. The financial improvement in the UK, achieved despite the continuing decline in the UK new car market, was the chief factor behind the European company's return to profit. The UK result came in the face of a 10.3 per cent fall in first-quarter sales volume, to 95,896 from 106,892 a year ago. Last year Ford actually increased its sales by 3.6 per cent in western Europe overall, but had to cut prices and shoulder heavy marketing expenses to achieve this. Ford's experience has been in sharp contrast to that of General Motors, Europe's most profitable mass car maker, earning Dollars 1.76bn last year and expecting Dollars 1.5bn this year.</p>

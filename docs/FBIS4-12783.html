			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter, P. V. Vivekanand] </F>   [Text] Amman--A senior Turkish official held high-level  talks here Monday [11 April] on the Middle East peace process  and bilateral relations and said later Ankara attaches much  importance to developing economic cooperation among the  countries of the Middle East.    Ozdem Sanberk, under-secretary of the Turkish Foreign  Ministry, said his talks here also covered the strife in former  Yugoslavia as well as the implications for Turkey and Jordan of  the continuing international sanctions against Iraq.    "Since Jordan plays a crucial role in the ongoing Middle  East  peace process, the Jordanian side elaborated in detail this  particular issue," Mr. Sanberk told the Jordan Times after talks  with Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali and Minister of  State for Foreign Affairs Talal al-Hasan.    Describing the talks as very fruitful, the Turkish official  said there were "no problems whatsoever between Turkey and  Jordan on the bilateral level," and that "we noted with  satisfaction that our visas concerning the international as well  as regional issues are widely coverging." [sentence as published]    The Jordan News Agency, Petra, said Minister al-Hasan and  Mr.  Sanberk reviewed progress in the peace process and the  implementation of U.N. Security council resolutions 242 and 338.    Mr. al-Hassan briefed Mr. Sanberk on the continued siege on  the Port of al-'Aqabah and reaffirmed Jordan's call for an end  to the damaging inspections of all ships bound for Jordan.    In his interview with the JORDAN TIMES, Mr. Sanberk restated  his country's stand that Iraq should abide by United Nations  Security Council resolutions. "Iraq must adopt a clear stand to  give confidence to her neighbour Kuwait," he said.    At the same time, he said, the embargo on Iraq continues to  hurt the people of Iraq.    "It has also created a very heavy economic burden for  Turkey," said the official, whose country has been calling for  an easing of the sweeping 44-month-old international sanctions  against its neighbour.    "The same problem also exists for Jordan," he said of the  impact of the sanctions. "We hope that the point for lifting the  embargo would be reached soon. Cooperation between Iraq and the  U.N. must be intensified to this end.    "The U.N. long-term monitoring programme (of Iraq's weapons)  must be put fully into practice without delay and be effectively  implemented in order that the oil embargo is lifted," he said.    Answering a question, the Turkish official said the outcome  of recent municipal elections in Turkey where Islamic activisits  put up a strong showing had no impact on the secular principles  that the country was founded on.    "in the modern Turkey founded by Ataturk, Turks are devout,  as always, and the religion is perceived as an individual  choice, an individual realisation of oneself," he said.    "Islam is not reduced in its political dimentions and... the  results (of the elections) reflect not the religious expression  of the individuals but their political preferenes within the  normal functioning of a multiparty democratic system," Mr.  Sanberk said.    He said Turkey, which is waging a war against the separatist  Kurdish Labour Party (PKK) in the southeast, wanted "her  partners and neighbours to abide by their commitments not to  give shelter to those who resort to indiscriminate separatist  violence."    The official conceded that the Kurdish problem has led to  disputes between Turkey and some of the European countries which  have accused Ankara of violating human rights in its battle  agaisnt the PKK.    But, he said, several countries have in Europe as well as  the  U.S. itself "declared (the PKK) a terrorist organisation," and  France and Germany had banned PKK activities in their  territories.    "It is obvious that terrorism is a gross violation of human  rights and is aimed at the same time at the destruction of  fundamental aspects of freedom and democracy," he said.    Mr. Sanberk said Turkey expects the Middle East peace  process  to create a better atmosphere for regional economic cooperation.    In this a context, he said, a "peace pipeline"  project--which  will bring Turkish water to the Gulf states and others in the  region--"is still on the table."    "It can only be materialised should the countries of the  region see its realisation in their interest and effectively  participate in their realisation," added Mr. Sanberk, in an  apparent reference to the financing needed for the project.    When it was first proposed several years ago, the project  was  estimated to cost about $12 billion. Revised estimates put the  cost at between $15 million and $20 million [numbers as  published].    In Ankara on Monday, visiting Israeli Foreign Miniter Shimon  Peres said Turkish and Israeli experts would look into the  possibility of various projects for the shipment of water from  Turkey to Israel. One idea is that water from Manavgat River  could be carried in plastic containes and floated on the  Mediterranean to Israel.</p>

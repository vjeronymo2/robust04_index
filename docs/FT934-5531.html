			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / How the bombers took secret route to a desperate dialogue for peace It was in the wake of the Greysteel shootings that the mask slipped. Within three days of last month's murders of seven Hallowe'en revellers by loyalist gunmen, the British government received a dramatic and panicky message from the Provisional leadership. 'Please tell us . . . as a matter of urgency when you will open dialogue in the event of a total end to hostilities,' the message said. 'We believe that the country could be at the point of no return.' Coming after eight months of tense and fitful dialogue, conducted in the strictest secrecy, between protagonists more accustomed to staring at each other down a gun barrel, it was the clearest possible signal it was time to act. Three days later, on November 5, as Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, paid his first visit for eight years to Northern Ireland - the government did just that. It spelt out its terms for a face-to-face meeting with the Provisionals within 75 days, in the middle of January next year. If a genuine end to violence was delivered 'within the next few days', the government said, a first meeting for 'exploratory dialogue' would take place within a week of parliament's return from the Christmas recess on January 11. This message would have landed on the desk of the Provisional leadership less than 24 hours after the Ulster Unionist party leader Mr James Molyneaux  -who has an effective veto over the shape of any political settlement - said Sinn Fein would have to wait at least five years before gaining admission to the democratic process. It came just four days after Mr Major told MPs that talking to Mr Adams and the IRA would 'turn my stomach'. These events of just four weeks ago are the most dramatic of the exchanges between these mortal enemies covered by the nearly 40 pages of documents released by the government yesterday. But they are merely the culmination of a top-secret dialogue which began - at the instigation of Provisional leaders - in February this year. The documents released yesterday are an extraordinary record of a discussion which, had it remained secret, would probably not have seen the light of day for 30 years. They indicate that the government set out its conditions for starting talks with Provisional leaders in March - on the very eve of the Warrington bomb blast which resulted in the deaths of two small boys and triggered worldwide condemnation of the IRA's methods. They show that the Provisionals later expressed their 'total sadness' in accepting responsibility for this bombing in an extraordinary oral message. They suggest relations between the Provisionals and the government cooled significantly after the support of nine Ulster Unionist MPs helped prime minister John Major to secure the ratification of the Maastricht treaty in late July. It took the escalation of violence in the wake of the IRA bomb which killed 10 people on the Protestant Shankill Road on October 23 to restore momentum to the dialogue. This appears to have led directly to that dramatic plea from the Provisional leadership - which it was last night denying it made - and the British response clearing the way for face-to-face talks next January. The first contact referred to in the papers took place on February 22 in an oral message from Provisional leaders. 'We need your advice on how to bring it to a close,' it said. 'We wish to have an unannounced ceasefire in order to hold dialogue leading to peace.' About six weeks earlier, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, had said publicly for the first time that pressure within the IRA for an end to violence was mounting. The government, in a brief response four days later, promised to take the overture 'seriously and at face value'. On the day the message was sent - February 26 - a bomb exploded at a Warrington gasworks.

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Talks over Isosceles refinancing get under way Parties involved in the Pounds 1.4bn refinancing of Isosceles, parent of the Gateway food retail chain, are now starting talks over the deal which needs to be agreed in principle by the end of this month. This follows the presentation of the company's business plan to its banks last Friday. Talks are expected to be complex, and in the initial stages much semi-public posturing is expected. The banks have put forward a suggestion that Gateway should adopt Pounds 800m of the total debt, which comprises bank loans of Pounds 1.05bn and mezzanine debt of Pounds 350m, with the rest passed to the parent company. However, others involved say this idea is 'almost certainly completely unrealistic'. Gateway, some say, is not capable of supporting more than perhaps Pounds 400m of debt if it is also to finance capital spending from cashflow. The business plan forecast that Gateway would record a Pounds 103m operating profit in the financial year to end April, compared with a Pounds 187.4m profit in 1991-92. Further, profits are expected to fall again before they recover. The 1992-93 figures will also bear interest charges, including rolled up interest, of Pounds 153m, and 'kitchen sink' provisions covering restructuring, property write-downs, fees for the refinancing and other items, taking the pre-tax loss to Pounds 335m. Another suggestion for the refinancing is that a large part of the debt should be swapped into equity. However, this proposal also faces difficulties because of the position of the equity holders, and particularly Wasserstein Perella, the New York investment firm, which has 30 per cent of the equity, and through its holding of A shares which can exercise significant control over Isosceles.</p>

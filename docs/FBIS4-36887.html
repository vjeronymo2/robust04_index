			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi -- Congress shedding all manner of  diffidence over the economic reforms, has resolved to go the  whole hog culminating in the State engaged only in social  endeavour rather than industry.    The axe will inevitably fall on the grossly inefficient  public sector, the sick industry and inefficient state power  boards, Congress economic policy resolution adopted by the AICC  here declared. There will be more reform as the people want more  reform, and these will have to travel down to the district level.    Finance Minister Manmohan Singh and Agriculture Minister  Balram Jakhar led the Government's defence of its economic  policiers while participating in the debate on the economic  resolution .    The resolution was later passed after a four-hour debate.    Role of the Government in the new environment already stands  transformed, the Congress document stated. The State will  gradually shift out of industry and trade in order to  concentrate on education, rural, development, and healthcare,  the party resolution said in what is a complete and clean break  from the baggage of socialist ideology.    This, as the party bosses including N D Tiwari and Pranab  Mukherjee who opened the debate on the economic policy stated,  was the essence of the middle path advocated by Prime Minister P  V Narasimha Rao in his Davos speech earlier this year.    The middle path meant unleashing the economy, with the  Government assuming the responsibility of social tasks.    Launching a veiled attack on the public sector, Congress  declared that "social obligations are best met when public  enterprises make profits, and not losses." Taxpayers had  invested Rs 140,000 crore in the Central public sector, while  returns are less than Rs 300 crore per year.    Government would have to give the highest priority to  "technological, organisational, and managerial restructuring of  the public sector so that it operates commercially in a  businesslike manner.'    Rarlgarajan anl Goswarni committee reports on the  restructuring of the public sector must be implemented.    In similar vein, Congress has cracked the whip on  inefficient  state electricity boards.</p>

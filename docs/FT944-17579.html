			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Arts: Clients queue up for incentive cash - Sponsorship Next month the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts will announce its estimate of corporate expenditure on arts sponsorship in the UK in 1993-94. The figures are unlikely to show much change from the previous year, when, for the first time in two decades, spending dropped, by 13 per cent to Pounds 57.7m. If the arts have managed to hold their own this will be some achievement. Overseas, especially in the US, sponsorship has not recovered from the recession and many arts companies are suffering badly. In another repeat of a year ago, the arts outside London have proved more successful in attracting support, especially from smaller companies new to the game, while the big London flagship organisations are still finding it difficult. The desire to see sponsorship money work, with a marketing pay off, is growing, but corporate subscriptions to arts companies, offering seats for the boys on the board, are harder to justify these days. Ironically, while the overall sponsorship spend is marking time, applications from new sponsors to the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme are running at record levels, up to 60 a month. The government financed scheme, operated by ABSA, has Pounds 4.8m this year with which to match the contributions of new sponsors (with lesser deals for repeat sponsors). It has proved an effective trigger for attracting business: in the ten years of its existence the government has contributed around Pounds 26m while persuading companies to give Pounds 52m to the arts. So great is the weight of applications that the BSIS cannot satisfy everyone, and companies currently seeking help can expect cuts of between 30 and 40 per cent in matching money. This is causing real problems: the BSIS contribution is often built into the sponsorship, being earmarked for advertising, or for an educational project. Sometimes sponsors make up the BSIS shortfall; sometimes they withdraw from the sponsorship, or delay the deal. Small sponsors giving up to Pounds 5,000 are so far unaffected. ABSA hopes that the obvious success of the BSIS will encourage the government to increase its funding in 1994-95: after a 7 per cent rise last year the grant is scheduled to be frozen. Extra money will save ABSA embarrassment, for while most applications are being scaled down, some, including a few in the new top category of Pounds 35,000, are allowed through. There are cries of favouritism. ABSA obviously wants to encourage sponsors in imaginative experimental areas avoided by play-safe companies. That is why it has just given Michelob, the American brewer, Pounds 35,000 to raise to over Pounds 100,000 its support for the Michelob Pioneer Programme, which enables small to medium sized theatres to receive better funded work from visiting companies. Among the seven venues to benefit are the Young Vic, the Traverse in Edinburgh, and the Contact in Manchester and the companies getting much needed additional funding from Michelob include Gloria, IOU and Phoenix Dance. Another sponsorship to receive the full Pounds 35,000 is the syndicate backing the Romanian National Opera which is currently touring the UK. While most of the Pounds 2m funding has come from a mysterious Romanian multi-millionaire, around Pounds 200,000 was raised by companies with an interest in Romania, like East Coast Travel, Shell Romania, Price Waterhouse Romania, etc. The aim is to perpetuate the package, with the sponsors continuing to help the opera company on its return to Bucharest, forming, in effect, a nascent ABSA-Romania, a concept dear to the heart of ABSA's director, Colin Tweedy. There may be good reasons for ABSA's generosity in these cases, but in the small and gossipy world of sponsorship they have aroused some bitterness, especially the award to a foreign arts company. The fact that Paul Hudson, who heads the BSIS at ABSA, visited Romania before the grant was made has not helped. The Tricycle Theatre's 'Pay What You Can' scheme has been saved by Loot, appropriately enough. For the last four years on Monday nights and Saturday matinees, the unemployed, students, disabled, and the old could see a show at this north London theatre for as much, or as little, as they wanted to pay: a penny would get you in. The idea brought a new and needy audience to the theatre, and was copied by Contact in Manchester and, just recently, by Battersea Arts in London, but was proving costly in an era of frozen grants. On average the contribution at the door was Pounds 2.25, well down on the average ticket price of Pounds 7. But Loot, London's free advertising newspaper, is making up the difference for the next year at a cost of around Pounds 9,000. This is its first sponsorship, but its offices are nearby and there is a natural link between free advertisements and free access. A series of six lunch time concerts of 20th century British music in City churches may not look ground-breaking, but the fact that they are backed by the HSBC with around Pounds 40,000 (plus Pounds 25,000 from the BSIS) is important. HSBC, better known as the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank, acquirer of the Midland, rivals Glaxo as the UK's second largest company. It has never got into sponsorship before but wants to promote its new identity. Its commitment will grow. The concerts are free, involve the City of London Sinfonia, and contain three new works commissioned by HSBC. The next will be on November 9 at St Katherine Cree. CEREC reports that 61 per cent of arts organisations would currently accept tobacco brand sponsorship, but few actively seek it . . . The Visual Arts UK Festival, to be held in the northern region, has attracted over Pounds 50,000 in sponsorship from Air UK which will act as official airline, fly in artists, and carry the Visual Arts UK logo on its aircraft . . . BP is renewing its Pounds 100,000 a year support for the Portrait Award at the National Portrait Gallery until 1997 with an option until 1999 . . . the National Trust has attracted Pounds 1m partnership support from the Rover Group.</p>

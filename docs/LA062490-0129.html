			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME ENTERTAINMENT: STEREO SYSTEMS WITH ELBOW ROOM  </P> <P> You've heard of "desktop publishing" -- well, now there's "desktop audio." The  move to make modern electronics smaller and smaller has spilled over into the  home entertainment arena. Tiny desktop audio components are becoming more and  more popular, and are being produced by an ever-increasing variety of  manufacturers.  </P> <P> As populations grow and land in urban areas becomes increasingly costly, we are  all striving to make more efficient use of space. Whether you live in a studio  apartment, a college dormitory, a town house or one of the latest generations  of compact homes, you know that every inch of space is dear. "Desktop audio"  components are designed and built to take advantage of this need to conserve  space.  </P> <P> Some manufacturers refer to the new generation of tiny audio components as  "compact" rather than "desktop." The result is the same: several pieces of  equipment occupy a very compact area. Desktop audio gear should not be confused  with battery-powered portable equipment or "boom boxes." Desktop gear, though  very small, is meant to live at home.  </P> <P> While the size of the new audio equipment may have shrunk, the sound produced  by it (as well as its price tag) can still be quite large. Here are three  systems from different makers. Each is no larger than a foot-high pile of  telephone books.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Casio Single Unit  </P> <P> While the Casio MS-202 looks like a stack of four components, it's actually a  single unit. It houses (from the top down) a turntable, an FM/AM tuner, an  integrated amplifier with three-band graphic equalizer, and a dual-cassette  deck. Also included are a wireless remote control and a pair of speakers.  </P> <P> Though small, the system is not without bells and whistles. The full-size  turntable is the belt-driven, semi-automatic type, and has a molded plastic  dust cover. The tuner can be set to 12 FM and six AM stations. The cassette  unit is capable of high-speed dubbing and can play two tapes consecutively. It  can record from the turntable, the radio, or tape to tape.  </P> <P> The MS-202 has an external input for attaching a compact disc player,  television set, VCR or other audio source, and it has a headphone jack for  private listening. The wireless remote controls on/off, volume, mute, and tuner  scan. The Casio MS-202 is available now at a suggested retail price of $250.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Compact Magnavox  </P> <P> The model AZ8700GY (where do they come up with these numbers?) from Magnavox is  even more compact than the Casio, and while it lacks a turntable, it does  feature a compact disc (CD) player.  </P> <P> So, included in this desktop system are a CD player, FM/AM radio, an integrated  amplifier with a four-band graphic equalizer, and a dual-cassette deck. A pair  of speakers comes as part of the package.  </P> <P> The CD player features repeat and shuffle play modes, as well as 20-track  programmability. The FM/AM radio has electronic tuning, 12 station presets, and  a built-in, telescoping antenna. The dual cassette deck offers high-speed  dubbing and auto-reverse recording and playback. A pair of small, single-driver  speakers is part of the system, and a headphone jack is included for private  listening.  </P> <P> The Magnavox AZ8700GY, a real mighty-mite of a system, will be available in  September with a $320 price tag.  </P> <P> </P> <P> High-End Yamaha  </P> <P> I think the Yamaha YST-C11 is the best sounding of the three, but is three  times the price of the others. The YST-C11 consists of a CD player, an FM/AM  tuner, a dual-cassette tape recorder/player, an integrated stereo amplifier  with four-band graphic equalizer, a wireless remote control and two speakers.  </P> <P> The CD-player offers direct access, random play and full programmability. The  FM/AM tuner allows direct entry of station frequencies, as well as 10 presets.  The tape deck has auto-reverse playback on both cassettes, as well as Dolby B  noise reduction. The speakers are of excellent quality, each with a 4.75-inch  mid-range and 1-inch tweeter. The wireless remote contains 34 buttons, enough  to control every function of the YST-C11.  </P> <P> The system also includes a built-in timer, so you can be awakened (or lulled to  sleep) by your favorite radio station, CD or tape -- or even record a radio  program while you're away. The Yamaha YST-C11 desktop audio system sells for  $999, and is available now.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEW COLUMN  </P> <P> After shelter, food and transportation, home entertainment equipment is now the  largest single item in the average consumer's budget. New technologies and new  products are emerging constantly. Beginning this week, Home Entertainment, a  column by syndicated writer Harry Somerfield, will guide consumers through the  maze. The column will appear every two weeks.  </P></p>

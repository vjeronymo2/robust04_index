			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Opportunity for Gatt deal seen in autumn THE world's leading industrial democracies yesterday vowed to make another attempt to resolve the stalled Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. But it became clear that a breakthrough cannot be expected before France's September referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Undeterred by their failure to meet an end-1991 deadline for concluding the round that was agreed at last year's London summit, they set the end of 1992 as a new deadline. In their statement at the end of this year's summit, the leaders of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and the European Commission expressed 'regret' at the slow pace of negotiations since the London meeting. But said they were convinced a balanced agreement was within reach. The communique said that an accord to create more open markets for goods and services 'will require comparable efforts from all negotiating partners'. The statement, which G7 officials said represented a firmer commitment than last year's, outlined areas of further work for negotiators in the trade round, which is being carried out under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The G7 leaders said more work was required on making internal farm support consistent with the EC's recently adopted reform of the common agricultural policy as well as on dealing with volumes of subsidised exports and the avoidance of future trade disputes. Problems over market access and trade in cereal substitutes also had to be resolved. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, who tried and failed to achieve a breakthrough on Gatt at the meeting, said afterwards that he thought progress had been made. He warned that Britain would keep returning to the subject and he would 'continue to bully and badger, cajole and encourage the negotiators to get together for there to be a speedy settlement without delay'. The remaining gap in the Uruguay Round talks was relatively small, he said. In Britain's case 'we could settle our differences in 30 minutes'. President George Bush also said he was ready to conclude a Gatt agreement 'right now'. However, the best time for such negotiations is generally considered to be between the French referendum and the US presidential election at the beginning of November. This is understood to be the view of the European Commission, which is the Gatt negotiator for the Community. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who chaired the summit, said the talks in Munich had shown that a breakthrough and a balanced result on Gatt were possible. 'I'm not only optimistic,' he said. 'I will go further. I expect that we will at last have reached that objective by the end of this year.' Mr Major said it was 'essential to have a discussion here. As a result, we have got a firmer commitment to detailed negotiations on the outstanding issues than we have had before.' Although his efforts seemed to many observers to be a political setback, he won support from some delegations. 'If no European had tried, if there had been no signal from Europe, we would have had a very unhappy President Bush,' a Canadian official said. In Geneva, Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, said there would be disappointment that recognition that a balanced trade agreement was within reach had 'not led to a more substantial step forward in Munich'.</p>

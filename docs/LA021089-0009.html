			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A DISTURBING BACKDROP FOR CONVENTIONAL ARMS TALKS  </P> <P> A member of the West German Parliament, visiting in Los Angeles recently, was  asked by American luncheon companions to comment on complaints in this country  that the European allies are not carrying a large enough share of the burden  for their own defense. His response was blunt.  </P> <P> "I am tired of hearing that if West Germany doesn't do this or that, the United  States will withdraw its troops," he said. If America wants to withdraw its  forces, it should go ahead and do so.  </P> <P> Other West Germans at the meeting, sponsored by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation,  hastened to say that the Bundestag member does not reflect the Bonn  government's views on defense issues.  </P> <P> Just last month, however, participants in a NATO seminar in Munich heard  similar words from Rupert Scholz, the West German defense minister.  </P> <P> Objecting sharply to U.S. "reproaches" on burden-sharing, he said that they  could result in "indignation against the American ally" and a rethinking of  German commitments to the alliance.  </P> <P> The growing U.S.-German frictions form a disturbing backdrop to preparations  for a crucial new round of East-West talks aimed at deep cuts in conventional,  non-nuclear forces in Europe.  </P> <P> There is a broad and growing weariness in West Germany with what is seen as an  outmoded U.S. predominance in German affairs.  </P> <P> It is reflected in public demands for a reduction or even an elimination of  low-level practice flights by NATO warplanes after recent crashes in which  German civilians were killed.  </P> <P> It is also reflected in trade frictions and high-level resentment at overt U.S.  pressures on Bonn to crack down on West German companies that provided  materials and know-how for a chemical-warfare facility in Libya.  </P> <P> Chancellor Helmut Kohl is a staunch ally who welcomes the fresh breezes from  Moscow but believes that a stable and peaceful Europe will require a strong  American military presence into the indefinite future.  </P> <P> Probably most West Germans still support NATO membership, but the foundations  of that support are visibly eroding. Recent polls indicate that 75% of the West  German public believes that the military threat has ended, up to 80% want all  nuclear weapons removed from Europe and a large minority now favors a  withdrawal of U.S. troops.  </P> <P> This mood, coinciding with budgetary pressures in Washington, will make it hard  for the alliance to maintain the unity that is badly needed in the  conventional-arms talks.  </P> <P> President Bush must get a handle on the huge U.S. budget deficit. The  impression is growing that he will accept, albeit reluctantly, the necessity of  large cuts in projected defense outlays.  </P> <P> The American military commitment to Europe -- where more than 340,000 U.S.  troops are stationed -- will inevitably come under review. However, significant  reductions would be risky unless the Soviets are willing to make even deeper  cuts in their numerically superior forces.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced plans in December for a  unilateral reduction of 500,000 troops, plus cuts of 10,000 tanks, 8,500 guns  and 800 combat aircraft in Eastern Europe and western parts of the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> Allied governments, although delighted by the promised cuts, have jointly  observed that even after the unilateral reductions occur the Warsaw Pact will  have more than a 2-1 advantage in weapons most suited for an assault on Western  Europe.  </P> <P> Thus, if a negotiated reduction of U.S. troops is to take place, the Soviets  must make deeper cuts than we do. Gorbachev had appeared to agree, but the  latest pronouncements from Moscow reflect the Soviet military's stand that  asymmetries favoring the Soviet side are already offset by asymmetries in the  Western favor.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's interests in force reductions seems real, however. Just the other  day he told his people that cutbacks in military spending are essential to  solving Soviet economic problems.  </P> <P> There is ample evidence that the Soviet military believes that Gorbachev indeed  intends to make deep cuts -- and is uneasy over the prospect.  </P> <P> Thus the way may be open for negotiated reductions that will allow Bush to  safely reduce U.S. outlays for European defense.  </P> <P> The Kremlin, however, may be sorely tempted to stonewall in the expectation  that the West will make reductions anyway.  </P> <P> Congress and the Bush Administration itself may not be able to wait for  successful negotiations before reducing U.S. military outlays in Europe. West  Germany, especially, is in no mood to take up the slack.  </P> <P> It seems, then, that the best hope lies not in Western steadfastness, which may  not exist, but in the domestic economic pressures on Gorbachev to get on with  shifting resources away from the Soviet military.  </P> <P> Those pressures are real. We might luck out. But relying too much on another  country's altruism is a chancy business -- especially when you consider that  the survival of Gorbachev and his policies is far from a sure thing.  </P></p>

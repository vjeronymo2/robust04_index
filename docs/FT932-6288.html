			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (11): Company care becomes the focus  -Winning investment is only the first stage INWARD INVESTMENT in Britain will change in the 1990s, according to the Northern Development Company, the economic regeneration body for north east England and Cumbria. In the past decade, UK inward investment organisations have focused on chasing greenfield projects, a competition in which north east England, with high profile Japanese catches like car maker, Nissan, and microchip manufacturer, Fujitsu, has been conspicuously successful. The worldwide search for new projects continues. NDC maintains a strong profile in the world's most promising inward investment target areas through nine overseas offices, including two in the US and two in Japan, the biggest investors into the region. In the last six months alone, it has announced a clutch of new investments and acquisitions by companies from Hong Kong, the US and Switzerland, ranging from television manufacture and knitwear production to telephone marketing services and the purchase of Sunderland University's electro-magnetic compatibility testing facility. But the agency now sees winning inward investment as only the first stage. The new challenge is to evolve a support role, to ensure the investors it has gained remain and prosper. 'We need to plan in the knowledge that reinvestment, development of the existing investment base, will be far more important in the 1990s,' says Mr John Bridge, NDC's chief executive. 'It may well be the plant here is in competition with the plant in, say, France to get the ear of the parent in the US. A third party can be quite helpful.' The NDC is not alone in this view. At a recent Newcastle University seminar Professor Neil Hood, director of the Strathclyde international business unit, argued that British inward investment agencies need to develop an aftercare and support role. 'Many so-called multinational companies are not remotely multinational,' said Prof Hood, ex-director of the inward investment agency, Locate In Scotland. 'The managers are largely left on their own to compete for investment within the company. Local agencies can help them.' Increasingly, he said, foreign investment in the UK was in the form of joint ventures and acquisitions, yet inward investment projects, although small and declining in number, were still being keenly pursued, partly because of their glamour. Many agencies, he suggested, are ill-equipped for the more subtle and resource-intensive role of supporting existing investments. NDC, however, says it has already responded to this trend by allocating staff to new areas of activity over the last two years, including supplier linkages, support in securing further funding, and an aftercare programme for inward investors. Some may, for example, need help with training. Others may have tentative plans for expansion, which NDC can help them realise. Around 40 per cent of new inward investment-related jobs in the region now come from expansions and reinvestments, says Mr Chris Fraser, NDC's director of operations. In the 1960s and 1970s the region saw enclave investment, says Mr Bridge, with overseas companies setting up self-contained plants. Now, he says, the area must aim for embedded investment, so the inward investment is just the starting point for a complex web of linkages. Creating these linkages - the growth of a locally-based automotive supplier base for Nissan's Sunderland plant is an example - will, it is hoped, encourage spin-off investment and ensure plants remain. The region now has investments by more than 350 overseas companies. More than 120 are North American-owned, and 50 Japanese. It claims to be the principal European centre for manufacturing investment from the Far East. But while the US has resurged as a source of inward investment, interest from Japan is very flat. Although NDC is firmly established within the north east as the co-ordinating body for inward investment - Cumbria keeps its options open by also being a member of Inward, NDC's north west counterpart - County Durham has its own development company (CDDC), set up to raise the profile of a county which has to compete against neighbouring urban heavyweights Tyne and Wear and Cleveland. The CDDC, which sees itself as adding value to, rather than competing with, NDC's efforts, is hoping the expected creation of an enterprise zone in East Durham will help regenerate an area which has lost its last four pits, employing 4,000 men, in the last three years. John Elliott, CDDC business development executive, says that while the era of big investment projects may be past, there is a myriad of small and medium sized opportunities to aim for. He hopes Durham University's proposed Pounds 30m science park will help attract quality investors. In Northumberland, the county council has opted for some lateral thinking to encourage investment, by targeting companies in which its superannuation fund has equity stakes. Between 1985 and the end of 1992, NDC estimates overseas investment in the region created 24,405 new jobs, and safeguarded a further 11,800. The estimated capital spend was almost Pounds 3bn. The safeguarded category covers acquisitions of existing plants in the region by overseas investors. One recent example is the purchase last month by the Whiting Company of Vermont, of South Durham Fibres, based at Bishop Auckland. The plant, which makes PVC and polyester filaments, will become the European manufacturing base for Whiting, a synthetic fibres manufacturer. In 1991 and 1992, safeguarded jobs were proportionately more important than in the 1980s, accounting last year for almost half the total 5,784 jobs secured. The NDC is aiming to secure a total of around 5,000 jobs a year through inward investment. The total UK annual figure is around 50,000. It could be argued that inward investment's importance in the region's economic base has been overestimated. An analysis by Northumbria University academics Frank Peck and Ian Stone of 1980s' incoming greenfield manufacturing investment in the region pointed out that it comprised just 5 per cent of the total stock of manufacturing jobs at 1989 levels. However, they also noted the newcomers were creating the type of jobs - full-time and for men - badly needed in the region. The NDC's Agenda for the North, its strategy for long term economic growth, published last December, stresses that inward investment has played an important part in maintaining the region's manufacturing performance, creating new sectors, such as semiconductor manufacture, and strengthening growth sectors such as electrical and electronic engineering. It also suggests inward investors have upgraded quality levels achieved by suppliers, improving export performance. On the downside, it notes an absence of some key research, design, development and marketing functions among the northern operations of overseas companies, but points out this is a general problem for the region, as UK headquarters are overwhelmingly concentrated in London and the south east. Advantaged though it is in this regard, southern England has, nevertheless, been lobbying hard over the redrawing of the assisted areas map. The importance of UK government regional aid , which also helps unlock European grants, is undisputed. Between 1987 and 1992, every one of the 82 new greenfield overseas investment projects in the northern region went to assisted areas. Of 202 projects, including new arrivals, joint ventures, acquisitions and expansion, 95 per cent were in assisted areas. 'If some parts of the south of England get it and we retain what we've got I wouldn't be too worried,' says Mr Bridge. 'If they get it at the expense of parts of the north, I would be more concerned.'</p>

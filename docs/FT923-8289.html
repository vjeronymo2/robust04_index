			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Observer: Heard on a grouse moor It will be interesting to see whether Scottish landowner Christopher Moran, the first broker to be expelled from the Lloyd's insurance market, is going to make it back into the list of Britain's seriously rich people. Moran, who used to be reckoned to be as wealthy as GEC's Lord Weinstock, was upset when The Sunday Times left him off its recent list of the 300 richest people in Britain. Moran, who owns Scotland's Glenfiddich estate and is spending Pounds 25m on Crosby Hall, his new Cheyne Walk home, told the paper that his property assets were worth some Pounds 200m and he had little or no borrowing. Ivan Fallon, The Sunday Times' deputy editor, has promised to reinstate him. However, it sounds as if Moran might soon be a little less wealthy than he was. A US federal judge has just ordered him to pay Dollars 2m to settle an alleged insider-trading lawsuit linked to his sale of shares in Zondervan, a publisher of Christian books and Bibles. When Observer contacted Moran yesterday on his Scottish grouse moor, he sounded remarkably unperturbed by what might seem to some a legal setback. His view is that the judgement is unenforceable in the UK and the case should be tried in the English courts, where it would be defended. And no, it would not prevent him going to America. He promises me that his finances are in good shape. He degeared before the 1987 stock market crash, and his ownership of Chelsea Cloisters and half a dozen other buildings which are fully let, assures him of a healthy income. He intends to become more active again when the market is right but 'for the moment we are free-wheeling and shooting some grouse'.</p>

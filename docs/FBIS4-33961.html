			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Mexico City, 13 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Mexican  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said he is willing to  mediate between Cuba and the United States to eliminate the  economic embargo on the island, however, "no one has asked us to  mediate, and we are not in the habit of going where we have not  been invited." In a short news conference, shortly before  leaving for Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, Salinas de Gortari  said he is convinced the blockade solves nothing and added: "we  believe it should be lifted and in this manner bridges for  communication and dialogue would be built." [passage omitted]    The Mexican president said the visit was "very positive and  cordial and strengthened the traditional good relations that  exist between our two countries." [passage omitted]</p>

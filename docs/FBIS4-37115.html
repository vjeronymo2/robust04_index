			<p>BFN     [Text] His Highness Crown Prince Hasan, the regent, has  stressed that we are facing a new challenge in the peace  process. In a speech he delivered at the Royal War College, his  highness added that peace in the Middle East figures high on the  international agenda. He said Jordan has always been a peace  advocate, and that Jordan's peace theory is not just theoretical  propaganda, but an essential practical reality.    In his the lecture, his highness reviewed the challenges  facing the Arab nation under changing world circumstances. His  highness said the world's interests have become intertwined.  Therefore, small states have lost a great degree of their  freedom, and their decisions are affected by the international  axis more than by regional and domestic axes. He indicated that  the continued Arab-Israeli conflict threatens cruel  international disputes.    [Begin Hasan recording] We want a peace that preserves our  historical and religious rights in the holy land and holy  Jerusalem. Peace should not be a bargain of material profits at  the expense of moral and spiritual sublimeness. Any peace that  does not secure our rights cannot be a durable peace. For peace  not to be fragile, we want peace for all Arab parties. Peace is  indivisible. A just peace is a comprehensive peace on all  fronts. We are not raising this as a slogan, but as a message  that this is the only possible peace whose hopes and pains we  can cope with. For us in Jordan, the requirements of peace are  unchangeable. They will require us to face the burdens of peace  with internal cohesion, comprehensive security, building a  production base, and resolving the shortage in basic supplies,  such as water, energy, and food. [end recording]    Present to listen to the lecture were Acting Prime Minister  Dhuqan al-Hindawi, advisers to his majesty the king, the  information minister, his highness the prince's special adviser,  chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, the chief of staff of the  Royal Ground Forces, aides to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs  of Staff, and senior Armed Forces officers.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Mainland offers get cold shoulder from the US - Chinese issues Shandong International Power Development has become the latest victim of a tendency for Chinese companies to be given the cold shoulder by US investors. The power group admitted on Friday that its flotation, involving an issue of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) and a listing in Hong Kong, will not now take place until early next year. The listing had been scheduled for November. Another recent victim was Concordia Paper, which produces recycled packaging and paper. It originally planned to raise up to Dollars 56m with an initial public offering via Lehman Brothers and SG Warburg, but scaled it back to Dollars 20m. The smaller offering was a success, with shares issued at Dollars 10 a week ago trading on Nasdaq at that level on Friday. 'The company now has an audience to go back to,' said a banker close to the deal. SIPD is looking to raise around HKDollars 2.7bn with its planned offering, which will be jointly brought by Goldman Sachs and Peregrine Capital. The company blamed poor market conditions for its delay but while this may be true in the Hong Kong market, where the shares will be listed, it is more likely that SIPD has its eyes on the US market, where it had planned to issue ADRs. The performance of ADRs issued by fellow China power companies Shandong Huaneng and Huaneng Power International has not suggested an enthusiastic welcome from US investors. ADRs in Shandong Huaneng, the first mainland state-owned enterprise to seek a primary listing on Wall Street, were issued at USDollars 14.25 on August 4 and on Friday were trading around Dollars 9.25. CS First Boston acted as global co-ordinator of the deal, which represented 27 per cent of the outstanding share capital. Huaneng International Power, which hit Wall Street on October 6 after slashing the price of its stock some 27 per cent over the course of the roadshow, has seen its ADRs fall from the issue price of Dollars 20 to Dollars 15.25 on Friday. Until Shandong Huaneng, there were four mainland companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange: Brilliance China, China Tire, Ek Chor Motorcycle and Shanghai Petrochemical. In October Huaneng Power, an associate company, became the sixth US listed mainland company. The experience of the latest two China companies on Wall Street has been the same as that of their predecessors, all have seen weak performances and lacklustre volumes. The US cold-shouldering of mainland stock trading on Wall Street has prompted the Chinese regulatory authorities to explore means of encouraging dual primary listings in the US and Hong Kong - as achieved by Shanghai Petrochemical and its sponsors Merrill Lynch Hong Kong and Peregrine Capital last year. This would enable companies to widen their investor base with a US listing, while recognising that the bulk of demand, for now, will be in Hong Kong. In turn, this may mean two of China's biggest overseas listings earmarked for New York might dovetail their flotations with Hong Kong offerings. They are China Southern Airlines, being brought to market by Goldman Sachs, and China Eastern Airways, being arranged by Morgan Stanley. US investors are likely to give them a cooler welcome than a year ago. The US investor's view of Chinese investment may also have been affected by news that Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, is suing three of China's biggest trading companies for allegedly failing to pay nearly Dollars 100m in debts.</p>

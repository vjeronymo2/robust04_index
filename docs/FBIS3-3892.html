			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [text] Taipei, March 18 (CNA) -- The government on Friday  [18 March] pledged to accelerate the development of the Changhua  Coastal Industrial Zone in central Taiwan, where 15 domestic  steelmakers are planning to establish a steel complex.    Officials of the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under  the Ministry of Economic Affairs said that the bureau recently  gave a green light to the building of a large thermal power  plant in the zone by the state-run Taiwan Power Company.    Completion of the power plant will help ensure a sufficient  supply of electricity in the industrial zone, the officials  stressed.    The IDB will do its best to continue building the reclaimed  land in Changhua County into an industrial area in order to meet  the strong demand in Taiwan for land suitable for industrial  purposes, they said.    A total of 83 manufacturers of everything from precision  machinery to computers [words indistinct] applied to open plants  in the industrial zone, they added.    Meanwhile, the Taiwan Steel and Iron Industries Association  announced that 15 steelmakers have decided to join hands to  build a steel complex in the zone.    Coordinated efforts will help reduce development costs of  the  steel complex, thereby increasing the competitiveness of the  domestic steelmakers, he elaborated.    He said the complex will help make Taiwan self-sufficient in  steel. Taiwan imported 15 million tons of steel products last  year, making it the world' third-largest steel importing country.    The spokesman said that the 15 steelmakers are planning to  invest NT$30 [New Taiwan dollars] billion (us$1.13 billion) in  the five-year project, which will occupy an area of about 200  hectares for the production of a dozen steel products.    The IDB officials, however, said that they cannot promise  that the steel complex will be completed as planned by the  steelmakers because construction of the industrial zone itself  might cost more money and take longer than expected.</p>

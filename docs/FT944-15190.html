			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Taiwan Cement tumbles to TDollars 2.4bn Taiwan Cement, the country's biggest cement manufacturer, has reported pre-tax profits of TDollars 2.37bn (USDollars 90.6m) for the first nine months of the year, down sharply from TDollars 3.36bn a year earlier, writes Laura Tyson in Taipei. The company, controlled by the Koo family, said the retreat was due mainly to a TDollars 700m-TDollars 800m shares sale in 1993. Turnover also fell, to TDollars 13.44bn from TDollars 15.04bn, in part due to a slowdown in public and private construction. Imports of Japanese cement at 'unreasonably low' prices had pushed domestic prices down 5 per cent since the beginning of the year, the company said. About 90 per cent of Taiwan's cement imports come from Japan.</p>

At the rally, Mr Mandela told thousands of supporters that  senior state officials were perpetrating violence. The ANC  leader also charged that the NP was fomenting violence. "I hope  that before April 27 there will be sufficient evidence to show  that there is a `third force'," said Mr Mandela. Dr Steenkamp  said the ANC president's statement was an "insult to the  intelligence of the public".    The Goldstone Commission had conducted a thorough  investigation and found no proof of the existence of a "third  force".    "It is common knowledge that the ANC itself is involved in  by  far the majority of cases of violence and intimidation  throughout the country."    Dr Steenkamp said if Mr Mandela was serious about  intimidation he would acknowledge his own party as the "main  culprit, and do something about it". Mr Mandela's hard-hitting  statement also undermined his stature as a Nobel peace laureate,  Dr Steenkamp concluded.</p>

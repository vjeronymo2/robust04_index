			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE'S DECISION ON REMOVING FOXES  </P> <P> Judge Robert Kelleher's decision to sanction the "murder" of the foxes at the  Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station (May 2) is a small example of the type of  narrow-minded idiotic decision made by a man who does not have any  understanding of ecology.  </P> <P> Even after animal organizations have offered to trap the foxes, he renders such  an unwarranted decision. It's frightening to have such men as Judge Kelleher in  positions of power!  </P> <P> JOAN RICHARDSON  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

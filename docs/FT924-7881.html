			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum price forecasts cut JOHNSON MATTHEY, the world's biggest platinum marketing group, has scaled down its short-term forecasts for the metal's price because of the effects of recession on the Japanese, the biggest platinum buyers. Earlier this year the company forecast that the price would be rising towards Dollars 400 a troy ounce by the end of 1992, but this underestimated the impact of collapsing property and equity prices on rich Japanese. It now expects the average for the fourth quarter of this year to be about Dollars 370 an ounce, rising to Dollars 385 in the first quarter of 1993. Sales of large investment platinum bars in Japan were badly affected by the uncertainties created by the market collapse and JM expects demand for these bars to drop to 90,000 ounces this year from 240,000 ounces in 1991. Also, a sharp fall in sales of high-quality and expensive platinum jewellery in Japan is forcing retailers to adjust stock levels. Sales of simple, cheaper platinum jewellery in Japan continue to be buoyant, however, and JM predicts that overall demand from jewellers will drop this year by only 10,000 ounces to 1.46m ounces. According to Mr Jeremy Coombes, author of JM's interim market review, published yesterday, platinum supply and demand are closely balanced. He forecasts a supply surplus of about 30,000 ounces compared with one of 135,000 ounces in 1991. The total platinum market will be smaller this year, says Mr Coombes, with both supply and demand contracting. Demand is forecast to be 3.86m ounces, down from 4.025 ounces last year, and supply 3.89m ounces, down from 4.16m. Recession in many industrialised countries will cause a 5 per cent fall in industrial demand for platinum, to 760,000 ounces. But, despite recession, tightening anti-pollution legislation affecting cars in Europe and North America will see demand for platinum in automotive exhaust catalysts rising by 6.1 per cent this year to a record 1.655m ounces. This means non-investment demand for the metal is heading for the ninth successive year of growth, says JM. On the supply side, Mr Coombes suggests that Russian platinum exports, which spiralled out of control in 1991, are now strongly constrained by the authorities and JM therefore expects these exports to fall by nearly one third this year - to about 750,000 ounces compared with 1.1m ounces in 1991. In 1990 Russia exported about 720,000 ounces. Also, a year ago JM expected South African producers to supply more than 3m ounces to the market in 1992. This estimate is trimmed in the review to 2.82m ounces, a rise of only 1.8 per cent on the 1991 level. A combination of industrial and political action, technical problems, mining inefficiencies and difficult ground has disrupted production and expansion programmes and developments have been delayed. Mr Coombes says: 'Returns are now inadequate to provide funds for future investment and, without a recovery in prices, there could be more delays in expansions or even cuts in production at high-cost areas'. The review suggests the palladium market will see a supply deficit of 110,000 ounces and the metal's prices should therefore remain firm. Rhodium will be in surplus by 13,000 ounces, partly because of de-stocking by Japanese car makers. Platinum 1992 Interim Review, free from Johnson Matthey, 78 Hatton Garden, London EC1N 8JP, UK.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / People: Hodder's deputy head Tim Hely Hutchinson, chief executive of Hodder Headline, continues to carve his faintly iconoclastic path through the publishing world by bringing on board as his deputy a man from the company that brought you Sonic the Hedgehog. In Mark Opzoomer, commercial and finance director of Sega Europe, Hely Hutchinson recognises what he calls 'the acceptable face of high-level finance'. The new broom is obviously not bowled over by the calibre of his peers in other publishing houses. 'We employed headhunters Spencer Stuart because we were pretty sure the right person didn't exist in our industry,' he says. But what do the folks from Hodder &amp; Stoughton, that grand old publishing name that was 'merged' with Headline last year, think of the arrival of an electronic media buff? 'The people who remain here from pre-merger days are the forward-looking ones,' says the boss. And the only 'family' man still extant is the head of marketing for general books, Jamie Hodder-Williams, who is 'actually very good'.</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Challenger holds key for Vickers THE NEW Challenger 2 tank, on which the long-term prosperity of Vickers, the engineering company, may depend, was put through its paces for the first time yesterday, Daniel Green writes. The Ministry of Defence has ordered 140, while Oman has signed a contract for 18. The future of one of Vickers' two tank factories at Newcastle upon Tyne and Leeds, which employ 800 workers each, depends on further orders. The MoD plans to upgrade its fleet of more than 400 Challenger 1 tanks. But the Army would be happy to have a smaller number, perhaps 200, of Challenger 2s. An order for 200 of the new tank would be worth between Pounds 400m and Pounds 600m and would keep Vickers working for up to six more years.</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> LYDIAN QUARTET AT DOHENY MANSION  </P> <P> The Lydian String Quartet offered a curiously constructed concert for the Da  Camera Society at the Doheny Mansion on Friday.  </P> <P> The ensemble, in residence at Brandeis University near Boston, began with  Faure's melancholy, recondite and rarely encountered swan song, his Quartet in  E minor.  </P> <P> It is worth hearing, especially in as involved and shapely a reading as the  Lydian's. But one questions the wisdom of starting an evening's entertainment  with music so undemonstrative and unlikely to yield up even a fraction of its  secrets on first encounter.  </P> <P> The tension generated by the subsequent offering, a local premiere of the Third  Quartet of American composer Lee Hyla (b. 1952), proved somewhat more  involving.  </P> <P> Hyla's single-movement work, commissioned by the Lydians last year, employs the  medium cleverly, frequently dividing the foursome into competing pairs of  instruments.  </P> <P> On a first hearing, never conclusive, one recognizes such Bartokian derivations  as its long tremolos and slashing, sonorous unisons. What this listener did not  recognize, however, was the composer's announced use of a "rhythmic riff from  'Fight the Power' by the rap group Public Enemy."  </P> <P> Finally, the Lydians treated the familiar strains of Schubert's "Death and the  Maiden" Quartet with respect and freshness of spirit. High marks to the  ensemble -- violinists Daniel Stepner and Judith Eissenberg, violist Mary Ruth  Ray, cellist Rhonda Rider -- particularly for presenting the  theme-and-variations slow movement not as a series of fancy solo turns, but as  a tautly integrated ensemble piece.

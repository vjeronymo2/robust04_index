			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / International Company News: Olivetti pins survival hope on specialisation - Can Carlo De Benedetti save his company twice? Mr Carlo De Benedetti, Olivetti chairman, cuts through the politely oblique inquiries about his company's health like a surgeon wielding a scalpel: 'The question you should be asking,' he says reprovingly, 'is can Olivetti survive?' His point is well taken. Olivetti may still be the largest European-owned manufacturer of personal computers, printers and related equipment, but its financial results in the past two years have made dismal reading. The company lost L460bn (Dollars 297.5m) in 1991 after heavy restructuring costs and is likely to post an operating loss for 1992 of between L300bn and L350bn. Further restructuring charges are expected to add substantially to the final loss figure, bringing it up to an estimated L750bn. Mr De Benedetti, whose holding company, CIR, has a 38 per cent stake of Olivetti's ordinary shares, has no doubts that the group cannot survive for long without stemming the flow of red ink and returning to profitability, He claims, however, that Olivetti's chief problems are not financial, drawing attention to its strong balance sheet and predominantly long-term maturity of its debts. 'Our problem is whether we can successfully execute our survival strategy. We have to convince our large customers that we will be around in five years' time,' he says. Olivetti, in common with the rest of the world's main computer manufacturers, has been hit hard by profound changes in the indystry's structure. Hardware prices have plummeted - personal computer prices fell by 75 per cent between 1991 and 1992. Customers are demanding 'open' or industry-standard computers that command low gross profit margins rather than the proprietary designs which have dominated the industry to date. Olivetti's sales fell 6.8 per cent from L8,607bn to L8,025bn in 1992, reflecting lower hardware costs, intense competition and the state of the European economy. The company, however, is also fighting to eliminate the effects of two disastrous strategic errors that have compounded its problems. The purchase of the office equipment manufacturer Triumph Adler from Volkswagen in 1986. Triumph Adler will represent the largest element in the 1992 losses - half in operating losses, half in restructuring charges. The restructuring element is believed to have amounted to about L150bn. A further, much smaller, charge will have to be taken this year; by December, Triumph Adler will have fewer than 200 staff compared with 3,000 in 1988. The decision in 1988 by Mr Vittorio Cassoni, the former managing director to meet the challenge of a fragmenting market by dividing the company into three separate units to handle office products, systems and networks and information services. The duplication of effort cost Olivetti dear as the overall market collapsed. The three divisions have been wrapped back into a single company. Mr De Benedetti believes Olivetti has three characteristics that will enable it to survive its greatest test. First, it has proved its culture is adaptable to change. When he bought into Olivetti in 1978, it was a loss-making typewriter company. He earned his international reputation transforming the Ivrea-based concern into Europe's most successful personal computer manufacturer, shifting first from mechanical to electronic typewriters, then into PCs. But can Mr De Benedetti manage the trick a second time? He says the company has adaptability in its genes. He took day-to-day control of Olivetti in 1991, moving Mr Cassoni sideways to the role of international ambassador. More recently he has appointed Mr Corrado Passera, one of his most trusted lieutenants, to the post of joint managing director, but he emphasises his continuing personal and financial commitment to the company. 'Olivetti is my life. It is run by an entrepreneur who is here in the office every day and who has no interest in short-termism,' says Mr De Benedetti. Second, it has made the right strategic choices. It has already moved away from manufacturing in favour of software and services: 'We do not have factories any more,' Mr De Benedetti says, with only a little hyperbole. At one stage in the 1980s, there were 14,000 people in manufacturing. By the end of the year there will be only 4,700. Mr Passera fleshes out the strategy: 'We have become a systems company. Our turnover can now be subdivided into three parts of more or less equal size - professional services, systems and products. Office products, for example, which used to generate 80 per cent of revenues, now generate only 10 per cent.' 'Our focus is on Europe and on specific industries such as banking and financial services. Other markets are marginal. Our target size for the end of 1993 is 37,000. That gives us critical mass for professional services and for networking.' The strategy means the company will be retrenching in regions such as Australia, the US and Canada, where the aim will be to avoid losses rather than make profits. The company is committed to open systems and has secured a number of strategic alliances, giving it access to leading-edge technology, the most recent with Digital Equipment of the US. In return for a 4 per cent equity stake, Olivetti will have access to Digital's new alpha microprocessor, said to be the world's fastest. It is possible, Mr Passera says, that the company could develop a fourth industrial specialisation in telecommunications through a strategic alliance with a telecommuni-cations company. Italian analysts have regularly speculated on some form of link with the state-owned STET telecommunications group. This, however, seems unlikely, not least because of domestic political differences between Mr De Benedetti and some of the governing parties. The third leg in Mr De Benedetti's survival strategy is financial strength. The balance sheet is strong and even after this year's losses, he says, the company will have Dollars 3bn in cash. It expects to break even at the operating level, including financial charges this year, and make a profit in 1994. Some may remember Mr Cassoni making similar forecasts for 1992 little more than a year ago. It will be a vital test of Mr De Benedetti's campaign to convince customers of Olivetti's staying power that the numbers come out closer to expectations this time round.</p>

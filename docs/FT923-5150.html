			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: Bond reconstruction on course THE COMPLEX reconstruction of Bond Corporation Holdings, once the quoted flagship of Mr Alan Bond, appears to be back on course after the group settled a dispute with Australian Consolidated Investments (Acil). Acil, formerly Mr Robert Holmes a Court's Bell Resources, also announced a net loss of ADollars 46m (USDollars 35.3m) after abnormal items for the year to end-June, against a loss of ADollars 108.2m the previous year. Bond Corp's reconstruction was endangered in June when Acil withdrew from a management committee overseeing implementation of a debt-for-equity swap which would give Acil 25 per cent of Bond shares. Acil had earlier stopped making working capital payments of up to ADollars 1m a month to Bond Corp, which were provided for under a deal reached last year between Bond and its creditors. The dispute was complicated by the acquisition of Acil earlier this year by Rossington Holdings, a bidding vehicle jointly owned by Brierley Investments of New Zealand and GPG, Sir Ron Brierley's UK investment company. However, Mr Colin Henson, Acil's executive director, said the group had suspended a claim over several of Bond Corp's remaining assets in return for ADollars 16.75m in cash and assets. Mr Henson said Acil would resume working capital payments and help finance the cost of a legal action brought by Bond against the Western Australian state government over the failed Kwinana petrochemicals project.</p>

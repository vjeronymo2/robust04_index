			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Telekom sale to involve US and UK banks The partial privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, expected to raise about DM15bn (Dollars 10bn) in 1996, is likely to involve US and UK banks because of the importance of both countries' stock markets, Mr Helmut Ricke, chief executive, said yesterday. He did not say which investment bank the state-owned telecommunications company preferred for the main international role of global co-ordinator. But it was important to give banks from the countries containing the world's most important stock exchanges a decisive say in the share placement, he said. 'That naturally applies to the US just as much as it does for Britain,' he said. 'I can't imagine that there would be any political considerations which would exclude a strong American partner. There is no disagreement between management and the owners (the government) in this matter.' Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, is among the most likely candidates to head the international placement, with Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley in the running, along with S. G. Warburg and Kleinwort Benson from the UK. Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank are expected to be named the overall managers of the privatisation issue, which is likely to be split into regional consortiums to cover Germany, the rest of Europe, North America and the rest of the world. A final decision is expected shortly, with banks standing to earn fees of about DM450m from the placement. However, Mr Ricke said a decision on which banks would be involved in the issue would not be made as early as this week. 'We are under a certain amount of time pressure but we will need to evaluate the matter more carefully than that.' Deutsche Telekom invited 22 of the world's leading investment banks to a 'beauty contest' in Bonn at which they presented their respective bids to the company and the finance and postal ministries. 'They are all good,' Mr Ricke said. 'We now have to decide what their particular strengths are, what connections they might have to companies which we regard as our competitors.'</p>

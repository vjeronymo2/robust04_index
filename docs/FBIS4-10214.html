			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks are recorded] </F>   [Text] Illegal immigration is an issue on which our people  have many different views. It is an extremely dangerous endeavor  for those who have emigrated illegally from Cuba by sea.  Research is being conducted precisely on this topic by a  specialist of the Center for Political Alternatives of the  University of Havana. Its deputy director, Antonio Aja, explains:    [Aja] "This is an in-depth study of the characteristics of  those who emigrate illegally; the motives of the people who make  the decision to emigrate illegally; who they are; what their  reasons are; and the risks taken once the decision and attempt  to illegally emigrate is made."    The researcher also spoke about the significance of this act  for national security and human life.    [Aja] "Emigrating through the Guantanamo Naval Base is not  the same as emigrating in a raft."    The classification of people who attempt to emigrate by sea  was another of the goals of this study.    [Aja] "They can basically be classified as young. This is  understandable because, first of all, this endeavor requires a  certain physical ability."    This interview is only an excerpt of a broad subject that we  will discuss further in this program over the next few days.</p>

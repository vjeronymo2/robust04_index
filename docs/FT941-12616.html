			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Murdoch admits to talks with Polish TV group Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International yesterday confirmed that it was involved with Polsat, the consortium which has won the licence for Poland's first national commercial television channel. The company said there had been detailed discussions but no final decisions had been taken and the Murdoch organisation was not legally a member of the consortium. It is believed that News International, the UK subsidiary of News Corporation, signed a letter of intent with Polsat to take a stake of up to 33 per cent. News International declined to comment on this yesterday. Earlier, a spokesman had said: 'News has had several discussions with Polsat about finding ways in which News might contribute to the consortium, such as the provision of programming, but no final decision regarding any involvement has been made.' Mr Zygmunt Solorz, the owner of Polsat, yesterday denied he had any agreements with News International. 'We parted with Mr Murdoch when we made our application for the licence last November,' said Mr Solorz yesterday. He added that he recently passed a letter dated January 25 from News International to the Radio and Television Council, which issued the licence, in which the international media group said it wanted to participate in the Polsat application. The letter came after three days of public hearings earlier this month during which Polsat had taken the line, with considerable success, that it represented a purely Polish bid with no foreign links. It won the licence against competition from mixed local and foreign groups. Mr Solorz said yesterday that he had 'no contracts, no agreements with anyone' but he added that he was now receiving offers of co-operation from other foreign companies such as Time Warner. It appears that Polsat will have to gain the council's approval if it wants to bring in a foreign partner, although the law permits up to 33 per cent foreign ownership. Mr Solorz wrote yesterday to Mr Marek Markiewicz, chairman of the National Broadcasting Council, insisting that Polsat had no contractual obligations to any foreign interests. He said he also denied rumours about 'alleged negotiations in London at our representatives with News Corporation. All the documents pertaining to our contractor with foreign interests have been presented to the National Broadcasting Council.'</p>

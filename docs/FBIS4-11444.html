			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Presidential candidates of small opposition parties  have termed the debate positive, but demanded that it be more  open and that all candidates be allowed to participate.    [Begin recording] [Alvaro Perez Trevino, presidential  candidate for the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution]  Honestly, no debate has been agreed upon because, in reality, no  candidate has grabbed the bull by the horns. Now Dr. Zedillo  has dared to launch this initiative. It is alright because if  this initiative would not have been presented, no debate would  occur.    [Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, presidential candidate for the  Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party] I will always  maintain that a debate must be pluralistic and democratic,  without exclusions. If there are no guarantees that all  candidates are treated with respect and equality, I would not  participate in debates of this nature.    [Marcela Lombardo Otero, presidential candidate for the  Popular Socialist Party] If we want to strengthen and expand the  political-democratic system in the country, it must be done by  expanding and strengthening the multiparty system, which  enriches proposals and projects anywhere in the world.    [Jorge Gonzalez Torres, presidential candidate for the  Mexican Green Ecologist Party] We are happy to be part of the  group of political parties that have been set aside. These  parties have not been considered for the possibility of debating  at this level, and the possibility of gaining access to the  presidency. Well, at least that is what they believe, but the  reaction of neglected parties will be very powerful.    [Pablo Emilio Madero, presidential candidate for the Mexican  Democratic Party] We are all presidential candidates, there are  not only three candidates. Therefore, it would be inappropriate  to hold the debate only amongst three people.    [Unidentified reporter] How would you propose that the  debate  be held?    [Madero] All candidates should be allowed to participate at  the same time, with the same lighting, the same cameras, the  same journalists, the same audience, and on conditions of  equality. This will permit citizens to appreciate what each  candidate is proposing. [end recording]</p>

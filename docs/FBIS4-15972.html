			<p>BFN     [Text] RIA reports: The State Duma has agreed with a  Federation Council proposal to create a conciliation commission  to overcome any disagreements which may arise. Disagreements  arose after the Federation Council rejected a law, approved by  the Duma, on the procedure for publishing federal constitutional  laws, federal laws, and acts of the chambers of the Russian  Federal Assembly and for their coming into force. From the  State Duma, Vladimir Bessarabov, Sergey Zenkin, and Anatoliy  Lukyanov, members of the Committee on Legislation and Judicial  and Legal Reform, will be on the conciliation commission.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, December 31 (KCNA) -- The legendary  Chollima, a symbol of the revolutionary stamina of the Korean  people, has spread its wings for another leap.    With the pride in having carried out the Third Seven-Year  Plan (1987-1993) under the changed situation and manifold  hardships, the Korean people have risen up again in a fruitful  struggle to carry through the revolutionary economic strategy of  the party.    At the 21st plenary meeting of the sixth Central Committee,  the Workers' Party of Korea, on the basis of a profound analysis  of the changed situation and actual demands of socialist  construction in our country, set two or three years to come as a  period of adjustment in socialist economic construction and put  forward a strategic policy of directing primary efforts to  agriculture, light industry and foreign trade in this period.    "Let us bring about a great upsurge in economic construction  in the spirit of Chollima spurred on by the `Speed of the 90's'!"    In response to this militant slogan of the party, the  Working  People of Korea are hardening their determination to carry  through the new strategic policy of socialist construction.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said:    "Just as we have advanced so far, upholding the  revolutionary  slogan of self-reliance and hard struggle, so in the future we  should hold high this slogan and smash the anti-socialist moves  of the imperialists and the reactionaries and accomplish the  socialist cause."    Still alive are the spirit and the stamina with which they  brought about a great upswing of Chollima in response to the  resolution of the historic December, 1956, plenary meeting of  the Central Committee of the party calling them to maximum  production and economy in the days when the internal and  external situation was grim after the war.    The revolutionary banner of self-reliance and hard struggle  was the only banner that we had to hold high when we were  reconstructing the economy with bare hands on war ruins.    Our people, upholding this revolutionary banner, shattered  the silly talk of the enemy that Korea would not be able to rise  again in a hundred years and turned Korea into a socialist  industrial state from scratch in the spirit of Chollima that  gallops ten steps, nay a hundred steps, when others take one  step.    By effecting another great upsurge in socialist economic  construction in this revolutionary spirit, the Working People of  Korea are building our-style socialism into an invincible  bulwark, resolutely smashing the moves of the imperialists and  the reactionaries to blockade and stifle the DPRK economically.    The whole country is seething with revolutionary enthusiasm,  though it is not long after the new policy of socialist economic  strategy was set forth.    Mass meetings to carry through the resolution of the plenary  meeting were held in all parts of the country.    More than 100,000 Pyongyang citizens held a mass meeting and  resolved to take the lead in carrying through the new strategic  policy of the party.    In accordance with the strategic policy of the party, the  agricultural working people are pushing ahead with the work for  completing the technical revolution in the countryside set forth  in the rural theses and carry on farm work on a scientific and  technical basis as demanded by the farming method of chuche so  as to place all sectors of agricultural production on a new,  higher level.    Well-planned operations have been launched to modernize  light  industrial factories still further, expand the variety of  consumer goods and decisively improve their quality.    And a thorough-going organizational work has been undertaken  to increase the production of exports in all fields of the  national economy and actively explore foreign markets for a new  turn in the development of foreign trade.    The work of economic organisation is geared to the new  economic strategy.    The working people of Korea are making energetic efforts to  create "the speed of general march of our-style socialism" with  confidence in victory and optimism, undaunted by any political  and ideological offensive of the imperialists and the  reactionaries and their economic blockade.</p>

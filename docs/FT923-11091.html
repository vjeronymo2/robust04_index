			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (11): Challenge that could not be turned down - Profile of Ian Donald AFTER SEVEN difficult years in charge of the restructuring of pulp and paper group, Fletcher Challenge Canada, Mr Ian Donald seemed a surprise choice to be recalled to Auckland to become chief financial officer for its parent - New Zealand's biggest company. With revenues of USDollars 8bn, Fletcher Challenge has substantial overseas investments in Australia, Brazil, Chile, Canada, Britain and the US. Mr Donald's original term had been extended by two years. It was expected he would stay in Canada till the company returned to profit after the losses of the past two years. Mr Donald is the last remain ing senior executive of the old Wellington-based Challenge Corporation which merged with Fletcher Holdings of Auckland in 1981. After the transfer of the head office in 1987 from Wellington to Auckland, senior Fletcher people increasingly dominated its management. Yet, had the merger not occurred, Mr Donald seemed earmarked to succeed Sir Ron Trotter as chief executive of Challenge, the country's biggest rural group. As financial officer, he succeeds Mr David Sadlier, one of the country's most popular business figures who had held that post, first with Fletchers and then with Fletcher Chal lenge, for over 20 years. Mr Donald dominates any group. He is 6ft 6in, powerfully built, with a booming voice. He was born in Liverpool in 1941. His doctor father, who was serving with the Eighth Army in North Africa, sent his young family for safety to Canada and then South Africa. When the family was reunited after the war, they emigrated to New Zealand. Mr Donald worked on farms for three years before deciding he needed better qualifications. After completing degrees in commerce and accounting, he gained qualifications in farm accounting in England and agricultural economics at Michigan State. He joined Challenge Corporation in 1972, becoming head of the rural division of Fletcher Challenge in 1981. As head of the company's operations in Canada from 1987, he oversaw the merger between British Columbia Forest Products and Crown Forest Industries to form Fletcher Challenge Canada, and the CDollars 1.4bn upgrade of its plants. The company's sales total USDollars 2bn, but because of the recession profits have been erratic. In 1989 the group earned USDollars 250m after tax, but it incurred a USDollars 20m loss last year, with a similar result expected this year. Mr Donald says he is very bullish about the industry and prices should pick up as the slow economic recovery gains pace in key North American markets.</p>

			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Directors' pay rises criticised DIRECTORS' pay increased last year while the real value of managers' pay fell for the first time since 1984, according to a survey by the British Institute of Management. Directors' pay rose by 11.5 per cent for the year ended last January, a rise in real earnings of 2.3 per cent. Mr Peter Benton, director-general of the institute, warned: 'This may damage the relationship on which good leadership is based.' Directors should ask themselves if they were worth the rises they awarded themselves, he said. Where earnings were tied to profitability, directors should accept the same medicine as their managers when profits fell. Managers' pay rose by 9.5 per cent, but once deductions for tax and national insurance were taken into account the true value of their wages fell by 0.4 per cent. Their pay was also hit by a fall in bonuses. The BIM report showed that more than 11 per cent of directors were paid more than Pounds 100,000 and nearly one in five received Pounds 10,000 in bonuses. Directors in companies with a turnover of more than Pounds 600m received the biggest rises, with chief executives winning average increases of 22.7 per cent, taking average remuneration to more than Pounds 210,000.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Council cleaners to lose jobs ABOUT 1,000 cleaners with Devon County Council face redundancy after losing a contract to clean the council's schools and buildings. The redundancies come on top of claims that tens of thousands of jobs are at risk in local government, mainly in the large cities and county councils in the Midlands and the north, because of the government's capping limits on the coming year's spending. The biggest cuts are in Birmingham, where 3,000 posts are under threat.</p>

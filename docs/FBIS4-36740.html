			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Damascus: Washington's </F> Problem in the Middle East Is With Itself First and Israel  Second"]    [Text] Damascus -- Syria said yesterday that the United  States' problem in the Middle East lies with itself first and  Israel second. And if the United States is playing its role as  a full partner, if it really is committed to the principles of  the peace process, it should persuade Israel of these  principles. In practice it should find no difficulty in  persuading Israel. Because by virtue of its relationship with  Israel and by virtue of the nature of that relationship it is  capable of making Israel's rulers respect international  legitimacy and comply with the requirements of a just and  comprehensive peace in the region.    A Syrian official said that the United States has precedents  in this connection. After the tripartite aggression in 1956 it  was able to force Israel to relinquish Sinai one week after the  Knesset decision. Because then-U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower  took an influential position that persuaded Israel. If U.S.  President Bill Clinton were willing to do the same today with  regard to the Golan, the peace process would move in the  required direction. But Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator for the  peace process, has become a promoter of concessions to those  violating international legitimacy -- which is not in line with  the interests of peace or with the characteristics of the full  partner that the United States claims to be.    The official said that Syria is still and will remain  committed to the peace process and its foundations. All the  evidence proves that it is seeking peace. This is a Syrian  strategy, not a diplomatic game or a transient propaganda  campaign. It will continue to cooperate with the United States  as long as the United States continues to respect the basis of  the peace process and the resolutions of international  legitimacy. The problem is still not with Syria but with  Israel, the U.S. position on Israel, and the lack of a serious,  influential, fair, and responsible role. The official added  that Israeli logic, which differs from any other logic, will  push the Middle East region into a new whirlpool of escalation,  tension, wars, and bloodshed.    On U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to the  region, the official said that the problem lies not in whether  Christopher should come to the region or not, but rather in  whether the United States demonstrates commitment to the full  role it has chosen for itself. This role was not a Syrian  invention or demand; it was a U.S. idea.    Asked whether Syria will agree to receive Christopher during  the tour now in preparation, the official said: We are always  willing to acquaint ourselves with whatever new baggage  Christopher may be carrying, because we are seeking to achieve a  real peace. If Christopher carries with him Israeli proposals  that achieve the basic requirements of the peace process, there  is no problem in joining the negotiations. However, we urge the  United States to commit itself and adhere to the UN resolutions  and the principles of international legitimacy. In this context  we do not accept that there should be any room for any neutral  approach or for acting merely as a mailman: Either Washington  is with international legitimacy, or it is not. He added that  the problem is not between Syria and the United States; the  problem is with the Israeli position. And Syria is looking  forward to hearing the Israeli proposals that Christopher might  carry with him during his announced tour. These proposals  should fall within a new framework so that the peace process can  advance. He said that Syria has not yet been informed of the  date of Christopher's arrival in the region. The official  pointed to the existing full coordination between Syria and  Lebanon, saying that the two tracks will not diverge, that the  efforts being made to separate the two tracks from one another  will fail; and that the Lebanese resistance will continue to  fight until the land has been liberated.</p>

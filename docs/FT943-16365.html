			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Leave it to the other guy  -Richard Gourlay looks at two extreme examples of outsourcing Behind the World Cup competition in the US lies an unusual organisation. Using a dazzling array of computers, it provides adminsistrative and information support for all aspects of the games through network links between the 12 football grounds. This organisation did not exist before the games and will be disbanded after the winners' victory parade. While the competition is in full flow, however, World Cup USA 1994 is the ultimate virtual company from which all functions are contracted out to specialists. Meanwhile, as of yesterday, London has its own virtual company, in the form of the Parking Committee for London. The body takes over responsibility for parking enforcement on behalf of London's 33 local boroughs from the Metropolitan Police and traffic wardens. Both World Cup USA 1994 and the Parking Committee are extreme examples of outsourcing - the sub-contracting by companies of non-core activities to outsiders - that is being adopted by businesses of all sizes. International Business Machines says the market for outsourcing is worth Pounds 7bn a year in the UK. There is clearly an opportunity for companies - often small ones - that take over other businesses' chores. But smaller companies also have an opportunity to outsource some of their own back-office functions. 'The question is: do you want to do a certain function yourself or is it a non-value adding activity that you want to buy as cheaply as possible,' says John Goble, financial administration business manager for IBM UK, which has just launched two companies to tap the outsourcing market. 'The question applies to a 20-person company as much as to a 20,000-person company but there is a reluctance in smaller companies to approach people like us.' Ultimately, the theory goes, companies will perform only those functions where they add greatest value. Goble says IBM could consider taking over functions as varied as customer order taking, distribution, invoicing, and the management of car fleets and payroll. The World Cup USA 1994 organisation is a particularly hi-tech example of outsourcing; a network of Sun Microsystem computers is linked by Sprint fibre optics and co-ordinated by EDS, the computer services company owned by General Motors. But the Parking Committee for London is outsourcing not only its IT needs but also more mundane tasks. Although the organisation expects to process Pounds 200m worth of fines and charges a year, Nick Lester, the chief executive, decided that he only needs a handful of staff - chief executive, finance director, appeals adjudicator, a public relations co-ordinator and a skeleton support staff. EDS, which won the Parking Committee for London contract, will do the rest. The contract itself was relatively novel. EDS was simply told what the Parking Committee wanted and asked to provide everything to make that service possible. 'The contract with EDS was based entirely on a performance specification,' says Lester. 'We said don't supply us with bits of hardware that will do this and that but provide us with the service.' The specified tasks include telephone reception services for drivers whose cars have been clamped or removed; administrative support for the appeal and adjudication service; a common computer link with the 33 boroughs; liaison with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority and the County Court in Swansea; a clearing house system for payments; and management of the persistent offender database. Why did London's boroughs not contract out management of the entire ticketing operation? In the first place, the Parking Committee for London is a statutory requirement of the 1991 Road Traffic Act. Also, says Lester, 'We are making certain we get the policy right and make sure others do their jobs according to the policy.'</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / The men who invest in Soviet dinosaurs: A look at the buccaneers of Ukraine's richly endowed Donbass region John Hughes, a Welsh blacksmith, opened the first big steel plant in Donetsk, then called Yuzovka, in 1872. More than a century later, amid rusting Soviet industrial giants, the entrepreneurial spirit is alive again in the heart of Ukraine's Donbass region. White Mercedes Benz cars, covered in a thin film of black dust from 50 coal mines, career down grey, muddy streets. Smartly dressed young men stand out among the pensioners. The explanation for this sharp contrast is that, although it was hard hit by the Soviet Union's collapse, there are many ways to make money in the Donbass. It is estimated that a quarter of Ukraine's economic potential lies with the Donbass's steel mills, coal pits, farms, sea ports, factories and coal, manganese and iron ore deposits - all that prompted Dmitry Medeleyev, the Russian scientist famous for the periodic table, to marvel at its 'inexhaustible richness'. 'It's a rough diamond, uncut, unpolished,' says Mr Fredric Kerulis, a US mining engineer who has worked with western investors in Donetsk for two years. He notes that both small traders and large companies, such as General Electric, are keenly interested. Yet the local business elite is the driving force behind economic and political change in eastern Ukraine. The summer elections brought into the governor's seat Donetsk's retail shop magnate, Mr Volodymyr Sherban, a 41-year-old with no Communist party background whose electoral success was matched by other young progressives gaining the mayor's office in Mariupol, the Donbass's leading port, and in neighbouring Lugansk. Mr Sherban's goal is to bring in private capital, rebuild industry and commerce, and develop metal, raw material and coal exchanges. Last week he hosted Israeli juice producers who, with emigre ties to the area, want to set up a joint venture in the region. 'I'm temporarily governor,' Mr Sherban says, 'but forever in business.' 'We support whatever works,' says Mr Oleg Rybak, the mayor, citing special land auctions for filling stations, hotels and shops contracts open to foreign companies. The plans are in infancy. The World Bank and the UK consultancy Bain &amp; Company also worry that privatisation is stalled, although progress is visible on small-scale enterprises. The climate, at least, has changed. African and European traders invariably follow steel, but direct investment by former Soviet, Middle East, east European and west European partners is picking up after a drop off during last winter's economic chaos in Ukraine. The popular Mr Rybak, an unassuming former apparatchik who does not belong to any party, keeps an open door. At his sparse office last week guests included the city's favourite son, Mr Sergei Bubka, the pole vaulter and now local entrepreneur. 'I divide my time between Monte Carlo, Berlin and Donetsk,' says Mr Bubka, who has opened a sports club, several shops and a slot machine business in his home town. Once dutifully criticising capitalism in US television interviews, Mr Bubka says: 'We survive in a different way now: everyone buys and sells everything.' Mr Aleksander Mahmudov typifies this diversity. A stocky middle-aged engineer, he was mayor before starting, with two partners and little capital, a financial concern in 1991. Dikon Invest, now publicly owned with 48 offices in Ukraine, Russia and Bulgaria, works in securities, banking, insurance and pension funds. With a sixth share issue coming up, Dikon in 1993 paid dividends of up to 30,000 per cent, albeit skewed by hyperinflation. But rarely for Ukraine, where financial groups mostly shuffle hard currency for short-term gain, the bulk of Dikon's business is with the large enterprises prominent in the Donbass that are considered white elephants by most experts. 'Our motto is: take advantage of the negatives,' Mr Mahmudov proclaims, between answering his portable or satellite phones in an office cluttered with western gadgets. The Dikon portfolio includes stakes in 20 companies with more than 35,000 employees - such as Nord, Ukraine's famed refrigerator concern that this week opened a plant in Jordan, and Azovmash, a machine-building giant in Mariupol. Despite stuttering nationwide privatisation, Dikon also drew up plans to first corporatise, and soon after privatise, the Soviet dinosaurs. 'When we see large enterprises need financial help,' Mr Mahmudov said, 'we invest in them to keep them afloat.' The optimists hope Donbass mirrors the post-war fate of Germany's Ruhr region or Pittsburgh in the 1980s: an industrial swathe restructured, then revitalised. 'In the west it took 15 years,' Mr Mahmudov said. 'There are energetic people here, but in Donetsk, it'll take longer.' Outside capital is desperately needed to rebuild inefficient and subsidised industries and mines. Gas de France last week explored coal mines to consider a venture to trap and sell methane gas, a resource currently wasted. But such visits are rare. Even compared with Russia, Mr Kerulis said, Ukraine's Donbass looks risky. Companies fear the government's 'moving target' tax policies and the mob. Just across the border from Rostov, an organised crime centre, Donetsk sees more than a share of grenade attacks, car burning, and murder. Politics is a hurdle, too. Donetsk is a communist stronghold with a large constituency in miners and pensioners, underpaid and unhappy. Miners' strikes scuttled government plans to cut subsidies. Last week a walkout was called off when Kiev raised wages. But a showdown is imminent: Ukraine's efforts to shape up mining are central to new-found respect for fiscal austerity but the government may be ill prepared to face the social unrest and economic consequences of mass strikes. The other, but exaggerated, threat to stability lies with deep nostalgia for the Soviet Union among the region's almost exclusively Russian speakers. Nationalists also worry about the local elite's strong CIS-Moscow orientation. The Donbass is now very strong in Kiev. President Leonid Kuchma is an eastern industrialist. His strong ally Mr Sherban, also an MP, chairs the parliament's budget committee with wide power over purse strings and investment contracts. The east no longer seems Ukraine's weak spot. Quite the opposite, the Donbass is at the vanguard of change. Bread prices this month were freed first in Donetsk - and the region's efforts at improving ties with Russia, Mr Rybak says, are not an attempt at separatism but greater autonomy spreading across the country.</p>

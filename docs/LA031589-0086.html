			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EX-COACH IS SENTENCED TO PROBATION IN MOLESTATIONS  </P> <P> A former varsity basketball coach and teacher in Anaheim was ordered Tuesday to  serve 5 years' probation after admitting last year that he had sexually  molested two 16-year-old students.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown's sentence of Christopher M. Lee, 42, of  Newport Beach marked a partial trade-off in the severity of punishment, since  Lee avoided any further jail time but got a probationary period that was longer  than the standard 3 years.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathleen M. Kendle, who had sought a sentence  of a year in County Jail, said she was "extremely disappointed" with Brown's  decision.  </P> <P> "It took an awful lot of courage for these particular students to come  forward," Kendle said of the two Esperanza High School students who reported  Lee's repeated sexual activities with them to a school counselor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Popular Teacher  </P> <P> The girls suffered "intense peer pressure and ostracism" at school for  reporting a popular teacher, and "they deserved more than this sentence after  what they've been through," Kendle said.  </P> <P> But Brown, in ordering probation for Lee, pointed to the "unusual  circumstances" in the case -- an apparent reference to Lee's unblemished  history as a respected and well-liked English teacher and varsity basketball  coach at Esperanza and as a community member in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Lee has already spent 40 days confined in a state institution for a diagnostic  review by mental health professionals. Brown indicated to the attorneys at a  conference before the sentencing that he saw no need for any further  imprisonment, the attorneys said.  </P> <P> Lee refused any comment on the case as he left the Santa Ana courthouse after  his sentencing. His attorney, Ronald G. Brower, pleased with the outcome, said:  "Any more jail time would have been too severe. He has already certainly  suffered public humiliation from the publicity that attended this case."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Working as Supervisor  </P> <P> Now working as a supervisor at a construction firm, Lee has no plans to contest  the formal loss of teaching certification that will follow Tuesday's criminal  sentencing, Brower said.  </P> <P> Besides serving a 5-year probation sentence, Lee will have to register with the  state as a sex offender and is barred from contact with minors unless another  adult is present. He may also have to make restitution to the victims for the  financial expenses they have incurred as a result of the molestation -- such as  psychiatric treatment.  </P> <P> Both victims are undergoing continued counseling to deal with the trauma of the  experience, prosecutor Kendle said.  </P> <P> Lee pleaded guilty last fall to charges that he had repeated sexual relations  with the two students -- both in school and out -- over a period of several  months in 1987.  </P> <P> In his interviews with state mental health professionals, Lee could give no  explanation for his conduct, according to prosecutor Kendle. His attorney has  previously described the episode as a single moment of "human frailty" on Lee's  part, "an extreme lapse in judgment."  </P></p>

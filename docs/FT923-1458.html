			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / World Bank chief urges aid increase: International community 'must not turn its back on the poor' MR Lewis Preston, president of the World Bank, yesterday urged donor nations to give more aid to the poorest developing countries and committed the bank to a policy of 'people-first environmentalism' in the third world. 'Donor budgets are tight and events of the past week have created further uncertainties and pressures,' he said. But 'the international community must not turn its back on the poor'. By allowing aid flows to decline in real terms, the industrialised world was asking the poor 'to bear the burden of adjustment in the rich countries as well as in their own'. Only five of 20 of the richest industrial countries have met the international target of official development assistance equivalent to 0.7 per cent of GDP. Britain and the US are among the laggards. Addressing ministers from 167 countries at the formal opening of the IMF/World bank annual meetings, Mr Preston said the real resources of the International Development Association (IDA) - the bank's concessional finance affiliate - had to be substantially increased. The bank is negotiating the tenth replenishment of the IDA, which covers the three-year period beginning next July. A commitment of about Dollars 18bn (Pounds 10.1bn) is the minimum required to maintain the current volume of lending to the poorest countries. However, there are nine new countries eligible for the IDA, including some former Soviet republics, and new calls on resources, including environmental pledges made by world leaders at the Rio Earth Summit in June. The bank fears the commitment to aid is so weak in industrial countries that even the minimum Dollars 18bn target may not be reached. It has been pressing for an 'earth increment' of about Dollars 5bn to help finance environmental policies but has received little support. Mr Preston said the most urgent environmental problems were 'those that cause illness and death on a huge scale in the developing world - dirty water, inadequate sanitation and pollution. Ours must be a people-first environmentalism.' He said the bank would increase its investment in water and sanitation projects by 75 per cent over the next five years and substantially expand agricultural services and pollution abatement schemes. Spending on social programmes such as health, education and family planning was set to rise by 50 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bridgetown, 6 May (PL) -- The Barbados Declaration  was ratified today at the conclusion of the First World  Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island  States. The participating governments committed themselves here  to implementing, by way of a new action plan, the  recommendations contained in the Agenda 21.    The document adopts the goals outlined in the Agenda 21 of  Rio de Janeiro '92 in the paragraph dedicated to small islands  on specific policies, actions, and measures to be carried out at  the national, regional, and international levels in favor of  sustained development in these territories.    The declaration says the survival of small islands is  threatened, as well as their human and natural resources and  cultural heritage. It adds that plans for sustained development  should continue, giving full attention to the special needs of  women, children, youth, and indigenous peoples.    It reaffirms the sovereignty of island states over their  natural resources and their responsibility in preserving their  sea and coastal resources, as well as their biodiversity and  national ecosystems, through international cooperation.    The document stresses the special role to be played by  nongovernmental organizations and the importance of their  cooperation with governments to implement the Agenda 21 and  action plans at the national, regional, and international levels.    It notes that because of their size, small islands have  particularly vulnerable economies that depend on scarce  resources and world trade, without any means of influencing the  latter.    Based on these considerations, the 17 heads of state and  governments committed themselves to formulating and implementing  policies for sustained development that will include social  progress, health, and environmental protection, mobilizing all  resources available for improving the quality of life.    They agreed to promote regional and subregional cooperation  among the small islands and the international community. They  also agreed that the international community should cooperate in  the implementation of the action plan to provide new and  additional funds in accordance with the [words indistinct]  facilitating the transfer of technology, protecting intellectual  property in developing countries, and promoting commercial  agreements that will not be discriminatory against them.    The Barbados Declaration makes the international community  responsible for the protection of small islands to minimize the  negative effects of natural disasters on their frail ecosystems  through multilateral cooperation.    In the document, the small islands commit themselves to  eliminating or reducing negative patterns of consumption and  production and to promoting adequate policies for democratic  development.    Rosa Elena Simeon, Cuban minister of science, technology,  and  environment and member of the delegation accompanying Cuban  President Fidel Castro, described the Barbados Declaration and  the joint action plan as positive, specific, and of great social  content.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Canadian dollar dives to 8-year low The Canadian dollar dived to its lowest level in eight years yesterday, despite persistent intervention by the Bank of Canada. The currency was partly a victim of the strength of the Japanese yen and European currencies against the US dollar. But traders said the weakness was exacerbated by uncertainty over the new Liberal government's policies. The Canadian dollar closed at 73.92 US cents yesterday, having touched a low of 73.75 US cents during the day. It had closed at 74.43 on Friday. Mr Paul Martin, the finance minister, will table his first budget on February 22. It is expected to include spending cuts and a broadened tax base, but Mr Martin has indicated the deficit is unlikely to fall below CDollars 39bn-CDollars 40bn (Pounds 19.5bn-Pounds 20bn) in the next fiscal year, compared with about CDollars 45bn this year. Currency markets have also been unnerved by indications that the government is eager to push domestic interest rates down further. With the long decline in US rates now ended, such a move would narrow the traditional spread between US and Canadian rates.</p>

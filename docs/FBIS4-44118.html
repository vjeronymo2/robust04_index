			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Nm"-signed editorial: "On Corfu"] </F>   [Text] What was signed on Corfu, Greece's "green island,"  on the first day of the European Council has quite a lot to do  with the principle of hope. For example, the partnership  agreement with Moscow: Whether Russia will one day be part of  the European free trade zone depends on its political  developments in the next few years. If, in the Russian power  struggle, the forces of the bureaucratic-military-industrial  complex hold their own -- Prime Minister Chernomyrdin belongs to  this group -- then the agreement with the European Union [EU]  will not materialize. Yeltsin's short visit to Corfu would then  remain another attempt to boost the Russian president's image,  which is declining at home, through international support  actions.    The principle of hope also stands behind the signatures,  which seal the EU's "northern enlargement," at least at the  official government level. The matter with Austria, where the  citizens voted in favor of accession with a surprisingly large  majority, seems to be the only issue genuinely settled thus far.  In Finland, Sweden, and Norway, party majorities have spoken  out "in favor of Europe" recently; however, the voters have not  been asked yet. In Norway, in particular, it is more than  dubious whether the people will follow the advice of Prime  Minister Brundtland, who is not tiring in her struggle for  membership. Their small chance is based on the fact that the  Norwegians will be the last ones to hold a referendum, on 28  November, and might be scared of becoming isolated in case their  Swedish and Finnish neighbors vote in favor of accession first.    The heads of government are dealing with a long agenda on  Corfu. At the top of it is the decision on who will succeed  French Commission President Delors; on such issues, the  political microcosmos tends to turn on its own axis at a high  speed. What is more important is that, by establishing a  preparatory group for the 1996 government conference, the EU  will embark on its path toward "Maastricht II." Germany and  France, which will now assume the presidency in the EU in  succession, are expected to provide decisive impulses: In view  of the election campaigns in the two countries, one can only  count on the principle of hope here, too.</p>

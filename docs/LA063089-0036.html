			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The judge in the Oliver L. North case put off until today a decision on whether  a juror's possible misconduct affected the Iran-Contra trial, court officials  said. North prosecutors said the juror gave inaccurate information to the court  due to "inattentiveness, forgetfulness or lack of comprehension" but that there  is no evidence she lied. The assertions were in a seven-page court filing a day  after juror Tara Leigh King testified that she had forgotten that one of her  brothers had served a year in prison for armed robbery. North's lawyers say his  trial was tainted by King's presence on the jury. The former White House aide  was convicted May 4 on three felony charges arising from the Iran-Contra  scandal.  </P></p>

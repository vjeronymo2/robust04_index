			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It is very likely that Russian special agencies  stand behind the Kebich government; this was declared by  Vladimir Novik, Belarusian Supreme Soviet deputy and secretary  of the legislative standing commission on the economy, in an  interview with SVABODA [Freedom] on 5 January. "You can be  absolutely sure," he said, "that stabilizing the Russian ruble  or the U.S. dollar means undermining our economy and robbing our  people. This would strengthen the economies of the countries  whose currencies would be allowed in Belarus. Who is devising  these kinds of policies? The government of an independent state  or a special agency? The latter, is the most likely answer."</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Profit fall hits Thyssen as German chemicals climb MOST bourses were firmer yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT's DAX index maintained its uptrend with the help of two or three blue chips, closing 5.86 higher at 1,628.53, but the more broadly-based FAZ easing 0.16 to 6589.53 at midsession. Volume eased from DM6.9bn to DM6.5bn. In chemicals, BASF and Hoechst rose DM3.40 to DM235 and DM8.50 to DM235.50 on rumours of two buy recommendations. Bayer, more highly priced and with less of a dividend yield to offer, rose only 80 pfg to DM287.80. In carmakers, last year's underperformers recovered a little, with Porsche rising by DM5 to DM560. Volkswagen added DM6.50 to DM307 as County NatWest noted a VW indication that profits rose by 6 per cent in the final quarter after a 17 per cent drop in the first nine months of 1991. Ms Heidemarie Hoppner of B Metzler in Frankfurt noted a return to quality among second-liners where specialist chemical manufacturers like Henkel and Schering rose by DM8 to DM562.50, and by DM8.50 to DM820 respectively. However, in steels, Thyssen fell DM2.50 to DM208 on the 42 per cent drop in Thyssen Stahl's 1990-91 profits, and the forecast of 'clearly worse earnings' in the current year. PARIS finished close to the day's highs on the back of Wall Street. The CAC 40 index rose 19.52 to 1,843.81 in turnover estimated at around Monday's FFr2.0bn. News that Libya planned to cut its oil production to support sagging world oil prices lifted the oil sector. The oil refiner Total added FFr45 to FFr1,054 while Elf, weak recently, recovered FFr7.30 to FFr365.30. The building materials company, Lafarge, recouped FFr6.70 at FFr324.80 after Monday's 6.7 per cent drop. Elsewhere, Pernod Ricard, the drinks company which announced an 11 per cent rise in its interim dividend last week, added FFr38 to FFr1,431 in relatively heavy volume of 109,125 shares. MILAN overcame a weak start as options-related selling dried up. The Comit index rose 6.94 to 537.91 in turnover estimated at around L100bn after Monday's L85bn. Part of the day's gains were attributed to short-covering ahead of the close of the January account today. But dealers detected domestic buying in anticipation of the dissolution of parliament and the general election campaign, during which the stock market traditionally performs well. Bargain-hunting and optimism that all the bad news was out in the open lifted the ordinary shares of Pirelli by L35 or 3.3 per cent to 1,080. In telecoms, Sip was unchanged at L1,490 in spite of some foreign profit-taking as the stock approached L1,500. ZURICH rose as Nestle was reported to be considering a ten-for-one share split. The Credit Suisse index rose 1.3 to 463.8. Nestle bearers put on SFr120 to SFr9,000 and CS Holding, next on the active list, rose SFr50 to SFr1,875 as the market awaited the decision by the US rating agency, Moody's, on the credit rating of Credit Suisse, CS Holding's main subsidiary. OSLO extended its recovery with the all-share index up 6.24 to 443.13 in active turnover of NKr430m on the stronger dollar and better oil prices. HELSINKI did likewise in in the year's largest volume, the Hex index rising 7.90 to 861.20 in turnover of FM58.1m, of which free shares made up FM24.6m. STOCKHOLM saw continued interest in Astra as its A unrestricted shares added SKr4 to SKr570 while its B unrestricted shares fell SKr8 to SKr552. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 0.6 to 958.6 in turnover of SKr417m after SKr384m. AMSTERDAM concentrated on dollar-earners and stocks which had lagged behind in the second half of last year. The CBS Tendency Index closed 1.1 higher at 118.0. Heineken went as high as Fl 164.90 before ending unchanged at Fl 164.10 on takeover rumours, which were dismissed by analysts as unlikely. BRUSSELS rose in line with the rest of Europe. The Bel-20 Index added 7.08 to 1,114.86  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JAN 14  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm    3 pm    close 1110.86  1111.61  1110.40  1111.38  1112.27  1112.41 1112.58 1112.87  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High  1113.30    Day's Low  1110.38  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Jan 13    Jan 10   Jan 9     Jan 8     Jan 7 1105.02   1105.40  1100.02   1080.21   1086.06  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Retailers launch new consortium RETAILERS will tonight launch the British Rail Consortium, which is intended to give the industry a more cohesive voice. The BRC, which has been formed through the merger of the Retail Consortium and the British Retailers Association, will represent the industry from corner shops to high street multiples. The BRC claims to represent 90 per cent of the retail industry, but some big retailers still choose to remain outside the organisation. The John Lewis Partnership left the former Retailer Consortium several years ago, saying it did not wish to be associated with some of the other members, which it condemned for opening stores on Sundays.</p>

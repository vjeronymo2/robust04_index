			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Soft economy and falling bonds hit Dow Wall Street SHARE prices on Wall Street retreated sharply yesterday as the market's earlier euphoria over Germany's interest rates cut faded and there was further statistical evidence of the extremely sluggish performance of the US economy, writes Alan Friedman in New York. Declining prices in the US Treasury bond market also aggravated sentiment in the equity area, as did the conviction that interest rates in the UK and elsewhere could remain high notwithstanding the Bundesbank's unusual action on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 48.90 down at 3,327.32, while trading volume on the New York SE stood at 212m shares. At least part of the Dow's decline was interpreted by dealers as a technical reaction to Monday's 70-point upsurge. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 5.50 to 419.77 and the Nasdaq composite index was off 6.35 at 587.86. Mr John Parasco, a senior vice-president of trading at Lehman Brothers in New York, said stock prices had been weakened both by soft economic news and by falling bond prices. Among the macro-economic statistics released yesterday was a 0.5 per cent decline in August retail sales, worse than expected. Consumer prices last month were up by 0.3 per cent, in line with expectations. The US current account deficit for the second quarter - Dollars 17bn - was above expectations of a deficit of about Dollars 13bn or Dollars 14bn for the quarter. Disappointment at the rather slim cut in German interest rates and a sense that the market had overreacted on Monday were key factors for equity traders. The German rate cut at first came as a relief, but by yesterday many in New York had come round to the view that the move did not offer any long-term solutions. Especially hard hit yesterday were share prices in the computer and airline industries. Computer share prices were sinking yesterday after Amdahl signalled that its products were suffering from weak demand and offered a bleak earnings outlook. IBM weakened Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 85 1/2 . Airline issues were down after Mr Robert Crandall, chairman of AMR, the parent of American Airlines, told analysts that the company's third-quarter losses would exceed those already suffered in the second quarter. AMR relinquished Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 58 3/4 . Among the most active issues, AT&amp;T dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 44 5/8 on about 2m shares traded, while General Motors lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 33 7/8 on volume of 1.6m shares. Canada SOLID GAINS in gold shares limited the overall decline in Toronto as the market pulled back from Monday's 30-point advance. The TSE 300 index ended 6.3 off at 3,464.1 and declines led rises by 313 to 281 after volume of 30.5m shares valued at CDollars 317.7m. Gold shares followed through on Monday's gains in gold futures, in spite of a mild easing in Comex gold futures yesterday. American Barrick put on CDollars 1 1/2 to CDollars 38 5/8 , Pegasus Gold CDollars  5/8 to CDollars 21 1/2 , Hemlo Gold CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 10 1/8 and Placer Dome CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 12 7/8.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Book collection to be sold at Sotheby's auction The finest collection of early printed books to be sold at auction for more than 50 years will be offered at Sotheby's in London on July 1, Antony Thorncroft writes. There are almost 400 volumes including one illustrated with this hand-coloured woodblock, and they seem certain to fetch more than Pounds 3m. The books come from the court library of Prince Joachim zu Furstenberg, and some were bought by the family direct from the printers. Many are in their original bindings. Books from 52 towns and more than 160 presses are represented. Rarities include an almanac of 1462 believed to be the first example of printing from Vienna and a first edition of the 'Speculum humanae salvationis' with the text in Latin and in German 'for nuns and other religious persons who do not understand Latin'.</p>

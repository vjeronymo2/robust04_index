			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIMITING TERMS OF ELECTED OFFICIALS  </P> <P> Now, Henry, you know very well that incumbents cannot lose once they have  entrenched themselves long enough to amass a war chest and build a political  barter system.  </P> <P> You also know that many non-voters are not satisfied with the representation  they have; they are just convinced that the incumbent cannot be defeated  because he has the support of the moneyed special interest groups.  </P> <P> Most Americans have faith in democracy. It's today's politicians they mistrust.  So the movements to limit tenure.  </P> <P> MARGARET W. ROMANI  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov's office said after he  met  with a delegation from the European Union that the talks could  be held "under the auspices of the United Nations and with the  help of the European Union."    The EU delegation headed by European Commissioner for  Foreign  Relations Hans van den Broek was to relay the Macedonian offer  to Greek authorities who broke off negotiations on the dispute  last October.    Van den Broek said he would meet Greek Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias later Wednesday and Greek Prime Minister  Andreas Papandreou the following day. He hinted that he may  then return to Skopje for further discussions.    Van den Broek stressed that it was essential to end the  dispute between the two countries to avoid an escalation of the  conflict, which has irked Greece's EU partners who have  threatened to haul Athens before the European Court of Justice.    "Both sides are aware they they are living in a dangerous  part of the world," van den Broek said. "And good neighboring  relations between Athens and Skopje are a prerequisite to  prevent an escalation in the region."    Greece announced on February 16 that it was blocking all  trade to Macedonia through the northern Greek port of Salonika,  which handles most of the country's imports including oil.    Athens justified the move by citing Macedonia's "continual  provocations and growing irredentist intransigence" and by  claiming that the former Yugoslav republic has territorial  ambitions in the northern Greek province of the same name.    Earlier Wednesday Papoulias said that Athens wishes to have  good relations with its neighbor but the latter must accept the  "logical" demands made by the Greek Government.    The demands call for "Skopje", the name Athens uses to  designate Macedonia, to stop "hostile propaganda" against  Greece, to remove from its national flag a sun symbol that  reflects the ancient Greek dynasty of Macedonia and to remove a  constitutional clause calling for the liberation of Macedonia.    Meanwhile, Belgium Wednesday, in an apparent affront to  Athens over the seemingly endless dispute, recognized The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the provisional name given it  pending a resolution of the conflict.    Six other EU countries recognised Macedonia before Greece  took over the Union's revolving six-month presidency in January.</p>

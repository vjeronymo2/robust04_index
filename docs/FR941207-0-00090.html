			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Final Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following is a section-by-section summary of the amended regulations, together with a discussion of the applicable comments on the corresponding provisions of the Interim Regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Part 251_Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels Rules of Procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Part 251 contains most of the rules and procedures governing the operation of the CARPs and, like the rules proposed in the NPRM, received the greatest number of observations and suggestions from the commentators. It is divided into seven subparts, identified as subparts A through F. Subpart A, entitled ``Organization,'' describes the composition and selection process for the CARPs. Subparts B and C, ``Public Access to Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel Meetings'' and ``Public Access to and Inspection of Records,'' remain virtually the same as those adopted in the Interim Regulations, with only a few minor amendments. Subpart D, ``Standards of Conduct,'' prescribes the financial and ethical requirements for arbitrators, and governs  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  communications, billing, sanctions for misconduct, and other matters involving ethical standards. Subpart E, ``Procedures of Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels,'' prescribes the procedures to be followed by the CARPs in conducting proceedings, including those governing submission of evidence, conduct of hearings, reports of the CARPs, and orders of the Librarian. Subparts F and G,'' Rate Adjustment Proceedings'' and ``Royalty Fee Distribution Proceedings,'' provide certain additional requirements inherent in rate adjustment and distribution proceedings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have already described most of the major issues raised by the commentators to the Interim Regulations and discussed our responses and amendments. The following summarizes other additions and changes to the Interim Regulations in the various subparts of part 251.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Subpart A_Organization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Arbitrator lists.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 251.3 describes the information that must be submitted to the Librarian by an arbitration association for each person to be eligible to serve on a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel. Section 251.3(a)(5) requires ``a description or schedule detailing fees proposed to be charged by the person for service on a CARP.'' James Cannings submits that the proposed fees ``should reflect the current market daily or hourly rate as are charged by arbitrators who serve National Arbitration Associations, such as, the Arbitration Association of America.'' Cannings, comments at 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For reasons stated above in the discussion of our rejection of a fee schedule, it is not appropriate for the Librarian or the Copyright Office to impose fee restrictions on persons seeking to be arbitrators. Although the fee information provided by a potential arbitrator will have a bearing on his or her selection, we decline to amend &sect;251.3(a)(5) to adopt fee limitations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Qualifications of the arbitrators. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As was the case with the comments filed in response to the NPRM in this rulemaking proceeding, Copyright Owners had disparate opinions regarding the requirement in &sect;251.5 that all CARP arbitrators be admitted to the practice of law. Program Suppliers filed a separate comment in response to the Interim Regulations devoted solely to arguing that the Librarian should also consider non-lawyers in the selection process, while other copyright owners identified as Certain Copyright Owners filed a separate comment urging that the Copyright Office retain the requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program Suppliers advance essentially the same argument, which they made in response to the NPRM, that allowing non-lawyers as arbitrators could prove invaluable in expediting the arbitration process:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In reaching its ruling, the Office ignored the important value that non-lawyers with expertise in the types of statistical and economic studies that comprise the heart and body of distribution and rate adjustment evidence could bring to the decisionmaking process. Having arbitrators who are familiar with statistical and economic studies similar to those presented in prior rate adjustment and distribution proceedings would give each panel added competence to deal with the substantive issues raised, and thus assist the decisionmaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is ironic, to say the least, that the Office's ruling was based on a concern about the lack of time for non-lawyers to learn the nuances of legal rulings, but ignored the possibility that lawyer-arbitrators might have absolutely no familiarity with the type of complex studies presented by expert witnesses over and over again in prior distribution and rate adjustment hearings. Although legal rulings can affect certain aspects of a hearing, interpretation and understanding of the conflicting substantive evidence is crucial to reasoned final determinations setting rates or distribution royalties. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Program Suppliers, comments at 2&hyph;3. Program Suppliers believe that retaining subsection (c) of &sect;251.5 requiring arbitrators to have ``[e]xperience in conducting arbitration proceedings or facilitating the resolution and settlement of disputes'' would satisfactorily provide the potential arbitrator with the type of experience necessary to conduct arbitration proceedings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> at 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Certain Copyright Owners argue that Program Suppliers' arguments have already been rejected in the Interim Regulations, and that Program Suppliers fail to make any showing that ``the list already developed will fail to yield at least three Panel members who are capable of resolving royalty disputes in a fair and efficient manner.'' Certain Copyright Owners, reply comments at 2. Certain Copyright Owners believe that economic expertise is not necessary, and might cause an undue bias among the panel members.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Copyright Office has reconsidered the lawyer requirement imposed by &sect;251.5 and reaffirms its decision to retain the requirement. It appears that Program Suppliers are not so much concerned with allowing non-lawyers to serve on CARP panels as they are with seeing economists among the listed arbitrators. Section 251.5 in no way prevents economists or those with economic training from serving on a CARP, provided that they are admitted to the practice of law. Furthermore, we agree with Certain Copyright Owners' observation that Program Suppliers have failed to demonstrate any deficiency in the quality of experience of the potential arbitrators appearing on the current list.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 59 FR 24486 (1994). The listed arbitrators have diverse backgrounds and training, including economic expertise. Moreover, all of the listed persons have experience in the practice of law which, given the shortness of the arbitration period, is important in the efficiency and speedy disposition of CARP proceedings. The Copyright Office, therefore, declines to make any changes to &sect;251.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Subpart B_Public Access to Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel Meetings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> CARP Meetings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Copyright Owners make several suggestions with respect to meetings of the CARPs. Because confidential proprietary information is sometimes introduced into the record, it is necessary for the CARP to close a meeting for the purposes of receiving that information. When confidential material is involved in only a limited portion of the meeting, it is not necessary to close the entire meeting. The Interim Regulations, however, provide only for the closing of an entire meeting. Copyright Owners therefore suggest that &sect;&sect;251.11(b) and 251.13 be amended to make clear that a CARP may close only that part of a meeting during which confidential information is discussed; all other portions of the meeting, however, would be open. Copyright Owners, comments at 26.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copyright Owners also note that because it is often impossible to determine when and if confidential information may be disclosed at a meeting, it may be impossible to give the seven-day advance notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  required by &sect;251.11(b). Copyright Owners therefore suggest that a general notice of the possibility of the introduction of confidential information during the course of a hearing should suffice to meet the notice requirements even though it would be impossible to provide a specific date and time of the closed portion of the meeting.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another issue raised by Copyright Owners is the treatment of a CARP's internal deliberations. According to Copyright Owners, a literal reading of Subpart B would apply to confidential deliberations among CARP arbitrators. ``Thus, for example, if the members of a CARP want to talk over an objection to testimony during the course of a hearing before ruling on it, they would be obliged to have that discussion transcribed and to announce the fact of that confidential `meeting' in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> at 26&hyph;27. Copyright Owners therefore propose that the procedures of &sect;&sect;251.14 and 251.15 be modified so that (a) transcripts or minutes are not necessary for internal CARP deliberations, and (b) the procedures for closed meetings in &sect;251.14 do not apply to such deliberations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> at 27.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The points made by Copyright Owners are well taken. In order to allow CARPs to close only a portion of a meeting, as opposed to an entire meeting, for the taking of confidential information and related material, we are amending &sect;&sect;251.11(b) and 251.13 by adding the phrase ``any portion of a meeting.'' With respect to seven-day advance publication notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of a meeting that may be closed in part or in whole, we agree that a general notice of the possibility of the introduction of confidential information should suffice to satisfy the notice requirements. The notice of publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  therefore shall, as a matter of policy, contain such a general statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

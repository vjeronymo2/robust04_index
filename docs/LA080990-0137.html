			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> RENT SUBSIDY FUNDS OKD  </P> <P> The Redevelopment Agency on Monday approved $220,000 to augment its federally  funded Section 8 program to assist an additional 40 low-income families with  rent subsidies.  </P> <P> The money would be used to assist households that have an income of between 50%  and 80% of median income for the area, calculated to be between $20,850 and  $31,099 per year for a family of four, according to a staff report.  </P> <P> In 1983, the federal government restricted eligibility for the Section 8  program to include only those families with incomes up to 50% of the median,  according to the report. The additional funding approved Monday would allow an  additional 40 families to qualify for the program.  </P> <P> Families assisted by the Section 8 program pay participating landlords about  25% of their monthly income toward the monthly rent, and the program  contributes the rest, according to the report.  </P> <P> The program is intended to be a temporary measure to help the working poor  become more self-sufficient by allowing them to devote more of their income to  food, health care, and job training and education, according to Redevelopment  Director Jody Hall-Esser.  </P> <P> State community redevelopment law requires the agency to set aside funds for  low- and moderate-income housing programs.  </P></p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas maps out flight path for 1990s - Nikki Tait looks at the company's progress and restructuring plans and puts them into perspective John McDonnell, chairman of McDonnell Douglas, could not be accused of false modesty. 'When the going gets tough,' began his message to shareholders in the company's latest annual report, 'the tough get going . . . It is an apt description of our position.' No one questions the difficulties which are being faced by America's number one defence contractor and the world's third largest commercial airline builder. In the aftermath of the cold war, US defence spending is falling at a rate of more than 5 per cent a year, and government business still accounts for more than half McDonnell Douglas' sales. On the airline side, the company ranks behind Boeing of the US and Europe's Airbus, two strong competitors. This market, too, is likely to be difficult until the mid-1990s: major airlines, having ordered new aircraft with heady enthusiasm in the late-1980s, are scaling back in the recession-hit 1990s. Moreover, stretched financially, McDonnell Douglas needs wealthy partners if it is to develop its jet operations - in particular, the new and much-trumpeted MD-12 jumbo. Negotiations, notably with Taiwan Aerospace, have so far come to nothing. But what is moot is whether this week's announcement of a major restructuring in McDonnell's military/government operations signals that the company is turning a corner - as the same annual report's cover so proudly boasts. For once, Wall Street, which has not been kind to the company of late, seems favourably impressed. Since Monday, the shares have gained over Dollars 6, an 18 per cent advance. Several analysts have raised their 1992 profit forecasts, and a number of brokerage houses now rank the shares a 'buy'. Given that the stock is still trading at half its level a year ago, this is not a major endorsement. But it is a small step in the right direction. Details of the restructuring remain opaque. Broadly, the company plans to divide the six businesses geographically, into two divisions. One, based on the west coast, will take in the space-related projects, electronic systems and the C-17 military transport programme. The other, centred in St Louis, Missouri, will incorporate the missile, combat aircraft and helicopter operations. The mechanics of this reorganisation will be worked out over the next three months by a newly-created 'office of the chairman', comprising five senior executives. In the meantime, McDonnell Douglas declines to speculate on the potential cost-savings. But it does acknowledge that jobs will go, as duplicate administrative functions, like personnel, are rationalised. On the manufacturing front, at least one plant - making aircraft parts in Columbus, Ohio - will close next year. It employs 1,000 people. The aim is to find either a buyer or a joint venture partner for the helicopter business, which has annual sales of about Dollars 750m. That, suggests one analyst, could bring in approximately Dollars 500m if the first course is pursued. For some observers, it is the implied culture change - rather than the numbers alone - which is providing the encouragement. News of job cuts and re-trenchment are nothing new at McDonnell Douglas: only last month, for example, it told employees that up to 5,000 positions could be axed in the commercial aviation division by the end of the year. But Mr John McDonnell's statement this week suggested a commitment to only those businesses where McDonnell is, or could become, a market leader - that is, number one or two worldwide. This, say the bulls, could herald a more focused approach. 'We view it as a positive development,' commented Tassos Philippakos, vice-president at Moody's Investors Service, the Wall Street rating agency. 'It's a shift in emphasis on to the bottom line and the financial side, rather than assertions that McDonnell Douglas is the leading defence contractor and a big commercial airline manufacturer'. 'Obviously, a culture change has more long-term implications than just a drastic reduction in the head count.' But if Monday's news was generally viewed as a step in the right direction, the downside is that all questions overhanging the commercial airline operations remain unanswered. For months, analysts have been sceptical about the company's ability to proceed with the MD-12 programme. 'The wrong airplane at the wrong time and the wrong price,' ran one recent circular. However, without the MD-12, there are fears that the company will continue to cede ground to Airbus and Boeing, with their wider range of products, and its market share will dwindle inexorably. Under this week's reorganisation plans, the commercial aircraft operations would appear to become even more segregated. That, in turn, has prompted renewed speculation that McDonnell Douglas will quit the business altogether, either by selling or phasing out its operations. The Missouri company, however, publicly reaffirmed its commitment. And it is worth putting Wall Street's response to the week's news into perspective. After all, McDonnell shares have been sitting on a extremely low rating, back at levels seen two years ago, and way below the company's book value of Dollars 105 a share. The stock, moreover, fell heavily when second-quarter earnings showed a 51 per cent dive, to Dollars 38m, earlier this month. In short, if this is progress, it comes against a very unprogressive background.</p>

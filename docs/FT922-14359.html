			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / EC lifts embargo on oil exports to South Africa THE European Community yesterday lifted its ban on oil sales to South Africa, and paved the way for renewed sporting, cultural and scientific links. The moves brought an instant welcome from Dr Bhadra Ranchod, South Africa's ambassador to the EC, who said his country had had to compensate for the embargo by spending more on synthetic fuels, on stockpiling oil imported from other sources, and on prospecting for oil within South Africa and its waters. EC oil companies established in South Africa, such as Shell and BP, would be far freer to operate there, Dr Ranchod said. The decision paves the way for countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium to re-negotiate the cultural accords they broke off in 1985 when United Nations and EC sanctions were stepped up. South African academics and students will also have easier access to European universities, Dr Ranchod said. The only remaining EC sanctions on South Africa are those mandated by the UN Security Council banning the sale of arms to, and the exchange of military attaches with, South Africa. Oil industry operators in South Africa welcomed the unexpected announcement, but noted that the Community's decision will have limited financial impact. For the past few years South Africa has been buying its crude at world prices, paying little if any premium. The diminished impact of the embargo was already evident last year when the government announced it would sell part of its strategic reserve to finance social upliftment. It will, however, allow South Africa to diversify its sources of supply. The country will also be able to trade crude oil products openly. What remains unclear is the extent to which yesterday's announcement will undermine the United Nations embargo which remains. Locally, it will provide added impetus for the decentralisation of oil procurement, which has been controlled by the Central Energy Fund. Shipping Research Bureau, an Amsterdam based monitoring group, estimated that South Africa's oil imports cost Dollars 1.6bn in 1989. Demand is about 30 per cent below that of the mid-1970s due mainly to progress made by South Africa in achieving a level of self-sufficiency through developing a synthetic fuel industry which converts coal to oil and gas. Deborah Hargreaves adds: Oil traders do not believe the EC move will have much impact on world prices. 'We could see some temporary distortions in the trade flows of certain oil products,' said Mr Joe Stanislaw of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, 'but there will be no huge spate of demand opened up.'</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Frankfurt A shiver ran through the market last Thursday when BASF, the first to report of the 'big three' chemical groups, came out with a 41 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits which was below, in some cases well below, analysts' targets for this stage of 1994. However, Mr Martin Glen at Lehman Brothers said BASF was subject to restructuring and a line of its own for 'other expenses' before it came to the pre-tax level. Given the unpredictability of this effect on the BASF figures, he would not alter his forecasts of bumper results from Hoechst and Bayer, due Wednesday and Thursday respectively. Mr Glen is going for a 33 per cent rise in Hoechst pre-tax profits, reflecting cost reduction and restructuring, and a 22 per cent gain for Bayer which has a more defensive product mix.</p>

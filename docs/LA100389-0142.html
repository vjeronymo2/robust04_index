			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEW HOME SALES DECLINE 0.4% AS INTEREST CLIMBS  </P> <P> Sales of new homes fell 0.4% in August, dropping back slightly from a huge  double-digit gain in July, the government reported today. Mortgage rates edged  up at the same time.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said that new single-family homes were sold at a  seasonally adjusted annual rate of 755,000 units in August, following a 16.1%  gain in July, the largest increase in nearly three years.  </P> <P> The July sales increase was the largest monthly advance since September, 1986,  when sales climbed 22.9%.  </P> <P> Analysts had credited the July advance to a decline in fixed-rate mortgages  which had fallen to 9.81% by the end of that month from a peak of 11.22% last  March.  </P> <P> But rates edged back up to 10.22% by the end of August, according to a monthly  survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., contributing to the decline in  home sales that month.  </P></p>

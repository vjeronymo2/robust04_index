			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Drifting into a tangled net: With beef farmers and fishermen up in arms, are EU rules turning the continent animal crackers? The sight of Cornish trawlermen nursing their broken drift nets and their injured pride after being attacked by Spanish tuna fishermen this week, has incensed British fishing organisations. But the escalating 'tuna war' is not an isolated outburst: its causes strike at the heart of the European Union's common fishing and conservation policies. The reason for the clash lies in the distinctive fishing methods employed by Spain and other EU fleets. Spanish fishermen use baited lines to land their tuna, as they have been doing for generations. In the late 1980s, the UK, France, Ireland and other EU countries began to invest in large trawlers with nets stretching towards the horizon. Spain's Galician and Basque country fishermen whom the British trawlermen have described as a 'wolf pack', are threatening to go on the attack again if they spot EU vessels using long drifts nets in the Bay of Biscay. 'Of course we don't condone violent action,' said Mr Rafael Conde, director-general of fishing resources at Madrid's agriculture and fisheries ministry yesterday. 'But the attacks are not the problem, they are the symptoms of the problem.' The Spanish government alleges that the real irritant is the systematic abuse by the UK, French and Irish fleets of the 2.5km limit imposed by the EU on the length of drift nets. Their suspicions appeared to be confirmed yesterday when a Royal Navy ship seized fishing gear from a Cornish trawler suspected of flouting the rules on net size. The Spanish authorities, which use satellite equipment to measure the length from the bow of a trawler to the bouys marking the end of the drift net, insist there is persistent flouting of the EU's rules. The European Commission agrees with the Spanish that the rules are often broken and, in April, called on governments whose fishermen use drift nets to step up their monitoring procedures. The Commission says it drew particular attention to the tuna area which is such a long way from shore it is harder to police. 'Happily no one has been killed so far and that is what we feared would happen,' said a Commission official of the latest dispute. 'But at least this incident has forced member states to take the issue of policing more seriously.' Four EU inspectors have gone to the Bay of Biscay to monitor the measuring of drift nets by patrol boats from countries fishing in the area. A fifth is on his way to the site of the current dispute in Spain. Madrid wants the EU to ban drift nets altogether, but in the meantime is urging Brussels to ensure that each member country strictly enforces the limitation on the lengths of the drift nets used by their fleets. The Commission is sympathetic to Spain's plea for a ban on the nets, and has asked EU fishing ministers to consider phasing them out on environmental grounds. Last year 1,000 dolphins were caught in the nets as well as thousands of other smaller fish. EU ministers have so far failed to reach a consensus on banning the nets, which allow fishermen to increase their catch. A trawler using such nets can land about 105 tonnes of tuna in the June-August season in the Bay of Biscay against the average 35 tonnes that the smaller Spanish vessels catch using lines. The 700 ships that make up Spain's tuna fleet caught 25,000 tonnes of fish last year, while the 60 trawlers of the French fleet, the next largest in the EU, caught 6,300 tonnes. The emotional argument over drift nets and policing masks the real concern in Europe over dwindling fishing stocks and common access by all fishermen to each country's waters. 'As long as you have fishermen, you will have disputes of this nature, not because they are genetically different, but because you don't have clearly defined property rights in the sea,' said one Commission official. British fishermen are angry because they feel they have been pushed out of UK waters by quotas imposed on their catch of white fish such as cod, and competition from other nations' fishing boats. Mr David Pessel, chairman of the Plymouth Trawler Owners' Association, says his fleet used to catch 66 per cent of its fish in British territorial waters, up to 200km from shore, 20 years ago - that figure has fallen to 12 per cent. 'The boats from Newlyn and Mevagissey in Cornwall have been targeting the tuna for the past year because it's very lucrative for them and there's not much left for them to fish here,' he said. The EU so far imposes no quotas on the tuna catch of any member state, but this may change if recent scientific evidence of a drop in tuna numbers is corroborated. Last year the scientific committee for the ICCAT, an international committee based in Madrid that monitors the conservation of Atlantic tuna, warned that the use of drift nets had, for the first time, clearly begun to deplete the tuna population. The scientists also noted what the fishermen know only to well: the tuna, which migrate from south of the Azores towards the Bay of Biscay in early summer, were staying further and further away from the coast. Some of the main banks of fish are now to be found up to 800km offshore. 'The tuna isn't tonto (stupid),' says Mr Conde. 'We're dealing with a smart fish who every year will try and avoid the drift nets.' The Spanish tuna catchers say their method of fishing with lines is more environmentally sound as they do not hook dolphins, an argument supported by Greenpeace, the environmental organisation. Its Rainbow Warrior vessel was also on the look-out this week in the Bay of Biscay for illegal drift nets. The British have tried to get round the problem by opening up 'dolphin doors' in their nets to enable the larger creatures to escape. 'There is a lot of scaremongering going on, but we are genuinely and seriously interested in conservation,' said Mr Pessel. While this week's row may be solved by stepping up monitoring procedures, it is nevertheless a further step in the disillusionment of UK fishermen with the EU's common fishing policy. Some are backing a campaign to abandon the policy and regain control of the UK's own territorial waters. 'I'm a good European, but the management of fishing policy has been appalling. Fishermen in this country face going the same way as the coal and steel industries,' said Mr Pessel. But, he says, ignoring EU fishing policy is a solution unlikely to find favour with the UK government. More fish wars could be imminent.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> YOUNGSTERS BRING GIFTS TO SHELTER  </P> <P> Like elves bearing gifts, a bus full of schoolchildren arrived Thursday morning  at Friendship Shelter with freshly baked bread, Christmas tree ornaments and  almost $400 cash meant to brighten the holidays at the city's only homeless  shelter.  </P> <P> More than 50 youngsters bound up the stairs and filled an upstairs sitting room  where, moments before, three residents had quietly untangled strands of lights  for a bare Christmas tree in the corner of the room.  </P> <P> The youngsters, all from the Community Learning Center, an  alternative-education program at Top of The World Elementary School, carried  handmade ornaments, bright red stockings and cranberry scones for Christmas  morning. Paul Lithgow, a 26-year-old resident, exchanged greetings and  high-fives with several boys: "Hey dudes, how's it going?"  </P> <P> As they deposited their gifts, the first- through fourth-grade children took  turns telling how they earned money to help shelter residents. A youngster with  freckles and bright blue eyes said he created a money-making magic show,  another boy sold used books on the school playground and a third child washed  cars.  </P> <P> One young entrepreneur raised $31 selling lemonade during a school soccer game.  Kyra Pitt, 10, earned $15 doing household chores with her 7-year-old brother,  Ryan.  </P> <P> "I like helping people," she said.  </P> <P> And 6-year-old Amanda David, who wore a crimson sweat shirt with "I Believe In  Santa Claus" on the chest, said she broke her piggy bank to get money for the  shelter.  </P> <P> Teacher Kathie Reynolds said she is proud of the children's response to a  community need.  </P> <P> "It represents so much hard work on their part, and thoughtfulness," she said.  </P> <P> Heather Davis-Barton, the day supervisor, thanked the children and said, "We  wouldn't have ornaments for the tree if you hadn't come or any decorations for  the house."  </P> <P> It was the third year that youngsters, parents and teachers from the school  have focused their efforts on Friendship Shelter, director Colin Henderson  said.  </P> <P> "It's kind of glaring as far as what most people expect to have at Christmas  and what people in the shelter can expect," Henderson said. "A lot of people in  the shelter get extremely depressed in the holiday season. It reminds them of  Christmas in childhood when things were much easier."  </P> <P> Thursday morning, after the youngsters piled back onto the bus and quiet again  settled over the sitting room, Lithgow smiled broadly and said he will help  decorate the tree with the boxes of ornaments and paper chains that were left  stacked nearby.  </P> <P> "It helped me get in the spirit a little more," he said.

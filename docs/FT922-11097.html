			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / UK Company News: Irish Life below forecast in dull equity markets IRISH LIFE, the Republic's largest insurer in the life and pensions market and its biggest fund manager, reported embedded value for 1991 of IPounds 540m (Pounds 490m). This is IPounds 5m less than forecast in the prospectus at flotation last July, reflecting the general fall in equity and property markets since the group was valued at March 31 last year. Embedded value - a financial yardstick increasingly used by life assurance companies to more accurately reflect their market worth and earnings - measures the net value of present and future surpluses expected to be generated on current business on the company's books. In Irish Life's case it includes income generated from both its investment and insurance arms. These first full results since privatisation showed pre-tax profits of IPounds 40.6m. A dividend of 5.44p is recommended, payable from earnings of 10.23p per share. Mr David Kingston, chief executive, said that embedded profits arising from investment business 'were substantially lower' than forecast due to the poor performance of the equity and property markets. However, these have been largely offset by higher embedded profits resulting from a 13 per cent growth in new recurring premium sales in Ireland last year to IPounds 50.4m, which has increased Irish Life's domestic market share in the life, endowment mortgages and pensions businesses from 27.7 per cent to 29.5 per cent. Overall premium income in Ireland fell by 3 per cent to IPounds 448.7m, due to a sharp fall in the more volatile single premium market. In the UK total premium income grew by 12 per cent to IPounds 93.1m,although new business in recurring premiums fell by 10 per cent to IPounds 19m. US premium income jumped 94 per cent to IPounds 78.3m.</p>

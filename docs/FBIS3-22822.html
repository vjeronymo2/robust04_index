"The potential for danger is rising," State Minister Bernd  Schmidbauer (Christian Democratic Union), who is responsible for  the intelligence services, admitted, but he added that, despite  intensive observation of the market, there have not been any  signs of a threat by nuclear terrorists. "So far, there is no  indication at all. Weapons-grade material has not turned up in  our country at all.... Terrorists do not have access to  weapons-grade material because it is not available on the  market," he said in an interview with RTL.    "It can still be ruled out that nuclear warheads are  available in an uncontrolled manner," the newsmagazine quotes a  report by the Federal Intelligence Office (BND). However,  referring to the same source, DER SPIEGEL warns that nuclear  bombs and biological weapons from Eastern Europe could soon be  in the hands "of Western gangs."    In its 18-page report the BND speaks of a "trend toward an  escalation of the situation." Centers of smuggling include  Vilnius and Kamas in Lithuania. According to the magazine, the  FRG has become the hub for nuclear smuggling. Schmidbauer  explained this by referring to the FRG's geographical location.  The minister reported that over the past two years 300 to 350  cases of illegal nuclear trade or smuggling have been registered.    The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna also  does not assume that blackmailers will soon have access to  nuclear weapons. "So far, we have not noticed anything like  that in our worldwide monitoring," a spokesman said in an  interview with the private radio station RADIO 7 in Ulm. The  IAEA has helped the CIS states to establish inspection bodies so  as to prevent trade of weapons-grade material.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Gaddum softens D-Mark THE DOLLAR gained more than 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday after a Bundesbank council member hinted that there could be another reduction in official German interest rates this week, writes James Blitz. In recent weeks, Bundesbank officials have been hawkish about the prospect of more monetary easing in Germany, because of fears of inflation, the weakness of the D-Mark and the growing German money supply. Indeed, the last easing in German monetary policy came more than a month ago, when the repo rate was cut to 7.60 per cent. Yesterday, Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, the directorate member responsible for credit market operations, changed the mood, saying a slowdown in the pace of German money supply expansion could give the Bundesbank room to lower interest rates. This was seen by dealers as a strong indication that the M3 money supply figures might fall within the 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target band set by the Bundesbank. In the first four months of the year, M3 expanded at a seasonally adjusted and annualised 7.0 per cent. In the European afternoon, the dollar rose sharply against the D-Mark on the back of these comments. Initially the dollar had weakened to below DM1.62 after the US consumer price inflation data for May showed a monthly rise of 0.1 per cent, against market forecasts of 0.2 per cent. This underlined expectations that the Federal Reserve would not lean towards tightening short-term interest rates to curb inflation. But Mr Gaddum's comments reversed the trend: the dollar peaked at DM1.6413 and finished at DM1.6375, up more than a pfennig on the day. In New York it ended higher at DM1.6460. The US currency's strength helped to reverse another strong performance by the yen in Tuesday's Asian trading. The yen hit a post-war high of Y104.75 per dollar in Far Eastern trading. But this was seen as a strong technical resistance barrier, and it lost ground in the European morning, dipping to Y105.88. In New York it closed at Y105.85. There were strong rumours in London that the Bundesbank and other European central banks were intervening on behalf of the dollar. But these rumours could not be confirmed, and it was far from clear that it was in the Bundesbank's interest to support the dollar at the current time. European currency trading was thin, although the D-Mark showed some signs of weakness at the start of the European day, dropping to minus 17 percentage points against its divergence indicator. Sterling rose most noticeably against the D-Mark, boosted by a Confederation of British Industry survey which showed that retailers were more optimistic about business prospects over the next three months than at any time since February 1987. The pound closed at DM2.4925 from a previous DM2.4800.</p>

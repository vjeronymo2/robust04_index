			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Yuriy Sizov] </F>   [Text] Kiev May 26 TASS -- "We should take joint efforts to  avoid media confrontation. This can be achieved mostly by means  of consultations, negotiations and compromises", Ukraine  president's spokesman Viktor Stelmakh said in an exclusive  interview with TASS on Thursday.    Commenting on the decision by Ukraine's Foreign Ministry to  strip three newsmen of the Ostankino TV network of their  accreditation and on the protest of Russian media chiefs against  this decision, the spokesman noted that recently Ukraine had  become "an objective of a massed information onslaught by  Russian and some foreign mass media", adding that "for some  objective reasons, our information capacities cannot be  considered adequate".    "Perhaps this prompted the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry to  resort to such a drastic measure as a means of self-defence", he  explained.    According to Stelmakh, Ukraine is also concerned over  certain  statements by Russian top officials, which he described as "far  from being friendly", which cannot but affect relations between  the two countries.    The spokesman expressed confidence that there would not be  any reasons for "raising a question about violation of  international law with respect to media representatives" if the  two states carry on a constructive dialogue for better mutual  understanding and if newsmen comply with rules of journalists'  ethics.    Stelmakh dismissed recent reports about the possibility of  discriminatory measures towards TASS correspondents in Ukraine.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Show Constant Concern for the </F> Well-Being of the Masses"]    [Text] Leading comrades of the central authorities are  very much concerned about the well-being of the masses. Not  long ago, they urged various localities and departments to  conscientiously help a considerable number of people settle  their problems in living.    Showing concern for the well-being of the masses is our  party's fine tradition, and an important embodiment of our  party's mass standpoint and mass line. Whether in the  revolutionary war period or in the socialist construction  period, our party has always considered the work of being  concerned about the well-being of the masses as an important  task. Reform is the cause of hundreds of millions of people.  It is difficult to succeed in reform without the broad masses'  wholehearted support and active participation, and the  well-being of the masses is an important factor determining  their enthusiasm for participating in reform. One of the main  reasons our reform and opening up is supported by vast numbers  of cadres and the broad masses is that the last decade or so was  the period in which the people's living standard improved most  rapidly and the masses gained the most benefit. In order to  accomplish the reform work this year, to smoothly promote the  establishment of socialist market economic system, and to  realize the magnificent goals of struggle, we must be concerned  about the well-being of the masses and take practical measures  to solve some of the difficulties and problems encountered by  the masses in their lives.    With the profound development of reform and opening up, the  incomes of the broad masses are always on the rise and their  living is improving constantly. According to the State  Statistical Bureau, in the first quarter of this year, the  monthly per capita living expenses and income of urban dwellers  increased by 35.5 percent compared with the same period last  year, whereas the per capita cash earnings of people in the  countryside increased by 31.1 percent. After allowing for price  increases, real growth rates were 9.3 percent and 13.1 percent  respectively. This indicates that reform and development  embodies the broad masses' fundamental interests, and that our  party and government are truly concerned about the well-being of  the masses. Under the new situation of deepening reform and  promoting development, and at a time when the people's living  standard is constantly improving, some new conflicts and  problems also have arisen. For example, owing to the combined  effect of various factors, workers and staff of some enterprises  that are in the red and have completely or partially suspended  production, peasants in poverty-stricken areas, and some retired  workers and staff have encountered some problems in their  living. These are transient problems under the excellent  situation, problems that have arisen in the process of  development. The party Central Committee and the State Council  attach great importance to these problems and already have taken  a series of important measures, such as bringing down commodity  prices and paying close attention to the "Shopping Basket"  project. We firmly believe that under our party's leadership,  we definitely can solve these transient difficulties and  problems in an appropriate manner through deepening reform and  developing our economy.    What should be affirmed is that most of our leading cadres  take heed of and listen to the voice of the masses, are  sympathetic to the hardships of the masses, and are making every  effort to solve problems closely related to the interests of the  masses, thus vigorously bringing into play the initiative of the  masses so that every undertaking develops steadily. However, a  small number of comrades are not so concerned about the  hardships of the masses and cannot promptly take resolute  measures against arbitrary price increases, disturbances of  social order, and all those matters infringing on the interests  of the masses. Some cadres think only of "their own  achievements," and do not hesitate to take funds earmarked for  the improvement of people's living and channel them into  development projects, but they seldom bother about whether or  not workers and staff can receive their pay on time, whether or  not communications are convenient, to what extent do vegetable  prices rise, whether or not peasants are overburdened, whether  or not new phenomena of issuing IOUs exist, and how to reduce  circulation links and increase peasants' earnings. Some other  cadres even take advantage of their positions and abuse their  power for personal gain, spending public funds for private  enjoyment and overseas travel. All these infringe on the  interests of the masses, and so cannot be allowed. To show our  concern for the well-being of the masses, we definitely must  improve the style of leadership in a conscientious manner, and  must seriously deal with persons and practices in violation of  the law and discipline in accordance with party discipline and  the laws of our country.    We must make strenuous efforts to concern ourselves with the  well-being of the masses. First, we must make in-depth studies  and investigations, and must have a good grasp of the "Shopping  Basket" and the "Rice Bag" projects and other issues closely  related to the well-being of the masses. Second, we must do  things in order of urgency, in light of the situation and our  ability, and try our best to solve the people's problems. Money  must be spent on some problems, so we must coordinate our  financial resources to solve them. However, not much money is  needed for some other problems, so we are required to carry  forward the spirit of arduous struggle, rely on correct policy  decisions, and arouse and rely on the enthusiasm of vast numbers  of cadres and of the broad masses to solve those problems. For  those problems which we are, for the time being, unable to  handle, we still must patiently give clear explanations to the  masses and must draw up feasible plans for solving them so as to  gain the forgiveness of the masses. In brief, our leading  cadres should be in a spirit of "caring for even the  nonessentials" and should rack their brains to concern ourselves  with and improve the well-being of the masses. This is our  fellow Communists' basic task, which must never be forgotten.    Caring about the well-being of the masses is precisely to  care about reform; caring about the well-being of the masses is  precisely to care about development; and caring about the  well-being of the masses is precisely to care about stability.  If we concern ourselves with and conscientiously work for the  interests of the masses, the broad masses certainly will take  part in reform, promote development, and safeguard stability  with extremely great enthusiasm, initiative, and innovation.</p>

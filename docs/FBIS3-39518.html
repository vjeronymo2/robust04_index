			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Massimo Riva: "Liberal Left"] </F>   [Text] In a campaign that is gradually spiralling in the  production of words through the medium of words -- and often of  insults through the medium of other insults -- the "government  program" presented by [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS,  Secretary] Achille Occhetto at least has the merit of creating a  glimmer of hope of rationality and specificity. Having put his  cards on the table, the leader of the progressive alignment can  indeed hope that the other competitors will now abandon fatuous  advertising language and their coarse invective and compete in  the arena of the things that need to be done at this difficult  time in the nation's life. In his 50-page document, the PDS  secretary has made this effort, in a forum and language that  confirm, better than any number of television interviews, the  PDS' break with its past as a communist party.    First and foremost -- though it is tempting to say, at last  -- the program no longer features the cathartic inspiration, so  deep-rooted in the Italian Communist Party's traditional  documents, that implied a vision of politics as an instrument  for spreading happiness among people. Nor, logically and as a  consistent consequence, does it any longer indicate the  metahistorical objective of a transcending of the market economy  and therefore of the real conditions of the world as it is now.    Indeed, the entire program seems to be rooted firmly in  these  very conditions. Indeed, the ultimate goal of the PDS blueprint  seems to be leading to the acceptance of a market economy in a  country that, both in the past and in the present, has always  inclined toward the more comfortable path of protectionism and  unfair promotion of vested interests. There are two assertions  in the introduction to Occhetto's program that deserve to be  examined.    The first says that the precondition for rebuilding the  state  in Italy "is the existence of a government force that cannot be  held to ransom by perverse compromises and unknown potentates  that still influence the republic's life." The second important  statement is the following: "To help business to create wealth  is the precondition for possessing the means to allocate to the  citizens' prosperity, both material and other, and to support  the underprivileged. We cannot distribute that which we do not  have."    Italy's timid -- or, more often, sham -- adherence to the  rules of the market economy in recent decades has been at the  same time both the cause and the effect of a decline in the  relationship between politics and business that has imposed on  the country an overall system of government based on partisan  agreements between those governing the institutions and those  managing businesses. Now the Left is at last displaying an  awareness that its battles on behalf of an alternative system  had no other result than to strengthen, to everyone's detriment,  the mechanism of secret agreements between political and  economic bigwigs, in contempt of the golden rules of free  competition and free trade.    Having reached this realization, the Left is now grasping  and  espousing the weapon of the market as a means of liberating the  country from the heel of the political and business oligopolies.  And it does so through an explicit adherence to one of the  linchpins of a liberal economy when it states, as we have seen,  that "we cannot distribute that which we do not have." You can  turn these words around however you want, but their ultimate  meaning is not very different from, or is indeed identical to,  that of the now famous warning issued by the American monetarist  school, namely, that in modern societies "there is no such thing  as a free lunch."    I do not know whether Occhetto will like this interpretation  of the document that he presented yesterday or whether it will  suit him (looking to his left). But the fact is that his  government program deserves general attention not so much  because of its numerous and detailed social welfare plans  (unemployment, social security, health), but rather because of  its overall approach, which seems to be inspired by the most  solid principles of democratic and liberal thinking.    Liberal, mind -- not liberalist, in accordance with a  fundamental distinction on which both Benedetto Croce and Luigi  Einaudi had some excellent things to say. This, particularly  where it outlines a state that will not submit to the invisible  and domineering hand of business and that will not claim the  right to take its place in despising the rights of freedom.  And, vice versa, of a state that, as a leading actor in  conflicts, will act as their arbiter, will "manage less and  govern more, that will do fewer things but that will help others  to do them." This, precisely in accordance with the teachings  of the liberal doctrine of the state, in contrast to the  liberalist anarchism which is only a disguised version of the  ancient law of the survival of the fittest.    Hitherto this election campaign has profoundly disoriented  the public because of the general and chaotic race by almost all  the political forces to exclusively appropriate the liberal  democratic label. Now the Left has specified its stance in this  area and has defined its identity. It seems highly desirable  that the other competing groups abandon the generic banalities  of television commercials and present the voters with their own  government programs -- equally clear in their principles and  plans -- in order to start practicing the principles of the  market and fair competition in politics too.    Nobody would dream of suggesting that the PDS' program is a  kind of cure-all for the country's problems. Indeed, it  includes some proposals that seem still ill-defined or  unsupported by adequate arguments -- for instance, where it  postulates a growth, albeit sacrosanct, in expenditure on  education of 6-10 percent of GDP, without clarifying to the  detriment of whom and what this would take place. Be that as it  may, however, this examination of the good and bad features of  the PDS program can produce useful and meaningful assessments  only on the basis of a comparison with the proposals and  programs of its rivals.    To be specific: There are a couple of issues that have  particularly occupied the start of the election campaign --  taxation and the media. With regard to the former, Occhetto  says that "a reduction in taxation will be achieved as and when  the general conditions of public finances make it possible." In  other words, it is necessary first to emerge from the trap of  the public deficit by bringing inflation down still further, the  continuation of an incomes policy, and further spending cuts.  This, essentially, is the policy being pursued by the Ciampi  government, and we are acquainted with both its advantages and  its disadvantages. Do Occhetto's rivals have a different  program in mind? We know that they are talking about cutting  taxes, but what do they intend to do about the public deficit?  To deal with it by means of inflation and by printing money?  Or by means of something less destructive? It would be helpful  if they were to say.    As for the media, Occhetto proposes reversing the rationale  of the "perverse compromises" -- again -- behind current  legislation, centering the defense of the public not on the  vested interests of the existing bigwigs but on the citizens'  right to pluralism in their sources of information. What are  the other rival political forces offering as an alternative?  Some further compromises in line with the oligopolistic Mammi  bill, or a real opening to this market based on the principles  of competition? It would be helpful to know this, too, in order  to assess the liberal substance of Occhetto's proposals: It is  possible to do better than him, but someone has to do it.</p>

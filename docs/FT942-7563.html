			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Safety worries over sell-off are dismissed - Air traffic control The government yesterday set the stage for the first full privatisation of a country's air traffic control system by proposing to sell the Civil Aviation Authority's National Air Traffic Services (NATS). After a one-month consultation period with the aviation industry, the government hopes to have the legislation passed in the next parliamentary session and to launch the flotation of NATS at the end of next year or early in 1996. Mr Christopher Chataway, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), said the privatisation of NATS would probably be similar to the flotation of other UK utilities. Shares in the new company, which would become a privatised contractor to the CAA, would be offered to the public, aimed at small shareholders as well as big institutions and corporate investors. However, a limit is expected to be set on the number of shares that big groups would be able to buy in the privatised company, Mr Chataway said. The move would be designed to limit shareholdings by large air traffic control users such as airlines and airport operators. The government is also likely to impose a limit on foreign shareholdings. Both British Airways and British Midland Airways welcomed the government's proposals, which they said would give the privatised NATS access to capital markets and greater impetus to improve and modernise the country's air traffic control infrastructure. But Sir Michael Bishop, British Midland's chairman, said the government would have to consider 'very carefully' the impact on airline competition of allowing airlines to take ownership of NATS. 'We oppose the majority control of NATS by any airline or group of airlines,' he said. BAA, the airports operator, said that it would not be interested in taking a stake in NATS. Mr Chataway said that splitting the CAA's regulatory activities and its air traffic control arm would provide greater transparency between regulation and air traffic control services. But the main reason for privatisation was to give NATS access to financial markets so that it could secure its heavy funding needs to modernise and expand air traffic control services. Investment at NATS is running at Pounds 150m a year compared with only Pounds 20m 10 years ago. NATS plans to invest around Pounds 650m over the next five years and to concentrate its operations at two new centres: the en-route centre at Swanwick, Hampshire, and a Scottish Centre at Prestwick, Ayrshire. The privatised company would absorb 5,500 of the CAA's current staff of 7,000. NATS' annual turnover is about Pounds 500m, with the bulk of its income drawn from the provision of en route, approach and airport traffic control services. Mr Chataway said the CAA was keen to see the Ministry of Defence continuing joint operation with NATS. At present there are about 400 MoD staff integrated in air traffic control operations including some 300 military controllers. The relationship could continue with a contract between the MoD and NATS. Mr Chataway said the CAA was satisfied that privatisation would not adversely affect the safety of air transport. 'It is difficult to believe that private is inherently more dangerous than public,' he said, adding that both BA and BAA had been no less safe since privatisation. However, ever since privatisation was first mooted, critics have warned of the potential safety implications of turning over air traffic control to the private sector. Some air traffic controllers also warned this month that they would fight 'tooth and nail' against privatisation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] It is no secret that European and African states are  rather reluctant to intervene in Rwanda. Today, Paris has  multiplied its efforts to persuade them by stressing the purely  humanitarian aspect of the operation. In Brussels the Western  European Union [WEU] has been considering French proposals. WEU  Secretary General Willem van Eekelen explains:    [Begin van Eekelen recording] Everyone agrees that the  situation in Rwanda is tragic and that we must see if European  countries can do something. The WEU will now consider how it  could coordinate extra contributions from European countries  under the aegis of the United Nations. Our planning cell has  been allowed to get in touch with capitals to see which  capabilities, which means, could be placed at our disposal and  closely to follow developments. This is a start, and now a  possible scenario must be assessed, we must then see which  countries will be able to contribute. [end recording]</p>

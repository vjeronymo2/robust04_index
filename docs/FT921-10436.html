			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: ASKO lifts AVA stake ASKO, the German retail chain, has increased its shareholding in rival retailer AVA from 24 per cent to more than 50 per cent, Reuter reports from Saarbrucken. ASKO acquired the additional AVA shares in return for shares in its Co op offshoot, reducing ASKO's Co op stake to about 74 per cent. 'Through this investment . . . (ASKO) is buying the majority in one of the best run and most successful German trading groups,' ASKO said. Mr Klaus Wiegandt, ASKO chief executive, said AVA was a geographically ideal supplement to ASKO's network of supermarkets. AVA made a net profit of DM52m (Dollars 32.7m) on sales of DM4.41bn in 1990. It expects a further increase in results for 1991. In the first half of 1991, ASKO net profits were DM75m on sales of DM9bn. Full-year results are due in July. In 1990, Co op made a loss of DM301m on sales of DM10.25bn. Co op was on the brink of bankruptcy when ASKO bought it at the end of 1990 and has since gone through a hard hitting restructuring. Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency hopes to sell the east German chemical manufacturer Buna and the chemical divisions of Leuna to western investors by the summer.</p>

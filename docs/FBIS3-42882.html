			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G.Yu.Yu.: "Scoreboard"] </F>   [Text] After the new Constitution has with difficulty  overcome the 50 percent barrier, its further role appears, as  before, to be a double one. On the one hand it unties B.N.Y.'s  hands, permitting the establishment of a regime of personal  power, on the other, it also contains the possibility of a split  in the executive in the center along "president-government"  lines. In addition, the artificial removal from the draft of  many regional pillars of constitutional order in Russia (the  clause on the sovereignty of the republics, the Federal Treaty,  and others) is fraught with new representations from the regions.    The stories of the "success of fascism in Russia"  circulating  among the radical democrats do not withstand even the first  contact with reality.    Presidential authority itself excommunicated from the  election campaign the most active nationalist groupings (the  Russian National Union, the Constitutional Democratic Party, the  NRP [National Republican Party]). The authorities gave the LDPR  [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] with their own hands the  former's potential electorate (6-8 percent of the vote,  according to a number of estimates).    The rapid growth of the LDPR pertained to the last two weeks  before the elections. It is hard not to notice the sharp  contrast between the soothing tone of the political statement of  B. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, of 13 December  and the hysterical response of the radical democrats regarding  the "fascist breakthrough in Russia." These facts compel us to  treat attentively the rumors circulating in the most varied  political circles concerning the preventive funding of the  LDPR's election campaign by certain structures of the executive.    In the initial election scenario "Zhirinovskiy's party" was,  by all accounts, assigned the role of "pump" designed to "draw  off" from one-third to one-half of the electorate of the  Communists.    And the idea of using the Federal Assembly as a  "stabilization" trump card in the presidential game would seem  tactically justified. V. Zhirinovskiy, loudly stating his  pro-presidential sympathies, is together with S. Filatov already  being seen as a candidate for the position of speaker of the  State Duma in the semi-secret political consultations that have  begun.    The success of the LDPR strikes through, virtually, the  parliamentary scenario of the radical democrats counting if only  with a minimal preponderance in the ballot on "filtering" the  government and subordinating to themselves the power structures  and, consequently, the president also. The series of dismissals  of high-ranking officials in the last two weeks had underlying  motives, first, the need to identify and punish the "fall guys"  and those "to blame" for the surge of Zhirinovskiy and the  Communists, second, an attempt by the radicals prior to the  opening of the Federal Assembly session to realize if only some  of their "personnel preparations" (hitting at the Party of  Russian Unity and Accord and so forth).    It was the regional elites who achieved the election of the  majority of their candidates to the Federation Council. At least  three scenarios of the behavior of the Federation Council,  depending on the breakdown of forces in the lower house of  parliament, are likely.    Scenario 1. The majority that takes shape in the Federation  Council backs the factions and personalities that are dominant  in the State Duma. This is possible given the rapid  "domestication" of V. Zhirinovskiy and the prolongation of the  question of the government, if this is followed by the consent  of the "agro-communist" faction.    Scenario 2. The majority that takes shape in the Federation  Council begins to orient itself unequivocally toward President  B. Yeltsin.    Scenario 3. The Federation Council prefers to distance  itself  from the State Duma and from the president, assuming the role of  a kind of counterpart of the former Federation Council.    In all three cases the role of the Federation Council will  be  far more significant than that imputed to it by the new  Constitution. In all likelihood, this will be manifested in the  first weeks of work of the Federal Assembly.    The power structures do not have direct representation in  the  Federal Assembly. V. Zhirinovskiy, meanwhile, not a military  leader and having no chance of becoming such, of course, is  articulating a kind of ideology of militant "liberal patriotism"  connected with the rapid growth of influence of the power  structures 3-5 October and in the weeks since October.    Within the framework of programmed reductions approximately  500,000 servicemen will be discharged from the army in the next  two years. Considering that even now hundreds of thousands of  families of military persons "expelled" from East Europe, the  Baltic, the Transcaucasus, and Central Asia are without housing,  it would be natural to expect that interest in V. Zhirinovskiy,  who is promising the military the distribution of land entails  and full social protection, will be manifested primarily among  the middle and junior officers, the majority of whom voted for  the LDPR. The generals, on the other hand, are in sympathy with  Zhirinovskiy's statements concerning an increase in the army's  role in the country's foreign and domestic policy.    Nor do experts rule out V. Zhirinovskiy's support for the  political claims of the leadership of the Ministry of Internal  Affairs connected with a tightening of the machinery of  repression and a broadening of the rights of the operational  search and investigation subdivisions justified by the fight  against crime.    Up to the fall of 1993 B.N.Y. played a Bonapartist game on  the contradictions between the republics within the Russian  Federation, the sparsely populated resource-extracting oblasts,  and the traditional Russian agro-industrial regions. Then, when  the contours of large-scale geopolitical alliances oriented to a  considerable extent against the Kremlin (the Urals Republic, the  Greater Volga and Siberian Agreement associations) emerged, the  pendulum of the president's regional policy swung in the  directly opposite direction, which was expressed in the draft  constitution and, as a retaliatory response, in a surreptitious  increase in separatism.    The appearance at the political forefront of the figure of  V.  Zhirinovskiy, the "total unitarist" and "ethnocratic  imperialist" provocatively manipulated by the presidential  grouping, corresponds splendidly to the idea of Russian  disintegration: the response of the regional leaders, who have  come round from the October coma, will be unequivocally  separatist and anti-Kremlin. Experts of various persuasions see  in the future the possibility of a quite rapid collapse of the  traditional Russian ethno-state nucleus into puppet  "principalities." It does not need to be said that V.  Zhirinovskiy is incapable of showing himself to be a great-power  leader like figures of the National Salvation Front or the  Russian National Assembly.</p>

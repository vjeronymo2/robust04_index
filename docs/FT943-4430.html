			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / EU may exempt Irish on debt European Union finance ministers will this weekend hold preliminary talks on whether to exempt Ireland from the tough rules on government debt in the Maastricht treaty. Agreement would set an important precedent in favour of a flexible interpretation of the criteria laid down in Maastricht for membership of Europe's planned economic and monetary union. It would also offer hope to other debt-laden member states such as Belgium and Italy that they too may receive leniency. In Brussels this week the secretive European monetary committee, which comprises the top treasury civil servants in the 12 member states, backed a European Commission proposal to exempt Ireland. Despite reservations expressed by the French and German representatives, the Commission is confident of winning formal approval at a meeting of EU finance ministers on September 19 for a generous application of the debt rules. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister playing host to this weekend's informal meeting of EU finance ministers at Lake Constance, has insisted on strict application of the Maastricht treaty's rules on debt, deficit, inflation and currency stability. But with the general election in Germany barely a month away, Mr Waigel is likely to steer clear of controversy. At present, only Luxembourg meets the two deficit criteria of having an annual budget deficit of less than 3 per cent of gross domestic product and an accumulated debt of less than 60 per cent of GDP. The Commission argues that Ireland is a special case because it has kept its annual budget deficits below 2.5 per cent in recent years, and has reduced its stock of debt from around 114 per cent of GDP to around 90 per cent of GDP this year. This appears consistent with the Maastricht treaty provision which says member states can get round the target if 'the ratio (of debt to GDP) is sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace'. Germany, however, remains fearful of encouraging the notion that the so-called 'convergence criteria' in Maastricht are infinitely flexible. Only France supported Germany's reservations in the monetary committee this week, apparently because Paris is determinedly orthodox and wary of any move which might undermine Bonn's commitment to a single European currency. Britain remained silent, according to a participant. Assuming EU finance ministers agree later this month to exempt Ireland and Luxembourg, they will start 'excessive deficit' proceedings against the 10 other EU member states. This means setting policy recommendations for reducing debt which could take the form of targets for 1995. Italy and Greece are viewed as particularly thorny cases. Setting debt reduction targets could provoke charges of Commission heavy-handedness from finance ministers who want to take credit for tough measures to tackle deficits. The Commission could soft-pedal by simply urging member states to meet debt reduction targets which they have set out in their own 'convergence programmes'. These are the action plans which are subject to scrutiny by the EU's monetary committee and the Council of Ministers.</p>

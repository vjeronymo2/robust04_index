About 150,000  visitors are expected to attend the three-day event at Main Beach.  </P> <P> Forty teams will compete for a $70,000 purse at the tournament, which is  celebrating its 35th year.  </P> <P> Beach volleyball is played on the sand, with two people on a team. The rules  are the same as those for indoor volleyball. Scoring is based on who has  control, or serves, the ball, with points scored based on keeping the ball in  play without it touching the ground or landing outside the court.  </P> <P> The women's games start at 9 a.m. today, with finals slated for 2 p.m. Monday.  Men's games begin at noon today, with finals starting at 4 p.m. Monday.  </P></p>

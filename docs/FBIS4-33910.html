			<p>BFN     [Text] The Electric Union has issued a detailed report on  electricity generating capacity, pointing out that increased  capacity meant shorter outages last week. The Electric Union  predicts that the system will continue behaving like this until  15 June. The report also notes that the average deficit was  reduced significantly between 2 and 8 June and that the  electrical generating level in the last few weeks has exceeded  what was expected, increasing consumption of fuel reserved for  that purpose.    The truth is that the situation today is very different from  that in April, when the outages were prolonged due to breakdowns  at power plants without adequate maintenance program. The  generating capacity now increases daily. It was also confirmed  that Mariel Power Plant Unit 6 has been reincorporated into the  national electrical network. This unit, which can generate 100  megawatts, was off line for more than a year while Cuban  specialists completed their complex reconstruction task.</p>

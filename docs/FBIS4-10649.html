			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, the second day of his official visit to  Chile, PRC Defense Minister Chi Haotian met with Army Commander  General Augusto Pinochet.    Colonel Chi Haotian is responsible for one of the largest  armed forces in the world. The PRC land, sea, and air forces  comprise more than 10 million soldiers.    Chi Haotian came to Chile in response to an invitation by  the  Defense Ministry and met with Chilean Army Commander Gen.  Augusto Pinochet. The PRC minister is accompanied by seven  high-ranking PRC People's Liberation Army members. The two  military commanders introduced each other to their respective  successors [as heard] and exchanged gifts, after which they held  a 25-minute meeting.    One of Chi Haotian's most important activities in Chile will  take place this afternoon when he will visit the FAMAE [Army  Ordnance]. There is a chance the PRC will want to purchase  Chilean-made war materiel.</p>

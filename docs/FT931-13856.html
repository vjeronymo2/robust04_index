			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Vodafone Vodafone's juicy margins cannot last forever, so evidence of approaching competition from Mercury might be expected to unsettle investors. Yet the 8 per cent fall in Vodafone's shares in the past two days is slightly irrational. Mercury's deal for cheap connection charges with BT primarily relates to the price of incoming calls - a factor unlikely to prompt subscribers to move from Vodafone's system to Mercury's personal communications network, due later in the year. More worrying is the thought that Mercury may price outgoing calls cheaply too, substantially undercutting existing cellular providers. Vodafone has a number of responses including new pricing packages and the beginnings of a new cellular system similar to Mercury's. As Mercury is only starting in the M25 area, Vodafone may cede market share rather than cut prices initially. But eventually, as Mercury becomes established, Vodafone will be increasingly forced to compete on price. The timing of this battle will determine the company's earnings prospects. Vodafone's natural inclination may be to defer price cuts on its existing system. Particularly so because Mercury's system - restricted to London and using untried technology - may have limited appeal to customers. But the response of Cellnet, the other cellular network, could upset that calculation. Cellnet started the move towards lower rental charges in the autumn and has no product similar to the new Mercury or Vodafone systems. If it cuts prices in a bid to maintain market share, Vodafone will have to follow.</p>

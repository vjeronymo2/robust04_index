Unfortunately, the reform package by Governor  Chris Patten has further polarised the elite and the society,  already split over the attitude towards Beijing.    Among local people, there have always been suspicions,  resentments and fears against the communist rulers on the  mainland due to political turmoil there. Military suppression  of student-led demonstrations on 4 June, 1989, was the latest of  these political turmoils. But the crackdown occurred at a  particularly sensitive time to Hong Kong people as 1997 was only  several years away, and it came after 10 years of reform and  opening.    Before Mr Patten proposed his reform package in October  1992,  Hong Kong society and its political elite had somewhat contained  their polarisation from the 4 June trauma. But in the course of  the row over the political system triggered by the governor's  move, public figures have had to take sides. And the political  dispute has spilled over into other areas, such as the financial  arrangement of the new airport. As a result, the society and  elite have become further split.    Now both the Chinese and British are trying hard to woo Hong  Kong people to their sides. As Beijing is stepping up to set up  the "second stove" here, it is inviting new batches of people to  become advisers to the territory-wide and regional affairs. On  the part of the British, they are trying to hold people on their  side. In this tug-of-war, people have to choose camps and risk  being labelled as pro-Beijing or pro-London.    One of the most disturbed sectors is the civil service which  should continue to play a crucial role in the government of the  future Special Administrative Region. Beijing has taken to task  some of the senior officials who have fervently promoted the  governor's package. It is believed that the Chinese side is  close to determining that certain Hong Kong officials will not  serve beyond 1997. This will cost the territory some of its  most capable hands. But as every government gives top priority  to political reliability among its senior members, the Chinese  side's stance is quite understandable. In this regard, Anson  Chan, the first local to become Hong Kong's chief secretary, is  likely to lose her top job after 1997. Mrs Chan probably knows  this. In a recent interview with the HONGKONG STANDARD, she  cast doubts about her own political future, saying she would  find it difficult to preside over arrangements if China  dismantled Hong Kong's three tiers government in 1997. Here,  the chief secretary was actually saying that she could not  continue her civil service career because of the political  changes.    The fact remains that because of the row triggered by Mr  Patten's package, the Chinese and British can't agree on  political arrangements. The inability to establish a political  elite which commands the support and respect of the majority of  the local people will be harmful to the implementation of  Beijing's pledge of "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong". This  may jeopardise the "one country two systems" scheme which needs  local people to prop up Hong Kong's system of capitalism. In  the worst scenario, the polarisation may lead to instability in  the years leading up to, as well as the years after, transition.  We need local people to be in responsible positions in every  major sector so that after the British withdrawal, the local  administration can still operate effectively and stability will  be maintained. If we cannot do that, we risk the danger of  Beijing sending the mainland cadres to help run the  administration. This is a development which the local people do  not want to see.    Much has to be done to redress the situation. Ideally, the  Chinese and British sides should confine their clashes and  prevent further splitting the society and its political elite.  The two sides should stop politicising the civil service. The  Chinese side should understand that since the officials are  still under the British administration, they should by and large  follow London's line. Let the civil servants perform their  duties as usual. Actually, the society as a whole should be  allowed to do its business as usual. If the governments of  China and Britain and local political groups concerned  themselves more with livelihood rather than political issues,  Hong Kong would have a smoother transition. It would also be  easier for a political elite, which commanded the support and  respect of the majority of the local people, to emerge.</p>

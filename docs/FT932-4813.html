			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Russian talks may lead to election PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's constitutional convention is more likely to produce temporary legislation for early elections and a new division of powers rather than a new constitution. 'It's realistic, I think, and it could be the greatest success the meeting could achieve,' said Mr Alexander Vladislavlev, one of the leaders of the Civic Union alliance, which has the support of many managers of state-owned factories. The same conclusion emerged from remarks by other delegates as the convention, which is attempting to resolve Russia's power struggle, yesterday began discussing Mr Yeltsin's draft constitution in five separate working groups at the Kremlin. Delegates opposed to Mr Yeltsin signed statements of protest after the president refused to let his chief rival, the parliamentary chairman, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, address the opening session on Saturday. Mr Khasbulatov stormed out amid chaotic scenes.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE JAZZ ROOM THAT ALMOST WASN'T;  </P> <P> FIRST-CLASS MUSIC FILLS FITZGERALD'S, A NEW CLUB BUILT AS A DISCO THAT'S BEEN  KNOWN BY 3 NAMES  </P> <P> Jazz rooms usually take awhile to get established, but Fitzgerald's, the newly  opened nightspot ensconced in a corner of the also new Warner Center Hilton  Hotel and Towers in Woodland Hills, may be an exception to the rule.  </P> <P> Take a recent Friday. At a little after 7 p.m., Fitzgerald's was only about  half full. Pianist John Hammond's trio had already played a set for the happy  hour gang and was heading back to the bandstand with a quintet that included  saxophonist Pete Christlieb of the "Tonight Show" orchestra, and crack  trumpeter Steve Huffsteter.  </P> <P> But by the time the fivesome returned to the stand for its last performance  about 11:30 p.m., the joint was jammed with enthusiastic listeners.  </P> <P> One was Lil Finan, a retired attorney and former blues singer who gave her age  as "way past the age of consent."  </P> <P> "I'm a widow and this music, this place, it makes me forget I'm sad, makes me  feel that the world isn't so terrible after all," she said as the group romped  through a snappy rendition of the standard, "Star Eyes." "I keep coming back,"  added Finan from her spot in the back of the room that seats about 90 people  comfortably. "I live in the area and usually don't like nightclubs, but this  one is definitely not a drag."  </P> <P> The first-class music is the reason for the fast-growing popularity of  Fitzgerald's, where buoyant sounds provided by Hammond, the room's musical  director, and his various cohorts is on the schedule Tuesday through Saturday  at 8 p.m.  </P> <P> A good example was the group's perky version of "Stella by Starlight," in which  Hammond's dark touch accompanied gutsy jazz soloing from Christlieb, who was  subbing for the fivesome's regular reedman, Ray Pizzi. The efforts of the tall  tenor drew more than moderate applause.  </P> <P> "I'd come back to see these guys because they're solid," said Ron Ramelli, 37,  retail advertising manager for BAM magazine.  </P> <P> Ramelli, who lives in nearby West Hills, listed three of Fitzgerald's strong  points: location, location, location.  </P> <P> "There's nothing like it around here," he said. "Alfonse's -- the defunct North  Hollywood club that has reopened as M.K.'S P.O.V. -- was really far from here."  The nearest jazz clubs to Fitzgerald's would be Monteleone's West in Encino and  LeCafe in Sherman Oaks, neither of which spotlights the variety of instrumental  mainstream jazz that Fitzgerald's offers.  </P> <P> Fitzgerald's is the jazz room that wasn't supposed to be.  </P> <P> These days, many hotels focus their lounge business on dancing and the Warner  Center Hilton Fitzgerald's was no different: It was built to be a disco.  </P> <P> Fitzgerald's is square-shaped and two-tiered, with an open center so those on  the upper level could see the dancers below. It's got those little glimmer  lights strung in straight strings around the upper edges of the lower room, and  there's a dandy parqueted dance floor that now sits well-protected under thick  carpeting.  </P> <P> But in a rare turn of events, disco was not meant to be the thing at the Warner  Center Hilton -- jazz was.  </P> <P> "When we discovered that there were plenty of established discos in the area,  including the nearby Red Onion and Tickets in Warner Center Marriott, we  decided we wanted to go with something different," said Charles L'Episcopo, 38,  the hotel's food and beverage director. "We wanted to attract a different age  group than goes to discos, and wanted to do something for the hotel guests that  keeps them in the hotel."  </P> <P> (According to L'Episcopo, the Warner Center Hilton is a business hotel that  attracts a clientele in the 35- to 48-age demographic.)  </P> <P> Cue John Hammond.  </P> <P> "I live in the area and went down there, just after the hotel had opened in  November, to see what was happening," said the pianist, an energetic  48-year-old Houston native. "The management told me they had a lounge and I  felt that would be an ideal place for a jazz club.  </P> <P> "This community is really coming into its own and I felt there was a real need  for jazz out here," said Hammond of the West Valley area that includes Woodland  Hills, Chatsworth, Calabasas and West Hills, where Hammond, his wife, Winnie,  and their two children reside.  </P> <P> "Besides," he added with a chuckle, "I wanted to step out of the accompany role  and do something on my own."  </P> <P> Initially, Hammond, who grew up in Texas and was headed for a career as a  concert artist when jazz grabbed his ear, played solo piano in the hotel's  lobby. Then, after the hotel's top management team had heard a brief, informal  set by a Hammond quartet featuring Pizzi in early January, plans were begun to  turn Fitzgerald's into a jazz club.  </P> <P> "We all thought John and the band sounded great, that jazz offered the kind of  market we wanted to cater to," said LePiscopo, himself a jazz fan.  </P> <P> Fitzgerald's opened March 2. Until recently, the room was called Roxy's, but  attorneys for The Roxy, the well-known Sunset Strip nightclub, threatened to  sue the hotel to have the name changed, according to Charles L'Episcopo, the  hotel's food and beverage director. For about two weeks, it was informally  called Oxy's before it became Fitzgerald's. Representatives of The Roxy did not  return phone calls to The Times.  </P> <P> The name Fitzgerald's was suggested by the hotel's general manager Jose  Montilla. "We were looking for a name that fit the hotel's image, which I see  as Art Deco, and which wasn't related to any particular type of music, Montilla  said. "Fitzgerald's was ideal since it covers a wide area: It could be  interpreted as meaning F. Scott Fitzgerald the writer, or Ella Fitzgerald, the  jazz singer."  </P> <P> A no cover-no minimum policy is in effect at Fitzgerald's. There's a full bar,  with well drinks priced at $3.50 and call and premium brands, $4 to $5. Beers,  available on tap and in bottles, range from $2.25 to $3.50, and wine by the  glass costs $3.50. In addition to a free happy hour buffet from 5 to 7:30 p.m.  Tuesday through Friday, appetizers -- potato skins, pot stickers, etc. -- and  sandwiches -- BLT, French dip, pub burger etc. -- are served until 11 p.m.  </P> <P> While Hammond was in high spirits over the way things are taking shape at  Fitzgerald's, LePiscopo was a tad less vociferous.  </P> <P> "I'm thrilled with the way it's going," Hammond said. "I find we're getting a  lot of reaction from young people saying, 'We've never heard anything like this  before.' They're the ones that are cheering the loudest. All in all, people  seem to be ready for this."  </P> <P> "It's doing well. It's successful from the standpoint that people who do come,  enjoy it," LePiscopo said. "Certainly, I would like to see more people, because  the more seats we fill, the closer we are to showing a reasonable profit. Right  now, we're at maybe a break-even situation.  </P> <P> "But I'm very happy with what John's doing musically. It's excellent."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fitzgerald's  </P> <P> At the Warner Center Hilton Hotel and Towers, 6360 Canoga Ave., Woodland Hills.

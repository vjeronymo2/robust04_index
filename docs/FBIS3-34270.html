Addressing the  Balochistan local bodies convention in Sibi today, she said we  have been raising our voice against injustices and atrocities  wherever they have been committed -- be it Bosnia, Kashmir, or  Palestine. We would continue our support for the usurped rights  of the people and no threat can intimidate us.    The prime minister said we supported the brotherly people of  Afghanistan against Soviet aggression and are making every  effort for peace to prevail in that country so that it rebuilds  itself with the cooperation of brotherly countries. Ms. Benazir  Bhutto said we love Pakistan, we love the land which we achieved  after great sacrifices and would build this country into a  strong and prosperous state. Millions of people of the  subcontinent rendered tremendous sacrifices and laid down their  lives to achieve a separate homeland for Muslims of South Asia  where they could lead a life of respect, honor and independence.  She said democracy has been restored in Pakistan through fair  and impartial elections and an Awami [popular] government has  taken over the reigns of the country. This government with the  active support of the people would make every endeavor to  accelerate the pace of development and bring about all-round  progress and prosperity.    Ms. Benazir Bhutto said it is our collective responsibility  to work for the solidarity, integrity, and prosperity of the  country and we must translate the dreams of the Quaed-i-Azam  [great leader Jinnah] into reality. The people are the real  heirs and owners of the country, and therefore, the government  is paying due attention toward their betterment, she said.  [passage omitted]</p>

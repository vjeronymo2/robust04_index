			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Arts: Culture and the embarrassment factor - Lynn MacRitchie, in her round-up of 1994 exhibitions, describes the reviewers' secret nightmare In Paris earlier this month, I came upon a shop displaying dresses, coats and suits by the great couturiers, not new but from the earlier decades of this fast disappearing century. There were the unfortunate lengths and experimental fabrics of the 1970s, the shorter look of the '60s, daring then but almost frumpy now, the stacked heeled shoes with square toes. But that coat - pure Dior New Look, tiny waist, huge cuffs, full skirt, jolly red buttons on its green and tan tweed: how right it seemed, how perfectly now, the curious mystery of 'the look' repeating itself some 50 years on. The fascination of these garments, the almost physical pleasure the sight of the 'right' ones gave, was to me just like the effect of looking at contemporary art. Both offer the high of the perfect moment, epitomised in the frock, the shoe, the object, the installation, so exemplary of its time that no argument is possible, only the blissful surrender of recognition. And, as with fashion, that shining moment can very soon transform into the epitome of embarrassment. Herein lies the secret terror of the new in art, the fear that those of us who dare to like the work of today will look very silly when now turns to yesterday. Several of the best exhibitions abroad this year have taken work at this most embarrassing stage and boldly set it forth. I found that Bruce Nauman in Madrid, the Reina Sofia the only European stop in his retrospective, passed the test well. Nauman, American hero of conceptual art, had to weather some sticky moments. Constantly developing technology means that elderly video tapes, shining examples of experiment in their 1960s heyday, now seem blurry and curious in black and white. But the seeds of this tough humanist's newest and strongest works, concerned with the varieties of trivial cruelty we daily inflict on each other, were clearly present in these early tapes, simple-seeming explorations of the body and its limitations. There are some who wish that Joseph Beuys might be discovered to have feet wrapped not in his famous felt or fat but clay. I am not one of them, but, a true devotee, sometime wake in terror that, as time goes by, his work will crumble before me, the vitrines seem empty, the installations a jumble of old rubbish. The European touring exhibition which finished at the Centre Pompidou in Paris this October, though coldly executed, did not have this dreaded effect. The installations were magisterial, the vitrines full of allusion and melancholy. The warmth and humour, so winning in the man, survive in little gleams on film and video. At home, as in fashion, there were themes and variations, and the best things were sometimes found in more out of the way places. The Tate Liverpool had a good year. While Picasso lorded it in London this spring, up north they showed US video artist Gary Hill and Anthony Gormley's 'Field'. While Gormley won the Turner Prize, work by Hill - the best by far of the generation of video artists now receiving belated recognition - was not purchased by the Patrons of New Art, who chose the pedestrian 'Nantes Triptych', by fellow American Bill Viola, so huge but so dull, for their grand video purchase (showing in London until from now to February). Chocolate was big, a whole roomful of it smeared on the walls of Karsten Schubert's London gallery by Anya Gallaccio to melancholy effect (the walls half coloured, streaky brown, recalling school corridors, the fading odour like time gone stale). Helen Chadwick made a fountain of it in the summer heat at the Serpentine. It bubbled, and stank, but failed to impress. The plain, thin spike from which the brown liquid oozed was just not tall or powerful enough, its flow too gentle, the container beneath, painted a pale municipal blue (prone to unfortunate splashing when the bubbles burst), more a kiddies paddling pool than a Freudian ooze. Much hype (the Chadwick show had some hysterical media coverage) doth not an artwork make, although it can certainly draw a crowd, as the Serpentine again discovered when hundreds had to be kept queueing outside during the run of Damien Hirst's selection Some went mad, some ran away, even before someone poured black ink into the tank with the sheep. But Hirst is a serious artist, despite the wide boy image, and the show was impressive in parts, most of all in its air of fin de siecle melancholy, so many of its participants preoccupied with death, decay and degradation. Back in Paris, the year closed at the Pompidou with Hors Limites (running until the end of January) where a range of international artists show the kind of work which has led to the strange dilemma contemporary art now faces. Beginning in 1952 and continuing to the present, the show traces the development of work by artists determined to break down the barriers between art and life. In the earlier years, when tireless jokers like Yves Klein used naked girls smeared in blue paint as brushes and the new performance art explored the boundaries of improvisation and chance, there was a belief that freedom of artistic expression could somehow bring about the social and political freedom of the individual. This did not happen. Instead, artists turned in on themselves, leading to extremes of body art such as the self mutilations of Gina Pane and others in the 1970 which mutated into today's blank faced exposition of narcissistic sexual ritual (the torture tables and self abuse of Matthew Barney to take one example). The avant garde of the 1950s, filmed at their dirty deeds, wore suits and ties. Klein, heaving naked girls, was particularly dapper - (and I, had I been in the audience, would have been wearing that full skirted coat). As for today's society, the young know that we are what we buy. Mike Kelley and others roamed the depths of America's consumer culture, filling the gallery with dirty discarded clothes, toys and general junk, the detritus of the limitless 'choice' which has brought so little satisfaction.</p>

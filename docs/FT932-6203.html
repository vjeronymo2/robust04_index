			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Brent rated lowest for council tax service THE Conservative-controlled London borough of Brent provides council tax-payers with the worst level of customer service in the UK, a survey published yesterday shows. BEM Research, a market research company, produced the study by having 'mystery callers' contact each local authority in the UK, asking the same questions about council tax each time. In Brent they found a two-hour queue of 170 people, while telephone inquiries were put on hold for 10 minutes then cut off. In Labour-controlled Waltham Forest, which finished 413th out of 414 in the survey, a caller was told: 'We do not deal with any inquiries on Tuesday. We close to catch up with our paperwork.' Problems with computer systems were seen as the main difficulty for poor performers. Top performers were Labour-controlled Wolverhampton, followed by South Somerset (Liberal Democrat) and Amber Valley (Labour). Only 24 authorities scored below 60 per cent on the overall performance rating used, but many staff were unable to answer basic queries.</p>

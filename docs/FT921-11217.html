			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Arts: Potter with a Modernist eye - Susan Moore admires the work of Lucy Rie at the Crafts Council LUCIE RIE is Britain's greatest living potter, a Dame of the British Empire, and 90 in March. She has been making pots for 65 years. In 1938 she fled Vienna and settled in London, bringing with her the Modernist aesthetic of the avant-garde designers and craftsmen of the Wiener Werkstatte. It could not have been in greater contrast to the traditions informing the studio pottery movement burgeoning in Britain under the aegis of Bernard Leach. Rie set up a studio in a London mews rather than at an idyllic rural retreat, even installing the state-of-the-art fittings designed for her Viennese apartment by the architect Ernest Plischke. While Leach and his school looked to the workaday fat-bellied jugs of the medieval English potters and to weighty Japanese stonewares, Rie produced vessels of a striking refinement and formal purity. Her thinly potted wares were more in keeping with the metropolitan dining room than the rustic kitchen table. Moreover, they belonged to the present. The 180 or so pieces gathered together for the 90th birthday retrospective at the Crafts Council Gallery have an unexpectedly powerful presence. Together they reveal a rigorous intelligence at work. Rie's self-imposed parameters have allowed for perhaps a dozen simple bowl and vase forms, all made on the wheel. For six decades they have been honed and constantly adapted, and been the vehicle for exhaustive experimentation with a range of complex glazes. Decoration is almost confined to these rich glazes, which are applied with a broad brush to the unfired clay. Only rarely are there patterns to distract the eye from her sweeping clean-cut lines. Rie is aesthetically as well as technically a classical potter, and her Modernist's eye took in the purest and most pared down ceramic traditions of past and present. We find echoes of prehistoric pots, early Islamic fritwares and Chinese porcelains, and of contemporary Scandinavian design and the sculptural forms of her friend and one-time assistant Hans Coper. The best of her work seems at once timeless and firmly rooted in its age. This exhibition traces the evolution of forms, and of glazes. Its strength - and novelty - is the extent to which it concentrates on materials and techniques rather than on aesthetics alone, aspects crucial to the understanding of an artist as subtlely experimental as Lucie Rie. Curator Margot Coatts has engaged the services of ceramic technologist Nigel Woods, whose lucid catalogue essay benefits both layman and potter. From the first, Rie was innovative, producing in Vienna unusual mottled glazes that prefigure later work. These were earthenwares with stoneware glazes; when she took up stoneware in 1948-49 she kept to her electric kiln and produced effects quite different from those achieved in the traditional flame-fired kilns. Rie obviously liked the minimalist simplicity of pots that were made in a single firing, and decorative effects that were integral to the process of manufacture. She began with dry glazing and sgraffito, moving on to mixing reactive colouring oxides into the clay, and tocombining different coloured clays. The results of these marblings are spectacular, where bold zebra stripes spiral up the long necks of tall vases. Characteristically, decorative effects depend on taking away rather than on adding ornament. The elegant coffee-bean colour cups of the 1950s, for instance, are articulated by finely hatched lines scratched through the manganese glaze to the clay body. Textures also bring interest to a surface without recourse to additional colours. The glazes of unusually monumental and coarse stonewaresare bubbled and pitted like pebbles, or carved with deep furrows and burred as if knitted with Shetland wool. Especially pleasing are the infinitely varied surfaces of white porcelains that are reminiscent of Chinese Liao wares. Combinations of glazes juxtapose whites that are opaque and matt, gleaming or slightly frosted. Surfaces may be smooth or crazed, left unglazed or decorated with raised dots. One tall bowl takes aboard three rings of inlaid mauve pigment. The range of colours is surprisingly broad. Rie can introduce colour with great subtlety, whether in a single band in a single vessel or in, say, the ochres and olives used inside an elegant breakfast set of 1949-50. Boldness is rewarded too in glazes of brilliant uranium yellow or deep turquoise. Least successful, even deeply unpleasant, are the exploding 'volcanic' surfaces of bubblegum pink and blue. The show ends with a case of the utilitarian pottery buttons, buckles and hair pins, and a mirror frame, that Rie was obliged to produce in the years immediately following the war. It would have been fitting to have added the couture buttons Rie made for the Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake in 1989. Lucie Rie continues at the Crafts Council Gallery, 44a Pentonville Road, Islington, until April 5.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LONG BEACH  </P> <P> Born in China and raised in Honolulu, Mary Bonic seems to combine memories of  both cultures into her nifty free-standing sculptures and paintings on wood  panel. They sport vivacious silhouettes, bright colors and eccentric, willful  snatches of patterning that avoid formula or slickness.  </P> <P> The "Trio" wall pieces are huge abstract black cutouts that sometimes  incorporate cartoon-like fillips like splayed "fingers" and "toes" or jazzy  doodles. Other paintings contain interlocking designs on black grounds. In  "Ancestral Digs," a welter of forms and outlines conjur up landscape forms,  fish eyes, spear points and fire.  </P> <P> The two-sided constructions are the most fun, even if their rear views  sometimes seem insufficiently resolved. Built out of bits and pieces of  brightly painted wood, they bristle with corners and curves. Most are abstract,  but a couple amusingly invoke the figure. "Woman in Kimono" -- perhaps the most  free-spirited of the lot -- has a face made of sponges painted white and gray.  "Wayfarer" stands on an oblong, cartoonish "foot" and carries on his back an  abstracted "knapsack" pieced together out of a bright jumble of shapes and  symbols.

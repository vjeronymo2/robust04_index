			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nickel producers fail to follow Inco's output cut NICKEL PRODUCERS are currently showing little enthusiasm for production cuts similar to those announced by Inco earlier this week, despite a continuing surplus of metal on world markets. Both the French producer SLN (Societe Metallurgique le Nickel) and Finland's Outokumpu said yesterday that they have no plans to cut output over the next few months. Falconbridge, the biggest western producer after Inco, said yesterday that a production cut is 'likely', but that no decision will be made for at least a few weeks. 'Each operation is looking at its plans and reviewing options,' the company said. Inco plans to trim production by 40m lbs over the next 12 months, bringing next year's expected output down to 380m lbs. However, the Toronto-based company also affirmed its determination to maintain its 25 to 30 per cent share of the western nickel market. Inco has bought substantial quantities of metal on the LME over the past year. Inco's cut will reduce worldwide production by about 3 per cent, but preliminary figures indicate that nickel output exceeded consumption by 14 per cent in the third quarter. The imbalance is due largely to stagnant demand from the stainless steel industry, which accounts for some 60 per cent of nickel consumption, and a sharp rise in Russian shipments. Mr Ray Goldie, metals analyst at Richardson Greenshields in Toronto, predicted yesterday that 'Inco's cutbacks won't be enough'. With Russia unlikely to rein in its exports, Mr Goldie said the burden is likely to fall on western producers such as Falconbridge. His prediction is confirmed by the lacklustre response of nickel prices to Inco's decision. Cash nickel on the London Metal Exchange fell back to close at Dollars 6,620 a tonne, down Dollars 70 on the day and Dollars 85 on the week so far. SLN chairman Mr Yves Rambaud told Reuters that the renovation of one of three smelters had already reduced the company's production this year, and he saw no need to consider further cuts. The renovated smelter was brought back into service in August, but Mr Rambaud said that Eramet's stocks are 'very low'. The group expects its nickel output to fall to some 39,000 tonnes in 1992, down from 43,500 tonnes in 1991. An Outokumpu official told Reuters that 'We do not have need for such cuts and there are no plans for such measures'. He noted that the company's total nickel output of 13,800 tonnes a year is less than Inco's planned cut.</p>

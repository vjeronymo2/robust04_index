			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Eriks Kulis: "Explosions Heard in Ammunition </F> Depots at Liepaja Military Seaport"]    [Text] Liepaja, 25 Mar -- In accordance with the timetable  for Russian Army withdrawal from Liepaja, Army Unit No. 1331  emptied its artillery ammunition depots, but unfortunately did  not finish the job. At three depots, boxes containing outdated  detonators for infantry mines and artillery missiles (the latter  contain approximately 300 grams of explosives), as well as long  powder sticks were left behind. This oversight was immediately  taken advantage of by youngsters, who took away everything that  caught their eye, and over the next few days the area around the  seaport shook with loud explosions. Thank Goodness, until now  the "taking over" of the depots has not inflicted a toll in  human life, but teachers at a nearby school are often shocked  when they have to run after first-grade students carrying enough  explosives to blow up the entire class. Naturally, the rest of  the inhabitants feel as if they are on the front line.    "I am ashamed to report on this example of  irresponsibility,"  the military prosecutor of the Russian Army in Liepaja, Vitalijs  Pobedonoscevs, told DIENA during an interview. "Along with  evacuating the ammunition depots, the armed guards were also  removed, leaving only an emergency fire brigade, but no one at  the headquarters knew that explosives have been left there. The  fact was overlooked by officers responsible for transporting the  ammunition. The result was that over four or five days, the  depots could be entered by anyone who so desired. Presently, a  criminal investigation is being conducted, supervised by the  commander of the garrison, Valerijs Stalevs."    V. Pobedonoscevs also stated that it is now necessary to  form  a unit of explosives experts, because it is not possible to hand  the depots over to municipal authorities in such a state.    With regard to these events, head of the Liepaja Police  Department, Janis Lidaks, told DIENA the following: "This is an  example of extraordinary irresponsibility. If military  personnel were ordered to evacuate the ammunition depots, they  should have been in full control of the operation. Presently,  we are catching the boys, but this really only represents a  fight against the consequences of the action. Actually, we have  traced a few boxes, but this is nothing in comparison with the  great amount of explosives that have already been spirited away  from the depots. Of course, we have warned the National Guard,  as well as the municipal police. But it is not within our  capabilities to guard the 60 hectares on which the depots are  situated. Surely, Russian armed sentinels have been placed  there now, but according to unofficial reports, some soldiers  are ready to close their eyes for a pack of cigarettes and let  anyone in, if somebody would like to see what is inside the  depots."    J. Lidaks is of the opinion that an intense trade in the  explosives can now be expected, and whoever is interested will  be able to purchase them freely.</p>

(These are not toll-free numbers.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. Extension of Termination Date <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with title IX, section 907(b)(2) of the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (NAHA), as amended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, the Department has determined that extension of the termination date for the direct homeownership provision at section 105(a)(25) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended, is necessary to continue to provide homeownership assistance until homeownership assistance is available under title II of NAHA, the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. Therefore, the termination date is hereby extended from October 1, 1994, to October 1, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For CDBG entitlement communities, HUD-administered Small Cities grantees in Hawaii, and for Insular Area grantees, no CDBG funds may be expended for any activity eligible under the direct homeownership provision unless the funds are obligated to a homebuyer before October 1, 1995. For the State CDBG program, HUD-administered Small Cities program in New York, and the Indian CDBG program, no funds for homeowner assistance may be expended unless a grant for such activities was made by the State or by HUD, as appropriate, before October 1, 1995 to a unit of general local government, and then only for such amounts as are specifically approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Basis for Determination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The basis for the extension is the Department's determination that assistance to homebuyers would not be fully available under the HOME Investment Partnerships Program by October 1, 1994. The first-time homebuyer and resale restriction provisions of the HOME program have proven difficult for many participating jurisdictions (PJs) to implement. Recent amendments to the HOME regulations intended to facilitate funding homebuyer assistance under the HOME program have not yet been in effect long enough to be fully implemented by HOME PJs. Funding homebuyer assistance under the HOME program is especially difficult for CDBG grantees that are not HOME PJs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The recent changes to the HOME homebuyer provisions are both statutory and regulatory. Statutory changes to the definition of eligible homebuyers and to the recapture provisions were enacted in section 203 of the Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;233, approved April 11, 1994). These changes were implemented by a memorandum dated May 10, 1994 and a rule published on August 26, 1994 (59 FR 44258), but PJs have not yet had time to redesign their HOME programs to reflect the amendments. Similarly, the April 19, 1994, interim rule for the HOME program (59 FR 18626) offers additional flexibility by changing the basis for determining the affordability period applicable to homebuyer units and provides additional guidance on recapture provisions. PJs have not yet had time to incorporate these changes into their programs. The Department is also still in the process of developing model documents that may be used by PJs for such activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The lack of time to implement the HOME program changes and the resulting limits on the availability of funds is especially problematic for CDBG entitlements that are not HOME PJs. Without CDBG funds available for direct homeownership assistance, these communities would have to wait for the next State HOME program funding rounds to get funding for this purpose. In most States, the next funding round following the above-referenced statutory and regulatory changes will not be until after October 31, 1994. This extension will allow smaller CDBG communities to provide continuous funding for direct homeownership activities until such CDBG entitlements have a reasonable chance of receiving State HOME funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In making this determination to extend the CDBG homeownership provision, the Department is acting in accord with its national initiative to increase homebuyer assistance, particularly for lower-income families. This initiative includes Departmental proposals to extend permanently the CDBG direct homeownership provision, bolster the HOPE programs, expand the Single Family Property Disposition Initiative, and develop additional homebuyer program models under the HOME program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 26, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Andrew Cuomo, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24190 Filed 9&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4210&hyph;29&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

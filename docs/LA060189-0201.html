			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> AUTOPSIES DONE ON ANAHEIM COUPLE  </P> <P> Autopsies were being performed this morning on the bodies of a man and woman  found shot to death in their Anaheim apartment Wednesday afternoon, police  said.  </P> <P> Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Barry identified the victims as Louis Arturo Herrera,  24, and Diane Patrice Swarbrick, 23. The autopsies should determine the time  and cause of death, he said.  </P> <P> Investigators have no suspects in the double homicide but are "out digging,"  Barry said.  </P> <P> He said a neighbor discovered the bodies after the victims' two children -- a  girl and boy, between the ages of 18 and 24 months -- wandered to a nearby  apartment. (Story, Part II, Page 3.)  </P> <P> Police were still trying to determine a motive for the homicides. It appeared  that nothing was taken from the couple's apartment, Barry said.  </P></p>

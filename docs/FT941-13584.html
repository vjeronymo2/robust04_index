			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Observer: Brain dead Bad news for the seedy CD-Rom industry. A Japanese court has ruled that a ban on a strip-tease computer game is constitutional. Gainax, manufacturers of Electronic Brain Academy Scenario 1  - the game in question  - failed to persuade the Miyazaki district court that the ban violated its freedom of expression. The judge ruled that the game, which involved a schoolgirl removing an item of clothing each time a question was answered correctly, 'could give rise to considerable stimulation of sexual feelings in youth', and would 'develop in young men the wrong view that girls are tools that exist to satisfy their sexual demands'. Back to the drawing board presumably.</p>

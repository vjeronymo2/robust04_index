			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The annual export share of the industrial sector,  affiliated to the Industries Ministry, was 42 percent of the  country's total industrial exports figure in the year 1372  [Iranian year ending 20 March 1994].    While announcing this, the industrial and production affairs  deputy of the Industries Ministry said today in an exclusive  interview with our correspondent: The country's industrial  exports figures increased from 60 million dollars in the year  1368 to 440 million dollars in the year 1372. Thanks to the  growing trend of exports, it is forecast that the figure will  increase to 500 million dollars in the current year.    He added: A stable rate of foreign currency, precise  planning  of industrial projects, and stability of the country's economic  policy are very effective factors in oiling the wheels of the  country's industry. He further stressed that the foreign  currency earned from the non-oil exports fully meets the demands  of the industrial sector for hard currency. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Ministers act to head off BR defeat THE GOVERNMENT sought yesterday to avert another possible defeat over British Rail privatisation in the Lords by saying that an opposition attempt to challenge the legislative procedures being used would not delay the sell-off. Department of Transport officials said the Liberal Democrat amendment would only create uncertainty for BR pensioners. Labour and Liberal Democrats have seized on the amendment as a fresh chance to wreck the sell-off following the government's defeat last week on a proposal to allow BR to bid for franchises. The amendment's effect would be to force ministers to adopt rules for 'hybrid' bills - bills combining changes in public policy with changes affecting private individuals - when BR pension provisions are altered. That would mean a lengthy consultation process before changes to the pension schemes could be implemented. Lord Tordoff, the Liberal Democrats' spokesman in the Lords, said the amendment could attract the support of some Tory peers.</p>

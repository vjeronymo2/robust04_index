			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / UN relief convoy trapped by landmines A UNITED NATIONS relief convoy was trapped near Gorazde, eastern Bosnia, yesterday after hitting two land mines on Thursday night while trying to reach the town, where 70,000 hungry people are besieged by Serb-backed forces, write Laura Silber in Belgrade and Christopher Parkes in Bonn. UN officials in Sarajevo said a rescue convoy was deployed yesterday morning to Gorazde, the last Moslem stronghold under sieged by Serb militia. Meanwhile in Bonn, six special trains, each with room for up to 1,000 people, were being prepared to pick up refugees gathered in the Croatian town of Karlovac, 50km from Zagreb. Germany has allowed in more than 200,000 people from the former Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 11 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet  Cetin on Monday [11 April] critized the United Nations mechanism  as being too slow, saying it was the reason why intervention to  Gorazde had come too late.    He was speaking to reporters after a joint press conference  with visiting Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres.    Cetin said necessary protection should also be given to  other  regions besides Sarajevo, stressing that Turkey had called to  attention the fact that Gorazde was a "critical" region, before  the Serbian attacks were intensified.    He underlined the fact that Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina  should join the agreement signed between Bosnians and Croats,  adding a healthy future for the Balkans can only be reached with  the setting up of lasting and just peace.    Cetin said Turkey will continue efforts for the  establishment  of peace in the region adding talks between Turkish-Bosnian and  Croatian delegations will be held at the foreign ministers level.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Paul Jacob] </F>   [Text] Jakarta -- President Suharto, whose recent remarks  on his tenure as Indonesian leader fuelled speculation that he  might be preparing to step down, said yesterday that no one  should make an issue of the political succession question. He  said the procedures for determining the country's political  leadership had long been in place and had been implemented at  presidential elections every five years since 1968.    Speaking to Religious Affairs Minister Tarmizi Taher at the  Istana yesterday, Mr Suharto said he was a man who abided by the  constitution and its provisions, which include one which states  that a President is elected to serve a five-year term. Mr  Suharto, 72, pointed out that having been entrusted with the  position by the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) last year,  he would end his term "in accordance with the Constitution". The  provisions also say that a candidate can be re-elected and no  limit is stipulated.    In keeping with his long-held position on the leadership  succession issue, Mr Suharto did not say whether he intended to  seek re-election for a new term in 1998, but said he intended to  serve out the current term. The closest he had come to saying  that he might step down was in a biography released in 1989. But  in view of the support given to him by political parties and the  military in late 1992, he said that such endorsement and support  was a call to duty and service which he could not dismiss. He  then went on to accept the nomination and was elected last March  to his sixth straight five-year term.    Mr Suharto has maintained at each occasion that it is the  people, through their representatives in the MPR -- the  country's highest legislative body -- who decide every five  years who their future leader should be.    Mr Tarmizi, who met the President to report on his visits to  Saudi Arabia and Malaysia recently, used the occasion to raise  the succession question on behalf of a number of local religious  leaders. These leaders had questioned Mr Tarmizi about Mr  Suharto's earlier remarks that he would not be President for  life and that he knew when to step down.    Mr Suharto responded by pointing out that procedures for  determining the country's political leaders were in place. He  also urged against too uninhibited a discussion on the issue.    Political scientist Amien Rais first suggested last December  that the succession issue should be discussed openly. After some  initial reaction, the move died down when the ruling Golkar  [Functional Group] party, of which Mr Suharto is de facto  leader, rejected the idea. It resurfaced last week after  American academic Donald Wilson told reporters after meeting Mr  Suharto that the Indonesian leader had said he did not intend to  be President for life and that "I will step down right on time".</p>

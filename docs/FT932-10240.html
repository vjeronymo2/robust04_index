			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Observer: Scarlet idol While it is a long time since Beijing's Temple of Heaven was the scene of Chinese Emperors' harvest prayers, the shrine has suddenly become the centre of envious speculation. Citizens are agog to learn which of their present leaders will be the first to bow down there before one of the prime fetishes of capitalism, to the extent of acquiring it for personal use. The idol to be displayed at the temple is a Ferrari, in politically suitable red, being air-freighted from Italy by importers who have already established a hot-line in a near-by hotel to solicit offers. The local paper Yangchen Evening News has done its best to help the enterprise by describing the exhibit as the 'sparkling diamond' among luxury cars, and pointing out that owners include not only aristocrats and business tycoons, but pop stars to boot. Alas they are unlikely to be joined by even a comparably small elite in China. The average worker would need to save the whole of his or her pay for 500 years to afford such a model at almost Pounds 88,000.</p>

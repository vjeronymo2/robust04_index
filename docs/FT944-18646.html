			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / This Week: Sport Tomorrow: US baseball play-offs. These should have started, but they won't, because of the players' strike and the owners' cancellation of the season. Baseball's enlarged, TV-friendly, eight-team play-offs were to have started tomorrow, but no-one will turn up. Result: for the first time since 1904 there will be no World Series winners - just losers. Golf: October 6-9: Alfred Dunhill Cup, St Andrews Old Course, Scotland. An end-of-term feeling hangs over St Andrews for the 16-team tournament that tries to duplicate the nationalist enthusiasm of the Ryder Cup. The cast keeps changing but Fred Couples, Curtis Strange and Tom Kite are due to play for the US, the defending champions. Rugby league: October 5: Leeds vs Australia; October 8: Wigan vs Australia. Australia, the most muscular operators in the tiny pond of international rugby league, have arrived in Britain. Their hosts have arranged the itinerary so that their best players meet the Kangaroos often and early, softening-up the tourists. This week Australia play Leeds, whose player-coach Ellery Hanley is the new Great Britain coach, then Wigan, the world club champions. Soccer: October 8: European championships: Estonia vs Italy, France vs Romania, Armenia vs Cyprus. October 9: Latvia vs Portugal, Croatia vs Lithuania. Italy were brought down to earth after losing the World Cup final when drawing with Slovenia in their first European championship qualifier. They continue their tour of eastern Europe with a visit to Estonia where their chief adversary will be their old fear of failure. But Italy can benefit from the knowledge that they cannot top France's collapse in the World Cup qualifiers in Paris last year. France lost their last two home games - the second to Bulgaria by two late goals - to surrender a place in the finals. Eric Cantona (above), now France's captain, blamed Parisian fans. France play Saturday's game in St Etienne, where they face erratic Romania, World Cup quarter-finalists, and the ghosts of recent Balkan humiliations. Rugby union: October 8: South Africa vs Argentina. Kitch Christie, the unorthodox new South African coach, makes his debut, shaking-up the back division and, perhaps, South Africa's traditional approach.</p>

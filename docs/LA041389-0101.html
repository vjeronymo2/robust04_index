			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Soviet arms control inspectors decided to conduct "short-notice" inspections at  Cape Canaveral, Fla., and Huntsville, Ala., under terms of the treaty banning  medium-range nuclear weapons, the Pentagon announced. The Soviet inspection  teams had arrived in Washington on Tuesday. Cmdr. Ken Pease, a Pentagon  spokesman, said one 10-member team specified a visit to a missile storage  facility at the Redstone Army Depot in Huntsville. The other 10-member team  asked to inspect Complex 16 at Patrick Air Force Base near Cape Canaveral.  Complex 16 was once used as a launch test center for the Pershing 2 and  ground-launched cruise missiles that are covered by the treaty.  </P></p>

A committee statement said several thousand people have  already been mobilized. They were at the barracks of the  Croatian Army and wearing uniforms without any insignia. Noting  that those mobilized were citizens of Croatia, the committee  noted that the Croatian authorities "did not adhere to  international provisions" which "most strongly forbid sending  soldiers of one state to fight in another state."    A civil war raged in Bosnia-Herzegovina for more than 20  months between the local Serbs, Moslems and Croats. The Bosnian  Croats have from the very beginning been assisted by several  tens of thousand of troops of the regular Army of the Republic  of Croatia. The Croatian Helsinki Committee demanded the  Croatian authorities immediately halt such activities, condemn  them and promise a thorough and urgent enquiry as well as open  disciplinary and court proceedings against the officials  involved.    The statement also demanded an enquiry into the fate of all  the soldiers, Croatia's citizens, sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina  whose whereabouts were presently unknown, as well as the return  of all those mobilized and already sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The committee, as set out, was in possession of documents  showing that disciplinary measures were taken against the  soldiers serving in Croatia's Army who have refused to go to  Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as that they were threatened with  court-martial.    Some of the soldiers who refused to take part in the latest  preparations for going to Bosnia-Herzegovina "were beaten up at  the barracks," while others were threatened "to have their  citizenship certificates taken away and inviting trouble for  their families," the statement of the Croatian Helsinki  Committee said.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Arts: Stoppard turns to India - Radio TOM STOPPARD'S In the Native State (Radio 3, Sunday) is about the relations between the British and the Indians. In 1930, his heroine, Flora Crewe (Felicity Kendal), an English radical poet, is lecturing in India (she was told to go 'somewhere warm' to improve her lungs). Sixty years later are published the letters she wrote to Nell Swan, her younger sister, in London, and Nell (Peggy Ashcroft) entertains the son of the Indian painter Nirad Das (Sam Dastor) whose portrait of Flora adorns the wrapper of her book. But Das had done another painting of Flora, a nude. He kept quiet about this, and it was not seen until his son gave it to Nell Swan. On this simple framework, Stoppard has hung an engaging variety of indicators. Flora is easily beguiled. David, the Resident's Junior Political Agent, guides her in social and political affairs - for example, his Indian ICS colleague, liked and admired, may not come into the Club. The women, David thinks, won't 'muck in' with the Indians. The Resident's literary talk is 'How is Alfred Housman?', though Flora has tales about Wells and Squire. The friendly Rajah believes independence will be bad for the native states, like his own Jummapur. There is informed talk about Indian erotic art, about Rajput writing, the rift between the Hindus and the Moslems, the Salt Tax, the banned Theosophical Society. There is talk too about Flora's life, her sittings for Modigliani, her affaires, but the source for this is in the footnotes we're read from the Collected Letters. (The poems quoted are awful; yet Nell wants the word 'poet' engraved on her dead sister's headstone - for India never cured her chest.) We hear from Emily Eden's Up the Country, casually worked in, her account of the Victorian ball of 1839, her reflection that 'I sometimes wonder why they do not cut all our heads off.' There's no real theme in the play beyond this correlation of English and Indian convictions with their behaviour, but it is done with a skill that transmutes the politics into romance. I shall read it when my local bookshops pull their fingers out, and hear John Tydeman's able production when it's repeated on June 4. Two programmes on Radio 4, presented by Andrea Adams on consecutive Thursdays, deal with the problem of Bullying at Work. This may sound trivial, but they say that 1.3bn hours' work per annum are lost through 'occupational stress'. This week's programme, An Abuse of Power, was presented mostly through five victims. Jane, who complained to the Royal College of Nursing because she was rebuked for 'bleach-blond' hair, should swop experiences with a Guardsman. Teacher Jill lamented because she was deprived, first of her desk, then of her favourite class; teacher Keith hated the 'sudden flare-ups' of his head. Francis, a parish worker, resented his vicar's letters in square white envelopes (though we were not told what those letters said). Perhaps I am lucky, I have usually got on with my superiors. If I say that these five seem a second-class lot, it may be because I can't visualise their suffering. To me, they sound like people who want life to run on their own chosen lines and resent the imposition of any other. To some degree my feelings are reproduced in next Thursday's programme, Whose Fault is it Anyway? Here are the expert voices of psychotherapists and personnel managers (though a reformed bully gets a turn, and I didn't like him much). One psycho view is that victims of bullying may have themselves to blame - they enjoy being victims, just my conclusion from the first programme. The BBC has an organised anti-harrass scheme, we were told. I wonder how Jill, Ann, Francis, Jane and Keith got on under director Cathy Drysdale? Make a note of Colcoughs, 'an everyday story of Potteries folk', Wednesdays on BBC Radio Stoke, repeated Sundays. Presented with Stoke-on-Trent City Council and North Staffordshire Health Authority, it is almost exactly like The Archers. Bound to win.</p>

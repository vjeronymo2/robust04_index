			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Jail riot report due in weeks A REPORT on the riot at Wymott Prison in Lancashire is likely to be with Home Secretary Michael Howard before the end of the month, it emerged yesterday. The Home Office said initial estimates of the damage were between Pounds 10m and Pounds 20m. Judge Stephen Tumim, the chief inspector of prisons, will lead the inquiry. He will report directly to the Home Secretary, who will decide whether to publish all or parts of his findings. The riot echoed an outbreak of violence in April 1986, when 200 prisoners went on the rampage causing 'immense' damage. Prison sources said yesterday it was hoped that an interim report, either oral or written, would be given to Mr Howard before the end of the month with the full written report to follow soon after.</p>

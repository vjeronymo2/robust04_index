			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL JAILS A TOP PALESTINIAN, PROBES REVOLT ROLE;  </P> <P> ARAB UPRISING: THE ARREST OF A PROSPECTIVE NEGOTIATOR IS A SETBACK TO HOPES FOR  PROPOSED PEACE TALKS.  </P> <P> An Israeli court Friday ordered Faisal Husseini, a top Palestinian leader, to  spend four days in jail while police investigate his alleged role in the Arab  uprising.  </P> <P> Husseini, who had been expected to play a part in proposed peace talks, said  his arrest was a pretext for the Israeli government to derail the talks.  </P> <P> "This is an attempt to obstruct the peace process and also to confuse the  Israeli public so it will be suspicious of our peaceful intent," Husseini told  a reporter while waiting to appear in court.  </P> <P> Later, as he left the courtroom, he shouted defiantly, "Nothing can stop the  peace process!"  </P> <P> The police suspect Husseini of giving $450 to young Palestinian activists so  they could buy uniforms. He also is accused of condoning attacks on Israelis  and the execution of suspected Arab collaborators by Palestinians.  </P> <P> Court sources said the information regarding the uniforms was provided by  Palestinian sources and the information on his other activities by secret  intelligence reports.  </P> <P> In recent months, hawkish politicians and ultranationalist Israeli groups have  demanded that Husseini be imprisoned. His arrest comes at a time when the  government is under fire for putting soldiers on trial for allegedly beating,  shooting and otherwise abusing Palestinians.  </P> <P> As policemen stood by, Husseini was spat on and pummeled by two unidentified  Israelis as he left the court. One of the assailants screamed, "Stinking Arab,  we shall destroy you!"  </P> <P> According to court reports, the police want to question Husseini "on suspicion  he assisted an illegal organization that acted within the framework of the  uprising."  </P> <P> If convicted, he could be imprisoned for up to seven years. He already has  spent more than 18 months in jail without being charged and was released a year  ago.  </P> <P> Husseini, 49, is associated with Yasser Arafat's Fatah wing of the Palestine  Liberation Organization. He is the scion of an old Jerusalem family and son of  an Arab leader who was killed fighting Israelis in the 1948 war of  independence.  </P> <P> Husseini's recent efforts in support of civil disobedience had put Israeli  officials on guard. Last fall, the police blocked him from holding a news  conference in support of a tax revolt in the West Bank town of Beit Sahur. In  December, he led a peaceful rally of Palestinians, Israelis and others at  Jerusalem's Old City. Policemen attacked the demonstrators with clubs, tear gas  and jets of water. Later, the police tear-gassed the interior of a hotel where  Husseini was preparing to talk with reporters.  </P> <P> Husseini, while expressing sympathy with the motives behind fatal attacks by  Palestinians on suspected informers, also has criticized such executions. He  had declared 1990 as a year to convince the Israeli public that Palestinians  could be trusted to run their own affairs in a free state next to Israel.  </P> <P> Israel recently barred Husseini from traveling to the occupied West Bank and  Gaza Strip, then from traveling abroad. The foreign travel ban drew a protest  from the United States, but Israel refused to rescind it.  </P> <P> Husseini's name has appeared on virtually every list of participants in  possible peace talks. Washington is trying to convene a joint meeting of U.S.,  Israeli and Egyptian representatives to work out the composition of a  Palestinian delegation. But the plan has bogged down over opposing demands by  Israel and the PLO. The PLO wants to take part openly; Israel is demanding a  veto in the matter of who can participate.  </P> <P> The government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has long expressed reservations  about the talks. By putting Husseini in jail, the government appears to be  making it clear that anyone with nationalist aspirations is likely to be barred  from the negotiations. In addition, residents of Arab East Jerusalem, where  Husseini lives, would not be welcome. Palestinians in Jerusalem have demanded  that they be represented in the talks.  </P> <P> The political implications of Husseini's arrest were grasped immediately by  onlookers at his hearing.  </P> <P> Tsachbi Hanegbi, a member of Parliament from Shamir's rightist Likud Party who  campaigned for Husseini's arrest, called the Palestinian an extremist.  </P> <P> "He makes a profession of talking moderately, but he shares the ideas of the  PLO," Hanegbi said. "If we take him out of the process, others will arise who  will be more moderate."  </P> <P> But Ran Cohen of the dovish Citizens Rights Movement called the arrest "a  foolish step" and added, "If someone imagines that the political process can be  replaced by a criminal trial, everyone will suffer."  </P> <P> Sari Nusseibeh, another prominent Palestinian leader, said Husseini's detention  is a blow to the "evolution of the Palestinian community toward talking to the  Israelis." Nusseibeh has been named in court documents as a source of PLO  funding for activists in the uprising, but he has not been arrested.  </P> <P> Both the United States and Egypt reacted negatively to Husseini's arrest,  according to wire service reports.  </P> <P> State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the United States was  "surprised and disturbed" by the action.  </P> <P> Criticizing Israel for the second time this week and the fourth time in the  past month, Tutwiler said U.S. Ambassador to Israel William Brown "has told  them that this action sends precisely the wrong signal to the Palestinians at a  time of intense efforts to establish a dialogue between them and the Israelis  and move the process forward."  </P> <P> Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Maguid, speaking to reporters in  Washington after a meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III, said the  arrest was "something we extremely regret; we don't like it."  </P></p>

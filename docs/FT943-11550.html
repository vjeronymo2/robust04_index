			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Japanese venture behind 88% advance at Unitech Shares in Unitech rose 20p to 348p yesterday after the international electronic components and controls group announced an 88 per cent increase in full-year profits. Pre-tax profits climbed to Pounds 19.8m (Pounds 10.5m) after increased demand, particularly in east Asia, pushed sales ahead 20 per cent to Pounds 302.3m (Pounds 253m) in the year to May 31. Although favourable exchange rates flattered the results by adding Pounds 29.4m to group turnover and Pounds 2.3m to profits, operating profits rose from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds 24.4m. The improved performance was underpinned by sharply increased profits at Nemic-Lambda, the group's 50.6 per cent-owned Japanese subsidiary, which contributed Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 3.6m) to the power supplies division. Buoyant demand for power conversion equipment helped the division, Unitech's largest, more than double its profits to Pounds 20m (Pounds 9.94m) on increased sales of Pounds 205.4m (Pounds 164.9m). Mr Peter Curry, chairman, said: 'This success has been driven by Japan. The challenge now is to repeat that with our other divisions.' The group has embarked on a strategy to increase international sales by its two smaller businesses: connectors, which manufactures electronic testing equipment; and control products, the heating and ventilating component company. Mr Curry said such moves, including joint ventures in Japan and China, would offset flat trading conditions in continental Europe, where profits fell from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 927,000. The main victim was the connectors business - based in France - which reported a Pounds 539,000 loss compared with a Pounds 1.02m profit last time. Cost cuts, however, had led to improved efficiency in recent months, and Mr Curry said the business was now trading profitably. The control products division, meanwhile, benefited from steady growth in the UK and saw profits increase from Pounds 2.95m to Pounds 4.8m on turnover of Pounds 51.9m (Pounds 38.9m). Earnings per share rose from 7.3p to 12.9p, and a final dividend of 4.32p (4p) makes a total for the year of 6.56p (6.1p). COMMENT This set of results had analysts searching for superlatives. Verdicts ranged from 'extraordinary' to 'excellent' after the figures exceeded most forecasts for the current year. With no sign of the yen weakening or a reversal in east Asian demand, this year's profit forecasts have been increased on average by a third to about Pounds 28m. The challenge for Unitech is to unlock shareholder value from its stake in Nemic-Lambda, which is valued at Pounds 424m. If it achieves that and also manages to exploit signs of an upturn in Europe, the shares could prove an attractive prospect, despite their premium on a forward multiple of 18.4.</p>

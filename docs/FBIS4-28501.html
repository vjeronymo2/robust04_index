			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  warned North Korea Friday that its suspected nuclear arms  program would result in "a grave mistake of inviting  self-destruction."    Speaking at the opening ceremony for the War Memorial Hall  in  Yongsan, Kim, noting the Russian documents on the Korean war he  received from President Boris Yeltsin during his recent visit to  Moscow reveal how North Korea started the war by invading the  South, said the North is again seeking to commit war crimes by  developing nuclear arms. To avoid this scenario, it must repent  for what it did 40 years ago and apologize to the nation for its  criminal acts.    Deploring that some South Korean youths still believe and  follow the old dogma of communism shunned by the entire world,  he expressed hope that the war memorial hall would serve as a  training ground for the people, especially the rising  generation, to learn the pain and suffering of war.    A people who never forget war will enjoy peace, he stressed,  urging his countrymen to protect freedom and peace.    Attending the ceremony were Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae,  Seoul Mayor Yi Won-chong, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen.  Yi Yang-ho, U.S. Forces Korea Commander Gen. Gary Luck and many  other dignitaries.    Completed in three years and seven months, the six-story war  memorial hall, including two basement floors, is situated on an  area of 35,000 pyong (one pyong is about 3.3 square meters) on  the old site of the Army headquarters in front of the Defense  Ministry building.    Displayed in six showrooms in the building are some 7,800  war  items collected from many countries. In addition, over 110  Korean war items, including the South Korean Air Force's T-6  training plane, the North Korean Army's T-34 tank and a U.S. Air  Force B-52 bomber, are on display.    The hall is open from 9:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays,  starting Tuesday. Admission fees are 2,000 won for adults,  1,500 won for secondary school students and 1,000 for elementary  school pupils.</p>

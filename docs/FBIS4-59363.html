			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 12 (AFP)--The United States recently  sent a message to Iran on opening direct and formal  negotiations, a newspaper said Thursday.    The written message contained assurances that the United  States did not seek to undermine the Islamic republic and urged  Iran "not to take seriously" anti-Tehran comments made by a US  official during a recent Gulf tour, the daily SALAM said.    The assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs,  Robert Pelletreau, said earlier this week in the United Arab  Emirates that Iran was a potential threat and he renewed US  pledges to defend the region.    Tehran and Washington broke diplomatic ties in 1980 after  Iranian radical students stormed US embassy here and took its  staff hostage.    The United States has on several occasion called for direct  negotiations to improve ties, but the two sides have yet to make  a breakthrough.    The latest message also expressed concern over Russia's  "future threats" against the region and said Iran was  geographically "well-placed to counter such an influence," SALAM  said.    But the paper said the message also criticised Iran's  alleged  human rights violations and support for international terrorism.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: PARAPLEGIC IS RACING TOWARD HIS ATHLETIC GOAL  </P> <P> David Cornelsen, 38, is in the process of remaking and redefining himself.  </P> <P> For starters, the well-conditioned Huntington Beach man wants to become a  professional athlete even though he is a paraplegic, the result of a head-on  automobile collision three years ago in Mexicali, Mexico, that disabled his  legs.  </P> <P> "I'd like to make a living being a professional athlete who lectures on  handicapped sports, at least for the short term," said the one-time USC  sociology lecturer.  </P> <P> Earlier this year in New York he competed in a 24-hour time-trial ride in his  racing tricycle against 82 cyclists and finished 47th.  </P> <P> He was the only handicapped contestant.  </P> <P> In August, Cornelsen set a record by cycling his arm-powered tricycle 2,963  miles from Costa Mesa to New York City in 18 days, 16 hours, 52 minutes.  </P> <P> The old record set by a handicapped bicyclist was 32 days, 11 hours. Regular  cyclists can do it in eight days.  </P> <P> "I missed a lot of sleep," was part of the reason offered by Cornelsen for his  success. "I had to. I started out boasting I could do it in 21 days."  </P> <P> His cross-country ride had more than one objective.  </P> <P> Besides raising money and bringing more awareness to what people can do after a  major disability, "I wanted to be taken seriously as an athlete," he said.  </P> <P> He received pledges for the miles he traveled cross country and raised $20,000  for the American Paralysis Assn., which is researching methods to heal spinal  injuries like his.  </P> <P> To prepare himself, the one-time program manager for the disabled at Long Beach  Memorial Medical Centers began training in February by cycling 80 miles a day  on his tricycle in Huntington Beach and on the Santa Ana River bicycle trail.  </P> <P> "I got a lot of attention," said the Boston University graduate, who also has  master's degrees from the University of Connecticut and Yale as well as a  doctorate in social work from the University of Pennsylvania.  </P> <P> "You don't often see a cyclist rowing his way down the street," he said. He  explained that he pushes pedals back and forth at chest level in a rowing  fashion to propel the arm-powered machine, steered by leaning one way or the  other.  </P> <P> He works the brakes with a finger lever.  </P> <P> Cornelsen said he tape-recorded his adventurous but sometimes boring cycling  trip and kept journals from his six-month hospital stay after his accident.  </P> <P> He hopes to include the facts in a book he plans to write.  </P> <P> "During the cross-country trip I talked about what I was experiencing, the  highs and the lows, the boredom and the moment of ecstasy when I finished," he  said.  </P> <P> Cornelsen said it stimulated his mind by talking to the recorder and it also  helped to "recapture the moment at that time because I knew it would be hard to  recall later."  </P> <P> He also attracted a lot of CB (citizens band) attention from truckers.  </P> <P> "I wish I had (heard) some of the things they were saying about me while I was  cycling down the highway," he said.  </P> <P> Writing, however, is only one of his goals.  </P> <P> "I've put a lot of things on hold since my injury," he said. That includes a  career in teaching or in the human services administration field, both earlier  goals he hoped to reach with his education.  </P> <P> But for now, "I'm working very hard to strengthen my legs," he said, much of it  on gym equipment in his home.  </P> <P> "There's a possibility there might be some return to my legs. It's a slow  process."  </P> <P> Santa Ana resident Emily L. Sodicoff, 48, the mother of five grown children,  was named Kiwanian of the Year, the first woman to win the honor in the 70-year  history of the Santa Ana Kiwanis Club.  </P> <P> "The message I get from this is that women not only can be part of a male club  but can be respected and responded to in a positive way," said Sodicoff, an  insurance agent.  </P> <P> Club officials said she may also be the only woman in the world to get the  award from any Kiwanis Club.  </P></p>

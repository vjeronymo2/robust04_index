			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / People: The revolving door at Lucas and TI Tony Edwards was yesterday confirmed as the new chief executive of TI Group's Dowty division, the rival aerospace business to Lucas Industries, where, as recently as August, he was due to take over as chief executive. The move represents not only an extremely rapid change of heart by Sir Anthony Gill, chairman and chief executive of Lucas, and his board which decided in August that Edwards had not established himself as a successor. It is also demonstrates fleet of foot by TI. After taking over Dowty in June, TI placed Sid Taylor, formerly managing director of operations, in a temporary role at Dowty. He was to introduce TI culture and financial reporting systems into Dowty and to begin a strategic review of the division's development in the aerospace area. His position had always been planned to be temporary but a permanent chief executive with detailed knowledge of the aerospace industry had not been expected on board as quickly as Edwards is now due to arrive. TI woke up to the opportunity earlier this month. Following Sir Anthony's confirmation during the presentation of Lucas's interim results that Edwards would not take over, TI pounced via a headhunter. Edwards arrives at TI after two years at Lucas and experience at Bombardier of Canada and General Electric in the US. From November 16 he will take over the role of deciding the strategic development of the Dowty aerospace division. Meanwhile Taylor will move back to head office where he will keep TI's three operating divisions - seals, pipes and aerospace - in touch with the latest world developments in manufacturing practice and research relevant to its manufacturing areas being conducted outside the group. TI has now appointed chief executives in all three divisions: all report to Christopher Lewinton, chief executive and chairman, who in turn is expected to relinquish the chief executive position once the Dowty acquisition is more fully integrated.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Decision on Hurd's Maastricht 'treason' hangs with CPS IT WAS, as Hexham magistrate Mrs Muriel Bowman observed, 'a procedure we rarely see'. Normally, at 9.30 am on Thursdays, the magistrates court in the Northumberland market town hears nothing more momentous than applications for drinks licences. However, yesterday's business was special - a last-ditch attempt to throttle the Maastricht treaty by laying seven charges of treason against the ministers who signed it: Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and the former Treasury minister Mr Francis Maude. Treason still carries the death penalty under UK law. The men behind the move, businessman and Conservative political economist Mr Rodney Atkinson - older brother of comic Rowan Atkinson - and Freedom Association chairman Mr Norris McWhirter, earnestly addressed Mrs Bowman. The massed media - the people of Hexham being conspicuously absent - sat entranced. The statutes they handed over were impressive, from the Coronation Oath Act of 1953 and the 1795 Treason Act to the Magna Carta. Mr Atkinson submitted that the signing of the Maastricht treaty was contrary to laws and statutes of the United Kingdom going back over many centuries. Mrs Bowman played it with a straight bat. She passed it on to the Crown Prosecution Service. After the three-minute hearing Mr Atkinson insisted the challenge was serious. 'My brother is in the business of comedy, I'm afraid on this occasion I'm in the business of tragedy, a democratic tragedy for the British people unless this Maastricht treaty is overturned.' Mr McWhirter threatened a judicial review if the CPS does not act. But did they really want to see Mr Hurd in the Tower of London? 'The Queen can always exercise the prerogative of mercy, provided of course by that time she's not Mrs Elizabeth Windsor, European citizen,' suggested Mr McWhirter. If their main target was worried, there was no sign of it; he was 300 miles away at a Downing Street cabinet meeting and was not represented in court. It was all very civil but then Hexham, chosen for its nearness to Mr Atkinson's family home and distance from the London political establishment, has been pretty quiet for the last few centuries since the border wars between England and Scotland calmed down. The demonstrators, flanked by banners - 'Hang Hurd High', 'Rodney is Right'  -were undeterred. Should Mr Hurd hang? 'Yes, absolutely,' said one. 'It's no more than the government deserves.'</p>

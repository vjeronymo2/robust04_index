			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / International Company News: Ferruzzi and Unilever in Hungarian venture FERRUZZI, the Italian agribusiness group, and Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products manufacturer, are to co-operate in taking over a Hungarian company which is eastern Europe's largest oilseed producer. Though no financial details of the deal were published, it is believed to be worth about Dollars 100m. That would make it by far the largest foreign acquisition in Hungary's food and consumer goods industries, which have been the main target of western investment in the country recently. In a two-stage transaction, Cereol Holding, a Ferruzzi subsidiary, will acquire almost 90 per cent of the state-owned Novenyolajipari es Mososzergyarto Vaallalat (NMV), which has 3,000 employees and had sales last year of Dollars 290m. Cereol will keep NMV's oilseed business and will set up a joint venture with Unilever to take over the Hungarian company's margarine, soaps and detergents activities. The joint venture will be owned 80 per cent by Unilever, which will manage it, and 20 per cent by Cereol. According to privatisation agency officials in Budapest, the Hungarian government was keen to promote competition by separating the two sides of NMV's operations, while neither Ferruzzi nor Unilever wanted to take over the whole of the company's business. NMV crushes about 850,000 tons of domestically grown oilseeds a year. The takeover marks a further phase in the aggressive east European expansion strategy of Ferruzzi, which is Europe's largest oil seed producer. Eridania/Beghin Say, a Ferruzzi subsidiary, last year paid Dollars 40m to acquire 40 per cent holdings in three Hungarian sugar companies, which control about 40 per cent of the country's sugar market. These stakes are due to be increased to 60 per cent. Unilever said it would add international brands to NMV's margarine business, the biggest in Hungary.</p>

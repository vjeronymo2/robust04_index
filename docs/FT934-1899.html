			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Exceptionals cut Bulmer to Pounds 2.7m HP Bulmer Holdings, the cider maker, reported an 11.9 per cent increase in first half pre-tax profits to Pounds 12m after adjustment for exceptional losses of Pounds 8.6m on the sale of its pectin business. On an FRS 3 basis, however, profits for the half year to October 29 declined from Pounds 10.7m to Pounds 2.66m. Helped by a buoyant UK cider market, in which volumes grew 10 per cent to 88.8m gallons in the year to September, operating profits on continuing businesses rose 20 per cent to Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 12.3m). Turnover improved 7 per cent to Pounds 139.5m in spite of lower soft drinks sales and a depressed beer business. Adjusted earnings per share rose 15.7 per cent to 15.02p and the interim dividend is lifted to 4p (3.75p). Operating profits from UK activities rose from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 13.2m. Share of the draught cider market increased from 52.6 per cent to 54.7 per cent. Scrumpy Jack led the growth with volumes through pubs ahead 40 per cent. Strongbow sales rose 4 per cent but Woodpecker showed a modest decline. In the take-home market Scrumpy Jack sales were up 42 per cent. Strongbow's growth was affected by increased competition from economy and private label brands, and Woodpecker volumes, reflecting declining demand for sweet cider, fell 11 per cent. Bulmer almost doubled sales of its economy products to 3.6m gallons and now accounts for 29 per cent of the sector, which is growing at an annual rate of 37 per cent. Mr John Rudgard, chief executive, said an independent review of the UK cider market, commissioned by the company, predicted continuing growth with annual volumes reaching 110m gallons by the end of the decade. The company is extending its orchards and investing Pounds 20m in new manufacturing technology. Profits from Australian operations rose from Pounds 740,000 to Pounds 911,000 while Stassen in Belgium achieved higher than expected growth, contributing profits of Pounds 706,000. Sales in France rose 71 per cent. Borrowings at the period-end totalled Pounds 41.6m but will be reduced to Pounds 33.2m, with gearing of 45.8 per cent, as a result of the pectin disposal.</p>

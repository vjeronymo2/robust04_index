			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour sidesteps union showdown LABOUR HAS shelved a plan to look at the unions' powerful position on the party's ruling National Executive Committee, side-stepping a further confrontation with the unions over their links with the party. The working group reviewing the party's relationship with the unions has decided against pursuing the issue. Last month's NEC meeting, however, endorsed the first part of the group's work, a consultation paper for party members on the role of the unions. Mr John Smith, the party leader, ran into fierce protests from leaders of some of the largest unions when he told that meeting that he wanted the unions excluded from the selection of parliamentary candidates and the election of the Labour leadership, and expressed support for further reductions in the union vote at conference. It had been intended that when July's NEC meeting agreed recommendations to be put to the party conference in October, it would also consider the review group's conclusions about union representation on the NEC itself. There are currently 12 union places among the 25 elected places on the NEC - compared with 7 members elected by constituency parties, the next-largest group. Members of the union review group said that the plan had been abandoned for the time being partly because of the other changes to the party machinery, and partly because it had not been in the original terms of reference. The new National Policy Forum, which will include councillors and MPs, was approved by the conference last year, and in the autumn the composition of the NEC will be affected by the commitment to raise the number of women members. 'It raised too many questions to be dealt with as an 'add-on',' one group member said yesterday. Although there is little doubt that Mr Smith's preferences for the scaling down of union links will prevail, Labour could face severe embarrassment during the union conference season as some unions continue to voice opposition to the plans and question the future of the political levy which finances the party's activities.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Boost for pollution claims COMPANIES COULD face damages claims totalling millions of pounds after yesterday's launch of the Environmental Law Foundation (Elf) - an organisation which helps people protect their environment. Elf has nearly 100 lawyers ready to give local groups legal advice and take cases through courts or planning enquiries. Elf's initial appraisals of cases will be free, and subsequent work will be charged at legal-aid rates. The scheme has been endorsed by Mr Philip Ely, president of the Law Society, and Mr Gareth Williams, chairman of the Bar Council. Leigh Day, one of Elf's member firms, is handling a claim by 1,500 residents of London's Docklands against the London Docklands Development Corporation and Olympia &amp; York, the builder of Canary Wharf. Elf announced yesterday that the residents had won the right to legal aid. Ms Sally Moore of Leigh Day said that claims of Pounds 10,000 for each individual were likely to be made if the case reached the High Court. The claim is based on nuisance from noise and dust levels and interference with television reception. Members of Elf are also advising residents complaining of emissions from the Monkton Coke Works in Tyne and Wear. They have also been helping people near Gateshead fight a proposal for the siting of a waste incinerator on property owned by Northumbria Water, a water-supply company.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As Roels et al. (1992) and other investigators have noted, a threshold for the neurotoxic effects of Mn has not been reported in the epidemiological literature. Therefore, instead of a NOAEL, a LOAEL was obtained from the study by Roels et al. (1992) by dividing the geometric mean integrated respirable dust concentration (793 &mu;g Mn/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  &times; years) by the average period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> worker exposure (5.3 years) to eliminate time (in years) from the time-weighted average, thereby yielding a LOAEL of 150 &mu;g Mn/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (The geometric mean concentration was used to represent the average exposure because the workers' exposure measurements were log-normally distributed, and the arithmetic mean exposure period was used because it was the only value reported by Roels et al. (1992).) The workplace-based LOAEL of 150 &mu;g Mn/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was then adjusted for nonoccupational lifetime exposure by multiplying it by (1) the quotient of 10 m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /day divided by 20 m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /day (for worker versus nonworker ventilation rates) and (2) the quotient of 5 days divided by 7 days (for work week versus full week). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting adjusted LOAEL, labeled the human equivalent concentration (HEC), was 50 &mu;g Mn/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , which was then divided by a total uncertainty factor of 1,000 to yield an RfC of 0.05 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total uncertainty factor of 1,000 incorporated the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors: 10 to protect sensitive individuals; 10 for using a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LOAEL in lieu of a NOAEL; and a composite factor of 10 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> database limitations reflecting the less-than-chronic periods of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure and the lack of reproductive and developmental toxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data, as well as potential but unquantified differences in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity of different forms of Mn. A modifying factor was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used (i.e., it was set equal to 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each RfC is assigned an overall rating of low, medium, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high confidence level, based on two subsidiary confidence ratings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflecting the quality of the evidence from the principal studies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the quality of the overall database for the chemical in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> question, respectively. The revised Mn RfC was assigned a medium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level of confidence. The evidence for the neurobehavioral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of low-level Mn exposure by inhalation was compelling and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent across several well-conducted studies. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited duration of exposure and the lack of a NOAEL for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxicity in any of the principal or supporting studies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevented assigning a confidence level greater than medium.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, the lack of definitive data on the concentration-response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship and on the potential reproductive and developmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity of inhaled Mn limited the degree of confidence in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> database to a medium rating. Virtually all of the human health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence is based on healthy, adult male workers. No known  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies have investigated human female reproductive function, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even though male worker reproductive function is known to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by Mn exposure, it has not received adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation. The limited available information concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developmental toxicity of inhaled Mn suggests the possibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that prenatal exposure of laboratory rodents to MnO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (via the air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplied to the pregnant mother) may depress neurobehavioral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity in neonatal rats and that continued postnatal exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the pups may intensify this depression. In addition, several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies have demonstrated alterations in neurochemical (dopamine)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels in young mice and rats exposed during early postnatal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development to Mn via other routes. Thus, the potential for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developmental toxicity due to Mn exposure exists. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations and durations of exposure sufficient to induce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such effects are not known. Although adequate epidemiological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies of children and the elderly have not been conducted, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is known that certain populations, such as children, pregnant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> women, elderly persons, iron- or calcium-deficient individuals,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and individuals with liver impairment, may have an increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential for excessive Mn body burdens due to increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> absorption or altered clearance mechanisms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another concern raised by the lack of studies involving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer periods of exposure and/or older subjects is that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensatory or reserve capacity of certain neurological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanisms may be stressed by Mn exposure earlier in life, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manifestations of impairments only becoming evident much later,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perhaps at a geriatric stage. One reason for the latter concern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is that Parkinson's disease is typically a geriatric disease in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which symptoms are only seen when the loss of brain cells that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce dopamine (which is also apparently involved in Mn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity) reaches 80% or more. Indeed, some neurologists think  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a long latency period of perhaps several decades may precede  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various parkinsonian syndromes. These points lead to a concern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that if Mn reduces the compensatory or reserve capacity of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nervous system, parkinsonian-type effects might occur earlier in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life than they would otherwise. Thus, several questions remain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be answered before higher confidence in the accuracy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RfC can be achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The two studies of Roels et al. (1992, 1987) were considered coprincipal studies for the derivation of the revised RfC, with supporting evidence in the reports of Mergler et al. (1994), Iregren (1990), and Wennberg et al. (1991, 1992). Given the fact that these studies involved exposure to various oxides and salts of Mn, the RfC is designated as applying to Mn and Mn compounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (including Mn <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The previous RfC of 0.4 &mu;g Mn/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  applied to Mn only, due to undifferentiated forms of Mn in the principal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> study. Given that different forms of metals may have different toxic properties (due to different oxidation states, different solubilities, and possibly other factors), it is likely that different compounds of Mn vary in toxicity. However, sufficient data on the comparative toxicity of various compounds of Mn are not available to judge the relative toxicity of Mn <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  specifically.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / The press and the bottom line: Dominic Lawson is the proud holder of an unbeaten English seat I was never beaten as a pupil, in spite of being sent away as a prep-school boarder at the age of seven. When I emerged from the private education system, approximately 14 years later, my bottom was as serenely untouched as it had been at the outset. Some might say that my parents did not get what they paid for. But, unless I am suffering from what psychologists call denial, I cannot recall any occasion on which I was beaten at home, either. In other words, I am not well qualified to enter into the great flogging debate. This was started by the Singapore government's decision to give Michael Fay, an 18-year-old US resident, six strokes of the cane. It was augmented, by revelations in the UK, of the over-zealousness with which Anthony Chenevix-Trench, a former headmaster of Eton, is said to have beaten his pupils. It appears that President Clinton's biggest foreign policy triumph to date - persuading the Singapore authorities to reduce Michael Fay's sentence from six strokes of the cane to four - has not been greeted enthusiastically in the US. Apparently half the population would rather like to see the same sort of punishment carried out in America against vandals such as Michael Fay. It seems to me absurd that a president, who as Governor of Arkansas gave the go ahead to the judicial execution of a mentally impaired criminal, should lecture another country on 'barbaric practices'. In England too, there has been public approval of Michael Fay's caning. Across the top of yesterday's Daily Mail newspaper there is a garishly colourful picture of a cane, under the banner headline: 'IS THIS THE ANSWER TO BRITAIN'S SOARING CRIME RATE?' Whether it would be or not, is, unfortunately for the Daily Mail's characteristically vigorous campaign, irrelevant. The European Courts have already decreed that such corporal punishment is not to be allowed in the European Union, as the legislators in the Isle of Man discovered to their irritation. No doubt the restoration of violent corporal punishment would give a lot of people enormous pleasure. The Daily Mail was not the only newspaper which lingered long and lovingly over the details of Micheal Fay's flogging. It was with a slight air of disappointment that one newspaper revealed that the Singaporean authorities allow the administering of a slight anaesthetic to the recipients of their judicial canings. Which brings us to Anthony Chenevix-Trench. He, it is alleged, derived sexual satisfaction from flogging naughty Etonians, which, we are told, he carried out in a state of intoxication. In The Spectator, the British political weekly magazine, Charles Moore, a pupil at Eton during the end of Chenevix-Trench's headmastership, argues that the old boy's excesses - which he never experienced at, um, first hand - should not be criticised at all. 'Since imaginative gifts are vital for good teaching and since sexual desire stimulates the imagination, it is not surprising that many great teachers are driven, in part, by desire for their pupils,' argues Moore. I do not know if Moore would continue to take such an unruffled attitude if his own son were to experience the same bizarre form of affection when he goes to Eton: but then the situation is hardly likely to arise. Eton has abolished flogging. As Moore mournfully points out in his article: 'Schools are freer than ever of such men (as Chenevix-Trench) and they are the poorer for it.' What we can say is that present day Singapore and the Eton of 25 years ago have much in common: a very hierarchical system within a closed society, self-confident about its own rigid values, whatever the outside world says. Perhaps those in this country who miss that, should consider settling in Singapore. I believe that it is still very much open to immigrants. Otherwise, I continue to believe that those who enjoy the idea of a good flogging should not be prevented from the innocent pleasure of pursuing their perversion in the sanctity of their own home. All they have to do is read the newspapers. Dominic Lawson is editor of the Spectator</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: 'Recs' wanted Better than expected results from the National Grid, owned by the regional electricity companies, were behind the latest strong performance from the 'recs'. The National Grid announced a 15 per cent increase in its dividend payment, slightly disappointing the market's super-bulls, who had been looking for a rise of around 18 per cent, but generally pleasing the market, where the 'recs' made good progress throughout the session. Mr Kevin Lapwood, utilities analyst at Smith New Court, described the National Grid results as 'extremely bullish for the recs'. The Smith analyst said that in only one year since the Grid had its regulatory review - then viewed as harsh by the market - the company has already managed a return on capital of 8 per cent on the dividend and 15 per cent on earnings on the back of a 10 per cent cut in manpower. 'If the recs can do the same after the current review, then you could be looking at potential prices of 900p a share on average,' said Smith's Mr Lapwood. The best individual performances from the recs came from Eastern, 11 higher at 590p, Northern, 10 up at 651p, and Southern, 10 firmer at 573p. Norweb, 622p, and South Wales, 627p, rose 7 apiece.</p>

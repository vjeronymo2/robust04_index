			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Appeal to Bonn on business confidence THE Bundesbank yesterday appealed to the Bonn government to restore business confidence and bring public spending and deficits under control with an early and convincing end to discussions on Chancellor Helmut Kohl's projected solidarity pact. Mr Otmar Issing, a member of the central bank's policy making central council told a conference business confidence in the economy had deteriorated drastically to a level not seen since the 1970s. He was speaking after an earlier press conference at which the bank announced a modest relaxation of its tough monetary policy, but stuck firmly to its refusal to lower interest rates. Explaining the decisions, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, referred pointedly to federal and regional budget deficits as he declared there was still no room for rate cuts. Yesterday's events supported the growing conviction that while some of the conditions necessary for interest rate cuts are being met, the central bank will not move until the solidarity pact's key aims of public spending cuts and wage moderation are delivered. Chancellor Kohl has said he expects 'significant decisions' in January, although Mr Wolfgang Roth, economics spokesman for the opposition Social Democrats said yesterday's monetary policy moves proved the Bundesbank had no confidence in the government. An increase in the central bank's target range for growth in the M3 measure of money supply from 3.5 to 5.5 per cent this year to 4.5 to 6.5 per cent won wide support from industry and government. According to Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, it took into account current recessionary trends in the west and would guarantee sufficient liquidity for recovery in the east. Mr Johann Eekhoff, secretary of state in the economics ministry, said he was glad special factors such as developments in eastern Germany had been taken into consideration. The decisions would allow room for growth while maintaining stability, he added. Anticipating more criticism from overseas of the central bank's refusal to reduce interest rates, Mr Eekhoff said complaints that German rates were too high were unfounded. Mr Schlesinger said inflation was still too high and there was no room for reducing rates. Mr Issing added that recent low wage settlements - which should help bring inflation down - showed a 'clear correction . . . in the right direction'. However, Mr Schlesinger pointed out that high interest rates were not yet having the desired effect on public sector deficits. Private sector economists, who had forecast an upwards shift in the M3 range, said the bank appeared to have set the stage for both growth and interest rate cuts. The effects of the slowdown, combined with falling import prices, lower pay claims and a decline in underlying inflation are read as signs that rates will start to fall in the new year. The key element yet to fall into place is Chancellor Kohl's mooted 'solidarity pact' between all levels of government, opposition, unions and employers which aims to encompass firm commitments primarily to public spending cuts. Another factor is control of monetary growth which the central bank believes fuels inflation. M3 expansion has outstripped targets every month this year. In October the annualised rate reached 10.3 per cent, but will fall clearly below that in November, according to Mr Issing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, has replied to the letter from  Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of Croatia, of 11  April. We are carrying the letter in full:    Esteemed Mr. President,    I fully agree with you and support your stand on the urgent  release of all detained Bosnian from Mostar's camps, and of all  HVO [Croatian Defense Council] soldiers from Zenica and Travnik  military prisons. In this respect we had previously made the  necessary decisions and issued the necessary orders. The  exchange of prisoners would have already been completed had it  not been for the stand of the HVO's Commission for Prisoners'  Exchange which is incomprehensible to us. Namely, this  commission insists that four persons -- found to have committed  crimes against civilians -- be included in the exchange. No  country in the world can pardon such crimes, whichever  nationality commits them. You are certainly aware of the fact  that last year in Sarajevo a group of our soldiers was given  long-term prison sentences for murdering two Croats, and that  another trial is under way of the persons suspected of killing  Franciscan priests in the military monastery [as heard]. To  leave these crimes unpunished will shake the foundations of the  law and security that our country -- despite everything --  managed to preserve.    I conclude from your letter that you were not acquainted  with  these facts and I, therefore, beg you to do everything in your  power to end the suffering of 340 people imprisoned in Mostar,  Zenica, and Travnik and ensure that their fate is not linked  with the fate of the four persons accused of war crimes.    Esteemed Mr. President, I assure you that the people and  government of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Republic are very keen to  wipe out all disagreements between Croats and Bosnians. The  last two months of peace have clearly confirmed that these two  nations are capable of building a joint state and rebuilding the  kind of life they enjoyed over the past five centuries, before  the recent unnecessary and mutually destructive clashes had  started.    In this spirit, I am expecting your visit to  Bosnia-Herzegovina, convinced that it will strongly encourage  the restoration of trust between our peoples and countries.    I beg you to accept the expressions of my respect.</p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOX CHAIRMAN WILL CHALLENGE FCC ON SYNDICATION RULES  </P> <P> In a move that the television networks hope will cause a major split in the  foundations of the Hollywood production community, Fox Inc. Chairman Barry  Diller announced Friday his long-expected intention to challenge the federal  restrictions on networks' ownership of programming and syndication of reruns.  </P> <P> Diller said he will file a petition with the Federal Communications Commission  on Tuesday asking that the federal government consider relaxing for all  networks the so-called financial interest and syndication rules, which bar them  from sharing in the more than $1-billion market for reselling old network  programs as reruns. The rules also preclude the networks from having a  financial interest in the programs they commission from outside production  companies.  </P> <P> Those rules, instituted 20 years ago, have played a key role in the development  of the syndication business and the rise of independent TV producers. (A  consent decree, set to expire in November, further limits the big networks'  ability to produce programming.) The networks and Hollywood studios have been  in discussions to reach a new compromise on the FCC rules.  </P> <P> Breaking ranks with the studios, Diller is now arguing that the rules are  outmoded. They were designed in 1970 to limit the networks' influence, but now,  he contends, they would inhibit the growth of the networks' first real  competitor, Fox.  </P> <P> The FCC defines an entity that distributes 15 hours of programs a week to be a  network and thus bars it from syndication. Fox, which is heavily involved in  syndication and owns its own studio, currently airs 7 1/2 hours (three nights  of prime time).  </P> <P> But it recently announced plans to move to five nights of prime-time  programming next fall, plus childrens shows and perhaps professional sports,  which would make it a network.  </P> <P> To keep on schedule with those plans, indeed, Fox is also asking for an  immediate exemption to the syndication rules. If it wants to make that fall  expansion, Fox Senior Vice President Preston Padden argued that it must have  the waiver by May to start selling fall advertising.  </P> <P> Those rules were instituted "when words like VCR and cable TV didn't exist,"  Diller argued in an interview. "If you tell me the status quo must be  maintained, I'll tell you you're an idiot."  </P> <P> Yet that is precisely what Diller's own trade organization, the powerful Motion  Picture Assn. of America, is arguing.  </P> <P> "The one thing that hasn't changed is the potential for excessive abuse by the  networks," said Jack Valenti, president of the association. "They are the only  one that can keep you on the air in prime time or keep you off. If this rule  (restricting network ownership of programs) is abolished or radically revised,  every independent programmer in the country will be vulnerable" to the  networks' demanding excessive shares of program ownership.  </P> <P> "The entire production community, large and small, all independent stations and  consumer groups, are all opposed to opening this (syndication) rule," Valenti  said. "It is one of the few rules that stands between competition and the total  dominion by the networks."  </P> <P> Instead, Valenti suggested that if the FCC wants to help Fox continue to build  its fourth network, it re-examine the definition of what constitutes a network.  </P> <P> The networks in turn are hoping that this split between Diller, one of  Hollywood's most important figures, and much of the rest of the community will  be the leverage they need to abolish the syndication rule.  </P> <P> "For a member of the Motion Picture Assn. and the Hollywood production  community to call for modification in this rule represents a landmark  development in U.S. communication policy," said Rick Cotton, executive vice  president and general counsel at NBC.  </P> <P> Yet while the networks want the rule repealed, they don't want the upstart Fox  to be granted a special exemption either, not unless it is granted to all of  the networks.  </P> <P> "We don't see why a vibrant company that is doing well and is the third-largest  communications company in the world should be given special status," said  Martin Franks, vice president for CBS in Washington.  </P> <P> In their lobbying effort, the networks will also note that Fox is part of  Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which is an Australian, not an American, company.  (Murdoch, who controls News Corp., became an American citizen in order to  purchase a group of television stations.)  </P> <P> "If they are going to get a waiver while that review process goes on, the three  American networks should get a waiver while that goes on," Franks said. "The  notion that they are a new struggling venture is absurd."  </P></p>

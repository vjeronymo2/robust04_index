			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / International Company News: Spring share issue for DnB Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, is to launch a NKr2bn share issue next spring as the first step out of government control following a prolonged crisis in the country's financial sector. Under an agreement with the government agencies handling the state's rescue of the loss-stricken banks, about NKr1bn (Dollars 135m) of the funds raised through the issue will be used as a capital injection for DnB. But the balance will go to pay back some of the state's heavy capital commitments made to keep the bank afloat. The agreement is the second move by the authorities towards re-privatising the banking sector. It follows a share issue of a similar scale this month by Christiania Bank, the country's second biggest bank, which also came under state control during the loan-loss crisis. At present, the Government Bank Investment Fund holds a 69 per cent stake in DnB, representing NKr2.9bn in state capital. In addition, a second state aid agency, the Government Bank Insurance Fund, injected preference capital worth NKr3.5bn into the bank. Initially, the preference capital will be converted into equity, bringing the total government share of DnB's equity to 87 per cent. But the share issue, likely to take place next May, will reduce the government's stake to around 65 - 70 per cent and is likely to be followed later by further privatisation. Details of the share issue have yet to be worked out, but DnB said the value would be 'at least' NKr2bn. Officials were keen to point out that the government now looks set to more than recoup its investment in DnB. At current market prices, the government shareholding after conversion of the preference capital is worth NKr8.7bn. This not only exceeds the NKr6.4bn injected by the investment and insurance funds, but also covers a further NKr1.24bn in state cash already written off.</p>

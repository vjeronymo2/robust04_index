			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova </F> by Alena Melicharkova in Vienna on 24 March: "The IMF Is Open  to Discussion"]    [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova returned  from the United States yesterday to assume her office. When we  addressed her at Schwechat airport, she was willing to answer  our questions.    [Melicharkova] Where were you when you learned that you had  been appointed as the government member responsible for economic  policy?    [Schmognerova] I did not expect that the no-confidence vote  in the former prime minister, on the basis of which the former  government resigned, would have an impact on my personal life.  At that time, my colleagues and I were on a trip in the United  States. During this trip, I visited several institutions. I  learned about the fact in Los Angeles. Immediately after my  return to the center, I phoned my husband, and he told me about  the proposal by the people who were forming the government. Of  course, I wanted to make my situation clear. I spoke with Peter  Weiss, chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic,  and with Prime Minister Moravcik. On the basis of the  conversation with them, I accepted the proposal.    [Melicharkova] What was the purpose of your visit to the  United States?    [Schmognerova] My trip was expected to take six months. It  was a working visit organized for future professional  politicians. This program has been running for three years. It  is financed by the Pewtery Double Trust company. The Pew  Freedom Economic Fellow program has three parts--the academic  one, visits to various institutions and organizations, and the  practical one, which is carried out in some government  organization or international financial institutions, or in  private institutions, as the case may be.    [Melicharkova] As deputy prime minister, you have  participated in debates in the IMF, in several international  financial institutions, and with U.S. Treasury Department  representatives. Could you tell us what are the IMF conditions  for approval of the so-called standby credit to the Slovak  Republic? There were rumors that the former government had  prepared a supplement to the already approved IMF memorandum on  the economic policy of the Slovak Republic Government. What is  going on in this sphere? What are the new IMF conditions?    [Schmognerova] The memorandum on economic policy was drafted  last year. It is a program outlining the Slovak Republic's 1994  economic policy. After the IMF visit in January and February of  this year, the IMF decided, on the basis of the results of the  1993 budgetary and monetary policy, to complete the memorandum  with additional conditions in the sphere of financial and  monetary policy. As far as I know, in the sphere of monetary  policy, the National Bank of Slovakia has already accepted these  conditions. The former government did not succeed in drafting  on time a supplement to the memorandum on the financial policy.  One of my intentions was to find out to what extent the IMF  would insist that we exactly meet the demands that were  formulated in that supplement. Certain parts of the talks  regarding this matter were really complicated. We succeeded in  achieving one thing. The IMF will be open to discussion with  the new government of the Slovak Republic. It is important for  us to achieve the goals of the 1994 economic policy. They will  also be open to our suggestions regarding the way we would like  to attain these goals. I believe this is an important step.    [Melicharkova] Do you have any idea to what extent the  economic policy of the current government will build on the  economic policy of the former government, and to what extent  this policy will change?    [Schmognerova] We will continue working on the basic tasks  that have been set out in the program of economic policy.  During the talks in the United States, I tried to explain that  our government was determined to achieve these goals. Our  efforts will be aimed at searching for measures that will allow  us to meet our objectives. We will certainly have quite  important differences here, compared with the former government.    [Melicharkova] It seems that the 1993 state budget deficit  is much higher than estimated two months ago. Without the  deficit in the health care and the education system, it amounts  to some 30 billion korunas. Do you know how to sort out the  deficit-related problem and its impact on the economic policy?  Many people are afraid that it would affect, once again, the  poorest people....    [Schmognerova] We have to look at the reason our deficit  increased so much in the last months of 1993. Basically, there  are three reasons. First, our deficit was mostly affected by  the payment of our debt to the Czech side outside the clearing  system. Second, certain National Property Fund claims in the  banking sphere had to be paid. Third, there were higher  expenditures from the stage budget. In certain spheres,  spending substantially exceeded the projected figures. Each of  these spheres requires a specific attitude and a specific  solution. In every case, we will have to make efforts to  prevent such a situation from arising in the course of the year  or at the end of 1994.</p>

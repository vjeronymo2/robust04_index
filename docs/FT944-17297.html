			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Collecting: Fiac optimism prevails Made homeless by the closure of Paris's Grand Palais, this year's 21st Fiac contemporary art fair is housed, until October 16, in accommodation supplied by culture minister Jacques Toubon - some 14,000 sq m of white tent on the Quai Branly, near the Eiffel Tower. Slightly fewer galleries, 160 as compared to 168 last year, are taking part and the foreign contingent has shrunk from 79 to 67 dealers, including seven British galleries, but only eight Americans as against 14 last year. Even if the Fiac now comes second to the Basle Fair in June as Europe's top contemporary arts show, the tone this year is still optimistic. Declared trading at last year's fair rose to FFr150m (Pounds 18m) following an all-time low of FFr100m in 1992 and organisers hope that 150,000 visitors will pay FFr50 each to crowd under the canvas over the coming week. The recession has radically affected prices - as much as 50 per cent lower than during the boom years of the 1980s - and the art on show. Many dealers have abandoned the staid, big-name works, once reckoned a good bet in hard times, to invest in younger, low-priced artists and thus in genuine contemporary art. To encourage this trend, this week's Fiac, instead of spotlighting galleries from a guest country as in previous years, is inaugurating a special section called 'nouvelles tendencies', housing 35 galleries showing works by young artists. Paintings by Paul Pagk, the British artist, are being shown by the Toulouse gallery of Eric Dupont, who is also exhibiting Hyun Soo Choi, the Korean, and the young Frenchman Musee Khombol. The Marc Jancou Gallery from London's Foley Street, a Fiac newcomer, is exhibiting pieces by British artists Jane Simpson, Martin Creed and Jasper Lester. Several major galleries, such as Paris's Durand-Dessert and Alain Blondel are making do with a selection of works by their stable of artists but almost 70 other stands are staging shows by just one or a handful of people: Paris's Galerie Lahumiere, for example, is exhibiting 10 works by Auguste Herbin, covering the artist's very varied career from 1917-1959, at prices from Ffr500,000 to FFr1.8m (Pounds 60,000-Pounds 220,000). Fellow Parisians Artcurial are devoting their display to the work of five women artists, Sonia Delaunay, Natalia Dumitresco, Germaine Richier, Margaretha Farner and the Danish Sonja Ferlov.</p>

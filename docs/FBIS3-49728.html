After  the talks, which were held behind closed doors, Akashi briefly  addressed journalists, telling them that he and Kontic discussed  the declaration issued at the NATO summit, which asks UNPROFOR  to study the possibilities of protecting Srebrenica and Tuzla  airport. Akashi announced that he will go to Geneva to meet  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and hold consultations on these  issues. He explained that he and Thorvald Stoltenberg will have  different obligations and that he will stay on the territory of  the former Yugoslavia.    I will help the negotiators in Geneva as much as I can. They  will rely on the information that I will send them from the  field. I think that this will help, and hope that it will bring  about positive results sooner, Akashi said. Prime Minister  Kontic and I discussed bilateral relations between the Yugoslav  Government and UNPROFOR, and must say that I am quite encouraged  by his views, Akashi told journalists.</p>

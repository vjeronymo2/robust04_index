			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Smith tightens his grip on NEC MR TONY BLAIR, the shadow home secretary, and Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, were elected for the first time to Labour's national executive committee yesterday as Mr John Smith took an unshakeable grip on the party's ruling body. Mr Neil Kinnock - Mr Smith's predecessor as party leader - was also elected to the 26-member committee, scoring the highest vote in the constituency section. Senior party officials hailed the result as a crushing endorsement of the leadership by grass-roots supporters. In line with a rule change implemented last year, delegates cast their votes in accordance with the results of a ballot of constituency party members. Following the result - which saw the ejection of Mr Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover, and Mr Brian Gould, the unsuccessful challenger to Mr Smith in Labour's leadership election earlier this year - Mr Tony Benn will be the lone voice of left-wing dissent. This may severely restrict the ability of the veteran Chesterfield MP to act as a thorn in the leadership's flesh, as he may lack the routine seconder needed to table motions. In other respects, the result will make no obvious impact on the running of the party, because the once left-wing NEC has long been closely identified with the leadership. With Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, also returned and Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy leader, free to continue as an ex-officio member, Mr Smith has secured what amounts to a kitchen cabinet of senior Westminster colleagues within Labour's ruling body.* Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, and Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, completed the line-up of constituency representatives, while Mr Gerald Kaufman, ex-shadow foreign secretary, did not stand for re-election. Mr Gould, who resigned as shadow heritage secretary on Sunday over his opposition to the Maastricht treaty, blamed the sharp decline in his vote on adverse reaction to his leadership challenge. Facing the end of a 14-year NEC stint, Mr Skinner vowed to remain 'the voice of the left in parliament'. He blamed his demise partly on not appealing to 'yuppies in the south'. Mr Kinnock pledged to 'sustain the impetus' for democratic change within the party. 'It is a very, very strong National Executive Committee and, most important, a committee with the authority that comes from one member, one vote,' he said. In other sections, Ms Hilary Armstrong, Mr Smith's parliamentary private secretary and another loyalist, takes Mrs Beckett's place on the women's slate, while Ms Judith Church of MSF becomes the first woman to win outright in the trade unions section. With Mr Smith and Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy leader, as ex-officio members, the NEC comprises: Trade union section (12 members): D. Duffy (TGWU), W. Connor (Usdaw), C. Kelly (Ucatt), T. Sawyer (Nupe), G. Colling (GPMU), V. Hince (RMT), J. Church (MSF), T. Clarke (UCW), D. Ward (NCU), N. Harris (AEU), R. Rosser (TSSA), C. O'Kane (Cohse). Constituency Labour parties (seven members): N. Kinnock, D. Blunkett, G. Brown, J. Prescott, R. Cook, T. Blair, T. Benn. Women (five members): J. Lestor, C. Short, D. Jeuda, H. Armstrong, B. Etchells. Also elected was Mr Tom Burlison of GMB as treasurer.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BETRAYED' IN THE 'LAND OF THE FREE'  </P> <P> I survived Hitler and came to the land of the free and the home of the brave in  1951. My six-unit apartment house in Santa Monica represents the result of 30  years of hard work.  </P> <P> The Rent Control Board in Santa Monica forces me to rent a beautiful  1,400-square-foot apartment with two bedrooms, dining room and two baths for  under $500, while only two blocks away, in Los Angeles or almost anywhere,  similar or even smaller apartments rent for $900 and more. I am, in fact,  giving my tenants $4,800 each per year, a total of $24,000 for five apartments.  </P> <P> Recently, the house needed a new roof at a cost of about $8,000. Rent Control  handed me a stack of forms to file a petition -- seven copies -- which revealed  that I can charge the cost of the roof plus financing to my tenants over 10  years, or about $11 for each of the six apartments per month. How much will the  $11 be worth in 10 or even five years?  </P> <P> I may be granted this relief if I can show that my net operating income did not  yield a fair return. Who is going to determine the fairness? Each of my tenants  will have the opportunity to see my figures and calculations. Am I still in the  land of the free? Is it permissible that in a free country my tenants have to  have knowledge of my financial matters? Can it be just that people simply vote  themselves my money into their pockets and will not allow me a reasonable  return on my investment? Last year I had, of course, no income whatsoever from  my investment, except for my free rent; the roof ate it all.  </P> <P> I am not allowed to let any of my relations have an apartment in my own house  because I occupy one myself. Am I in the land of the free? No more can I deal  with my property the way I need and want.  </P> <P> Every 50-year-old shack in Santa Monica that was bought for $15,000 can now be  sold for $350,000 while the value of my house has been cut in half because of  the unreasonable actions of the Rent Control Board, which disregards the  realities of the marketplace. Will the day come when the automobile dealer will  have to sell to the low-income people at half price? This is what is happening  to me, except that my tenants are far from the low-income group.  </P> <P> I feel betrayed, abandoned and powerless to fight the dozens of lawyers that  the board pays with my money.  </P> <P> HENRY BAUMGARTEN  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

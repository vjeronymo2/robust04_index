			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. You propose including within the definition of U.S. LICENSEE (subparagraph II.Q.) the licensees' subsidiaries, affiliates, and parents, pointing out that participation by U.S. LICENSEES in off-shore float glass manufacturing projects is often likely to occur through their subsidiaries or affiliates. While this is undoubtedly correct, such subsidiaries or affiliates participate in such projects under sublicenses granted to them by their respective U.S. LICENSEE parents or affiliates. Your proposal is unnecessary since subparagraph IV.A. of the Judgment expressly enjoins Defendants from conduct interfering with U.S. LICENSEES' sublicensing activities to the same extent as it enjoins interfering with their use of SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY. It may be noted that, in the course of discussions leading to the Stipulation to submit the Judgment to the Court, Pilkington's representatives acknowledged that under the Judgment U.S. LICENSEES will be free, through subsidiaries or affiliates, to participate in the design, construction, and operation of overseas float glass plants such as the Shenzhen plant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. You propose broadening the injunctive provisions of subparagraph IV.D., which deal with exports of float glass from abroad into the United States, to cover exports of float glass from the United States as well. Subparagraph IV.A. leaves U.S. LICENSEES free to export float glass from this country. Subparagraph IV.B. analogously protects U.S. NON-LICENSEES from interference with their export of float glass from this country. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. You propose that the injunctive provisions of subparagraphs IV.A. and IV.B. be made perpetual by exempting them from the ten-year Judgment duration provision of subparagraph VII.A. because, in your words, the ``Judgment should not leave open an argument that otherwise perpetual confidentiality obligations'' revive upon the Judgment's expiration. Trade secrecy obligations are, of course, never perpetual; they last only while the information to which they pertain has value and is not public. As set forth in Paragraph 24 of our Complaint, the SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY, all of which had been communicated by Pilkington to U.S. LICENSEES by no later than 1982, no longer has substantial value. The prospect that Defendants would be able to resume interfering with open competition by assertions of confidentiality for the, by then, even more highly superannuated technology, especially in view of the pro-competitive effects that this Judgment can be expected to confer during the next decade, are too remote to justify your proposal. Consequently, the Department does not consider such a change necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. You propose, in effect, to remove the exceptions to the injunction in Subparagraph IV.A.2. against Defendants' asserting know-how rights against U.S. LICENSEES with respect to any FLOAT TECHNOLOGY on the ground that we have determined that Pilkington's core float glass technology currently lacks substantial value. We continue strongly to believe that this assessment of the value of Pilkington's technology is correct, of course. For that reason, Subparagraph IV.A.2.(a) enjoins Defendants from asserting against all U.S. LICENSEES that are not subsidiaries of Defendants any proprietary claims as to the FLOAT TECHNOLOGY disclosed to the licensees under the license agreement (except for the reservation in Subparagraph IV.A.4. of money damage claims for past conduct that, as has already been discussed in Item 4, above, does not affect the public interest). In addition, Subparagraph IV.A.2.(b) enjoins Defendants from asserting any proprietary claims against such licensees as to other FLOAT TECHNOLOGY, (i.e., technology that the licensee did not obtain under the license but that Defendants nevertheless claim is theirs, unless the claim is based on a good faith argument that the technology in question is a legally cognizable trade secret and that it was unlawfully acquired). Subparagraph IV.A.2. therefore properly protects U.S. LICENSEES from unjustified assertions of know-how rights by Defendants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. You propose, as an alternative to your Proposal No. 8, changes to the language of Subparagraph IV.A.2. that would categorically bar Defendants' assertion against U.S. LICENSEES of (1) rights in pre-1983 know-how and (2) trade secrets developed after that date that a Defendant, in your words, ``claims may justify a restraint of trade,'' unless such trade secrets have been disclosed to the Department and to all U.S. LICENSEES and U.S. NON-LICENSEES who request it. You state that without such a provision Defendants will be able to continue to threaten competitors with ambiguous assertions of trade secret rights. We agree that it is important that Defendants be prevented from continuing such illegal conduct, but are certain that the Judgment will enjoin it. Subparagraph IV.A.2. absolutely bars Defendants from making such claims against U.S. LICENSEES with respect to SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY (which in view of the already-discussed 1982 cut-off of improvement disclosures to all U.S. LICENSEES refers to pre-1983 technology), and limits such assertion by Defendants, when dealing with other FLOAT TECHNOLOGY, to instances where they have good faith arguments that they are asserting rights to subject matter that qualifies as legally recognized trade secrets and also that the U.S. LICENSEE in question has obtained the subject matter unlawfully. Subparagraph IV.B.2. similarly protects U.S. NON-LICENSEES from such future conduct. Given the protection afforded by subparagraphs IV.A.2. and IV.B.2., the additional disclosure requirements are unnecessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. You propose to add to subparagraph IV.A.2. requirements that Defendants must satisfy before asserting know-how rights against U.S. LICENSEES that are as exacting as the subparagraph IV.B.2. requirements that apply when Defendants assert such claims against U.S. NON-LICENSEES. Although it may initially seem appropriate to impose the same requirements on Pilkington regardless of whether it asserts such alleged rights against U.S. LICENSEES or U.S. NON-LICENSEES, the differences in how the two groups gain access to Pilkington technology provides the basis for imposing different requirements in the two situations. U.S. LICENSEES originally obtained the SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY under their respective licenses, an information flow, as we have already noted herein, that ended in 1982. Subparagraph IV.A.2.(a) absolutely bars Defendants' claims against U.S. LICENSEES based on such old technology; thus, Defendants would have to establish that any claim they make against a U.S. LICENSEE not only meets the requirements of subparagraphs IV.A.2.(b) but also that the technology in question was obtained by the U.S. LICENSEE after 1982. The requirement for such a showing substantially diminishes the need for the kind of additional showing in claims against U.S. LICENSEES that you propose. By contrast, claims that Defendants might make against U.S. NON-LICENSEES could cover pre-1983 technology as well as that of later origin, making the provisions of IV.B.2. (c) and (d) far more important as safeguards against anticompetitive assertions of such know-how rights. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

These procedures are set forth in order that they may be incorporated by reference in future individual meeting notices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ACNW advises the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on nuclear waste disposal facilities. This includes facilities covered under 10 CFR parts 60 and 61 and other applicable regulations and legislative mandates such as the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act, and the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act, as amended. The Committee's reports become a part of the public record. The ACNW meetings are normally open to the public and provide opportunities for oral or written statements from members of the public to be considered as part of the Committee's information gathering procedure. The meetings are not adjudicatory hearings such as those conducted by the NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel as part of the Commission's licensing process. ACNW full Committee meetings are conducted in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> General Rules Regarding ACNW Meetings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An agenda is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for each full Committee meeting.

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Observer: Bass's not so happy hour Stiff upper lips at Bass, owners of the world's largest hotel chain. Its Holiday Inn franchisee in Sarajevo, which operates the city's premier hotel, is having staff problems. Service has not been the same since the 310-room hotel apparently fell into the hands of Serb extremists for a while. Only this week a colleague was having a quiet drink when guests in the lobby came under fire from the direction of the management office on the first floor balcony. After emptying a few rounds, the Serb vigil- antes then took their place in the hotel restaurant, one of the few remaining open in a city held under siege by their comrades. To add insult to injury, the gun-toting Serbs were served by smiling waiters while guests were told a hot meal would require at least a three-hour wait and there was no question of a reduction on the bill. Bass plays down the incident. First it said that it had been in contact with the hotel and it was so quiet that the general manager had gone home. But hadn't there been any complaints about shooting? After another call to the battle-front, Bass confirmed that a group of Serbs had tried to take over the hostelry on Monday but had been repulsed by Holiday Inn's loyal security staff. 'It's absolutely back to normal now,' insists Ben Hanbury, Bass's director of corporate affairs.</p>

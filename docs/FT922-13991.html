			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Brussels proposes rise in funding for R&amp;D The European Commission yesterday proposed streamlining the institutional and administrative procedures which hamper the distribution of EC research and technological development funds, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the research commissioner, is pressing for an increase in Community R&amp;D funding from Ecu2.4bn (Pounds 1.71bn) in 1992 to Ecu4.2bn by 1997 - 5 per cent of the total EC budget - concentrated more carefully on selected priority projects. According to the Commission's R&amp;D strategy document, published yesterday, EC spending on research and technological development amounted to 2.1 per cent of gross national product last year, compared with 3.5 per cent in Japan and 2.8 per cent in the US. 'In fact, the Community's current level is similar to that of Japan 10 years ago,' says the document. The 58-page document tentatively suggests moving some R&amp;D activities closer to the market to help meet external challenges, without breaking the rules which say that the EC can only support research projects, which do not distort competition in the marketplace.</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEEPING FRESH BASIL  </P> <P> While basil should ideally be used as soon as possible after purchase; it will  keep well for several days if treated like a bouquet.  </P> <P> Strip leaves from lower ends of stems -- if leaves are immersed in water,  they'll rot, and the fouled water will hasten the decay of the whole bunch.  </P> <P> If roots are attached, leave them on; otherwise, cut a slice from the end of  each stem, then set them in water to come up 3 or 4 inches.  </P> <P> In hot weather, the bunch should be kept in the refrigerator, but if  temperatures are moderate the basil bouquet can sit right on the kitchen  counter where it will both look pretty and remind you to use it up.

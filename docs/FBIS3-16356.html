			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 15 Mar -- The process of the restoration of  the autonomy of the Germans in Russia is only possible through a  mass movement "from below" in the places where they live in  large numbers, thinks Sergey Shakhray, Russian Federation  minister for nationalities and regional policy. He declared  this today at a press conference. Sergey Shakhray called such a  movement "the concept of the self-organization of the Russian  Germans."    In his view, Germans living in our country must, first of  all, decide for themselves on how to restore their autonomy,  liaising with the organs of power in the regions where they live  in large numbers. Only then, he pointed out, will there be a  real possibility of passing a federal law to that effect.    Sergey Shakhray also informed journalists about his recent  trip to Bonn, where he attended the fifth sitting of the  Russo-German intergovernmental commission on the problems of the  Russian Germans. According to the minister, the Russian side  confirmed its opinion that the Russian Germans can and must  remain in the Russian Federation. The rights of the Russian  Germans, repressed in 1941, must be restored.    At the sitting of the commission, the minister noted, there  was discussion of the problems involved in financing the  restoration of the Russian Germans' autonomy. At present, there  is no coordination of the sides in this matter, since the  Germans do not trust our state organizations and pass their part  of the funds allocated to the implementation of the program  through private intermediary structures. There are cases of the  squandering and "disappearance without trace" of the German part  of the funds.    But now, Sergey Shakhray stressed, the sides have agreed  that, in order to prevent such a situation arising, a special  Russian-German foundation and, at the local level,  Russian-German societies will monitor the distribution of funds  at federal level.</p>

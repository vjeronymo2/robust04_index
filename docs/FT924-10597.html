			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Way open for claims by civil servants THE GOVERNMENT may face thousands of compensation claims from civil servants who were confronted with job loss or deterioration in pay and conditions through compulsory competitive tendering (CCT). Ms Olga Aikin of Aikin Driver Partnership, the employment law specialists, told the Institute of Personnel Management's annual conference in Harrogate that claims could be brought against the government for not complying with a European Community directive that protects workers' jobs, pay and conditions when they change employers. Until now, the government has argued that the directive applies only to workers in the private sector. The NUCPS Civil Service union, which represents middle-ranking civil servants, is to test a recent ruling of the European Court suggesting that member states are liable for losses suffered by their nationals if they fail to comply with directives. The union believes that workers who would have retained their jobs, public-sector pay and conditions, had private companies not won contracts, can claim compensation, and that claims for unfair dismissal may be brought by workers sacked several years ago. It also says the three-month time limit for unfair dismissal claims would run only from the date that the directive is fully enforced. The government, after a separate ruling in the European Court, has accepted that UK law does not fully comply with the 1977 directive - known as the acquired rights directive - and an early amendment is expected. Civil servants at the DVLA driver and licence records office voted to stage a one-day strike today in protest at a threat to shed 3,000 jobs there. A ballot of members of the CPSA, the biggest union at the Swansea centre, was in favour of industrial action, although the smaller NUCPS union voted against. Hundreds of staff are expected to stay away from work to attend a rally in Swansea, supported by local Labour MPs and union leaders.</p>

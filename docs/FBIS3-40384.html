			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wilfried Klapprott: "Joint Ventures Give SNI A </F> Boost In Eastern Europe -- There Was Little Activity before the  Change;" first paragraph is COMPUTER ZEITUNG introduction]    [Text] Unlike other European firms in the IT [information  technology] sector, Siemens Nixdorf Information Systems AG (SNI)  does not have a traditional presence on eastern European  markets. Nevertheless, the company achieved a turnover of some  50 million German marks [DM] there in the 1991/92 fiscal year.    Heinz Nixdorf, the dominant patriarch of the former Nixdorf  Computer AG while he was alive, would not hear of contacts with  the East. At an international Cebit press conference he called  the former GDR [German Democratic Republic] a "shit country" [as  published], and he thought just the same about other nations in  eastern Europe. He therefore did no business with the East.  The COCOM [Coordinating Committee for East-West Trade Policy]  rules also obliged Siemens AG to exercise restraint in its IT  business, and the only remarkable activities it developed before  the eastern markets opened up were in the rail transport and  telecommunications sectors in the former Czechoslovakia.    But immediately after the reunification Siemens Nixdorf  Eastern Europe GmbH (SNO) was set up in Dresden with the aim of  "meeting the demands and requirements of industry and society in  the reformed states of central and eastern Europe and central  Asia in the best possible way." It currently employs about 300  people, coordinating the activities of the regional agencies it  has had in Moscow, Prague and Warsaw since 1990 and in Almaty  (Kazakhstan) and Kiev (Ukraine) since 1992. This year an office  was also opened in Bratislava, Slovak Republic. Most of the  staff of the regional establishments are nationals.    SNO offers the entire range of SNI products and services.  Investments in services and partnerships are to the fore in  almost all new business. For example, SNO is cooperating with  national companies in production, development, sales, service  and training in order to meet the specific national IT  requirements in the best possible way. According to SNO, the  promotion of partnerships is also "intended to contribute to  value creation in the country."    With Russian partners SNO has developed the Polis police  information system to national specifications, based on similar  systems in Germany and other European countries. Polis is being  introduced at central, regional and municipal levels in Russia.  A follow-up order has already been received from Kazakhstan. A  contract has been signed with the Ministry of the Interior under  which police offices in Kazakhstan's 23 regions will be equipped  with a total of 700 video terminals. In addition to the  hardware and software, training and after-sales service will  also be provided. Installation will begin before the end of  1993 and will be completed in three years. An SNI mainframe  with the BS2000 operating system will handle data management and  data security at police headquarters in Almaty. Middle-power  range Sinix systems operate as communications servers in a  country-wide network, while PC's or workstations are used as  video terminals. Among other things, Polis includes a  relational database and optical archiving and image processing  components. The Kazakhstan police will use it as an information  and investigation system and for processing cases.    SNO is also cooperating with the NIZEVT Computer Technology  Scientific Research Institute in Moscow. At an investment cost  of DM3 million and with a significant input from NIZEVT staff,  SNO has developed a migration concept from "Eser" (uniform  system of electronic computer technology in the former CMEA  [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] area) to BS2000 and set  up a demonstration computer center.  <H5>  Earlier Siemens Contacts Helpful </H5>   In the Czech Republic SNO is benefiting from the  comparatively favorable free-market conditions and earlier  Siemens contacts in the telecommunications sector. Among  others, a project has been carried out for the foreign insurance  section of Czech Insurance with the VESYS program package, using  an SNI H60 system. The Czech social insurance is also going for  SNO/SNI, and has had 97 Sinix MX300-60 systems with a total of  1500 PC workstations installed in its branch offices. SNO is  undertaking automatic passenger handling for the Czech State  Railway CD; five years ago Siemens-Nixdorf technology was used  to automate freight wagon circulation for the then Czechoslovak  State Railway. SNO has supplied the Slovak Republic's largest  bank, the General Credit Bank Bratislava, with 70 automatic  teller machines, connected online to the authorization center in  Bratislava.    SNO is paying particular attention to basic and advanced  training for its own and its clients' personnel. Besides  imparting basic knowledge wherever SNI systems are installed,  SNO says it is also offering courses in software development,  data communications, marketing, management and work methods,  basic business management, and foreign languages, among others.  SNO is also setting up training centers where major potential  customers are located, mainly to provide software training in  the respective national languages. In some cases training is  also given at its own training center in the West or in  cooperation with foreign educational establishments.    Over DM4 million have been invested in the Moscow training  center. It now has four rooms available for a total of 80  trainees. Mostly, courses are given on the MS-DOS and Unix/Sinix  system management, the BS2000 system administration, and network  management. There are 60 types of courses in all. In addition,  special courses for particular projects or clients are arranged  when required.    The range of services offered is also extensive. It consists  of four complex units, within which clients can select modules  to suit their requirements. The units are: system servicing,  security systems, infrastructure, networks, and additional  services which cover also other firms' hardware and software  used in conjunction with SNI products. Whether in planning,  execution, training or service, in all fields SNO cooperates  with partners and potential clients to identify their specific  requirements. They are explicitly seeking to avoid grafting on  ready-made western solutions.</p>

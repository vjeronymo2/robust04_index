			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRW TO LAY OFF UP TO 300 AT SPACE SECTOR;  </P> <P> AEROSPACE: UNTIL NOW, EXPERTS PRESUMED THAT SECRET PROGRAMS WOULD BE LESS  AFFECTED BY PENTAGON BUDGET CUTS.  </P> <P> TRW said Wednesday that a substantial reduction in funding on some of its  classified military programs will force it to lay off about 200 to 300 workers  at its Space &amp; Defense Sector in Redondo Beach, a signal that the  Pentagon's "black" programs may be under increasing budget pressure.  </P> <P> Until now, many analysts and industry experts had presumed that secret programs  would be less affected than conventional weapons programs by defense budget  cuts, since secret programs typically support special military needs or  intelligence.  </P> <P> But that upbeat assessment is changing.  </P> <P> "Clearly, the tide has shifted and these intelligence and special access  programs are going to be looked at more closely than they have been in the  past," said John Pike, director of the space policy project at the Federation  of American Scientists in Washington.  </P> <P> Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), a member of the Senate Intelligence  Committee, "has been hollering that we spend too much on satellites," said  Pike, who estimates that the United States spends about $5 billion annually on  intelligence satellites. That is more than is spent on tanks, strategic bombers  or Star Wars.  </P> <P> "The most expensive satellite, a Keyhole, costs about $2 billion, including  launch costs -- and that's as much as an aircraft carrier," Pike said. "But it  is a really good satellite."  </P> <P> Lockheed, rather than TRW, produces the Keyhole satellite.  </P> <P> Calabasas-based Lockheed recently consolidated its Sunnyvale operations, which  does a substantial amount of classified military work. Although the overall  unit has posted higher sales and profits so far this year, it has had declines  in "certain space system and defensive missile activities," according to  Lockheed's third-quarter report. The operation anticipates making some moderate  job reductions next year, a spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has  been a strong champion of satellite programs and fought efforts to cut the  nation's commitment to them, Pike said. But in a highly charged political  environment to contain defense spending and with a conflict looming in the  Middle East, spending on secret programs could be vulnerable.  </P> <P> Robert Costello, former Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, said in an  interview that the current Middle East crisis has forced Pentagon officials to  look closely at expenditures in an effort to increase the direct support of  U.S. combat forces.  </P> <P> "If they are not going to cut the visible programs like the B-2 bomber, then  somebody is going to take the (politically) easy route and cut the programs  nobody can see," Costello, a senior researcher at the Hudson Institute, said.  "With a constrained budget, it is the logical thing to do, but I think it is  wrong."  </P> <P> Indeed, Costello argues that a conventional arms treaty with the Soviet Union  will increase rather than reduce the need for strategic reconnaissance systems,  despite their high cost. "Surveillance activities have to be supported," he  said.  </P> <P> Cleveland-based TRW said the greatest impact of its layoffs would fall on its  Space &amp; Technology group, which produces satellites and other advanced  technology products. The firm said it could give no indication of the type or  scope of the work being reduced, but that it does not involve any of the firm's  major unclassified satellite programs, such as the Milstar, Defense Support  Program or Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System.  </P> <P> Among the firm's classified programs are believed to be a number of electronic  surveillance and infrared spying satellites, as well as payloads for satellites  produced by other contractors.  </P> <P> TRW spokeswoman Julie Meier Wright said the company would attempt to find new  jobs for some of the workers and that the actual layoffs might be somewhat  smaller than currently estimated. The layoffs will not begin until early next  year.  </P> <P> TRW's Space &amp; Defense Sector has eliminated 1,600 jobs nationally this  year, including 950 in the Los Angeles area. The firm laid off about 500 of  those workers; the balance of the jobs were eliminated through attrition.  </P> <P> As recently as 1987, TRW employed 20,000 workers at its facilities in Redondo  Beach and San Bernardino. The firm was forced to lay off 1,000 workers in 1987  when a major secret program was cancelled. It currently employs 15,600 workers  in the two locations.  </P></p>

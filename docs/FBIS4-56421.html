			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Relations Ministry </F> spokesman Miguel Alfonso by Barbara Bethancourt on 3 May; place  not given; from the "Evening Information Review" newscast --  recorded]    [Text] [Bethancourt] The U.S. Government has prevented  Foreign Relations Minister Roberto Robaina from participating in  a television program to explain the island's current situation.  Ted Turner, TBS [Turner Broadcasting System] president, invited  Robaina to Atlanta to attend the show. Foreign Ministry  spokesman Miguel Alfonso, please give us your report on the  situation:    [Alfonso] As I said earlier, we received the agenda listing  those invited on 7 March. The Atlanta conference was supposed  to take place 1-5 May in Atlanta. As you know, we must forward a  formal note to request a U.S. visa. The Foreign Ministry, on 4  April, 25 days before Robaina's scheduled trip to Atlanta, sent  the formal note. As you know, the U.S. Interests Section in  Havana has established a certain number of days to submit an  application prior to granting such a visa and those 25 days more  than covered this restriction. The note containing pertinent  information was delivered, and we began waiting to see whether  or not the visa would be granted.    Cuban authorities learned that TBS and CNN officials had  contacted the relevant authorities in the State Department.  According to the information we have, TBS officials believed the  visa would be granted. Time went by, and, as of 28 April, the  day before Robaina was scheduled to leave for Atlanta, we had  received no answer from the U.S. Interests Section in Havana,  which, as you know, is part of the Swiss Embassy in Cuba.    In view of this situation, the Foreign Ministry decided to  withdraw the passports from the U.S. Interests Section because  it had become impossible to schedule the trip. This is because  Robaina was supposed to leave for Atlanta the next day.    In short, this is a situation I want you, the media, to  examine. The media cannot overlook the fact that it was made  impossible for a figure such as Robaina to speak before an  important forum and have access to the international media to  discuss Cuba's position. Robaina and a number of Cuban  authorities have pursued this policy on a regular basis. I  repeat, the media cannot ignore the fact that it is hard to  believe all of this talk about freedom of thought in light of  Robaina's inability to obtain an entry visa to attend an  important television forum.    As you can see, there is no correlation between all of those  ideas espoused by the U.S. Government, which claims to advocate  freedom of speech, freedom of opinion, and the free flow of  ideas, and this inability of such an important Cuban  personality, like the foreign minister, to attend this forum for  exchanging ideas because other people in attendance may have  opinions that differ from Robaina's. This event was an ideal  venue for exchanging ideas because we always believe that by  exchanging ideas, we can better understand the opinions of  others. This is the statement I have for you.    [Bethancourt] Did you receive any reply after you withdrew  the passports?    [Alfonso] It was very interesting. As I already said, our  authorities decided hours before Robaina's departure that there  was no chance he would be able to make the trip. Therefore, the  passports were withdrawn, and the very next day, 29 April,  Secret Service agents from the State Department [as heard] went  to our Interests Section in Washington, D.C., to coordinate ways  to ensure Minister Robaina's safety during his visit to the  United States.    This situation indeed deserves to be criticized, because as  far as I know, communications between Havana and Washington were  not interrupted on 28 April. This visit in Washington by Secret  Service agents took place after we withdrew the passports the  day before. Again, these agents went there the following day to  coordinate ways to secure the personal safety of the Cuban  foreign minister. There you have it. This is the only reply we  have received.    [Bethancourt] Have you received any word from the U.S.  Interests Section in Havana?    [Alfonso] We have received no reply or explanation  whatsoever. The visa was not granted, considering we decided to  withdraw the passports from the hands of the U.S. authorities in  Havana.    [Bethancourt] We just heard Foreign Ministry spokesman  Miguel  Alfonso explain the reasons why Minister Robaina will not attend  a television show he had been invited to in the United States in  Atlanta.</p>

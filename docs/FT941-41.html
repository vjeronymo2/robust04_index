			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Woolworth interim result to be restated Woolworth, one of the oldest retailers in the US, disclosed yesterday it would restate 'interim financial results' for fiscal 1994 amid allegations of accounting irregularities. It warned that it may have to restate its fiscal 1993 results. The company refused to reveal the source or specific nature of the allegations, but announced the appointment of a special committee of outside directors to investigate the charges. 'While the company cannot at this time evaluate the accuracy of the allegations, it believes that nothing in the allegations will materially adversely affect the company's financial positions,' Woolworth said just before trading began on Wall Street. The company added it was unable to estimate the amount of any restatements but said the adjustments were 'not expected to have an impact on full-year results'. Instead, they would 'reflect the correction of gross margins', or the percentage of revenues retained as profit. 'The company believes the announcement speaks for itself,' the group said. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, the New York law firm retained by Woolworth to assist its investigation, was unavailable for comment. Mr Bruce Missett, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York, said the statement may mean the company would have to move some accounting items from one quarter to another. He added that the development would likely depress Woolworth's share price, which has lost nearly half its value over the past year. In early trading, the stock fell Dollars 1 to a 52-week low of Dollars 17. Moody's Investors Service said it was placing Woolworth's long-term debt ratings and its prime-2 commercial paper under review for a possible downgrading.</p>

In coordination with the anticorruption struggle, courts at  all levels in the municipality meted out sentences to over 2,700  criminals for embezzlement, taking bribes, and misuse of public  funds, of whom over 1,000 were sentenced to more than five years  of imprisonment, life imprisonment, or death.    In the meantime, Beijing's courts at all levels persisted in  promptly and strictly cracking down on criminal elements that  seriously endangered public security. Over 4,900 such criminals  were sentenced, including 160-odd murderers, 1,000-odd robbers,  and 560-odd rapists. The courts at all levels also held over  100 rallies to pronounce sentences, thus maintaining the  momentum of the strict crackdown activities and effectively  frightening criminals.    In trying economic cases, courts at all levels in the  municipality received over 7,000 cases on economic disputes in  1993, up 27.9 percent from the previous year, and concluded over  6,900 of them. Money involved in these disputes totaled 1.69  billion yuan, up 122.4 percent.</p>

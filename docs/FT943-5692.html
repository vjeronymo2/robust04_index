			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: SE considers short selling regulation The Stock Exchange is to consult stock market participants on the potential regulation of short-selling, in the wake of complaints over the impact of speculative short sellers on recent share offers. The Exchange said it would issue a consultative document during September to tap views 'on proposals for dealing with concerns' over short selling. Short sellers drive down the share price of companies which are arranging substantial share issues by selling shares that they do not own. Speculators can then balance their 'short' positions by buying cheaper shares through the secondary market issue. SG Warburg, brokers to the Treasury for last year's BT3 share issue, tried to persuade the Stock Exchange to implement rules to prevent substantial investors from driving down the British Telecom share price prior to the offer. The request was turned down under pressure from a number of large institutions. However, Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, gave a speech last July urging the Exchange to introduce rules governing short selling prior to secondary market issues. The Exchange cited 'concerns expressed at the time of the British Telecom and Wellcome share issues', both more than 14 months ago, as the driving force behind its latest decision. A response to the consultation process is likely by the end of this year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" Program] </F>   [Text] The first stage of Operation Putina has been  completed. The aim of the operation was to protect Russian  economic interests in its territorial waters. In other words,  to combat illegal fishing. Border troops; officials from the  Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Customs, the Taxation Police,  Primorrybvod [Maritime Kray Fishery Department], Sakhalinrybvod  [Sakhalin Fishery Department]; and naval personnel took part in  the operation. Captain First Rank Aleksey Velikanov, deputy  chief of the Pacific Border District Maritime Department, tells  us about the results of the first stage of Operation Putina.    [Begin Velikanov recording] The first stage of Operation  Putina '94 ended on 10 May. The results are as follows: During  the operation, more than 800 vessels, of which nearly 300 were  foreign, were found in Russian territorial waters and exclusive  economic zone. One hundred and fifteen [Russian] and 24 foreign  vessels were inspected. Twenty [Russian] and four foreign  vessels were cited for breach of fishing regulations. The  offending [Russian] vessels were fined more than 200 million  rubles. The Japanese fishing vessel was fined $15,385 and  fishing permits of the three remaining foreign vessels were  revoked. Losses estimated at approximately 20 billion rubles  were averted through the resources of those who took part in the  operation. Various resources, namely the Pacific Border  District, the Pacific Fleet, Primorrybvod, Sakhalinrybvod, the  Environment Protection Committee, Spetsmorinspektsiya [Special  Maritime Inspection], as well as the Pacific Fleet and Border  District aviation took part in the operation.    The next stage of the operation is planned for the latter  part of June. However, this does not mean that in the interim  the security of the exclusive economic zone and the state border  will be relaxed. Already, the customs and border troops in  Korsakov, Sakhalin Oblast, early this morning detained two  vessels engaged in the illegal transfer of crabs. They are both  currently under investigation.

Amangeldy Muraliyev, chairman of the State Economic  Committee, emphasized that presently the country is experiencing  a slump in production that looks set to worsen, because, on one  hand, the stage of industrial restructuring has not yet begun,  and on the other the diversification of forms of ownership has  not yet reached a level where market mechanisms begin to work.  In Muraliyev's view, it is clearly essential to pinpoint  sectors to be financed on a priority basis down to the level of  individual enterprises and industries; to work out a mechanism  of tied credit and investment allocation; and to set up a  special government commission to deal with the matters. The  State Economic Committee chairman said that transformations in  the agricultural sector have facilitated access to land for  broad sectors of the population, helped agricultural enterprises  achieve greater independence, and given private farmers a new  lease on life. Hopes that a competitive environment will emerge  following the introduction of new economic methods, however,  have not been fulfilled. Muraliyev said that the objectives of  financial stabilization require that a number of unpopular  measures be taken in the short run. These include the freeing  of bread and municipal services prices, the abandonment of  licensing, and drastic cuts in loans to state-owned enterprises.  We need to find an optimum compromise, he emphasized, between a  tight monetary policy, the development of production, and the  maintenance of the minimum living standards of the population.  In his view this is not an easy task, but the national  referendum demonstrated people's high degree of confidence in  President Akayev and, hence, in reform. We should draw on this  confidence, Muraliyev said, in order to carry out economic  reform at this stage in a proper fashion.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Repent at haste ACTIONS HASTILY conceived in circumstances of national outcry are often later regretted or simply turn out to have been nugatory. The effectiveness of the English criminal justice system has been seriously weakened by miscarriages of justice perpetrated at times of public outrage after horrible terrorist bombings. A series of vicious attacks by dogs two years ago produced the Dangerous Dogs Act which has failed to rid Britain of killer dogs but provided lawyers with work defining breeds. There is a similar peril in the present moral panic over the killing on Merseyside of a two-year-old boy, apparently by older children. The intense media coverage has led many to suppose that the UK has become engulfed in a tide of violent crime. Several recent news stories have been cheaply and misleadingly linked to suggest that children are at the forefront of the crimewave. Recorded crime rates have certainly risen, as in almost every other advanced economy. But fear of crime has risen much faster. And there is, sadly, nothing new about children killing other children - as those with memories long enough to remember the case of Mary Bell will know. Such considerations count for little, however, when politicians scent an issue of popular concern. The parties vie to demonstrate their commitment to ever-stronger measures, with little consideration of their efficacy. The prime minister is right to call for greater condemnation of violent crime. But his corollary of less effort to understand the criminal is exactly what is not needed. Much more work is required to examine the many factors which lie behind increased crime rates. These include unemployment, which has left pockets of deprivation in many large cities where crime is seen as the only way of acquiring material wealth. There is the failure of schools which send 40 per cent of students to further education colleges with inadequate numeracy and literacy skills, along with vocational training system still very much in the throes of uncertain reform. There is the erosion of the nuclear family, which provided two adults to share the burden of parenthood. And there is the question of violence in the media, which may create an impression that violence is the norm. There is also the easy availability of drugs, trafficking in which offers financial rewards way beyond those possible through hard work. Those attractions are enhanced at a time of few job opportunities for young people with no qualifications. There will be disagreements over the weight to be assigned to each of these and to many other relevant factors. But anyone who hopes to contribute to solutions must recognise that dealing with this complex issue needs multifaceted policies managed with skill and determination over long periods. That is the note the government needs to strike in the coming days.</p>

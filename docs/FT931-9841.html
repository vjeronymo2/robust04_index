			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Baby Bell agrees to buy two cable TV companies SOUTHWESTERN Bell, one of the seven Baby Bell regional telephone companies in the US, has agreed to buy two cable television systems in suburban Washington DC for Dollars 650m - a move which marks a dramatic escalation of the battle between telephone and cable industries to bring communications into the 21st century American home. Southwestern Bell is the first US telephone company to try to buy control of a US cable television company and its move could set off a scramble by other telecommunications companies. However, the purchase requires regulatory approval from the Justice Department, the Federal Communications Commission and Judge Harold Greene, who has overseen the Baby Bells since they were split off from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph in a 1984 anti-trust court settlement. Clearing all these fences could take Southwestern Bell a very long time. The seller of the two systems is Hauser Communications, a privately owned company. Southwestern Bell provides local telephone services in Texas and other southwestern states. It is barred from owning a cable company there, under 1984 cable legislation preventing any local telephone company from owning a cable business in its core operating area. Southwestern Bell already owns a cellular telephone franchise in the Washington area and could eventually try to link this into its cable system. This would mean a competitive challenge to the Baby Bell which provides normal, wired telephone services in this area, Bell Atlantic. Southwestern Bell owns and operates a system in Britain and has interests in others in Israel.</p>

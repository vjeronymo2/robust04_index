			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Vasiliy Likhachev, vice-president </F> of the Republic of Tatarstan and doctor of juridical sciences,  conducted by correspondent Dmitriy Lukashov: "Vasiliy Likhachev:  It Is Not Yet Clear To Whom the Realization of the Treaty  Between Russia and Tatarstan Will Bring Greater Political  Capital..."]    [Text] [Begin boxed material] Three months have passed  since the day of conclusion of the "Treaty of the Russian  Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan `On Delineation of  Objects of Management and Mutual Delegation of Powers and  Authorities Between the Agencies of State Power of the Russian  Federation and the Agencies of State Power of the Republic of  Tatarstan'."    Today in Tatariya they no longer speak pretty words on this  subject, but have begun to think about how to live in the  future. A program is being development to bring the economy out  of crisis (and this crisis is obvious, since even oil drilling  is at a standstill). Most likely, major reforms await the local  government. The republic authorities, whose main words during  these last three years have been: "As soon as we conclude the  treaty with Russia...," and which have directed all their  efforts specifically toward this end, to the detriment of the  economy, are now faced with the problem of realizing the treaty  and implementing real reform.    This was the subject of discussion between our correspondent  in Kazan and one of the "fathers" of the treaty, vice-president  of the RT [Republic of Tatarstan] and doctor of juricial  sciences, Professor Vasiliy Likhachev. [End boxed material]    [Correspondent] Vasiliy Nikolayevich, it seems to me that  the  period of euphoria following the signing of the treaty with  Russia in February has passed. The comments by leaders of  Tatariya, including yours, ever more often express the thought  that it is time to start realizing this treaty. Of what should  this consist, first of all?    [Likhachev] Well, first of all I must say that the treaty is  already in effect. This is expressed, specifically, in the fact  that the government of Russia and the federal ministry have  finally begun to perceive us as normal partners whose opinion  must be listened to. And today the factor of our republic in the  political life of Russia and the CIS is not simply the factor of  a former autonomy which has travelled a certain path toward  formulation of statehood. It is the image of a rather competent  politician with an all-Russian, all-CIS reputation as  represented by an entire republic.    As for the intra-republic aspects of the treaty's  realization, it will receive the support of the population only  if it is oriented toward the specific individual. Specifically,  immediately after we signed this treaty, people came up to me on  the streets and in the stores and thanked me. They perceived  this treaty as a means of solving their problems--from the  national to the everyday.    From this standpoint, the economic aspects of realization of  the treaty with Russia are beginning to worry me more and more.  Therefore, during the last meetings with the leadership of  Russia, and specifically with Viktor Chernomyrdin and Oleg  Soskovets, we discussed questions of economic stabilization to a  greater degree.    This treaty has synonymously entered political history. And  no matter what anyone says today, no matter what lengthy  articles are written, the event has come to pass. It is an  entirely logical event which has justified the hopes of most of  the republic's residents.    [Correspondent] You said that the treaty must be oriented  toward specific problems...    [Likhachev] Of course, it is difficult to lay out all the  pluses and minuses on a bookkeeper's abacus. First of all, we  must mention that the treaty allows us to create a normal state.  The level of responsibility of this state is increasing. The  need for increasing the intellect, competency and  professionalism of its public officials is increasing.  Ultimately, this will be a benefit for the people. I am not even  speaking of some specific projects whose realization would be  impossible without mutual understanding with Russia. Moreover,  the treaty also removes many questions of international  relations: It places at the forefront the problems of human  rights and respect for the individual regardless of nationality.    The so-called common man, of course, wants things he can  understand--low prices, low rent, peace on the streets and  material well-being. However, we cannot expect immediate  benefits from this document.    Moreover, without the active inclusion of the republic's  citizens in the realization of the treaty--not in perception on  the level of "like-dislike," but specifically in creative and  conscious work--it is unlikely that we will be able to  accomplish anything. Do not think I am trying to be coy. We are  speaking here of the formation of a civil society in the  republic. The complexity of the signed document consists of the  fact that we, making an effort to depart from the former system,  have nevertheless not gone away from it, but have built a picket  fence of theses from the dictionary of the market economy.  Marketing, management, investments--we hear these words every  day, several times a day. But ask the common man what they mean,  and he will shrug his shoulders at best. Politicians, economists  and the people seem to be living in different dimensions. Some  complain about the lack of education of the people. Others  simply do not understand anything. This is very dangerous,  because the average citizen does not feel himself to be a member  of society and, it seems, soon he will become totally  indifferent to what is being said there, "at the top." This  difficulty will, naturally, be expressed in the realization of  the treaty.    [Correspondent] Is the process of realization of the treaty  currently being formulated in a documental manner?    [Likhachev] Yes, a draft program of action by the agencies  of  state power of the republic on realization of the treaty with  Russia has been developed within the apparatus of the president  and the cabinet of ministers. There is a supplement to this  program which points out the need for adopting various edicts,  laws and decrees. Moreover, it contains a list of supplemental  agreements and treaties with the Russian Federation.    In working on this document, the experts proceeded from the  fact that, first of all, the treaty directly points out the  presence of specific agreements--on transport, foreign policy,  higher education and so forth. And secondly, the need for  adoption of such documents is dictated by life itself.    I might add that the shortest time alotted for preparation  of  various agreements is by the end of 1995.    In this connection, I would like to turn to the problem of  reforming the republic's apparatus of state structures. It is in  need of rejuvenation. I believe this process must begin soon...    [Correspondent] Some time after the adoption of the  Declaration on State Sovereignty and before the signing of the  treaty with Russia, none of the leaders of Tatariya, including  you, ever directly answered the question of whether the republic  is within the make-up of the Russian Federation. From this  angle, the problem of the existence of Tatariya as a state is  not being overly reviewed even today. Yet, in my opinion, from  the treaty it clearly follows that the republic is nevertheless  within the make-up of Russia. Having signed this treaty, have  you not closed that door which opened the way to adoption of  more and more new decisions securing and strengthening the  position of the republic which, ultimately, could have led to  ideal results for many of the political forces of the republic?    [Likhachev] From the very start of negotiations with the  organs of power of Russia, and even before, we knew where we  were going. Our tactical steps were not always substantiated and  justified, but we always kept our strategic goal in view.    Whether the treaty turns out to be specifically such depends  largely on the time factor. Had we concluded it a big sooner or  a big later, it would have been somewhat different, perhaps  closer to the ideal. However, the limit of time and the limit of  confidence of the people had already been exhausted. After all,  we cannot say for almost 3 years: Wait a bit longer, we will  define ourselves soon. Negotiations continued, but there were no  specific results--neither agreements, nor a treaty. And,  naturally, after a certain time the question of confidence in  the president and the state structures of the republic would  have arisen.    The treaty states that, "...the Republic of Tatarstan is a  state united with the Russian Federation..." My  colleagues--jurists in Moscow and in Europe--evaluated this  formulation as being rather flexible. Such flexibility has  allowed us to adopt many elements of life of the Federation  while at the same time retaining our own, legitimized, view of  our existence. In this case, and I repeat this for the 101st  time, we cannot approach the question with standard measures--"a  little federation-confederation." This is a certain intermediate  model which corresponds to the given historical period, the  expression of will of the people of the republic at the  referendum of 21 March 1992. And, undoubtedly, it does not close  off the path to development of the Russian Federation, to  modernization of its state-legal forms, as well as to the  movement of Tatarstan toward strengthening and expanding its  independence.    It is quite another matter that it is reasonable to fear the  realization of the treaty in the sense that it is not yet  provided with cadres, finances, or currency... However, if it  did not exist, we would simply not have paid attention to many  aspects of the republic's existence, just as we do not pay  attention to our own miscalculations. If it turns out well, we  are good fellows. If it does not turn out--Moscow is to blame.  This, after all, is the most comfortable position...    In my opinion, the positive moment of signing of the treaty  between Russia and Tatarstan is obvious. We were the first and,  God willing, not the last in Russia to show that we can achieve  what we want by political methods instead of tanks. The  leadership of Russia, in turn, demonstrated that it is capable  of perceiving the new and of resolving at the negotiating table  any contradictions which may arise. Now we must prove to the  people with specific examples that the process of reforming  Russia is in progress. Not only the leadership of the republic  is interested in the treaty's realization, but also the  leadership of Russia. And it is still unclear to whom it will  ultimately give the greatest political capital.    [Correspondent] By the way, in regard to earning political  capital. The fact of signing of the treaty, it seems to me, has  stirred up the extreme forces in the republic, activated them.  In all probability, with the signing of the treaty, the  opposition, which previously was in a state of ignorance and  then also a state of confusion, now has grounds and a subject  for criticism of the republic's leadership...    [Likhachev] That is so, but it seems to me that in many  people who call themselves politicians, the sense of political  feel has simply been dulled. Since the referendum, criticism of  this treaty cannot speak about anything else.    Opposition is necessary in any society. But our opposition  is  acting strangely somehow. Those who call themselves federalists  want Russia to be a unitarian state. The nationalists,  meanwhile, strive to get maximum independence and full state  separation from Russia. In doing so, both become removed from  real life in their aspirations.    The credo of the republic's leadership consists of following  the main postulate of physicians: Do not cause harm.    [Correspondent] During the period of the treaty's  preparation, the republic authorities spoke about the fact that,  having delegated a large part of the powers and authorities of  Tatariya, Moscow will also give it a greater portion of  responsibility. And the republic authorities, in turn, would  readily accept this responsibility. In other words, they have  taken out a promissory note of trust from the people, and now  the time has come to repay it. And, perhaps, it would be  entirely logical if people blame not Yeltsin, but Sheymiyev for  the high prices in the stores. And no one will listen to  explanations that, supposedly, the Moscow authorities are  conducting an inept financial and tax policy, that the printing  press which encourages inflation works not in Kazan, but in  Moscow... Are you not afraid of such responsibility?    [Likhachev] Only foolish people are not afraid of anything.  Our situation is rather difficult. On one hand, we have  formulated our independence, and on the other--we find ourselves  in a unified economic, cultural and other types of space with  Russia. It will be very difficult to ensure a standard which  differs for the better from the average Russian indicators. Yet  we must do so, because the people need not some political and  legal formulas, but specific results. This is the problem for  today and tomorrow, and this is a tactical problem. Yet the  strategy has been and remains as before: The republic is a  state, and must realize its economic and political sovereignty.  And this includes reforming the supreme organs of state power,  creating a full-fledged system of organs of local  self-government, training high-class administrative cadres,  ensuring a normal living standard, and so forth.    The tasks, as you see, are not the easiest. But there is  nowhere to go. The promissory note, after all, really does have  to be repaid...</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> ALLIES HAVE LONG ROW TO HOE, DESPITE SETTLING SPAT OVER FARM SUBSIDIES;  </P> <P> TRADE: THEY MUST NEGOTIATE A COMPLEX PACT IN GENEVA AND SELL IT AT HOME AND  ABROAD. THE WORLD ECONOMY IS AT STAKE.  </P> <P> President Bush won a significant victory Wednesday when leaders at the  seven-nation economic summit broke the impasse over farm subsidies that had  stalled global trade talks in Geneva.  </P> <P> Resounding as his triumph in Houston was, however, that was the easy part.  Negotiating the actual trade accord and selling it, both abroad and at home,  will make Wednesday's achievement seem simple.  </P> <P> What the leaders did in Houston was essentially jump-start the Geneva  negotiations, which had bogged down over the issue of agricultural subsidies.  Until now, there was virtually no chance that the talks could end by December,  as Administration strategists had hoped. Now, there is hope.  </P> <P> But, as U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills conceded to reporters, there  is still a long way to go in hammering out the details of the complex trade  accord.  </P> <P> The communique that the seven leaders issued Wednesday is basically "a  political statement," Hills said. "We are meeting at the table to negotiate.  We'll see how far we get."  </P> <P> Hills' caution is understandable. The Geneva negotiations, the most sweeping  talks ever held on removing barriers to trade, are designed to revamp the world  trading system.  </P> <P> Besides writing new rules covering agricultural trade, the new system would  impose new regulations for trade in services, investment and intellectual  property, such as patents, trademarks and copyrights. In all, it would affect  about 15 major trade categories. About 105 countries are taking part in the  talks.  </P> <P> With trade tensions already mounting, the stakes are high. William E. Brock  III, who held Hills' job in the early 1980s, warns that if the talks don't  succeed, the failure would throw the world economy into turmoil. Financial  markets would gyrate. Trade would slow sharply. And recession could quickly  follow.  </P> <P> Worse yet, Congress, already on edge over what it perceives as unfairness on  the part of America's trading partners, seems likely to become even more  protectionist if the Geneva talks fail. That, in turn, would help push the  world into competitive trading blocs designed to shut out all competition.  Economically, Europe, Japan and the United States would be at war.  </P> <P> "This is the first big test of whether the big industrial countries can work  out our differences in this new post-Cold War world," says C. Fred Bergsten,  director of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank.  "If the negotiations fail, the impact will go far beyond economics."  </P> <P> What makes the talks especially difficult is that all of the 15  "mini-negotiations" -- on agriculture, services and the like -- are linked to  one another.  </P> <P> Unless the rich countries agree to lower barriers on agriculture and textiles,  which are important products in the less-developed countries, Third World  nations won't accept rules safeguarding Western patents, trademarks and  copyrights. Failure to guarantee free access for service industries would make  any new accord impossible to sell in richer countries.  </P> <P> "The question now is, can the momentum that the summit leaders generated in  Houston be translated to the lower-level negotiators in Geneva?" says Michael  Aho, trade analyst for the Council on Foreign Relations, the New York-based  foreign policy group.  </P> <P> The complex negotiations, which are expected to move into high gear now, will  continue in Geneva until early December, when Cabinet-level trade officials are  scheduled to meet in Brussels for a final week of bargaining. Most of the  serious horse-trading is expected to occur in those final days. Until then,  everything will be up in the air.  </P> <P> Even more uncertain is whether Hills -- and eventually Bush -- will be able to  sell any new accord to Congress. Hills is well aware that the lawmakers won't  even consider the pact seriously unless it contains firm rules for reducing  barriers in agriculture, services and intellectual property.  </P> <P> But if the United States gets its way on these, it almost certainly will have  to give up import quotas and tariffs that now protect powerful domestic  industries, such as textiles, sugar and steel.  </P> <P> Representatives of these industries already have begun lobbying intensely  against the Geneva talks. Now, even the environmentalists have joined them,  protesting efforts to prohibit countries from using what U.S. officials see as  bogus health standards to keep out foreign goods.  </P> <P> The result is almost certain to be a major political brouhaha next January and  February, when the lawmakers, bombarded with narrow-interest political  pressures, begin work on ratifying any new accord.  </P> <P> For now, that time still seems relatively far away. In between, there is much  real work to be done.  </P> <P> "We're going to have further disagreements, further all-night sessions," said  Julius L. Katz, Hills' chief deputy for trade negotiations. The United States  and its trading partners are still far apart.  </P> <P> But the Houston communique is a start. It is aimed at providing the same sort  of political impetus that the summit leaders did in 1977 and 1978, when they  jump-started the previous round of trade-liberalization talks, known formally  as the Tokyo Round.  </P> <P> Those talks, completed in 1979, helped bring about a sizable expansion in world  trade and thus contributed significantly to the expansion that is continuing  today.  </P> <P> The hope of the seven leaders here was that Wednesday's action might do the  same.  </P> <P> </P> <P> AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES  </P> <P> Subsidies include cash payments, value of tariffs and tax benefits and other  forms of producer supports. In billions of dollars.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.10IN:1.67IN:1.67IN:1.67IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> United States  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $44.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $45.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $39.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $32.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> European Community  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 62.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 68.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 62.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 53.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Japan  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 34.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 35.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 37.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 33.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: U.S. Agriculture Department  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial] </F>   [Text] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] submitted a  "preliminary estimate on tax reform" to the government's Tax  Council. It is literally no more than a preliminary estimate of  the future outlook of the social welfare burden outlined in the  future welfare vision program, but it gives a strong impression  of the necessity for substantive tax increases by citing several  theoretical cases where tax increases would be required in a  range above 7 percent. To begin with, it is odd that the report  makes 7 percent the starting point. They should start with a  theoretical case wherein there is no tax increase.    We have always advocated that the study should be premised  on  the fundamental concept of "neutrality in tax revenues" in the  sense that tax reform in all cases would reflect tax increases  which are offset by tax decreases. The reason is that fiscal  spending and fiscal revenues are both influenced by many  uncertain factors and many issues remain to be discussed in  reference to the status of tax burdens. An offsetting  consumption tax rate for an income tax reduction of 6 trillion  yen would be set at 5 to 6 percent. We cannot help but stress  that the case for a real tax increase is very weak, and that it  would be difficult to gain approval of the public for such an  increase. As a result, we fear that tax reform itself will not  be achievable.    The recent estimates were premised on 1) continuation of the  6 trillion yen income tax cut; 2) implementation of public  funding as visualized in the "21st Century Welfare Vision  Program" to cover social welfare-related costs; and 3)  redemption of government bonds used to cover tax reductions in  10 years assuming offsetting consumption tax increases will take  place in fiscal year 1997. Among these premises, the second one  poses special problems.    The welfare vision program outlines benefit and cost  projections for social security based on four assumed cases,  including one case assuming continuation of current systems, but  the recent estimate encompasses revision of the annuity system,  increased efficiency of the medical system, and improvements in  nursing, and is based on a so-called standard model.    According to the estimate, it assumes a 5-percent annual  average growth rate in individual income and a social security  burden in fiscal year 2000 of 21 percent of individual income  versus 17.8 percent for fiscal year 1993, of which public  funding based on tax revenues will amount to 6.5 percent versus  4.8 percent for fiscal year 1993. The latter ratio of 6.5  percent of individual income poses a problem in that it must be  covered by fiscal funding.    Neither has an adequate debate taken place nor has public  consensus been formed about social security benefit levels,  types of benefits, and the breakdown of cost allocations such as  social security taxes, other taxes, and self-help efforts. It is  even possible that the tax burden can be reduced depending on  the options selected.    If the public burden portion as a ratio of public income  were  to be reduced one point to 5.5 percent, the social  security-related expenditures cited in the estimate would be  reduced by 4 trillion yen in fiscal 1994. The estimate indicates  that fiscal requirements for social security will increase by  5.5 to 5.7 trillion yen in fiscal year 1994, but these figures  can be reduced to a level just below 2 trillion yen. This means  that the fiscal deficit will, of necessity, become a lesser  issue.    We cannot help but say that the estimate which claims a 4-5  trillion yen shortfall despite a consumption tax rate of 7  percent is poorly grounded.    Another point of issue concerning the estimate is that it  does not consider spontaneous growth in revenues in its  calculations for revenues and expenditures. Tax revenues are  very unstable in that they expand significantly during stages  such as the bubble economy and drop during recessions like the  current one, but as long as there are progressive income tax  rates, tax revenue will grow faster than the economic growth  rate over the long term.    As a matter of fact, the MOF has estimated that if a tax  revenue elasticity rate of 1.1 and an increase in tax revenue at  a multiple of 1.1 over the economic growth rate are assumed  based on past experience, the spontaneous increase in revenues  will be 2.8-3 trillion yen for fiscal year 1994. If these  figures are considered, revenue and expenditures would change  substantially.    The premise of calling for redemption of emergency  government  bonds in 10 years in the estimate lacks persuasiveness when one  considers that ordinary government bonds are redeemed over 60  years. If the redemption period is set at 60 years, fiscal  expenditures which serve as the source of funds for redemption  hardly pose a problem.    As demonstrated in the foregoing discussion limited to the  premise alone, the estimate reveals MOF intentions of attempting  to create a fiscal crisis by overestimating the fiscal  requirements and underestimating the fiscal revenues.    If one were to elaborate, no mention has been made of any of  the issues that the government should normally deal with. If  reference were made to fiscal revenues, a revision of tax system  inequities mentioned in the midterm report of the government's  Tax Council should be included in calculations. As a minimum, if  action were taken to deprive businesses of benefits accruing  from the use of consumption tax revenues prior to deposit with  tax agencies, it should lead to considerable revenue increases  for the government. The effects of cost reductions based on  administrative and fiscal reform should be similar. It would not  be an exaggeration to say that acceptance of tax reform by the  public depends on actions taken on these issues.    The MOF claims that it excluded such factors because the  figures were not conclusive. However, in a similar vein, the  fiscal requirements used as a premise for the estimate were also  inconclusive.    What we would like to emphasize here is that we do not wish  to deny that fiscal requirements will rise with the aging of  society, but that the recent estimate lacks persuasiveness for  use as a basis for increasing taxes which have a direct effect  on the public's lifestyle. The estimate is presented in a manner  which can only be viewed as making a tax increase an unavoidable  conclusion. What is of concern is that such a stance could cause  a reaction from the public which would lead to a failure in tax  reform.    As repeatedly stated in the past, the pending aging of  society will not sustain the current tax system, which relies  excessively on income taxes. There is a need to expedite a  restructuring of the tax system which corrects the ratio of  direct and indirect taxes. Further delays cannot be tolerated.    At any rate, the previously released welfare vision program  and the recent estimate have clarified that a major issue  remains to be resolved in terms of benefits and burdens.  Administrative and fiscal reform is probably an issue whose  benefits will be steadily implemented on a long-term basis. We  have not reached the stage where we are ready to provide a  conclusive outline of the future of fiscal administration.    The foregoing discussion covered our thoughts on why we  advocate fiscal neutrality. We are convinced that the above  approach provides for the most logical one at the present stage.    The recent estimate clarified the issues that require  resolution. We would ask that the government's Tax Council use  the contents of the estimate as a basis for conducting a  wide-ranging discussion.</p>

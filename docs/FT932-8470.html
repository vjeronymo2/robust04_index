			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Building unions seek local-level pay deals TRADE UNIONS covering 600,000 building and civil engineering workers intend to seek company and site-level wage deals for members after rejecting the employers' demand for a 12-month wage freeze. The unions said in a joint statement after yesterday's breakdown of national negotiations: 'To reject out of hand any increase on wage rates already as low as Pounds 7,000 a year is simply to store up trouble for the future.' They added that the 'employers' inability to negotiate a realistic increase must also cast doubt on the credibility of their industrial relations practices. There are doubtless many contractors now facing the task of negotiating wages directly who will question the tactics of their national negotiators'.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Call for better interim accounts THE STOCK Exchange should demand that companies' interim accounts are more extensive and should be reviewed by their auditors, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said yesterday. The consultative document issued by the institute's auditing committee called for interims, which are issued halfway between financial year-ends, to contain balance sheets and cashflow information, as well details of the profit-and-loss account. The document said the Stock Exchange should require listed companies to provide additional information and be subject to audit, while the Accounting Standards Board and the Auditing Practices Board should issue appropriate technical guidance. The recommendations echo suggestions for an auditor's review of interims in the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance, which reported last month. It also follows a similar proposal by the institute in February for preliminary statements - which are often issued to the market several weeks before the annual report - to be reviewed by a company's auditors. The committee argues that companies' share prices tend to respond far more to interim and preliminary announcements - which provide little and unaudited information - than to the audited accounts. Mr Graham Ward, a partner at Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, who is vice-chairman of the committee, said: 'Half-yearly reports are a major influence on the market, but there are no accounting rules or audit requirements to ensure that the market is given reliable information.' Audit procedures on a half-yearly report should include evaluating a company's internal controls, ensuring that accounting records are up to date, and examining the minutes of board and management committee meetings.

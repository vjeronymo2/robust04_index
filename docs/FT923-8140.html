			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Turkish group offers cash for PPI hotel A PRIVATELY-owned Turkish construction group has approached the administrators of Polly Peck International to buy the Sheraton Voyager hotel in the Mediterranean resort of Antalya. Dogus Holding, a large Turkish construction group with interests in banking and leisure, confirmed yesterday that it had made an all-cash bid for the 409-room hotel. The company declined to disclose the price. The hotel is believed to have cost about Pounds 65m to build. The Antalya Sheraton Voyager is one of Turkey's largest hotels and was opened more than a year behind schedule in September 1990, just weeks before Polly Peck was forced into administration. Occupancy rates have been good throughout this year. The book value of PPI's leisure operations is Pounds 235m, including four smaller hotels in north Cyprus. The Dogus bid follows this week's sale of PPI Del Monte, PPI's fresh fruit operation, to a consortium of Mexican investors for Dollars 499m (Pounds 261m). Dogus said it was waiting for the administrators' valuation of the company and that its bid would be for the shares of the hotel company and not the hotel itself. However, Dogus is also talking with Sheraton International about taking over its 15-year management contract and running the hotel directly. Dogus already owns and manages the largest hotel in the neighbouring resort of Alanya. Polly Peck also owns a number of fruit trading and packaging companies in Cyprus, but legal disputes have so far blocked the administrators' efforts to gain control of these.</p>

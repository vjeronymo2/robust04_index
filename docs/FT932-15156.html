			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Businessmen give conduct pledge THE Office of Fair Trading has received written undertakings from two businessmen involved in the collapsed Club Riviera timeshare company that they will abide by various consumer protection laws. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of the OFT, said yesterday that the future conduct under the Fair Trading Act of Mr Simon Clarke and Mr Lawrence Werner would be 'carefully' monitored. Club Riviera was compulsorily wound up in the High Court on February 3 this year. In July last year the OFT revoked the company's consumer credit licences, the first time the OFT had taken such action against a timeshare company. Sir Bryan said yesterday that if Mr Werner or Mr Clarke failed to abide by their undertakings the matter could be taken before the courts, with ultimately the threat of a fine or imprisonment. The OFT has invoked part three of the Fair Trading Act, which empowers Sir Bryan to require written assurances from company executives to desist from apparent breaches of a wide range of civil and criminal laws. Among the offences that Mr Werner and Mr Clarke have agreed to refrain from committing are: making false or misleading statements regarding services, accommodation and facilities, or which induce consumers into entering contracts; sending threatening letters; retaining consumers' money paid in error; failing to return deposits; and obtaining property by deception.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by correspondent Zhong Min (6988 2404) ] </F>   [Text] Retail prices in the first quarter of this year  rose 21 percent from the same period last year, eight percentage  points higher than last year's average increase of 13 percent  and far higher than the hoped-for "10 percent rise in annual  retail price increases" the State Council vowed to achieve early  this year. Although market supply in the mainland remains  stable, inflation will become this year's greatest problem,  slowing down various reforms and economic development.    Figures from the State Statistics Bureau show an average of  more than 25 percent price increases from the same period last  year in the first quarter in 35 cities across the country, with  Haikou (34 percent), Urumqi (30.6 percent), and Nanjing (30.1  percent) as the top three. Even Beijing's 24 percent,  Shanghai's 23.3 percent, and Guangzhou's 24.3 percent, which are  lower than average, are higher than the national average.    In general, when the inflation rate in a country rises  higher  than 20 percent, dire consequences inevitably follow: economic  recession, serious losses and factory shutdowns, massive  unemployment, panic buying in the market, and other such chaotic  phenomena. But Western experts are surprised to find that none  of the above have happened in mainland China, where market  supply has remained normal.    The truth is, incomes in the mainland rose even higher  during  the steep price hikes. Figures provided by the State Statistics  Bureau show that the income of township and town residents in  the first quarter of this year rose an average of 31.1 percent  from the same period last year, a net growth of 9.3 percent  allowing for price increases. Another survey showed that  increases in urban residents' income came mostly from bonuses,  allowances, part-time jobs, and extra money from odd jobs. This  explains why people have been able to withstand soaring price  increases.    However, constraints and the negative impact of inflation  are  being felt in various areas in the mainland. Mainland experts  pointed out: First-quarter GDP grew 12.7 percent from the same  period last year, of which total industrial output value grew 16  percent from the same period last year. A large increase in  fixed- assets investment was the primary engine of economic  growth, of which fixed-asset investment by state-owned  enterprises alone increased 36 percent from the same period last  year. This, plus the 50 percent or more increase in  fixed-assets investment last year, was a massive dose of new  investment which generated a tremendous pull on goods, and, in  turn, social demand and supply, forcing up prices for raw  materials, energy, and transport and, therefore, enterprises'  production costs, which in turn raised prices for daily  necessities. Experts estimate that fixed-assets investment this  year will rise by about 25 percent to 1,500 billion yuan, higher  than the State Council's projected 1,300 billion. Inflation  will inevitably worsen if fixed-assets investment runs beyond  the scale set by macroregulation and control.    According to official announcements, increased bank lending  in the first quarter amounted to 35.1 billion yuan and was  mainly fueled by increased lending for working capital and  fixed-assets investment. Expansion of the credit scale has  undoubtedly been one of the causes of deteriorating inflation.    What merits attention is the continued drop in production  efficiency among state-owned enterprises in the first quarter of  this year. Close to 50 percent of these enterprises are losing  money, and they absorbed 15.7 billion yuan of government  subsidies. Because these loss-sustaining enterprises will not go  bankrupt, all wages, bonuses, and allowances were paid as usual,  in effect turning government subsidies to these enterprises into  bank loans and bonds, while there was no respite in social  consumption power. Such a situation only drives inflation ever  higher.    Price deregulation, rising procurement prices for  agricultural products, and adjustments in petroleum and coal  prices since last year, together with price increases by shops  taking advantage of tax reform, are no doubt related to the  price hikes. The recent tightening of price management by  provinces and cities might cool things down to some extent.  However, if we cannot maintain control over the two big valves  of fixed-asset investment and the scale of credit, it will  continue to be difficult to curb rising prices and the  inflationary trend.</p>

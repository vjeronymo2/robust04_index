			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Poor trade and sales figures add to UK economic gloom POOR TRADE and retail sales figures yesterday added to growing evidence that the UK economy is failing to recover from recession. The figures, revealing a fall in high street sales and a sharp drop in exports last month, increased nervousness on the London stock market, where the FT-SE 100 share index ended 27.7 lower at 2,387.9. They also depressed the pound, which closed in London at DM2.8325, just a quarter of a pfennig above its lowest close since joining the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990. In late trading in New York it was at DM2.8328. The Central Statistical Office data, showing a 0.2 per cent drop in retail sales in June and a 2.5 per cent monthly drop in the value of imports, indicated that consumer demand is still muted. The fall in imports was outstripped by a drop in exports, reflecting weakening overseas markets. The value of exports fell by 3.5 per cent from Pounds 9.2bn in May to Pounds 8.8bn in June. This caused the visible trade deficit to deteriorate from Pounds 830m in May to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 922m in June. The current account deficit, which includes a projected Pounds 200m surplus from 'invisible' trade, such as services and transfers, was estimated by the CSO to have increased last month to Pounds 722m from Pounds 630m in May. The underlying deficit, which excludes oil and erratic items, such as aircraft and precious stones, remained stable at Pounds 1.2bn, the same as in May.

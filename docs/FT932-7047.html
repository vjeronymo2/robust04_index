			<p>930526 FT  26 MAY 93 / Miners' co-op in need of Pounds 3m MONKTONHALL Mineworkers, the miners' co-operative which is leasing a mine near Edinburgh from British Coal, needs a capital injection of Pounds 3m to overcome its financial crisis and become viable. A report by Quayle Munro, the Edinburgh merchant bank, says that Monktonhall is unable to develop new coalfaces because of lack of finance - due to initial underfunding and operating losses. The losses have exceeded the Pounds 1.6m of initial capital, all of which came in Pounds 10,000 subscriptions from the 160 miners.</p>

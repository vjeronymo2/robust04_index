			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGITAL'S STOCK PLUNGES ON EARNINGS OUTLOOK  </P> <P> Digital Equipment Corp. on Wednesday became the latest technology giant to fall  victim to lowered earnings estimates as its stock plunged more than $10 a  share.  </P> <P> The stock closed down $10.625 at $96.375 in consolidated New York Stock  Exchange trading, a decline of about 10%. It was the most heavily traded issue  on the Big Board.  </P> <P> Digital's decline came after the Maynard, Mass., computer maker indicated to  analysts that its order rate in the current quarter was likely to be lower than  some analysts' expectations.  </P> <P> Despite success in the marketplace, the world's second-biggest computer company  after IBM has been a serious disappointment to investors. Its stock price is  half its peak of $199 a share in August, 1987, which was the time of the stock  market's all-time high.  </P> <P> Digital's fall followed similar drops in recent months by Apple Computer Inc.,  Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines.  </P> <P> Analysts said there was no single factor accounting for all the reductions in  earnings estimates.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MOORPARK'S TAYLOR TO MISS OPENER  </P> <P> Bryant Taylor, one of the Moorpark College football team's top recruits, will  miss the opener against East L.A. today and perhaps the season because of high  blood pressure, Moorpark Coach Jim Bittner said.  </P> <P> "It's getting a little late," Bittner said.  </P> <P> "If he doesn't make it out by next week, we'll probably call it a season. It's  frustrating because there are no answers. They don't know what's wrong with  him."  </P> <P> A standout running back and linebacker at Oxnard High, Taylor (6-2, 210)  tentatively had been moved to linebacker full time by the Moorpark coaches but  had been held out of preseason practice as a precautionary measure.  </P> <P> Bittner said Taylor has continued to undergo medical testing every two days.  </P> <P> He added that Taylor's blood pressure has been lowered through medication but  that efforts to find the cause of the condition have produced nothing  conclusive.  </P> <P> "He still wants to play, but until they find out what's wrong, I won't feel  comfortable," Bittner said.  </P> <P> Taylor was a two-year Times All-Ventura County selection, once at linebacker  and once at running back.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Excerpts] The immediate tension appears to have subsided  in Lesotho following the killing on Thursday [14 April] of  Deputy Prime Minister Selometsi Baholo at the hands of rogue  soldiers who also briefly detained four other government  ministers. [passage omitted] Following this week's crisis, a  Commonwealth mediating team has flown in to Lesotho. On the  line to Maseru, Timothy Ecott asked Max Gaylord, director of  political affairs in the Commonwealth secretariat, whether he  thought this latest crisis was in fact an army revolt:    [Begin recording] [Gaylord] It's not that. In fact we have  just come from a meeting with the delegation of 25 soldiers, the  people that we dealt with last January. They have sought to  reassure us of a couple of things. One is that the Royal  Lesotho Defense Force is still united notwithstanding the rogue  elements who perpetrated the events of last Thursday. They  pledged again through us their loyalty to the Government of  Lesotho, the democratically elected government, and have  reiterated they want to be a professional army.    [Ecott] So, what do you have to do this time?    [Gaylord] Well, I think the principal purpose of our coming  here, we have already been asked: Are you going to solve the  crisis, whatever it is. Well, we are not doing that. We are  here to help the Basotho. The government and the people of  Lesotho are going to solve the crisis (?such as it is). But I  think what we have been able to do is take a reading of the army  through the 25 representatives. Of course, we will be passing  that on to the government. In fact, we have already done so.  And I think that is reassuring in itself. But certainly at one  stage a couple of days ago, I think the international media was  talking of a coup. Well, there is no evidence of that.    [Ecott] Can you say though what the incident actually  revolves around because the government didn't seem to be too  sure. They said it was a good guess that it was related to a  pay dispute.    [Gaylord] I don't think our guess is any better than theirs  at the moment, Tim. In fact, the investigation process is now  under way and I guess it will have to be left to the commander  and the authorities, but it is certainly to early for us to cast  any sort of opinion on it.    [Ecott] Is the situation, however, volatile? Have the people  you have spoken to given you the impression that this was a  flare up that can be contained or will be contained?    [Gaylord] Well, I think it can say to you that I believe it  can be contained. I believe it will be contained because as I  say it looks very much like -- I used the term before -- rogue  elements within the defense force. Certainly there is no hint  of anything in the officer corps from, say, the rank of  lieutenant and above. The deed appears to have been done by  soldiers. So, it certainly can be contained, although it would  be fair to say there is tension in the town. I think the  civilians are probably (?heartily) sick of this sort of thing.  Most of the soldiers or all of the soldiers we spoke to this  afternoon are absolutely dismayed by it (?as well as they) might  be. Some tension, but containable. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Labour calls for probe into Lloyd's syndicates THE LABOUR party last night called for an independent investigation into allegations that a group of Lloyd's syndicates run by market professionals offloaded bad risks on to outside Names. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City affairs spokeswoman, said she had asked Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, to appoint an investigator after receiving detailed documentation about the alleged malpractice. She was among three Labour MPs who were sent details of the transactions. It is thought the documents were passed on by Conservative MPs who suffered heavy losses after becoming Names in the market in the mid-1980s. Names are the individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's and many play no part in the day-to-day operation of the market. The allegations centre on the way in which the market's syndicates reinsure risks among themselves in a continually evolving spiral, known as the London market excess or spiral business. The documents allege that a group of syndicates run by professional agents and Names made large amounts of money out of this business, but that others  -whose members consisted mainly of non-professionals  - consistently faced losses after being saddled with bad risks. Full details of the allegations - and the syndicates involved  - are expected to appear in the House of Commons order paper today after two Labour MPs tabled a series of parliamentary motions last night echoing Ms Mowlam's call for an investigation. Earlier this week at a Westminster meeting, Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, faced strident criticism from Conservative MPs who had suffered heavy losses through the reinsurance business. The completion of an independent report into the reinsurance spiral at Lloyd's is expected in the next few days. The report has been prepared by accountancy firm Rodney-Smith and Partners. It was commissioned by action groups formed by Names who are members of catastrophe reinsurance syndicates at Lloyd's managed by Gooda Walker and Rose Thomson Young agencies. The report was commissioned following a legal opinion by Mr Gavin Lightman QC in October. Mr Lightman said the reinsurance contracts might be 'voidable' - contain flaws allowing Names to apply to have them set aside. Names on the reinsurance syndicates suffered heavy losses as a result of a string of catastrophe losses between 1988 and 1990. They have been encouraged by the successful out-of-court settlement earlier this week negotiated by Names on the controversial Outhwaite syndicate.</p>

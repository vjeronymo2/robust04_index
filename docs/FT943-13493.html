			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Digital restructures core unit Digital Equipment, the struggling computer manufacturer which last week announced plans to cut 20,000 jobs, yesterday announced a new structure for its core computer systems division which involves turning all but its top 1,000 largest customers over to third-party sales and support organisations. Mr Enrico Pesatori, who was named last week to head the division, said Digital currently served about 8,000 customers, but the 1,000 largest accounts made up some 75 per cent of the group's revenues. He said the transition would be orderly and he expected customers to be better served under the new system. Mr Pesatori, who headed sales and marketing, and before that Digital's personal computer operations, said the new division would consist of three worldwide business units, each with profit and loss responsibility. One is the company's PC division, to be headed by Mr Bernhard Auer, who previously headed the company's European PC business. A new systems business unit, which will be temporarily headed by Mr Pesatori, will make Alpha workstations and client server systems and sell them through business partners. An accounts business unit, to be headed by Mr Vincenzo Damiani, who remains president of European operations, will concentrate on sales to the top 1,000 accounts.</p>

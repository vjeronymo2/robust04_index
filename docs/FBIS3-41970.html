			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Jan 18 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry  has neither been informed about Skoda heavy engineering company  General Director Lubomir Soudek's negotiations in Iran last  November nor has it been approached by anyone from the Iranian  side, ministry spokeswoman Lucie Pilipova told CTK today.    The latest issue of the Czech political weekly RESPECT  reported that during the visit to Iran, the delegation from the  Plzen, west Bohemia-based Skoda company led by Soudek negotiated  with the Iranian Defense Ministry and Army representatives on  the possibility of supplying Iran with weapons and military  systems.    The weekly said that representatives from the Czech Foreign  Ministry had also been present at the talks.    Pilipova declined to comment on the published article or on  other reports on the topic that have appeared in the Czech media  recently.    Neither has a spokesman for the Iranian Embassy in Prague  commented on the article, citing a statement issued by his  embassy in December. At that time Iranian Ambassador in Prague  Rasul Movahedijan distanced himself from the information on his  country's alleged efforts to obtain nuclear technology from the  Czech Skoda company. At the same time he spoke in favor of  closer contacts with the company, emphasizing that this  cooperation was directed solely towards peaceful projects.    Skoda representatives admitted in December that Soudek had  negotiated on the possible nuclear project -- the construction  of a nuclear power plant -- during his November visit to  Teheran, but added that no agreement was concluded.    Israeli Ambassador to the Czech Republic Moshe Yegar, in an  interview with CTK in December, voiced the view that any  supplies for nuclear energy projects to Iran were  extraordinarily dangerous and voiced doubts about Iran's  sincerity in connection with the presentation of its nuclear  program as solely peaceful one.    RESPECT wrote that during the November talks with Skoda  representatives, not only were supplies for nuclear energy  projects discussed, but Iran also showed interest in Czech  supplies of "special technology" -- ground-to-air missiles,  modernized T-72 tanks, and the Tamara detection system, which  can track aircraft equipped with special anti-radar devices.</p>

The revised version of the draft law is ready to be  promulgated, said members of the Standing Committee of the  Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) at its Sixth Session,  which started on Tuesday.    They suggested that it be passed during this session, which  ends this Saturday [5 March].    To safeguard the interests of investors from Taiwan by law  will be conducive to encourage more companies, enterprises,  organizations or individuals there to invest in China's  mainland, said Li Yining, vice-chairman of the NPC Law Committee.    "It has been aimed to further promote the economic exchanges  across the Taiwan Straits," said Li, who is a renowned economist  in China.    The draft law stipulates that the state will not nationalize  or requisition the investments; but under special circumstances  and for the need of the public good, the state could purchase  the investments through legal procedures, with the investors  being reimbursed.    Two vice-chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee, Ni Zhifu  and  Li Peiyao, said the draft law should make it clear that the  Taiwan investors should observe China's laws just as they will  be protected by the law.    The draft law on the protection of investments of Taiwan  compatriots was submitted to the legislature for deliberation  for the first time on December 10 last year.    It was submitted to the lawmakers for another review  yesterday after being revised according to opinions both from  the members of the NPC Standing Committee and feedback from the  NPC Finance Committee, localities and departments.</p>

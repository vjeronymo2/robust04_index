			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia is firmly convinced that supporters of terror  in South Africa will not manage to impede the advent of a new  society, that South Africans will make their choice in favor of  democracy and peace in the country, a spokesman for the Russian  Foreign Ministry, Grigory Karasin, told a briefing in Moscow  Tuesday.    Karasin pointed out that for the first time in South  Africa's  history its people cast their ballots for a non-racial  parliament.    According to Karasin, Russia, which made a considerable  contribution to dismantling the apartheid regime, believes in a  new South Africa's future. U.N.-sponsored Russian observers in  South Africa and a number of official observers from Russia are  another sign of this, the diplomat said.    At the same time, Karasin pointed out that in South Africa  there remained forces which did not hope to win electors'  sympathy in a fair struggle under equal conditions and vainly  tried to stop the historical process and torpedo the elections.  "This is how the explosion of a car in Johannesburg near the  building where the ANC headquarters and affiliates of a number  of other political parties are situated should be understood,"  Karasin pointed out.</p>

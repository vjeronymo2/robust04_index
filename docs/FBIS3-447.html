			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government has warned Bophuthatswana that a new  government will turn off the economic taps to the territory  unless free political activity is allowed there. Foreign  Affairs Minister Pik Botha appealed to moderates within the  Bophuthatswana cabinet to reconsider a decision not to  participate in the election. He expressed concern that the  continuing strikes in the territory could spill over into South  Africa and said the government would insist on free political  activity in Bophuthatswana.    Mr. Popo Molefe of the ANC [African National Congress] said  his party would insist that budget allocations to Bophuthatswana  be halted. He said the ANC would also support the  intensification of mass action in support of free political  activity.    Meanwhile, reacting to the furor caused by his cabinet's  decision, President Mangope has said that he is prepared to die  for the independence of Bophuthatswana if necessary. He said  neither the Transitional Electoral Council [as heard] nor the  Independent Electoral Commission would be allowed to operate in  Bophuthatswana unless the government decided to register for the  election.    However, President Mangope expressed optimism that mediation  could lead to agreement to parties before the election.  [sentence as heard] He said it was now up to the Bophuthatswana  parliament to decide whether the state would participate in the  election.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Management: Alarm bells ring for 999 calls - The public sector is becoming more competitive A revolution has been under way in British public services in the past 10 years. Managers are being forced to be ever more efficient and accountable and they are borrowing heavily from the ways of the private sector. In some cases, the impetus is provided by privatisation. In others, managers are being Given greater responsibility for the services they deliver and are encouraged to adopt a more businesslike approach by carefully defined targets on financial performance and quality of service. Government services, such as the payment of benefits, are now provided by executive agencies under contract to government departments. Even parts of the public services which cannot be privatised or hived off into separate organisations are expected to be more accountable for costs and service quality. Within the Department of Trade and Industry, for example, managers are free to buy in support services, such as legal advice and personnel management. In local government, in-house teams must bid for work such as refuse collection and property management against outside contractors. This greater commercialisation requires new ways of working, especially if public service organisations are to compete in open markets: New accounting systems must be installed. Internal and external charging systems must be set up, often in fields where there is no comparable experience in the private sector. Valuations are required for stocks, estates, and overheads. Relationships with suppliers and customers - often formerly part of the same administrative machine - have to be converted into contracts. All of this must be done at the same time as the normal work of the organisation. This is not always easy as is shown by the experience of the former Directorate of Telecommunications (DTels), a section of the Home Office. DTels, which was targeted for reform almost 10 years ago and is a candidate for privatisation, provides telecoms services for the police and fire brigades. Seen by most of its customers as fairly competent, DTels was an accountant's nightmare. Management had no idea how much it cost to perform any task while contracts with individual customers did not exist. According to Nigel Finlayson, head of DTels, the directorate was dedicated to doing whatever was demanded of it 'irrespective of what it was or what it cost'. Squadrons of financial advisers were called to prepare for a more competitive environment. An accounting system was introduced under the supervision of Touche Ross, which enabled management to allocate costs and hours worked to individual cost centres. 'When we started to write things down and record them in a sensible way, we discovered that we were our own biggest customer,' Finlayson recalls. It was only when the accounting system was in place that management was able to attack such problems. Real savings, however, needed wholesale structural reform - but the process of change was interrupted by a complex engineering project to redesign and replace every item of radio equipment used by the UK emergency services. Understandably this was accorded priority by successive home secretaries, but this shows how political priorities can override the drive for greater efficiency. With that project nearly completed, DTels introduced direct charging for its installation and maintenance services in April 1989. Previously, the organisation had been financed centrally from a fund to which all police forces contributed according to size. This inevitably led, to a degree, to the larger metropolitan forces subsidising the smaller ones. While the larger forces welcomed lower charges, the smaller ones were not impressed by higher bills - and with direct charging exposing DTels to competition from other suppliers, they found it easy to shop around. Officials now believe that the changes should have been phased in over a longer period. For example, introducing direct charging before a management accounting system had been properly assimilated forced a bout of cost-cutting without sufficient information about where costs were falling. 'My mistake was to put in direct charging before we knew how competitive we were,' says Gordon Wasserman, the Home Office civil servant responsible for DTels. A comprehensive review of individual customer contracts and stocks of equipment was also launched in 1989. It is an indication of the chaotic state of the records that this took two and a half years to complete. One unexpected consequence was that customers found they had been making annual payments on imaginary or unwanted equipment. For example, some discovered they had been paying for the maintenance of 25p ear-pieces. The result was that DTels' turnover fell, together with staff numbers - down from 1,150 to 700, and further reductions are planned. Sites are being closed to cut overheads. Local cost-cutting targets have been imposed with rigour. 'Their incentive is continued employment,' replies Wasserman when asked how area service managers have been motivated to meet these performance targets. DTels' officials now claim to have an organisation capable of competing with the most efficient private-sector operators. Gerry Rodgers, a director of Serco, one of the group's main competitors, agrees that DTels has become more competitive in the last 12 months. The organisation no longer has to rely as much as it used to on its standing as the dominant force in the market, he says. However, the body labours under some disadvantages. It is constrained by the civil service salary code which makes it impossible to pay more than the most perfunctory bonuses to its best employees. For another, DTels can no longer act as a central procurement agency for the emergency services. This puts it at a disadvantage against competitors who can provide a one-stop service supplying equipment and information services. Success - in the shape of making DTels fit for privatisation  - is still not assured. Some 70 per cent of business with traditional customers has been retained in free competition, but the organisation is running a trading deficit of more than Pounds 4m a year. Under a financial plan agreed with ministers, the organisation must almost halve its trading deficit to Pounds 2.2m by the year ended March 1994 or face possible closure. Despite all the changes which DTels has been through in the last 10 years, it is still too soon to say that it can hold its own in the open market.</p>

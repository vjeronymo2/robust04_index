			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will meet with U.S.  President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher  in Washington on 18 February to finalize the two countries'  positions regarding the North Korean nuclear issue.    In a meeting with Secretary of State Christopher, Foreign  Minister Han is expected to earnestly discuss the conclusion of  an extradition treaty between the ROK and the United States.    The ROK and the United States have set the date of 21  February, when the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  Board of Governors' meeting is scheduled, as the deadline for  the settlement of the nuclear issue. Depending on North Korea's  attitude toward the nuclear issue, therefore, the 18 February  meeting between Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S.  leadership may be the last meeting to discuss follow-up steps  for after 21 February.    Concerning North Korea's attitude toward the settlement of  the nuclear issue, a relevant government high-level official  said on 5 February that "as of today, the IAEA and the United  States have not received any official notification from North  Korea regarding its position to cancel its decision to delay the  withdrawal of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty," and that  "there is therefore no change in the ROK and U.S. Governments'  positions of resolving the nuclear issue through dialogue."    He said that "it will indeed be difficult to resolve the  nuclear issue through dialogue once international sanctions have  been imposed on North Korea," and added: "It is sensible to  continue efforts for dialogue with the North Korean side, since  there is no way of knowing what results will be gained once  sanctions are imposed on North Korea."    He said that "reports by foreign papers that North Korea  would refuse to accept nuclear inspection by the IAEA are not  true."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 28 (CNS) -- According to the State  Education Commission, universities and colleges in China have  planned to enroll 895,000 new students this year, a slight drop  over last year. The commission stressed that the enrollment  work must be carried out properly and its management  strengthened.    According to an official from the commission, though the  enrollment scale will drop slightly this year, it does not mean  that development of higher education in the country would be  limited nor does it mean that there would be a drop in the  entrance rate of students enrolled into higher learning  institutions. Since the number of graduates this year will be  fewer than that of freshmen, the actual number of students  studying in universities and colleges will be up to 2.79  million, an increase of nearly 260,000 or about 10 per cent over  last year.    According to an education development programme drawn up by  the commission set for the year 2,000, China will see 3.5  million students studying in such institutions by the year  2,000, showing an average annual growth of 6.5 per cent. The  actual growth in the number of students during the past two  years was higher than the planned figure and so do such growth  to be seen in this year. [sentence as published] Students who  will graduate this year are expected at 2.15 million, a drop of  160,000 while the entrance rate of high school graduates to be  enrolled into these higher learning institutions will grow by  1.7 percentage points.    The official pointed out that the country had in recent  years  seen some violation of state policy on education including  illegal enrollment of students and running of schools. In order  to keep the running of these higher learning institutions in  good order across the country, governments as well as  departments in charge of student enrollment at various levels  must strengthen their administration of enrollment plans. The  commission would make public a number of universities and  colleges qualified for the enrollment of students on their own.  Other universities not included in this list can not enroll  students on their own.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / SIB urges graphic solution to life company presentation BRITAIN'S life insurance industry is being urged in a report by the Securities and Investments Board to use graphics and illustrations to make it easier for prospective purchasers of life insurance products to understand them. Mr Tim Miller, a SIB consultant and author of the report, believes the graphs should show how many years it will take before a life or pensions policy will give an entitlement to a 100 per cent refund of premiums if cancelled early. They should also show the difference between the value of the policy before and after charges are deducted and the value of life insurance cover provided. Other measures attack what some see as one of the great sales abuses in the industry: the failure of so-called tied agents to tell customers that they are only allowed to sell the products of one company. Sales agents would be required to state clearly who they work for, what they may sell and who pays them. Instead of being allowed to use the title 'appointed representative', or even 'adviser', a tied agent will only be allowed to call himself a sales representative. He will have to show a 'status card' saying that he can only sell the products of a particular company and which of that company's products he is qualified to recommend. Moreover, the sales agent will have to ask the customer to certify that he has received all the information required and give a prescribed cancellation form in case the customer changes his mind within the 14-day cooling-off period. But the centrepiece of the proposals is a chart which outlines at a glance what the value of each policy is year-by-year until it matures. Consumers will have to be given a prospectus outlining the product chosen and a chart spelling out in numerical terms the information contained in the graph. Mr Miller says that regulators have a responsibility to collect main performance indicators on companies. These include some of the indicators the industry is most unhappy about, disclosing such things as commission payments to sales agents and fees and charges. 'I do not however suggest that these returns should be assembled by the regulator into orders of merit. That can be left to the press,' Mr Miller says. Mr Miller last year resigned as a board member of Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, because regulators at Lautro and SIB had caved in to demands from the industry that they should not be forced to disclose their own charges to prospective customers.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special Dispatch": "Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman </F> Remarks on Xi Yang Case"]    [Text] Beijing, 14 Apr (TA KUNG PAO)--Shen Guofang,  Foreign Ministry spokesman, said regarding the case of MING PAO  reporter Xi Yang, that the case is being judged and handled  independently by the judicial department.    Responding to a question on detention of some pro-democracy  elements during the visit of French prime minister to Beijing  and Shanghai, Shen Guofang said: First I must correct you, they  are not pro-democracy elements, they are criminal elements.  Many of them are still on parole, during which period the  Chinese judicial department has the power to take any action,  and this is entirely unrelated to the French prime minister's  visit to China.</p>

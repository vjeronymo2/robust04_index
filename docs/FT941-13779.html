			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / It's the business cycle, stupid: America The slogan 'It's the economy, stupid' is indelibly associated with Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. Yet although it made good sense then to focus attention on immediate ills, such as high unemployment, such an approach is now a political liability. The relevant question today is not the vitality of the recovery (that can be taken for granted, arctic weather and earthquakes notwithstanding), but where the US stands in that constant of economic life: the business cycle. How mature is this cycle? When will the economy run out of capacity and begin to face inflationary pressures? The question seems daft until you recall that the US will shortly enter its fourth year of relatively robust growth. Given that the preceding recession was mild, it is not safe to bet that the economy will still be strong when the New Hampshire primaries open in two years. Some deceleration from the 6 per cent annualised growth of the fourth quarter seems assured. But given the accumulated momentum, growth may level off at 3.5-4.0 per cent. Paradoxically, such strength poses risks, warns Mr William Brown, chief economist at JP Morgan, the New York bank. Calculations by the Federal Reserve and others indicate the economy's long-run potential rate of growth is only 2.0-2.5 per cent. Excess capacity is thus disappearing rapidly: the rate of capacity utilisation in manufacturing industry is already close to the 83 per cent level previously associated with rising inflation. And the US labour market is entering the inflation danger zone. Allowing for demographic trends, Mr Brown reckons a jobless rate (on the current definition) of about 5.75 per cent constitutes 'full employment' in the sense that any further reduction in unemployment would cause accelerating inflation, and thus be unsustainable. The jobless rate has plunged 1.5 percentage points to 6.4 per cent in just 18 months. At this rate of decline, the US will hit full employment in about nine months. Once cyclical expansions really get going, they are hard to control. If the Fed is to prevent inflation rising, it may thus have to tighten policy quite aggressively. Against conventional wisdom, Mr Brown predicts that Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, will raise short-term interest rates, currently 3 per cent, by a quarter point before delivering his Humphrey-Hawkins congressional testimony in late February. (The conventional wisdom is that rates will not be raised until March or possibly even mid-year.) Thereafter the squeeze will have to intensify: by the end of this year short rates will be 4.5 per cent, rising to 5.5 per cent late in 1995. This sounds draconian. Yet although an increase of 2.5 percentage points would probably put a large dent in equity and bond prices, it would hardly be tough by historical standards. In the past six business cycles, short rates have risen by an average of 5.7 percentage points; even if one ignores the inflation-prone 1970s, the average increase was 3.8 percentage points. The JP Morgan analysis, however, is only as good as its assumptions. Some Wall Street economists - for example Mr Bruce Steinberg at investment house Merrill Lynch - believe industrial capacity is growing much faster than official figures imply. He also rejects conventional estimates of long-run potential growth on the grounds that corporate restructuring has raised US productivity growth. In his view, productivity is rising at about 1.75 per cent a year against just under 1 per cent in the 1980s. Since the labour force is growing at about 1.25 per cent, this means the potential growth rate is now about 3 per cent. There is thus more slack in the economy than conventional estimates suggest. One might add that standard measures of inflationary pressure could be equally misleading. Most experts (including the Fed) agree that the consumer price index overstates inflation, which is actually nearer to 2 per cent than the measured 2.7 per cent. Anxieties provoked by corporate 'downsizing' and record levels of white-collar unemployment may also mean that the jobless rate consistent with stable inflation has fallen. At any rate it is hard to believe that many employees will be bold enough to start aggressively demanding higher pay in the near future. It is thus possible that the current upswing could persist for several more years without generating much inflation. The economic landscape is changing in fundamental ways. The economic rise of east Asia and the adoption of market principles in much of the developing world - as well as some formerly communist countries - represents an historic extension of the global market; more intense competition should exert downward pressure on inflation in mature economies, such as the US. Yet as Mr Brown points out, the extraordinary divergence in business operating rates in the US and Europe in recent years suggests that national economies are less integrated than many suspect. In particular, service sectors (two-thirds of most economies) are largely insulated from foreign competition. You cannot therefore assume that excess capacity in trading partners - or competition from the likes of China and Mexico - will prevent the US economy from overheating. Since monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, the prudent course is surely for the Fed to tighten policy quickly and then debate the existence of a 'new economic order'. Taking the medicine early also makes political sense. Mr Clinton would surely prefer a modest firming of rates this year to a monetary crunch while campaigning in 1996.</p>

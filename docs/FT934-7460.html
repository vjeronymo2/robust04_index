			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Wentworth quote at risk THE USM quote of Wentworth International could be cancelled following the result of its recent rights issue. The plastic packaging products group has received acceptances for 234.5m of the 380.5m new shares offered at 2 1/2 p on a 7-for-2 basis. However, the acceptances include some 233.2m shares (about 61.3 per cent) which Monceau Investments, an arm of Banque Indosuez, had irrevocably undertaken to apply for. Attempts will be made to sell the balance in the market at a premium to the rights issue price. The shares closed unchanged at 1 1/2 p. If no further buyers are secured by close of business today Monceau and Banque Indosuez will hold 91.15 per cent of the enlarged issued capital. Under Stock Exchange rules an insufficient proportion of the share capital will be in public hands and the company's USM quote will have to be cancelled. A further announcement will be made 'as soon as practicable'. Wentworth reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 4.05m) for the year to March 31.</p>

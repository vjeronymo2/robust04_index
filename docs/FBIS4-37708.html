			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Amir Taheri, Lutfi Shatarah, Hanan al-Badri, and </F> Sawsan Abu-Husayn: "Arab Inclination To Consider Yemeni War  Threat to Region's Stability"]    [Excerpts] London, Washington, Cairo, Sanaa, Aden, AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT -- Yesterday, diplomatic sources in Washington and  London told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the United States and Britain  have agreed to step up efforts to achieve an immediate  cease-fire in Aden after northern forces stepped up their  bombardment of the city in an indication -- so it seems -- that  Sanaa is preparing to launch an all-out offensive to storm the  city following the failure of the efforts made by the UN  secretary general's special envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, to secure a  cease-fire. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, the southern leadership is intensifying its  diplomatic moves to step up Arab and international political  pressure to force Sanaa to observe a cease-fire and enter  negotiations to secure a peaceful solution to the situation.  Southern Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas and Foreign  Minister 'Abdallah al-Asnaj headed for Washington yesterday to  hold talks with the U.S. Administration.    Al-Asnaj told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT during his stopover in  London  yesterday that he and al-'Attas will brief the U.S.  Administration on the latest developments and the total damage,  rocket shelling, and heavy artillery bombardment to which Aden  and Lahij are being subjected. He said they will urge the UN  Security Council to take further practical deterrent measures to  prevent further disasters.    He stressed that they will meet with the UN secretary  general  to discuss Brahimi's report and to reemphasize Aden's commitment  to implementing the stipulations of the Security Council  resolution without any reservations. [passage omitted]    In Aden, military reports have revealed that 5,000 "Jihad"  organization elements, among them foreigners belonging to the  so-called "Afghan Arabs" organization, have arrived in the  (northern) Red Sea port of al-Hudaydah. The reports stressed  that these elements have been moved to the frontlines of the  northern forces besieging Aden.</p>

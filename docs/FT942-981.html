			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Work training onus is urged on employees Tax-free savings accounts for individuals to fund their learning should be permitted in order to stimulate the development of new skills in the UK, a training and enterprise council report has recommended to the government. The vehicle for savings, which might be jointly funded with employers, could be on the line of an educational Tessa, to which parents, individuals and employers could contribute, says the report from a working group chaired by Mr Colin Harris, chairman of Surrey Tec and managing director of Legal and General Financial Services. The report, etitled Individuals' Commitment to Lifetime Learning, comes as both Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, and the Labour party are looking at ways in which individuals can be encouraged to take more control of their own learning. The government prefers voluntary incentives while Labour, which is developing its training policies, is examing whether it should be obligatory for employers to open an individual training account for employees requesting one. The report from the Tec working group, which has been submitted to Mr Hunt, concludes that individuals play only a minor role in managing their own learning and that without increased commitment from individuals the UK will not improve its skills levels sufficiently quickly to meet international competition. At present most learning is carried out within the formal educational system and is undertaken when people are below the age of 22. The report recommends: An awareness-raising campaign to highlight the importance of lifetime learning and the benefits it can bring in terms of job security, career opportunities and pay. Tax-free savings accounts for individuals. Better access for high quality information and advice. Educational providers to be more flexible in offering training which meets an individual's work and social needs.</p>

Rod Oswald said.  </P> <P> Oswald added that he has relayed the message to California officials, who told  him they would ensure Taylor's safety.  </P> <P> Taylor, 36, was arrested in May for allegedly trying to sell a large number of  loose diamonds at a Rapid City pawn shop.  </P> <P> He faces charges of robbery, kidnaping, rape, grand theft and escape. At the  time of the breakout from the recreation area of the men's jail in Santa Ana,  Taylor was being held in connection with the theft of more than $2 million in  jewels from Southern California stores over the last two years.  </P> <P> Two accomplices arrested with him in South Dakota have been sent to Iowa to  stand trial on charges of robbing a jewelry store there.  </P></p>

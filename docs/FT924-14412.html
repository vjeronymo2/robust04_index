			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Move to abolish May Day holiday THE May Day bank holiday might be abolished as early as 1995, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, announced yesterday. Mrs Shephard said the May Day holiday, celebrated by many countries as Labour Day, had been forced on Britain by the TUC. She told the conference: 'You have made your opposition to that Socialist holiday quite clear.' One possible replacement is an October holiday to commemorate the Battle of Trafalgar, but Mrs Shephard said her personal preference was for an extra day added to the late August bank holiday, which might be less disruptive to business than an isolated day. She promised to consult on the issue. Any change would not apply to Scotland, which has had a May Day holiday for longer than the rest of the UK. In her speech ending the employment debate, Mrs Shephard said that if an EC 48-hour working time directive were adopted, the government would challenge it in the European court of justice. 'Despite the improvements we have won, we remain fundamentally opposed in principle to this directive,' she said. She later hinted that wages councils might be abolished in the Industrial Relations Bill expected to go before parliament later this year.</p>

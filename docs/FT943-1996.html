			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Broker cuts cocoa production estimate Trading house ED &amp; F. Man has reduced its world cocoa production estimate for 1993-94 by 24,000 tonnes to 2.36m as the prolonged effect of low prices further reduces yields in Brazil, Malaysia and Ecuador, reports Reuters. Man said it was forecasting Brazilian production of 265,000 tonnes for 1993-94, compared to an estimated output of 294,000 tonnes in 1992-93. The forecasts for Malaysian output is now 205,000 tonnes, down from an estimated 224,000 tonnes in 1992-93. Ecuador is forecast to produce 80,000 tonnes in 1993-94. While crops in Brazil and Malaysia have fallen as sustained lower prices affect higher-cost producers, Indonesia remains the only origin where the trend is towards higher production, the report said. 'We have raised our estimate of 1993-94 (Indonesian) production to 250,000. Over the last five years production growth has averaged over 20 per cent per annum and there is no sign that the rate of growth is declining.' Cocoa arrivals up to the end of September from the Ivory Coast, the world's leading producer, were estimated at 900,000 tonnes, which included some 100,000 tonnes carried over from the 1992-93 mid-crop season, according to the report. Man said it put its estimate for the Ivory Coast's mid-crop at 155,000 tonnes, giving a total 1993-94 production of 800,000 tonnes.</p>

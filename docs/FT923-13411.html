			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / UK Company News: CU acquires control of Australian insurer COMMERCIAL UNION, the composite insurer, is stepping up its involvement in the Australasian market by paying Pounds 23m to increase its interest in National Commercial Union, Australia's third biggest non-life insurer. CU already owns 45.67 per cent of the company and will increase its stake to 71.35 per cent by acquiring over half the shares currently held by The National Mutual Life Association of Australasia. Mr Peter Foster, general manager finance, said that the price of ADollars 1.28 (50p) for 46.5m shares was attractive and marginally below net asset value. CU will finance the deal by issuing new shares. Although a number of other UK companies have recently reduced their involvement in Australasia, CU's timing was influenced by evidence that the insurance cycle is beginning to turn. The company has a long standing involvement in the region, forming a listed company, CU of Australia, in 1960 which in turn became NCU in 1982. NCU's net pre-tax profit in the 12 months to June 30 1991 amounted to ADollars 11.8m on net written premium income of ADollars 550m. Profits in the six months to December 31 amounted to ADollars 14.6m. Net assets amounted to ADollars 243m.</p>

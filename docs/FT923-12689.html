			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (4): Something for everyone - Increased government borrowing is a fillip for products that advisers don't always mention / Fixed interest 3: National Savings NATIONAL SAVINGS products are an obvious investment for those seeking a fixed return on their money. Since they are issued by the government, they are completely safe and they offer attractive rates of return. They tend to be ignored by financial advisers, because they do not pay commission, but application forms are easy to get hold of over the post office counter. Fixed rates are available on Certificates - the index-linked and 37th issue  -the Yearly Plan, Children's bonus bonds, Capital bonds, and the new First Option bond, launched on July 7. The First (Fixed Interest Rate Savings Tax-Paid) Option Bond carries a guaranteed interest rate of 7.75 per cent net (equivalent to 10.34 per cent gross) on a minimum of Pounds 1,000. Tax is deducted at source, and the bond is aimed at the country's 25.1m basic-rate taxpayers. A higher rate of 8.05 per cent net is payable on Pounds 20,000 and above. The rate is guaranteed for a year, but National Savings can announce a new rate of interest for new issues at any time. The bond is part of the government's strategy to raise Pounds 28bn for the public sector borrowing requirement. The suitability of the fixed rate products you choose depends on your tax status: Higher-rate taxpayer: National Savings certificates are the best choice, because they are free of income tax and capital gains tax. The 37th issue certificate offers a guaranteed return of 8 per cent per annum compound if held for five years. The minimum investment is Pounds 25 and the maximum Pounds 7,500, although an additional Pounds 10,000 can be invested from matured certificates of earlier issues. The return is the equivalent of 13.33 per cent to a 40 per cent payer and 10.67 per cent to a basic-rate taxpayer. The index-linked certificates pay 4.5 per cent per annum above the rate of inflation, measured by the Retail Prices Index. You can hold a maximum of Pounds 10,000, and returns are again tax-free. It is possible to hold both sets of certificates but those wishing to choose between the two have to make a decision on where they expect the inflation rate to be within the next five years. If you think it will be above 4 per cent per annum, then index-linked certificates are going to be the more attractive. The Yearly Plan is a scheme for saving once a month for a year, in order to buy a Savings Certificate at the end of that year. Savers pay a fixed amount (between Pounds 20 and Pounds 400) by monthly standing order. This means that the maximum value Savings Certificate that you can obtain through the Yearly Plan is Pounds 2,400. The certificate must be held for a further four years to earn the average current return of 8 per cent tax-free per annum. Since payments in the first year are staggered, the total return will be lower than if the investor had placed Pounds 2,400 in the 37th issue certificates at the outset. Savers can hold the Yearly Plan in addition to the certificates. Non-taxpayers: Capital Bonds also offer a guaranteed return if held for five years, but are subject to tax. Non-taxpayers will have the benefit of receiving interest gross, because the tax is not deducted on the interest payment. The present Series D offers a gross return of 10.75 per cent per annum, compound over five years. The bonds are sold in multiples of Pounds 100, to a maximum of Pounds 100,000. Basic rate taxpayers: This gap in the product range has been met by the new one-year First Option bond. The bond pays a fixed rate of interest (see above) net of basic rate tax on a minimum of Pounds 1,000, guaranteed for one year at a time, although investors can hold the bond for more than a year if they like the sound of the next annual fixed rate. Interest will be added annually. However, there are stiff penalties for early withdrawal. If the bond is cashed in before the first anniversary, no interest will be paid. Withdrawals between anniversaries will attract half interest for the period since the previous anniversary. If you do not cash in the bond, any revised rate will be paid automatically for a further year. The maximum holding is Pounds 250,000. Non-taxpayers can reclaim the tax that has been deducted ast source. Basic rate taxpayers who want a fixed rate over a five-year period will be marginally better off buying Capital Bonds than the 37th issue certificates, because even after deducting 25 per cent tax, the return will be 8.063 per cent per annum. Children: The issue B Children's Bonus Bond pays a tax-free and guaranteed return equal to 10.9 per cent per annum over its first five years. These can be bought in multiples of Pounds 25 to a maximium holding of Pounds 1,000. Adults will have to purchase the bond for children under the age of 16, and there are no more returns after the 21st birthday. Disadvantages: The main disadvantage with National Savings certificates and bonds is that they do not pay an income: all of the return comes from the increase in value on maturity. They are also inflexible - the returns cited are only achieved if you hold them for exactly five years. If you sell them beforehand, the returns are reduced; if you forget to redeem them on maturity, the certificates start to earn the unattractive general extension rate of 5.01 per cent.</p>

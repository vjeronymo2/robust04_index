			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris off 1.2 per cent following budget THERE was widespread disappointment in France to the government's budget proposals, detailed after the market closed on Monday, writes Our Markets Staff. As Mr Andrew Shepherd-Barron, analyst at Kleinwort Benson in London, commented, many of the plans had been in the market last week and factored into prices, leading to the market's underperformance over that period. James Capel suggested that 'this budget is going to send France deeper into recession in the short-term and provides little direct assistance to equities which will have to rely on further rate cuts if it is to move upwards.' Morgan Stanley, taking up this theme, noted that high and growing unemployment 'demands much lower real interest rates which the French, in defending the franc fort, have been unable to deliver. German monetary policy is therefore the key to the alleviation of this social tension'. PARIS shed 1.2 per cent in reaction to the budget which did not provide the hoped for stimulus to encourage equity investment by small investors. The CAC-40 index closed off 22.69 at 1,854.52 in turnover of some FFr3bn. Further evidence of disappointing first quarter sales came from Alcatel Alsthom and the shares eased FFr13 to FFr627. Eurotunnel closed off FFr1.70 or nearly 5 per cent at FFr33.30 as the opening of the rail link receded further. FRANKFURT firmed on technical trading as dealers bought back shares after the index failed to fall through the 1,600 level on Monday. The DAX index rose 7.12 to 1,616.15 in turnover of DM6.6bn. Volkswagen plunged DM6.60 to DM320.50 on further pessimism over the company's future performance. Veba, the utilities concern, rose DM5.30 to DM384 after a statement that the company expected satisfactory results in spite of the weakening economy. ZURICH drew strength from the firmer dollar and D-mark, which help export earners, and the SMI index rose 13.5 to 2,192.6, near to its all-time high. The market is seeing a return of foreign demand as well as funds being switched from interest-bearing investment into stocks. Mr S J Marshall Lockyer of Kleinwort Benson in London attributes the market's current strength to a return of investorsentiment towards pharmaceutical stocks. This followed the perception that Mrs Hillary Clinton's exploration of US healthcare reform was becoming more sympathetic to the pharmaceutical sector. Roche certificates which have been recent strong performers, added SFr20 in early trade before late profit-taking left them SFr10 easier at SFr4510. Insurers were back in demand: registered shares in Zurich Insurance rose SFr40 to SFr2,900 ahead of today's press conference at which a breakdown of 1992 figures will be presented. MILAN edged lower, with trading held back by today's expiry of monthly options contracts and Friday's end of the monthly account. The Comit index shed 1.0 to 531.62 in turnover well down from recent levels at an estimated L250bn. Fondiaria, the insurer, was an exception, rallying L1,437 or 4.7 per cent to L31,582 on speculation, confirmed late in the day, that it had finally sold its 20 per cent stake in AMB, its German partner. AMSTERDAM saw a strong performance from Elsevier, up Fl 1.80 at Fl 130.70, after the group announced further acquisitions in both Europe and the US. The CBS Tendency index lost 0.1 to 108.7. BRUSSELS edged up amid low volume, with activity led by trading in Delhaize which surged surged BFr38, or 3.3 per cent, to BFr1,196 on shortcovering by foreign investors and speculative buying by dealers. The Bel-20 index added 3.22 to 1,190.78 in turnover of BFr1.25bn. MADRID reversed recent weakness with a gain in the general index of 1.82 to 242.21 helped by strength in the banking and construction sectors. Turnover was high at Pta18bn, compared with an average Pta11bn last week. DUBLIN built on Monday's 1 per cent rise with a gain in the ISEQ index of 10.82 to 1,522.93, as some confidence returned following the completion of the Greencore placing. There was strength in financials with Irish Life and AIB both gaining 2 per cent while Fyffes rose 5.5 per cent on news of a joint venture with a Canary Island's group. OSLO advanced on a stronger dollar and lower money market rates. The All Share index rose 6.53 to 476.45 in turnover of NKr484m. Norsk Hydro rose NKr3 to NKr174.5. The strength in the dollar helped the shipping sector up 9 to 456.14, with Kvaerner up NKr4 to NKr196.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- May 11                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1141.38    1141.29    1140.93    1141.97 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1205.57    1205.90    1206.78    1206.21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1142.42    1141.60    1139.87    1140.44 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1206.45    1206.30    1205.43    1206.03  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        May 10     May 7     May 6     May 5     May 4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1142.74   1142.41   1152.03   1153.13   1148.16 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1203.54   1200.34   1205.10   1206.61   1207.82  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1142.89; 200 - 1208.50 Low/day: 100 - 1139.45 200 - 1203.39  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

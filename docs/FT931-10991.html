			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Poland set for showdown on size of budget deficit POLAND'S coalition government faces an important test of its budget policies as parliament continues to press for a larger deficit than the International Monetary Fund is willing to accept as the basis for a Dollars 660m (Pounds 437m) stand-by loan. The government of Ms Hanna Suchocka is trying to hold this year's deficit to 81,000bn zlotys (Pounds 3.3bn), 5 per cent of GDP, a vital step it Poland is to settle its financial affairs with western partners. Western commercial banks will not sign a restructuring agreement on Dollars 12.3bn of debt unless the IMF agreement is in place. A further 20 per cent reduction of western government debt worth Dollars 30.6bn is also predicated on agreement with Washington. The World Bank has said it will not free a Dollars 450m loan to help restructure domestic and bank and company debts until the IMF deal is agreed. Western governments are also waiting for the IMF before freeing their shares of an unspent Dollars 1bn fund set up in 1989 to support Poland's currency. On Wednesday, the government lost another pensions vote in parliament, thus raising spending this year by an extra 20,000bn zlotys to 30,000bn zlotys. This, taken with other votes in the past few weeks, threatens to push this year's deficit past 120,000bn zlotys. The government now plans to stake all on a final vote on February 12, when it will ask the 460-strong Sejm, parliament's more important chamber, to shelve its previous decisions and approve the budget with its original deficit figure of 5 per cent of GDP.</p>

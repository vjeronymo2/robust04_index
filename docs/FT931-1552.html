			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Superstores under threat: Warehouse clubs are immense sheds in which a limited range of items sell at bargain prices - Two cut-price US retailing concepts that could change British shopping are on their way IN THE US, they called them the 'silent enemy' because of the impact they had on traditional retailers. Warehouse clubs have been the fastest-growing format in US retailing in the past 10 years, with total sales reaching Dollars 27.9bn in 1991. Between 50 and 100 opened each year throughout the past decade. Now Costco, the third-largest US operator, is reported to have taken two sites in the UK with an unnamed competitor taking two more. Costco refuses to confirm reports that it has signed up sites at Trafford Park, Manchester, and Thurrock, Essex. But as managing director Mr Paul Moulton at Costco's newly opened UK office says: 'We are definitely coming here, and we hope to open a number of locations.' The unidentified American competitor is said to have taken space in Wednesbury in the west Midlands, and on the Valley Park development in Croydon, south London. In a report last year, retail analysts at Goldman Sachs suggested warehouse clubs could 'turn the retail scene upside-down', with scope for 30 in the UK within 10 years, making annual sales of Pounds 2bn. But Mr Alan Treadgold, of the retail unit of Coopers &amp; Lybrand's, the accountancy firm, believes it is not grocery retail chains which need worry, but wholesalers and cash-and-carry operators such as Nurdin &amp; Peacock, Makro and Booker. 'It's the middlemen who look most vulnerable,' he says. 'In the US, 60 per cent of warehouse club customers are small businesses.' US warehouse stores are about three times the size of a typical UK Sainsbury or Tesco superstore at 100,000 to 140,000 square feet - and sell a limited range of 3,500 to 4,000 lines (against about 15,000 in a typical Sainsbury or Tesco) at bargain prices in no-frills surroundings. Gross margins are pared to the bone - 10 per cent compared with the 25 per cent typically enjoyed by US supermarkets. They make money by shifting huge volumes of goods, and charge an annual membership fee of Dollars 25 to Dollars 30 (Pounds 17.60 to Pounds 21.10). Their culture is the opposite of that of many UK retailers which make money by 'adding value', trying to achieve the widest possible gap between their selling prices and selling costs. 'When these two cultures clash - as they are about to do - it will be very, very interesting to see which one wins out,' says Mr Treadgold. There are two types of club. Price Club, the second-biggest US operator with sales of Dollars 6.6bn in 1991, and Costco, third with Dollars 5.6bn, officially sell only wholesale. Sam's, the biggest with Dollars 9.5bn, and Pace (Dollars 4.3bn), are operated by US retail giants Wal-Mart and K mart respectively, and are open to individual shoppers. Some retail experts question whether warehouse clubs in the UK will be able to keep costs low enough and volumes high enough to secure adequate rates of return. Cash-and-carry operators say they will not be able to operate more efficiently than the UK's existing wholesalers. Mr Richard Hyman, director of Verdict, the retail market research group, says land costs can be five or six times those in the US. He wonders whether UK customers will be as willing as their US counterparts to travel long distances to do their shopping, sometimes in unattractive locations such as industrial estates, or even to buy and store goods in such large quantities. Such doubts are not deterring UK operators from looking at the warehouse club format. Nurdin &amp; Peacock is widely expected to open warehouse clubs, and is rumoured to be seeking to change planning consents on some of its existing 46 outlets to allow them to act more like clubs.</p>

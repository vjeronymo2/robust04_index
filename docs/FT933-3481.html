			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Local authorities granted easing of tendering rules LOCAL AUTHORITIES will be exempt from the government's new regulations on compulsory competitive tendering for white-collar services if they have already conducted a market test, the government said yesterday. This relaxation of the tendering rules, announced by the local government minister, Mr David Curry, was welcomed by local authorities. The Association of County Councils said that many councils had already opened their professional services to competition without the need for the government to make such moves compulsory. The Association of District Councils also welcomed the move, but called on the government to announce the full compulsory rules for white-collar tendering as soon as possible. It said that otherwise there was a risk that councils could go to great expense on market testing exercises, and then have to repeat them when new regulations were announced. Under the concessions announced by Mr Curry, councils will be exempt from compulsory tendering of work for up to five years if contracts for the work have been awarded after they had attracted at least three tenders from external contractors, as well as from the council's direct service organisations. Authorities that have failed to meet this criterion but believe their contracts have been adequately tested against the market are able to apply to the Department of the Environment for the exemption. Councils needed to have attracted the three tenders by yesterday to qualify for the exemption. Councils which have not yet done so will be required to go through the formal tendering process already outlined in existing legislation.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TANGLED NORTH CASE  </P> <P> A criminal trial is supposed to be a search for the truth, an opportunity for  12 jurors -- surrogates for the rest of the citizenry -- to weigh the evidence  against the accused and decide whether to believe him or his accusers.  Unfortunately, in the case of the United States of America vs. Oliver L. North,  the process of getting at the truth has been thwarted forever by the  independent counsel's decision to drop the two major charges against him.  Although North still stands accused of a dozen lesser crimes that could land  him in jail for up to 60 years, much of the evidence that has been compiled  about his reckless campaign to fund the Nicaraguan Contras with the profits  from the sale of U.S. arms to Iran will never be aired. And that can only  frustrate everyone who genuinely cares about the truth.  </P> <P> Inevitably, conspiracies will be seen in independent counsel Lawrence E.  Walsh's motion to dismiss the charges of conspiracy and theft of government  property because, he said, they could not be tried without compromising  national security. Dropping those counts amounts to "a pocket pardon," an  attempt to do indirectly what President Reagan could not do directly, charged  the People for the American Way. Because Walsh's motion came within days of  North's move to subpoena Reagan and President-elect George Bush as defense  witnesses, there is speculation that they blocked the disclosure of classified  documents to avoid long days on the witness stand or a protracted fight over  executive privilege or both. And some critics have accused the intelligence  agencies of thwarting the investigation to cover up telephone intercepts,  bribes and other operations that they might have trouble justifying.  </P> <P> And yet, however intriguing the conspiracy theories, there is scant evidence to  support any of them. The initial refusal to release classified documents on the  terms established by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell came not from the  White House but from an interagency group of intelligence experts, some of whom  have been openly critical of North. Gesell had ruled that those documents could  be partly sanitized to protect some intelligence sources and covert operations,  but he was adamant that, for North to receive a fair trial, the government  should identify the countries with which he dealt and specify the ranks and  responsibilities of foreign officials mentioned in the documents. And the  interagency panel was just as adamant that such matters could not be made  public without jeopardizing U.S. interests abroad. Independent counsel Walsh,  very much the man in the middle of this tug-of-war between the Administration  and Judge Gesell, struggled for months to find a compromise. An upright former  judge and president of the American Bar Assn., Walsh very much wanted to try  North on all the charges but finally conceded defeat. The motion that he filed  to dismiss the two major counts was tinged with regret.  </P> <P> Should Gesell have given in to the demands of the interagency group and fully  censored the documents? Were the intelligence experts overly protective and too  quick to see potential harm to the national interest in the documents sought by  the prosecution and the defense? Has the Reagan Administration twisted the  Classified Information Procedures Act to protect North, one of its own? Or was  the government tied up in knots by North's ingenious defense lawyer, Brendan V.  Sullivan Jr., who knew that basing a defense on top-secret documents was the  surest way to torpedo the prosecution?  </P> <P> It is easier to pose those questions than to answer them. Because the cloak of  national security envelops this case, the public may never get satisfactory  answers. And, while North will stand trial on felony charges of obstructing  justice, destroying evidence and lying to Congress, Americans will be denied  the full story of his involvement in the Iran-Contra episode. His guilt or  innocence, like that of former President Richard M. Nixon in the Watergate  scandal, will be one of those matters debated for years to come, without any  real resolution. Being denied the truth is frustrating, but that is the price  to be paid for a system of justice that mandates due process for all criminal  defendants, even the most notorious.  </P></p>

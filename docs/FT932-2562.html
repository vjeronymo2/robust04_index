			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Possible routes for new motorway submitted THREE possible routes were put forward yesterday by the Welsh Office for a 14-mile motorway to relieve traffic congestion on the M4 around Newport, south Wales. All three routes would run from the tolls of the second River Severn crossing and cross the river Usk, south of Newport, to link with the M4 at Castleton, east of Cardiff. Construction of the motorway is not expected to start before the turn of the century. The options have been drawn up by Ove Arup, consulting engineers, and will go to public consultation. They all cross the low-lying Gwent Levels, which include sites of special scientific interest. There is likely to be opposition from environmental groups but Sir Wyn Roberts, Welsh Office minister, said the road would add to the significant benefits that the M4 corridor had brought to south Wales. No decision had been taken on how the motorway would be financed, he said.</p>

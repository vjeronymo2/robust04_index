			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Burton paper backed by deal to sell property portfolio BURTON Group, the UK retailer, yesterday raised Pounds 60m (Dollars 108m) from a bond issue backed by an agreement to sell its remaining property portfolio to institutional investors. The deal provides Burton with cash to repay bank borrowings and a guaranteed exit from the UK property market after five years. The five-year zero-coupon bonds, issued by Redcastle, a group subsidiary, have a redemption value of Pounds 100m but were sold to investors at 60.98 per cent of face value. The funds to redeem the paper will come from the sale of Burton's property portfolio, comprising six retail and office developments. Scottish Amicable and CIN Properties, the property arm of the British Coal pension funds, have agreed to buy the properties for Pounds 100m in 1997 if there is no sale before this date. The institutions received a fee for 'underwriting' the sale of the properties at this level. After legal and underwriting expenses and the fees paid to the two institutions, the issue provides Burton with fixed-rate sterling funding at a cost of around 10.8 per cent. Mr Richard North, Burton finance director, said the proceeds of the issue would be used to repay bank debt. Burton did not replace a Pounds 250m multi-option syndicated loan facility which matured last month, relying instead on bi-lateral bank facilities. In August, the group must pay Pounds 150m to holders of convertible bonds, which carry an investor put option at a premium to face value. The proceeds of yesterday's issue will free bank credit lines to meet the repayment. 'The deal improves our funding mix and extends the maturity of our debt. The zero coupon structure also offers us a considerable cash-flow advantage,' said Mr North. The credit quality of the issue hangs on the strength of the agreement with Scottish Amicable and CIN Properties to buy the six properties. Mr North said the company had spent months structuring the deal with lawyers to ensure the undertaking was unconditional. Warburg Securities, which placed most of the bonds with UK institutional investors, priced the paper to yield around 90 basis points more than UK government bonds of similar maturity. There are no comparable issues outstanding. However, the yield spread is close to the level at which building society bonds trade in the secondary market. The properties were valued in Burton's last accounts at Pounds 100m. Mr North said the company would make no accounting adjustment until properties were actually sold. Elsewhere, the mainstream international bond market remained subdued. Depressed conditions in most European bond markets and an auction of Treasury stock in the US kept potential borrowers on the sidelines. Council of Europe issued Dollars 80m floating-rate paper under its medium-term note programme. Following the recent trend, the issue was fully underwritten by the dealers to the programme, lead-managed by Lehman Brothers. The two-year paper pays the three-month London interbank offered rate, subject to an upper limit of 5 1/4 per cent for the first year and 6 1/2 per cent in the second year. North of England Building Society yesterday became the smallest UK mutual savings institution to raise core capital with an issue of permanent interest bearing shares (Pibs). The 21st-largest building society by assets, it placed Pounds 20m undated shares with UK institutional investors at a yield spread of 350 basis points over long-dated gilt-edged securities. The placing was arranged and underwritten by Charterhouse.</p>

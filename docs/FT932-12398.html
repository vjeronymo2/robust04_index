			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers prepares to boost diamond supplies DE BEERS, the South African group that controls about 80 per cent of the world diamond market, yesterday responded to an improvement in the world diamond market by increasing the amount it will buy from producers. Last autumn the group, which organises the market through the London-based Central Selling Organisation, told producers to cut agreed deliveries by 25 per cent as it struggled to bring supply and demand back into balance. Last year its sales fell by 13 per cent from 1991 levels to Dollars 3.147bn - a five-year low. In February this year, however, De Beers was able to increase its prices by an average of 1.5 per cent - the first rise for nearly three years. Yesterday the group said that 'in line with the changing relationship between anticipated CSO sales for 1993 and potential supply, the 75 per cent quota entitlement will be increased to 80 per cent with effect from May 1'. Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, the group's chairman, said that while the increase was not large, it showed the market was better than when the quota was imposed last August. He said the first three 'sights', as its sales are known, were 'very good'. The next is due next week. The improved market is put down to reduced smuggling from Angola because of the rainy season and the resumption of the civil war; slow sales from Russia, particularly before it lifted the 20 per cent export duty; and buoyant demand from India, which had increased sales to the US. Retail signals were mixed, said Mr Ogilvie Thompson, but it was encouraging that diamond jewellery sales had held up despite the recession.</p>

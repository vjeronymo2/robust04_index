			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> g. Administrative Amendments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters disagreed that Oregon's regulation authorizing administrative permit amendments, OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2230(1)(j), would allow the administrative amendment process to be used to change the content of a permit. These commenters asserted that this regulation would only allow the correction of minor misinterpretations of an applicable requirement, which they felt was appropriate. EPA objected to OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2230(1)(j) because, although the regulation could be used appropriately as the commenter suggested, the plain language of the rule would also allow the permitting authority to add or delete an applicable requirement from the title V permit without public participation if it determined the change was due to a ``minor misinterpretation of an applicable requirement.'' EPA maintains this position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to EPA's concerns, however, Oregon repealed OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2230(1)(j) on October 21, 1994. Thus, that provision is no longer effective as a matter of State law and is not before EPA for consideration at this time. Rather, OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2230, as amended by Oregon on October 21, 1994, and submitted to EPA on November 15, 1994, is currently before EPA for consideration and is fully approvable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> h. Variance Provision.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters objected to EPA's discussion of the Oregon variance provisions, ORS 468A.075 and LRAPA Title 23, section 23&hyph;005. In the September 14, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice, EPA proposed to take no action on these variance provisions because EPA believed they were external to Oregon's title V program. EPA also stated, however, that a variance granted by a permitting authority cannot modify a source's obligations under a title V permit, even if the State variance provision or the source-specific variance itself has been approved into the State SIP, unless the variance is incorporated into the permit through appropriate permit revision procedures. See 59 FR 47106. The commenters argued that part 70 clearly recognizes that sources may not be in compliance with all provisions of a title V permit and that State variance provisions, such as Oregon's, are consistent with part 70, in particular, 40 CFR 70.5(c)(8)(iii) and 70.6(c)(3). The commenters further objected to any implication that a variance granted by the State does not have any effect on a source's compliance requirements or the extent to which a source can be subject to enforcement action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA agrees with the commenters that part 70 recognizes that some title V sources will not be in compliance with all terms of their title V permits. Section 70.5(c)(8)(iii)(C) requires that a source that will not be in compliance with all applicable requirements at the time of permit issuance must submit a schedule of compliance and section 70.6(c)(3) requires the permitting authority to include such a compliance schedule in the source's title V permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA disagrees, however, with the commenters' implicit assumption that a compliance schedule is the same mechanism and has the same effect as a variance. As the commenters recognize, a compliance schedule included in a title V permit does not sanction noncompliance with the underlying applicable requirement. See 40 CFR 70.5(c)(8)(C). A variance properly granted under a State variance provision, and approved by EPA as a revision to the SIP, however, changes the underlying applicable requirement of the SIP. Because title V requires that all applicable requirements be incorporated into a source's title V permit, any change to an applicable requirement, such as EPA approval of a variance as a SIP revision, must also be incorporated into the source's title V permit through appropriate permit revision procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the commenters' concerns are premature at this time. As the commenters acknowledge, EPA is not taking any action on Oregon's variance provisions in this final action on Oregon's title V program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Small Business Assistance Program Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA proposed that, as a condition of obtaining full approval, Oregon must ensure that no source subject to title V will be immune from inspections or enforcement actions resulting from technical assistance visits conducted under ORS 468A.330(4)(a). See 59 FR 47107&hyph;47108. That provision states that ``Onsite technical assistance for the development and implementation of the Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program shall not result in inspections or enforcement actions.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

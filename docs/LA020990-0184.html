			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> CZECHS, ISRAEL RENEW OLD TIES  </P> <P> Israel and Czechoslovakia today renewed diplomatic relations, rectifying what  Prague's foreign minister called the "nonsense" of rupturing ties in 1967.  </P> <P> "Today, we have taken the first step (toward) very good and very friendly  relations," Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said after signing the  agreement with his Czechoslovak counterpart, Jiri Dienstbier.  </P> <P> Dienstbier and Arens voiced hope that the resumption of ties would lead to  trade and increased cooperation between Israel and Czechoslovakia, which was  one of Israel's strongest supporters when it was founded in 1948.  </P> <P> Arens paid tribute to Prague's supplies of weapons and training of air force  pilots then, noting that "Czechoslovakia was one of the few nations that lent  important assistance to Israel in its hour of need during the war of  independence in 1948."  </P></p>

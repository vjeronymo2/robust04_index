			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EASTWOOD TALKS HIS WAY INTO CHANGE OF PACE ROLE  </P> <P> The usually taciturn Clint Eastwood's acting career takes a new turn in "White  Hunter, Black Heart," which received its world premiere in Cannes today.  </P> <P> Eastwood sprang to fame as the near-silent hero of "spaghetti" westerns and  pared his script down to little more than a husky "Make my day" as detective  Dirty Harry.  </P> <P> But he waxes positively wordy in his role as devil-may-care director John  Wilson, a closely modeled portrait of the legendary John Huston.  </P> <P> "You can't do this kind of film without being wordy," Eastwood said.  "Certainly, it's different to anything else I've played before, though I've  played a wide variety of roles in the past."  </P> <P> Eastwood, who has been coming to Cannes for the last three years, acts and  directs in this production. The film is based on a story by screenwriter Peter  Viertel, who went to Africa with Huston in the 1950s to shoot the star-studded  classic "The African Queen."  </P> <P> But Viertel soon discovered Huston was obsessed with quite another kind of  shooting -- of an African elephant -- a fixation which led Huston virtually to  abandon his staff and come close to wrecking the entire project.  </P> <P> "I think this film has a big message about responsibility," said Eastwood. "The  character at the end becomes a tragic figure because he has allowed his  obsession to kill someone he respected and has lost a bit of himself in the  process."  </P> <P> Eastwood depicts Wilson as "a violent man given to violent action" -- cruel to  those he loves, sarcastic, unpredictable, but redeemed by his rejection of  racism, defense of the underdog and determination to value art over box-office  receipts.  </P> <P> "To write a movie you must forget that anyone's ever going to see it," says the  Wilson character when he is reproached for choosing an ending the public will  not like.  </P> <P> "White Hunter, Black Heart," is regarded as a strong entry among the 19 works  competing for the palm at the 43rd Cannes film festival. The 60-year-old  director's performance is also being tipped for a possible Best Actor award.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SITTING OUT 'DANCE'  </P> <P> What a disappointment! When I read Kirk Douglas' autobiography, "Ragman's Son,"  I was enormously impressed with this fine actor's ability as a writer.  </P> <P> I looked forward to reading his recent book and first novel, "Dance With the  Devil" (July 22). I should have saved my time and money.  </P> <P> Recently, in a late-night TV interview, possibly defending his novel, Douglas  said, "Well, you know there is more to my book than just raw sex."  </P> <P> Not much, Mr. Douglas, not much.  </P> <P> MERYL MEYERS  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES  </P></p>

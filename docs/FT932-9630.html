			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Scargill to visit Timex picket line MR ARTHUR Scargill, the president of the National Union of Mineworkers, plans to visit the picket line outside the Timex factory in Dundee on Monday to show his solidarity with workers who have been on strike there for the past three months, Robert Taylor writes. But his plan will be criticised tomorrow by Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU engineering union. He regards it as an unwelcome interference in a difficult and lawful dispute that does not involve any of Mr Scargill's members and one which will do nothing to produce a settlement. Some members of the local Timex strike committee are also known to be unhappy about Mr Scargill's inten-tion. Mr Jordan will visit the Timex picket line tomorrow for the first time. Throughout the dispute, which started in February when Timex sacked all its manual workers for refusing to accept reduced terms and conditions as well as a pay cut, the AEEU has sought successfully to stay strictly within the law. Mr Gavin Laird, the union's general secretary, warned strikers individually that they could be dismissed from union membership if they behaved unlawfully.</p>

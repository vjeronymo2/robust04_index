			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Growth at Bankers Investment Trust The Bankers Investment Trust saw its net asset value increase by nearly 15 per cent in the six months ended April 30 1993. That compared favourably with the principal indices in the UK, US and Europe. The value per share was 153.5p against 133.6p at the trust's year-end in October and 131.8p a year earlier. Its strategy during the six months has been to remain fully invested with increased emphasis on the UK, Far East and Japan. At April 30 the UK accounted for 52.7 per cent of the portfolio, the rest of Europe 11.5 per cent and the US 20.7 per cent. Total revenue came to Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 5.42m) and earnings per share rose 9.9 per cent to 1.88p (1.71p). A similar rate of growth was expected in the second half. The year's earnings will comfortably exceed the minimum forecast total dividend of 3.6p. A second interim of 0.9p (0.86p) is declared.</p>

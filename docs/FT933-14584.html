			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Schlesinger says ERM tensions are 'short term' THE tension within the European exchange rate mechanism is of a 'very short-term nature', according to Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank. Attempting to play down pressure on the French franc, he said in Basle that the ERM was more stable than at the time of disruptions last September and December. Mr Schlesinger claimed the Bundesbank's intervention in support of the French currency showed co-operation between the two countries' central banks was 'as close as ever'. However, co-operation is unlikely to extend as far as assistance through further reductions in Germany's leading interest rates at tomorrow's meeting of the Bundesbank council. On July 1, the Bundesbank cut the internationally important discount rate by half a point to 6.75 per cent and the lombard rate by a quarter-point to 8.25 per cent. A further move, following so soon after the Group of Seven meeting in Tokyo and this week's squeeze on the franc, could damage the bank's prized credibility by giving the impression that its policy can be swayed by political pressure and 'short-term' exchange rate fluctuations. Germany's latest inflation and money supply figures, the key to the bank's rates policy, have been revised upwards since the last rate cuts, suggesting little room for manoeuvre at present. Inflation in June was 4.2 per cent a year, compared with 4.4 per cent in January, while the growth in the M3 money supply measure was 6.9 per cent a year, compared with the bank's target of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent. While M3 expansion is expected to have fallen closer to the upper limit in June, the Bundesbank's latest bout of franc-buying could push it up again, according to Mr Gerhard Grebe, chief economist at the Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt. The condition of the franc and the state of the German economy demanded urgent supportive action support, he said yesterday. Even so, he expected no immediate cuts, favouring July 29 - the bank council's last meeting before the summer break - as the most likely and beneficial time.</p>

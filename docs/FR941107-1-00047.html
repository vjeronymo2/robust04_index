			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Third, the rule has come to be viewed as a mechanism for strengthening independent stations, with the result of increasing the strength and number of the primary buyers of independently produced programming. The argument is that, with this increase, not only are the number of independent program producers increasing, but the opportunity for new networks to emerge and compete with the existing networks is enhanced (by the presence of a healthy pool of independent stations). Thus, by strengthening independent stations overall, the rule has been considered to further both diversity and competition goals. Moreover, the independent stations themselves produce some degree of original programming, which contributes to the overall levels of diverse programming available in the market. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notice  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> thus invites comment on whether, given the current level of program diversity, the competitive alteration that PTAR causes with respect to a segment of the market is warranted. Similarly, the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notice <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  asks commenters to address the degree to which, from economic and public interest perspectives, PTAR leads to misallocated resources, limits viewers' programming choices, and alters the optimal prices paid. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notice <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  seeks comment on its analysis of this issue in general, and in particular raises questions such as: (1) whether regulatory measures designed to encourage the introduction into the broadcast industry of increased competition in the form of new networks remain necessary when the established networks and their affiliates are also competing against nonbroadcast video services; and (2) whether any inefficiencies of encouraging entry of new networks by placing limits on incumbents are outweighed by real benefits, and if so, what types and what number of inefficiencies and benefits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. In addition to seeking comment on the above-described ways in which PTAR alters the competitive opportunities in the relevant markets, the Commission framed certain overarching issues going to the public interest basis for PTAR, including, but not limited to, whether non-broadcast media should be considered in assessing the rule, whether PTAR is the appropriate mechanism to ensure diversity for those who do not avail themselves of technological alternatives to broadcast television, and whether other regulatory responses other than PTAR would be more effective or efficient to achieve the stated goals of the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. To the extent that the record to be developed might support retaining PTAR in whole or part, the Commission seeks public comment on the incidental elements of the rule_the definition of a ``network'' for purposes of the rule, and the various program categories that are exempted from application of PTAR. Moreover, although the policy examinations to be undertaken in this proceeding may make it unnecessary to address specific constitutional questions raised by the rule, if the rule is to be retained in some form, the Commission seeks comment on various constitutional implications of the rule and any proposed alternatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The Commission seeks comment on these issues, as well as specific economic analysis and supporting data favoring either retention, modification or repeal of the rule. If the Commission chooses to modify or eliminate the rule, we must then determine when to do so and whether to adopt transition measures. A modification to the rule might be appropriately enacted immediately after such a decision is made, or through a timetable that allows industry participants to adjust to the changing economic conditions that might result from modifications to PTAR. Elimination of the rule might be tied to technological developments or the timing might be tied to regulatory developments such as the scheduled expiration of the fyn/syn rules of some time thereafter. Similarly, a transition mechanism could be based on a variety of different considerations, focusing on defining the stages of that transition if one is adopted. For example, one possible transition would entail initial repeal of the off-network restriction followed by later repeal of the remainder of the rule. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notice <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  questions whether such a staggered repeal of the rule would further the public interest by reducing marketplace disruption or would delay the realization of benefits that could otherwise be realized from immediate form. In summary, should the record support elimination or modification of the rule, the Commission will require a record regarding the timing of any action and whether specific transition measures are necessary or appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

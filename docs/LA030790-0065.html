			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES POLL;  </P> <P> TEMPORARY HALT IN MEDFLY SPRAYING IS WIDELY BACKED  </P> <P> Most Californians think the Deukmejian Administration should temporarily halt  the aerial spraying of malathion until more studies can be conducted into  possible health hazards of the pesticide, according to the Los Angeles Times  Poll.  </P> <P> During the moratorium, citizens think, the state should use "safer methods" of  trying to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly -- presumably by releasing  larger numbers of sterile Medflies.  </P> <P> The Times poll represented the first statewide measure of public opinion about  malathion spraying in Los Angeles and Orange counties. Telephone interviews  were conducted with 2,058 California adults from Feb. 24 to March 1. The margin  of error was three percentage points in either direction.  </P> <P> Asked whether they thought there should be a temporary halt to the Medfly  spraying or if it should be continued, 57% of those interviewed favored a halt  -- and 36% said they felt "strongly" about their view. Only 35% believed the  spraying should continue. The remaining 8% were not sure.  </P> <P> Even in the Central Valley -- which as the state's biggest producer of crops  stands to lose the most from a widespread Medfly infestation -- the majority of  people favored a moratorium. Every region of California, in fact, supported a  moratorium. Los Angeles County was the most adamant, with 62% demanding a halt  to the spraying.  </P> <P> Across the state, a spraying moratorium was supported particularly by political  liberals, younger people, blacks and Latinos. But business executives were less  opposed to spraying than the average. And Republicans generally tended to be  more sympathetic toward the spraying.  </P></p>

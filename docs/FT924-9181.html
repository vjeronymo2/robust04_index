			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Advance at Quebecor QUEBECOR, the holding company for the Peladeau family's publishing, printing and forest products empire, unveiled third-quarter profit of CDollars 16.1m (Dollars 12.9m) or 27 cents a share, up from CDollars 6.1m or 13 cents a year earlier. Revenues rose 8.8 per cent to CDollars 623m. Nine-month earnings were CDollars 85.3m, or CDollars 1.42, up from CDollars 17.2m, or 36 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 1.8bn, up 5.5 per cent. The period included a CDollars 48.5m special gain equal to 81 cents a share. Quebecor's printing arm continues in an expansion phase, planning takeovers in Europe and possibly another acquisition in the US. The latter, if successful, would bring Quebecor Printing within sight of becoming North America's biggest commercial printer. Repap Enterprises, one of North America's top four coated paper producers, suffered a net loss of CDollars 34.5m (Dollars 27.8m) or 41 cents a share in the third quarter, against a loss of CDollars 41.9m or 81 cents a year earlier.</p>

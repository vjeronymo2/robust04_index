			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / International Company News: MIM and Musto sign deal to develop mine MIM, the Queensland-based mining company, has signed a definitive joint-venture agreement with International Musto Exploration of Vancouver to develop the rich Bajo de la Alumbrera deposit in Argentina. The agreement is a setback to Metall Mining, the international mining arm of Germany's Metallgesellschaft, which announced a CDollars 332m (USDollars 251m) hostile takeover bid for Musto last week in the hope of gaining control of the Alumbrera property. Metall was due to launch a tender offer for Musto shares on Friday, but the company said it was weighing its options. One condition of the Metall offer was that Musto should not dispose of any large part of Alumbrera. Metall said the agreement with MIM appeared to make Musto less attractive as a takeover target. Alumbrera is reputed to be one of the world's richest unexploited copper and gold ore areas. The cost of developing a mine has been put at USDollars 600m. MIM - which would be the operator of the mine - said it had raised the Alumbrera's projected output to 70,000 tonnes a day from 60,000 tonnes a day.</p>

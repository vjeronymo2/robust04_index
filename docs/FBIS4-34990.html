			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa -- Admitting the existence of "serious"  flaws in the foreign exchange system -- flaws which have led to  speculation -- the Central Bank of Honduras [BCH] Board of  Directors yesterday decided to implement reforms and hold an  auction of U.S. dollars, which will be overseen by the BCH,  according to BCH Chairman Hugo Noe Pino.    To implement the reforms, the BCH Board of Directors has  issued a document entitled "Regulation for the Public Exchange  of Foreign Currency." According to the document, beginning  today all exchange brokers must turn over their foreign  currencies to the BCH, which will buy them at referenced market  rates. This provision excludes dollars in on-demand savings  accounts.    Pino said 60 percent of the dollars acquired so far by the  BCH will be auctioned off, beginning on 23 June. He also said  that, before each auction, the general public will be informed  on the amount and base price of the currency. To guarantee  honesty, the auction will be handled by a commission comprising  one delegate each from the BCH, the Association of Honduran  Banks (AHIBA), savings and loan associations, and exchange  brokers, as well as two delegates from independent auditing  firms and one notary public.    Pino reported that natural or legal individuals can directly  or indirectly submit bids to buy currency, adding that the bids  must fall within a range of a minimum of $2,000 to a maximum of  $200,000.    The daily base buying price will be the average of the  prices  bid the previous day. To open this process, the BCH Board of  Directors has established a balanced average of 8.60 lempiras to  the dollar. This base price will be modified when the referenced  exchange rates consistently drop or go higher. The adjustment  will be effected whenever the current price consistently changes  over 15 consecutive auctions.    Pino pointed out that the bids cannot be higher or lower  than  the base price by more than 1 percent. Once bids have been  received, they will be arranged in descending order and the  amount of currency available will be assigned to the highest  bidders.    To give low bidders a chance to buy currency, banks and  savings and loans can bid for a daily maximum of $25,000, while  exchange brokers will have a daily maximum of $10,000.    In conclusion, Pino said currency will not be assigned to  natural or legal individuals more than once during the same  auction.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The interim president of the Republic today held  a meeting with officers of Bujumbura garrison. The meeting,  which was attended by Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko and  National Defense Minister Lieutenant Colonel Gedeon Fyiroko, was  on security and the Armed Forces' attitude during the current  crisis in Burundi. Marie-Josee Niyonzima reports:    [Niyonzima] These are the points on which the interim  president of the Republic's message focused on during the  meeting with Bujumbura garrison officers: a neutral army, a  loyal army, an army which guarantees citizens' freedom, the  creation of an army and a national gendarmerie which reassures  all the communities in the society.    It was his first contact since the death of President  Cyprien  Ntaryamira over a month ago. [passage omitted]    Regarding the disarming of armed groups in the country, Mr.  Sylvestre Ntibantunganya once again issued directives.    [Begin Ntibantunganya recording] Regarding the armed groups  who are an obstacle to security in the country, the government  cannot accept the emergence of secret armed groups inside the  country. The government urges the national Armed Forces to  combat them and asks them to adhere to discipline and loyalty  towards the government's decision on disarmament. We, however,  remind the Armed Forces that in this operation they must  scrupulously respect the directives of the commander in chief of  the Armed Forces which are as follows:    First, the disarmament operation must be carefully prepared  to prevent any problems. It must be conducted in close  cooperation with the local administrative authorities to avoid  any human or material damage. [passage indistinct] Fourth and  last, we must keep in mind that disarmament is not an end in  itself, but rather a precondition for peace and security to be  undertaken through a plan as yet undefined and a study of how to  tackle the following essential issue (?often used) as alibis for  certain actions: opening up and extending the armed forces to  all the ethnic components of our country.

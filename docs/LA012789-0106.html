			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Tom Wesselmann is long known for Pop-style comic-book nudes that function as  takeoffs on our culture's obsession with sex and violence. His constructions  used clocks, air conditioners and photomontaged cityscapes to evoke the same  sarcastic urban flavor.  </P> <P> Well, time has mellowed Wesselmann. Unlike the '60s and '70s, it's OK to be a  lyrical draftsman today, and Wesselmann shows he's just that, in wall-hung,  contour drawings cut out of very thin sheets of metal. Negative space is  completely cut away so that the bare white wall functions almost like a drawing  ground.  </P> <P> "Vivienne," a big female face with bee-stung lips and bull's eye breasts, is  closest to the Wesselmann we know. The laser-cut pieces are more atypical. A  computer directs a laser to cut steel according to Wesselmann's free-hand  drawings, recording every wisp of the brush and sleight of the hand. Clusters  of flowers in vases, fruit bowls, an impish remake of a Mondrian grid, and, of  course, Wesselmann's bevy of ripe odalisques are formed from the lacy, brightly  painted metal. Though some will find the textbook Wesselmann dated and the new  one a little too civilized, works have the spontaneous, schooled charm of life  drawings scrawled on a wall.

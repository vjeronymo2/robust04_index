			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Engineering plant agrees hours deal BRUSH Electrical's plant at Loughborough, Leicestershire, was removed yesterday from a list of engineering factories still threatened with industrial action over working hours, writes Michael Smith. The plant's 1,000 manual workers voted for a deal which will lead to the immediate introduction of a 37-hour week. The first phase of the AEU union's shorter-hours campaign ended officially earlier this month but the union said a further 12 companies might face strikes. Threatened plants include Hotpoint in Peterborough and NEI Victor and AP Appledore on Tyneside.</p>

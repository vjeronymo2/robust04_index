			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: HIGH STYLE;  </P> <P> THE GOOD OFFICE  </P> <P> WITH MORE THAN 100 million Americans now spending most of their waking hours in  offices, the workplace is emerging as the new frontier of contemporary design.  But what is good office design? From pencil holders to computers, it means  products that blend aesthetic appeal with functional efficiency, products that  take advantage of solar power, ergonomics and the constraints of time and  space.  </P> <P> Pasadena's Art Center College of Design presents "Good Offices," some 150  examples of the best-designed office equipment and products in the world --  from such old chestnuts as the IBM Personal Computer Model 30 and the "NeXT" to  the high-tech Canon Faxphone 8 Personal Desktop Transceiver and the lowly  pushpin, now transformed into a sculpted steel-and-rubber supergizmo.  </P> <P> Main Gallery, Art Center College of Design, 1700 Lida St., Pasadena, (818)  584-5052, until March 3.

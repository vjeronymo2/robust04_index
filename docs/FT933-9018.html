			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Letter: Thorp; a testing option, and flawed economics (2) Sir, Further to your editorial, Friends of the Earth believes the government has ignored a fundamental flaw in the economic case developed by BNFL for Thorp. By doing so it has ignored the possible gains to BNFL, its customers and the UK economy, that would arise by cancelling Thorp. The economic case that BNFL has put forward for opening Thorp assumes that it would lose all Pounds 4bn of its projected income if the plant were not opened. This scenario is completely unrealistic and should not be accepted without question. It would be far more realistic for BNFL to sell its customers other spent fuel management services, such as spent fuel storage, as a direct replacement for existing reprocessing contracts. It is likely that both BNFL and its customers would benefit from such a switch in contracts. For this to happen, however, the government must take responsibility for bringing the parties to the negotiating table. The government cannot claim that opening Thorp is justified without conducting a full and open evaluation of all possible options. Patrick Green, nuclear campaigner, Friends of the Earth, 26-28 Underwood Street, London N1 7JQ</p>

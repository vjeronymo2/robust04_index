			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCOUTS CLIMB, CUT, COOK IN CARDBOARD TO ENTERTAIN 35,000 AT ANAHEIM STADIUM  </P> <P> Learning how to cook in a cardboard box may not be an answer to the microwave,  but as any Scout will say, it sure can come in handy.  </P> <P> That exhibit, along with others such as pole climbing and log sawing, were  among the many skills that were demonstrated Saturday at the annual Orange  County Scout Fair at Anaheim Stadium, which drew more than 35,000 participants  and onlookers.  </P> <P> About 350 exhibits transformed the stadium's parking lot and a part of its  interior into a fair-like festival, titled "Friendship, Fellowship and Fun,"  where Scouts displayed their know-how in typical and not-so-typical Boy  Scouting activities. The annual event has been held in Orange County for more  than 50 years.  </P> <P> One troop built a makeshift beach -- complete with sand and volleyball court --  and another sponsored a Batman beanbag toss as several groups put on  non-traditional displays in an attempt to add contemporary appeal to the nearly  80-year-old national organization.  </P> <P> "There's always some group that comes up with something crazy and unique," said  Devon Dougherty, a spokesman for the Orange County Council of the Boy Scouts of  America, which has about 79,000 members. "There's physical activities, there's  mental activities, and there's pretty much people having a good time."  </P> <P> That's what 9-year-old David Clark was doing.  </P> <P> "We're having lots of fun," said David, a member of Troop 314 in Westminster.  "This is a really special day. It's like a fair; all the troops do their own  exhibits and then a lot of people come here and see."  </P> <P> It was literally good, clean fun when the Orange County Firefighters Assn.  turned on their foam bubble machine -- something used for extinguishing oil  fires -- and offered some hot, tired Scouts a chance to cool off.  </P> <P> Local police officers, search and rescue team representatives and members of  the American Red Cross demonstrated first aid and safety tips, including  information on earthquake preparedness and survival.  </P> <P> Also scattered throughout the exhibits were anti-drug and anti-gang displays,  evidence of Scouting's attempt to match its ideals with contemporary issues.  "It's something we've been doing for a while," Dougherty said. "We keep pushing  it more and more."  </P> <P> Many of the parents at the event said their children benefit not only from  Scouting's fun, but also from the guidance the organization offers them.  </P> <P> "Scouting provides the tools to be good human beings," said Michael Ceccanese,  who was once a Scout and is now Scoutmaster for his son's Troop 699 in Irvine's  Meadow Park. "It teaches camaraderie, loyalty . . . what you need to be a  solid, caring, outgoing human being."  </P></p>

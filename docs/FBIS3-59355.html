			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yang Jishen (2799 4949 4939): "Next Year's </F> Reform Will Bring Overall Impetus and Key Breakthroughs"]    [Text] A relevant department informed reporters a few days  ago that, in the 1994 implementation of the "Decisions" taken at  the 3d Plenum of the 14th Party Central Committee, reform will  bring with it overall impetus and key breakthroughs.  Authorities are optimistic that next year will see an  acceleration of reform and progress.    In 1994, the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy  will select 100 medium-sized and large state-owned enterprises  as experimental sites for conducting a modern enterprise system  in the corporation form. For state-owned small enterprises, the  chief measures taken will be combination leases, auction or  sale, lease prior to sale, while some enterprises can also  remold themselves according to the joint stock system. At  present, for a great many of enterprises which lack the  prerequisites for remolding into corporations, the key is to  implement the "Enterprise Law," "Rules for Transforming the  Operational Mechanism," and the "Rules for Supervising  State-Owned Assets," linking enterprises' rights of  self-operation with the system of property rights supervision,  to give positive impetus to property rights system reform. The  impetus for pricing reform will continue in the next year, with  cancellation at the earliest possible date of the dual-track  pricing system for means of production, acceleration of the  process of marketization of key production element pricing,  positive reform of the current commodity circulation system, and  strengthening and development of a commodity market network.  This is an important program of reform. The key points in  cultivating a market system are the financial market, the labor  force market, the real estate market, the technology market, and  the information market.    The key points in reform of the revenue system are changing  the current local revenue contract system into a tax division  system on the grounds of reasonably dividing the rights of the  central government and local revenues, setting up systems for  central revenue and local revenue, and, meanwhile, implementing  a system for refunding and transferring payments to localities  from central government revenues to regulate the distribution  structure and regional structure. The key points in financial  system reform are strengthening the role of the central bank,  setting up the central banking system as soon as possible to  implement currency policy independently under the leadership of  the State Council, regulating and controlling the currency  supply to keep currency value stable, separating policy type  business and commercial type business in the banking system,  organizing and building a policy type bank, changing specialized  banks into commercial banks, allowing them to become enterprise  type financial organs. The key points in investment system  reform will be dividing investment main entities and scope of  responsibility along the lines of investment areas,  progressively establish risk responsibility for legal person  investment and bank credit, confirming the investment scope for  government and enterprises, replacing the administrative  examination and approval system currently in operation with  project registration and maintenance of a file system.</p>

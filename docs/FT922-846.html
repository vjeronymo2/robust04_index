			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory unease over upturn intensifies GROWING DISQUIET among Tory MPs about the weakness of the recovery surfaced yesterday in a public demand that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, should extend the stamp duty 'holiday' for many house purchases. The call - in a Commons motion signed by 26 Tories - coincides with widespread acknowledgement among cabinet ministers that the party's election victory has failed to bring the promised revival. Mr Lamont's colleagues now expect the Treasury to revise down from 1 per cent to zero its forecast of output growth this year. But they denied that the chancellor faced cabinet pressure to risk sterling's stability in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System by forcing the pace on interest-rate cuts. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is understood to be keen for a small reduction in rates. But he is said to back the chancellor's view that any such move must be dictated by the financial markets rather than by political pressures. Mr Lamont last week underlined the government's commitment to sterling's ERM parity, telling Conservative MPs that a relaxation of the government's anti-inflation stance would wreck the medium-term prospects for the economy. The unease among Tory backbenchers about the slow pace of recovery falls significantly short of a rebellion, but it is reinforced by a separate attack on sterling's participation in the ERM. Conservative opponents of the Maastricht accord have seized on the stubbornness of the recession to strengthen their demands for a sharp cut in interest rates regardless of the impact on sterling. Yesterday's Commons motion was seen as a broader warning from the government's supporters of their impatience at the depth of the recession. It was signed by MPs representing a broad spectrum of opinion in the party Mr Lamont has made it clear he intends to stick to his plans to reimpose stamp duty on all house purchases. The temporary moratorium - until mid-August - of stamp duty on house sales below Pounds 250,000 was announced last December to stimulate the housing market. But the message from many Tories is that the measure has so far failed to provide any significant boost to the construction industry. Sir Malcolm Thornton, the Crosby MP who organised the motion, said he would be seeking a statement of intent from Mr Lamont before the Commons rises next month for the summer. There were signs at Westminster last night that Labour might seek to capitalise on the motion by incorporating an extension of the stamp-duty holiday in an amendment to the finance bill. That would leave the government facing a possible defeat as its Commons majority falls short of the 26 signatures on the motion. A handful of Tory backbenchers whose local councils have had their budgets disrupted through the 'capping' of their poll tax or community charge refused to support the government in the Commons last night, Ivor Owen writes. Their gesture made little impact, however, as the government secured a majority of 58 (312-254) approving the order endorsing capping. Mr Michael Shersby, MP for Uxbridge, criticised the rigid formula applied by the Department of Education. This, he said, had resulted in his local education authority being deprived of Pounds 1m because 15 per cent of the schools in the borough had opted out of its control by securing grant maintained status.</p>

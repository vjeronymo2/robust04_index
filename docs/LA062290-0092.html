			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MELVILLE PICKS UP PACE AT 70;  </P> <P> TRIATHLETE: OJAI RESIDENT WARMS UP FOR 100-MILE RUN AND 100-MILE HORSEBACK RIDE  WITH RECORD IN 50-MILE ROAD RACE.  </P> <P> John Melville's idea of a good time: At the end of this month, jog across the  spine of the High Sierra in a 100-mile ultra-marathon called the Western States  Run, and then, about a month later -- in a rare double -- ride the same trail  and the same distance in the Tevis Cup, the granddaddy of cross-country horse  races.  </P> <P> It all sounded plausible to Melville, an accomplished triathlete who lives in  Ojai, but the Western States 100 race committee balked. Melville isn't a kid  anymore. Or even middle-aged. He's 70, at an age when even driving 100 miles  can be detrimental to ligaments and tendons. Besides, nobody his age had ever  entered the footrace, a tortuous trek from Squaw Valley to Auburn, Calif., with  an ascent of 19,000 feet over several inclines.  </P> <P> So Melville was told that he would have to qualify by finishing a 50-mile race  in less than 10 hours. That alone seemed like an impossible task. Melville had  never even finished a 26.2-mile marathon in less than five hours. Even in  training for the Ironman triathlon in Hawaii -- Melville has competed in the  past seven -- he seldom runs more than 20 miles a day and he keeps his weekly  mileage under 70, a low figure for endurance running.  </P> <P> But Melville was blissfully unaware of just how tough it would be to crack 10  hours in the 50-mile run: Nobody in his 70-74 age group had ever broken the  10-hour barrier. So Melville would have to become the Roger Bannister of  septuagenarians to qualify for the Western States Run.  </P> <P> "Luckily for him, he didn't know that," said his wife, Wilma Dasche-Melville.  </P> <P> Melville competed in the West Coast 50 road run last month in Fountain Valley.  Accompanying him was his physician and trainer, Dr. Jeff Herten of San Luis  Obispo. Melville did cross-training -- swimming and cycling when he wasn't  running -- and upper-body weightlifting. Every other day, he'd run between six  and 10 miles. One day a week he'd go 20 miles. Herten made sure that Melville  did five miles of vertical running each week and also made him practice eating  and drinking on the run.  </P> <P> For the first 25 miles around the five-mile loop in Fountain Valley, fortified  by tubes of tapioca pudding concocted by Herten, Melville was 14 minutes ahead  of the 10-hour pace and felt he was "really cooking." But then his body began  to ache. At 36 miles, a dreadful reality suddenly overtook him, and he thought,  he said, "I still have half a marathon to do."  </P> <P> But Herten talked him out of quitting. "Jeff said, 'Everything that is going to  hurt is already hurting and is not going to get worse,' " recalled Melville,  who finished in 9 hours 56 minutes 38 seconds. "That was on a Saturday," he  said. "On Tuesday I get a call saying I set a national record. I was too much  of a gentleman to ask what the world record is."  </P> <P> (According to The Athletics Congress, Melville broke the national age-group  record by nearly eight minutes and might have set a world record but TAC  doesn't list world standards for the event.)  </P> <P> Melville currently is in Squaw Valley training for next Saturday's Western  States Run, which will kick off an event-filled summer for him. A couple of  weeks before the Aug. 4 Tevis Cup -- just for fun -- he is going to take part  in a 40-mile ride-and-tie, a race in which the rider and his partner alternate  riding a horse and jogging. Then, on Oct. 6, Melville will compete in another  Ironman in Hawaii.  </P> <P> "He's an amazing man, absolutely amazing," said Herten, who met Melville in  1987 while taking part in a ride-and-tie. "He's an outstanding athlete and also  has an exceptional mental attitude."  </P> <P> John and Wilma Melville's 1 1/2-acre Ojai ranch is tucked away in a grove of  eucalyptus trees at the base of the Topa Topa Mountains. It is an idyllic  setting for a retired couple to while away the golden years, but the Melvilles  are too busy to even smell the orange blossoms wafting over from a nearby  grove.  </P> <P> A horsewoman who competes in the Tevis Cup and other long-distance horse races,  Wilma, 56, runs the ranch, which includes the care and feeding of three horses,  two llamas, two dogs and a cat. She also conditions her horses for endurance  races, taking them on long rides into the mountains behind her house.  </P> <P> John mostly trains himself, jogging, cycling and swimming, and he goes to the  local chiropractor for massages.  </P> <P> "I'd always wanted to lead a rural and animal-related life, and when I finally  got a horse a few years ago, I told John I'd be spending four or five hours a  day with it," Wilma said. We'd always done things together -- skied, built and  flown our own airplane -- and he said, 'Well, I think I better find something  to do (on my own).' "  </P> <P> Before then, John was an avid hiker -- he met Wilma on a hike -- and has hiked  all stretches of the 214-mile John Muir Trail. An engineer and real estate  investor, Melville retired in the mid-1970s. A "kinky back" had kept him from  being overly active, but the back mysteriously "clicked in" sometime in the  late '70s.  </P> <P> In 1982, John was vacationing in Hawaii when he read about the Ironman  competition taking place on the island of Kona. He flew there to watch it,  immediately convinced that he could take up the triathlon at the advanced age  of 62. He was intrigued by an event that combined running a marathon, swimming  2.4 miles in the ocean and cycling 112 miles.  </P> <P> "I would not have done it if there was only one event," he said.  </P> <P> Melville began training when he returned home, running 10Ks as well as a  marathon before entering the 1983 Ironman. He has been remarkably consistent in  the Ironman, recording a time of 16 hours 8 minutes in '83 and again last year.  His best finish was 14:48 in 1986.  </P> <P> "To succeed, you have to have an ability to make a commitment," said Wilma, a  former physical-education teacher. "John has always been a very definite  person, sure of what he wants to do. Rain or shine, problems or not, he gets  out there and does what he has to do. He's also been very fortunate not to have  any significant injuries."  </P> <P> Despite his success, Melville is low key and self-effacing. Posters from  several competitions hang not in a conspicuous place of honor but in his  bathroom. He formed a club in L.A. for Ironman alumni older than 60, and their  motto, he said, is omnius gloria fugit, all glory is fleeting. In other words,  he says, "Don't get so involved with yourself."  </P> <P> A sign by Melville's swimming pool -- "Pain is inevitable; suffering, optional"  -- was given to him by Herten. It is indicative of Melville's willingness to  work hard to maintain a youthful, vigorous body and a dynamic lifestyle. But  how long can he keep one step ahead of Father Time? "A 91-year-old man ran in  the New York Marathon this year," Herten said. "I'm not sure we really know  what our limits are."  </P> <P> For most of his life, Melville wasn't much of a swimmer or a jogger, but  there's no doubt that he has grown faster with age.  </P> <P> "I'm nothing like I was 10 or 15 years ago," he said. "My energy level is  higher. . . . I can jump in the pool and swim for two hours. It's really a  kick."  </P></p>

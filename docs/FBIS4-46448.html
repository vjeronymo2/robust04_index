			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Colin Randall in Belfast: "IRA Border Post </F> Attack Kills Soldier"]    [Text] A lance-corporal killed in an IRA bomb attack on a  look-out post in Co Armagh at the weekend was the first soldier  to be murdered by terrorists in Northern Ireland this year.    L/Cpl David Wilson, a single man from Greenock, Scotland, of  9 Regiment Royal Logistics Corps, died while guarding the RUC  station at Keady, about two miles from the border, late on  Saturday night. It was his first tour of duty in Northern  Ireland. Another soldier suffered severe shock.    Although the terrorists were at first thought to have fired  a  mortar at the post, police said last night that the blast was  caused by a small bomb placed on a wall.    Loyalist gunmen opened fire with an automatic weapon as  about  200 people taking part in a Sinn Fein march made their way to a  rally in Belfast city centre yesterday.    The Ulster Freedom Fighters admitted responsibility for the  attack in which no one was injured.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing and agencies] </F>   [Text] China yesterday detained its best-known dissident,  Wei Jingsheng, less than six months after he was released from  more than 14 years in jail. The detention came less than a week  after U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck delivered  a letter from a group of U.S. Congressmen to President Jiang  Zemin saying China would lose its Most Favoured Nations (MFN)  trading status this June if more political prisoners were not  released.    It also came a week before the U.S. Secretary of State  Warren  Christopher's visit to China Mr Christopher is to tell Chinese  leaders that billions of dollars worth of exports to the U.S.  are in jeopardy because of their human rights record. The  detentions drew an immediate response from Mr Shattuck who left  Shanghai yesterday saying he was "disturbed' to hear of the  crackdown and again urged Beijing to free all political  prisoners. Asia Watch, the human rights watchdog, last night  issued a statement urging Mr Christopher to postpone the visit  to China in view of the latest crackdown.    The detention of Wei followed the arrest of at least four  other dissidents in Beijing on Thursday [3 March] and is being  seen as part of a concerted effort to keep Beijing's dissident  community quiet during the forthcoming session of the National  People's Congress [NPC]. Wei was taken away from his office at  10 am yesterday by three plain-clothes police officers.    Former student leader, Wang Dan, was detained for 24 hours  along with two friends at Beijing Railway Station on Wednesday  as they were about to board a train to the central Chinese city  of Zhengzhou. Mr Wang said yesterday the police gave no  explanation as to why he was being held. "It was very strange,  they did not interrogate me, just kept me at the railway police  station for a few hours," he said.    Mr Wang, a key figure in the 1989 student demonstrations,  said he did not believe the authorities would be able to keep  Wei locked up for too long. "They will probably detain him for  a few days and try to persuade him to go out of town for the  duration of the NPC," Mr Wang said, "but knowing Wei Jingsheng,  he will not go voluntarily."    The Foreign Ministry refused to comment on the detention of  Wang and Wei but confirmed the arrest on Thursday of three other  dissidents, including Zhou Guoqiang, the Beijing-based lawyer of  labour leader Han Dongfang. "Zhou Guoqiang and Wang Jiaqi  violated criminal laws and were arrested and investigated by the  (Beijing) judicial authorities," the ministry said yesterday. A  third dissident, Yuan Hongbing, "took part in a criminal action  and was arrested and investigated by the Guizhou judicial  authorities (in southwest China)", it said.    In Shanghai at least four activists were detained for 24  hours-- apparently to stop them from meeting Mr Shattuck. Yang  Zhou, a veteran activist there, said he was freed yesterday  afternoon after being locked up at a police station. According  to Yang, he was scheduled to meet Mr Shattuck on Thursday, but  was unable to attend because of "strong police surveillance".    "I had planned to tell Mr Shattuck that the US should give  China MFN this year. After all there has been progress on human  rights in the country over the years," Yang said. "But I am  very angry over what they did. I have done nothing wrong and  the detention is absolutely illegal," he added. Three others  freed yesterday were medical teacher Bao Ge and activists Dai  Xuezhong and Yang Qinheng.</p>

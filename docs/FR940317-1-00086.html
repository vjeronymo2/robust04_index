			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The appeal will be examined by the settlement authority who last acted on the claim or his or her successor, to determine if the appeal complies with the requirements of this regulation. The settlement authority will also examine the claims investigative file and decide whether additional investigation is required; ensure that all allegations or evidence presented by the claimant, agent, or attorney are documented in the file; and ensure that all pertinent evidence is included in the file. If the claimant states that he or she appeals, but does not submit supporting materials within the 180 day appeal period, the appeal will be treated as being on the record as it existed at the time of denial or final offer. Unless action under paragraph (b) of this section is taken, the claim and complete investigative file, including any additional investigation required, and a tort claims memorandum will be forwarded to the appropriate appellate authority for necessary action on the appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If the evidence in the file, including information submitted by the claimant with the appeal and any necessary additional investigation, indicates the appeal should be granted, in whole or in part, the settlement authority who last acted on the claim or his or her successor will attempt to settle the claim. If a settlement cannot be reached, the appeal will be forwarded in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) As to an appeal that requires action by TJAG, TAJAG, or the Secretary of the Army or designee, the Commander, USARCS may take the action in paragraph (b) of this section or forward the claim together with a recommendation for action. All matters submitted by the claimant will be forwarded and considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Since an appeal under this chapter is not an adversary proceeding, no form of hearing is authorized. A request by the claimant for access to documentary evidence in the claims file to be used in considering the appeal should be granted unless access is not permitted by law or regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) If the appeal authority upholds a final offer or authorizes an award on appeal from a denial of a claim, the notice of the appellate authority's action will inform the claimant that they must accept the award within 180 days of the date of mailing of the notice of the appellate authority's action or the award will be withdrawn, the claim will be deemed denied and the file will be closed without further recourse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.65  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Cross-servicing of claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Single-service claims responsibility.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Per DODD 5515.8, the DOD has assigned single-service responsibility to the various military departments for the settlement of claims in specified countries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Claims settlement procedures.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Per DODD 5515.3, the DOD has directed that where a single Service has been assigned a country or area claims responsibility, that Service will settle claims cognizable under 10 U.S.C. 2733 in accordance with the departmental regulations of that Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.66  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Attorney fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the settlement of any claim pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2733 and this chapter, attorney fees will not exceed 20 percent of the final cost to the United States of the award.

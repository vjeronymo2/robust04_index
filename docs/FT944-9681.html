			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Brokers fight for private savings Branch managers at Nikko Securities, a leading Japanese broker, have been scrambling to gather their ideas together ahead of the stock market seminars for individual investors held today. Over the next few weeks, the brokers are expected to pursue a fierce media campaign against the commercial banks in bidding for the ordinary salaryman's seasonal bonus. But many officials of the broker's 126 retail branches are uncertain how much interest they can muster among their individual clients in time to get them to invest their winter bonus payments, to be distributed next month, in shares. With the Nikkei index down 3.6 per cent since the start of the month, and many traders nervous over the benchmark's possible fall below the 19,000 psychological support level, some Nikko managers do not expect high participation. What worries the officials, and the Tokyo financial community, is that while overseas, corporate and large institutional investors have been cautiously investing in the stock market over the past few years, retail investors, who have shunned shares since the market started its decline in 1990, have shown no signs of returning. Participation in daily stock market trading has declined steadily, with last month's activity by private individual investors totalling 14.4 per cent of total market turnover, a sharp fall from 43 per cent 10 years ago. Many retail investors are still licking their wounds from the post 'bubble' era plunge in share prices, with the bulk of them sitting on unrealised losses. The problem has been exacerbated by disastrous privatisations of state owned enterprises. The government and brokers had hoped that flotation of such companies as East Japan Railway, part of the former Japan National Railways, and Japan Tobacco, the tobacco and salt monopoly, would lure private investors back. Instead, the Nikkei plunged 20 per cent in a month subsequent to JR East's listing in October last year, while Japan Tobacco has fallen 33 per cent from its public offering price. Mr Jason James, strategist at brokers James Capel in Tokyo, says a gradual rise in interest rates has damaged the case for a boom in retail stock investment seen in the US and the UK over past few years. While low interest rates prompted US and UK retail investments into equities, in Japan, the rise in bank deposit rates has kept individual investors from the equity market. So how will the brokers try and entice retail clients to invest their hard earned cash? Many hope that by steering clear of the stocks, they can appeal to their clients. 'We're offering them deposit type investments,' says one Nikko branch manager. 'We have to convince people that we also offer safe and profitable products,' he says.</p>

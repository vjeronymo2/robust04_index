			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIME, WARNER REPORTEDLY ON VERGE OF MERGER  </P> <P> Warner Communications Inc. and Time Inc., two of the world's most powerful  entertainment and media companies, are on the verge of announcing a merger that  would create a titan worth nearly $15 billion, industry sources said late  Friday.  </P> <P> "Time-Warner is a done deal," declared one entertainment industry executive,  while an investment banking source added: "There is a very, very high degree of  probability that it's done." The banker cautioned, however, that in the past,  Time executives have had "difficulty closing a transaction. Of (all) I've ever  seen, they're the worst."  </P> <P> No Warner or Time official could be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Both Time and Warner have fretted about controlling their destinies during the  frenzied takeover battles of the 1980s. Last year, the two companies discussed  the possibility of merging their cable television holdings but were unable to  reach an agreement.  </P> <P> A combination of the two companies will create a cable company second only to  Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver, which has rapidly added programming and  movie theater outlets to its empire of cable systems.  </P> <P> In programming, Time's Home Box Office subsidiary dominates pay television,  while Warner operates one of the most respected motion picture studios in  Hollywood. Despite two recent lackluster years at the box office, Warner last  month snared more Academy Award nominations than any other studio, and it  continues to enjoy long-running relationships with such stars as Clint Eastwood  and Goldie Hawn. And while Time was a latecomer to the home videocassette  business, Warner has profited in the videocassette field by drawing on its  enviable film library.  </P> <P> In magazine publishing, Time simply has no equal. In addition to its namesake  Time magazine, the company publishes Life, Sports Illustrated, People, Money,  Fortune and Southern Living. It is also a 50% owner of the company that  publishes McCall's and Working Woman, and a 50% owner of Whittle  Communications, publisher of business and health periodicals. In addition, Time  and Warner each have publishing operations. Warner owns DC Comics, Mad Magazine  and Warner Books. Time owns Time-Life Books, Book-of-the-Month Club, and  Little, Brown &amp; Co.  </P> <P> In recorded music, Warner reaps more profits than any other company, including  CBS Records -- acquired last year by Sony in a highly touted $2-billion deal.  Warner derives 45% of its total revenue from record labels that include  Electra, Asylum, Nonesuch, Atlantic and Warner Bros.  </P> <P> The Time-Warner merger would be accomplished by an exchange of stock, with a  value of at least $50 assigned to each Warner share, according to one source.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Co-Managers Expected  </P> <P> Sources said the combined company would be managed for the near future by  co-chief executive officers -- presumably Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross, 61,  and Time Chairman J. Richard Munro, 58.  </P> <P> The price of both Warner and Time Inc. shares have risen sharply in recent  days. Warner stock began the week at $41.25 and closed just shy of $46. Time's  shares jumped above $109 from $104.50 at the start of the week.  </P> <P> The possibility of a merger between Time and Warner apparently was broached  last summer when the two companies were engaged in ultimately unsuccessful  negotiations for a possible combination of their cable and entertainment  businesses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cable Powers  </P> <P> Discussions at the time reportedly centered on combining Warner Cable, with 1.4  million subscribers, with Time-controlled American Television &amp;  Communications Inc., with 3.8 million subscribers. The companies also discussed  including in the venture Time's Home Box Office unit and Warner's movie  operations, according to published reports at the time.  </P> <P> The proposal met resistance from Time's board, according to a story last  September in the Wall Street Journal.  </P> <P> The Journal indicated that one stumbling block was a delay in completion of  Warner's purchase of Lorimar-Telepictures Corp., a leading supplier of  television programming such as "Dallas" and "Falcon Crest." However, analysts  at the time said discussions of a full-fledged combination between Time and  Warner might resume once the Lorimar acquisition was consummated. The deal was  completed in January.  </P></p>

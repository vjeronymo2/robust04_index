			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE 'SIMPLER TIME' AT DRAGONWOOD FAIRE IS ALSO A LOT STRANGER  </P> <P> Jim Gable adjusted his suit of armor and surveyed the knights, damsels,  Scottish pixies and strolling minstrels in front of him.  </P> <P> "It was a simpler time," Gable said about the medieval scene last weekend at  Castaic Lake Recreation Area.  </P> <P> From the looks of the Dragonwood Faire, which will close after this weekend, it  also was a stranger time. Unlike the Renaissance Pleasure Faire, which has  16th-Century England as its theme, the focus of Dragonwood is the pre-gunpowder  era of 12th-Century Ireland and Britain. Fair promoters are billing the  attraction, which pulled in about 8,000 visitors last weekend, as a medieval  fantasy fair.  </P> <P> According to Christine Dzilvelis, the 12th Century historically was a time of  more fantasy figures -- elves, dragons, pixies -- than the Renaissance era.  "That's why you have everything from strolling werewolves and elves to knights  and dragon slayers," she said. "A lot of people who go to the Renaissance Faire  come here, but this theme attracts a different kind of vendor."  </P> <P> A different kind, indeed. In one booth are beaded head chains, a fashion must  for damsels of the period. "You'd look wonderful in chains, my lady," a  well-dressed lord called out to a passer-by. The woman sauntered over to  inspect them. "I've heard that before," she replied with a smile.  </P> <P> Swords and other medieval fighting wear are also in abundance. "Most people who  buy these are more interested in the period than they are in using them as a  weapon," said Bill Handel, who held up a flail -- a spiked iron ball at the end  of a chain. "One guy did ask me if it would hold up in combat, though. I  wouldn't sell it to him."  </P> <P> There are booths that sell crafts, including clothing, boots and jewelry.  Depending on how much you want to know, a Tarot card reader will tell your  fortune for $15, $25 or $35. Walking sticks with inlaid crystals sell for about  $75.  </P> <P> For the man who has everything, though, check out a handmade chain of armor  that sells for $1,200. Excluding tax.  </P> <P> "We don't do drugs and so this is where the money goes," said Sandra Gable,  whose husband, Jim, was wearing close to $1,300 in heavy metal. "I love this  period in history and getting dressed up is an escape valve. I'm a nurse and  he's a cop and so we need that."  </P> <P> Many other visitors apparently share that view. Except for the occasional pair  of Reeboks that peeked out beneath leather garb, most costumed fair-goers  appeared to have taken pains to make their costumes authentic. Others,  stretching the definition a bit, took some liberties.  </P> <P> "I'm not a Klingon," said Dianne Burry, whose pointed ears and severely angled  eyebrows resembled some attendees at Star Trek conventions. "I'm a Scottish  elf. If I were a Klingon, I'd have electronic weapons."  </P> <P> To prove her point, Burry, a correctional officer who came from Chino for the  event, pulled aside her cape to reveal a 12-inch dirk -- a knife she said was  "worn by elves" of the day.  </P> <P> "Of course, carrying this on the streets of California is illegal, but here it  is allowed."  </P> <P> (In 1987, a Los Angeles County ordinance was passed to address the increasing  number of groups that use weapons for historical re-enactments. The ordinance  states that weapons may be carried for any "lawful occupational, recreational  or religious activity.")  </P> <P> The fair is more than just a gathering of people who want to live out their  fantasies. Dragonwood Inc. is a nonprofit organization that selects small  charities in need of funding. This year, Dzilvelis said 20% of the proceeds are  being donated to the Adolescent Alliance, a La Crescenta-based nonprofit  organization that provides shelter and treatment for teen-agers infected with  the AIDS virus.  </P> <P> "Eventually Dragonwood would like to purchase land in the Los Angeles area for  a permanent site," Dzilvelis said. "Then after one charity is helped, another  one can be chosen."  </P> <P> Cost of admission is $8.95 for adults, $6.95 for students and seniors and $2.50  for children 5 to 12. Children under 5 are admitted free. Hours of the fair are  10 a.m. to dusk.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kamin report: "Mikhail Zadornov Acquires Monopoly"] </F>   [Text] The body of Duma deputies continues to explore  actively the rights and functions of legislative power.  Yesterday, the subject of a clash between Yabloko and the NRP  [New Regional Policy] was the placing under Duma jurisdiction of  the Control- Budget Committee, whose functional possibilities  are very highly assessed by KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts.    The Control-Budget Committee (CBC) was created under the  Supreme Soviet 18 months ago for financial oversight of the  government. Resulting from the September 1993 events, it ended  up, in accordance with the president's edict, under the  jurisdiction of the Council of Ministers itself. Early in 1994,  the government, yielding to the urging of the Duma's budget  committee (with Mikhail Zadornov as chairman), restored the CBC  to parliament. The Duma lent legitimacy to this action by a  decree under which the CBC is supposed to exercise the functions  of keeping tabs on the budget. Thus, before a special law on an  Accounts Chamber [Schetnaya Palata] is passed, the CBC happens  to be in charge of vetting the spending of budget funds  (credits, grants, and subsidies), as well as the finances of  nonbudget funds. This enables the CBC soon to become a serious  Duma tool to influence the government. Zadornov (Yabloko) is  planning to use the committee as a foundation on which to build  an Accounts Chamber.    The Duma, however, has already elected the chamber's  chairman  -- Khachim Karmokov ("Independent Regional Policy"). Notably,  the group's leader, Vladimir Medvedev, was dissatisfied with the  actions of Mikhail Zadornov who managed, at the time of voting,  to avoid mentioning in the CBC decree the Accounting Chamber's  powers. At the same time, the chairman of the CBC structure  (under the decree) cannot be confirmed unless presented and  approved by the Budget Committee. This amounts to the Zadornov  committee's monopoly in matters of budget control until an  Accounts Chamber law goes into effect. Remarkably, Medvedev  believes that Zadornov has deliberately dragged his feet on  passing this law.</p>

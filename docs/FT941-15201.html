			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Everglades clean-up intensified The US administration is renewing its efforts to make sugar producers help to restore the Everglades, the spectacular swamp at the southern tip of Florida. The Interior Department last week won the agreement of Flo-Sun Inc, one of the biggest sugar producers, to a clean-up plan that could cost it Dollars 70m-Dollars 100m (Pounds 47m-Pounds 70m) over the next 20 years, reviving a more extensive agreement in principle reached with the sugar industry last summer. That deal broke down last month amid disputes between environmentalists and sugar growers over details. But Mr Bruce Babbitt, interior secretary, said the Everglades were a test case for US ability to restore an ecosystem, He promised to press for a comprehensive agreement. Much of the surviving Everglades, one of the world's largest wetlands with abundant bird and plant life, is protected in a national park but the fragile ecosystem depends on a steady flow of fresh water. Drainage and civil engineering have created acres of farmland, mainly devoted to sugarcane, to the north of the park. This cuts the flow of water into the Everglades, raises salinity, and pollutes the flow with fertilisers which have nourished algae and exotic plants, choking native species. With Flo-Sun now accepting a deal, federal and state government pressure on US Sugar, the other big grower, will increase.</p>

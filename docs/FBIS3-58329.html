			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial signed "ha": "Partner Instead of Member"] </F>   [Text] The East European states will have no choice but to  accept NATO's Partnership for Peace offer. The summit meeting  in Brussels was organized so carefully that all disputes over an  eastward expansion were removed in advance. Basically, the  alliance declared its openness, but it deliberately tried to  keep the exact dates that countries might be accepted a mystery.    The evading maneuver has a temporary advantage: Russia's  President Yeltsin can sell the Brussels result as a "success."  If the democratic forces in Russia succeed in keeping the  chauvinists and neoimperialists under control, the concerns of  the Western neighboring states from the Baltic states to the  Black Sea may vanish again. Yet the stabilization of the  Russian democracy may depend to an even greater extent on  economic successes. The small states in Central and East Europe  will try to establish close political and military ties within  the framework of the Partnership for Peace. There were voices  on the sidelines of the summit that predicted their entry into  the Alliance "in a few years' time." It became clear that it  will not be possible for the Alliance to deny them membership in  the long run if the aggressive tones from Moscow intensify.    By the way, it is also possible for the Eastern neighboring  states to enter NATO in a roundabout way, that is via membership  in the European Union and its defense alliance, the Western  European Union [WEU]. President Mitterrand suggested completing  the "European Treaties" that the East European countries  concluded with the European Union by a "WEU association."  "Poland has not perished yet." The text of the Polish national  anthem is also valid for other countries.</p>

The new regulations embody the principles of the national  law  on this subject outlined in June last year.    The city has now got a population of 250,000 returned  overseas Chinese and their relatives. Seven out of ten  joint-venture enterprises in the capital are funded by overseas  Chinese and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan compatriots.    The regulations confirm that the returned overseas Chinese  and their relatives have rights to take part in social,  political and economic activities and to get proper education  and visit their relatives abroad. They are also ensured of  their rights in dealing with personal property.    The regulations go into detail on the issue of the private  houses, one of the greatest concerns of the returned overseas  Chinese and their relatives, and formulate some preferential  policies for them.    The regulations have outlined a number of special policies  to  encourage the returned overseas Chinese and their relatives to  set up enterprises in their motherland.</p>

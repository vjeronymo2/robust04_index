			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F> Hayim Zissowitz -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Zissowitz] Let us talk about  the Syrian track of the peace talks, which has not been affected  -- or has been less affected -- by the Hebron massacre. Did you  read the minutes of the meeting between Knesset Member [MK]  'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad  yesterday?    [Peres] Yes.    [Zissowitz] Did you detect any new messages?    [Peres] No, I just detected softer language. It is  interesting to note that this was a meeting between the Syrian  president and Israeli representatives, although they did not  enter the country with their Israeli passports and did not  highlight the fact that they are Israelis and members of the  Knesset. This, too, is one of the signs of the times.    You know, we have long outgrown the era of charades, of  hiding, disguising, and pretending. What good is it? That,  however, seems to be the way of the world up north.    [Zissowitz] In the meeting, President al-Asad reiterated his  formula of full peace in exchange for full withdrawal. Is  Israel prepared to accept such a formula?    [Peres] First of all, I do not know what full peace is.  When he talks about full peace, what is it filled with? For  example, he did not undertake to fill it with diplomatic  representations, commercial ties, and open borders. So what  does full mean?    [Zissowitz] Did you hear the utterances of MK's Talib  al-Sani' and Darawshah during a tour of the Golan Heights and in  other meetings?    [Peres] I think they are both MK's, and whatever their  criticism of Israel is, they should voice it in Jerusalem rather  than in al-Qunaytirah. In my opinion, both good manners and  logic call for highlighting the positive and the things we have  in common.    [Zissowitz] Do Israeli MK's who talk on the Syrian side of  the Golan Heights about the terrible oppression of the  Palestinians and who say that the lot of Israel's Arabs is worse  than that of Syria's Jews truly represent Israeli Arabs?    [Peres] I do not believe that. I do not recall the Syrian  Parliament ever having had a Jewish member. As you know, every  Syrian Jew may come to Israel, but can every Israeli Arab go to  Syria? We all know that not even all Arabs are allowed in, but  only people who belong to a certain party, group, and belief.  Even then, they are not issued passports or allowed to  publicize their identity. In this respect, if you were to  compare the Israeli delegation's visit to Syria with visits to  Israel by foreign delegations to meet with Arabs and others, the  difference would immediately strike you.

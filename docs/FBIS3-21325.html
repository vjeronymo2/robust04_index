			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 12--The Election Commission has  issued fresh instructions for seizing arms and ammunition and  checking the movement of authorised vehicles to ensure the  smooth and peaceful conduct of elections.    The three-page orders have been issued in the light of the  experience gained during the recently held Assembly elections to  four Northern States and the Union Territory of Delhi, besides  Mizoram.    According to the directions, no new arms licences would be  issued during the election period. The police would conduct  mopping up operations in the areas infested by anti-social  elements, paying special attention to unearthing unlicensed arms  and ammunition. The illegal manufacture of firearms would be  checked by conducting searches and arresting the persons  involved.    Special vigil on the inter-State movement of trucks and  other  commercial vehicles has also been suggested to prevent smuggling  of arms and ammunition and anti-social elements.    All firearms licence holders living in sensitive areas would  be asked to deposit their weapons with the district  administration for one week from the last date of the withdrawal  of candidature. Exception may however be made in genuine.    Responsibility: The District Magistrate and the  Superintendent of Police would be personally responsible for  ensuring that the exemptions granted were genuine. They would be  liable for sever action if any of the licensed arms which were  not impounded were found to be misused during elections.    Prohibitory orders banning the carrying of licensed arms  would be issued as soon as the election was announced. If, in  the opinion of the Director General of Police, there was a real  threat to the life and property of any person, he or she should  be provided with necessary security. But under no circumstances  would he be allowed to carry his own personal firearms or to be  accompanied by anyone with firearms.    The orders prohibit the plying of authorised cars and  vehicles in a convoy of more than three vehicles. All bigger  convoys would be broken up even if they were carrying any  Minister of the Central or State Government or any person  entitled to any security cover.    Failure to do so would be treated as serious and might lead  to cancellation of the poll, the order said.</p>

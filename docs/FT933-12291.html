			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Special Report on Second Cars: For those yet to be converted . . . - Diesels SECOND-car buyers who do not consider a diesel are denying themselves the opportunity to cut fuel costs by at least 30 per cent and make a modest contribution to protecting the environment. More than 200,000 diesel cars were sold in Britain last year, most to company fleets. This year, sales have continued to climb steeply and a total of 250,000 registrations, or more than 20 per cent of the total car market, is on the cards. Every kind of car is now available with a diesel engine. Well, nearly every kind. No maker has yet marketed a diesel-powered convertible or sports car, although you could call Citroen's ZX Volcane turbo-diesel (a top speed of 118 mph/190 kph) a diesel GTi. And one really must think of BMW's fast and ultra-refined six-cylinder, 2.5-litre turbo-diesels, newly-arrived in Britain, as typical BMWs first and diesel cars second. Diesels save on running costs, not because the fuel they burn is significantly cheaper than unleaded petrol but because they use so much less of it. When running below full power - as car engines are for 99 per cent of the time - and especially when warming after cold starting, diesels can be spectacularly more economical than petrol engines. A typical family diesel hatchback - say, a VW Golf, Ford Escort or Peugeot 205 - used almost entirely on short runs of a mile or two may have half the fuel consumption of a petrol equivalent. Only when driven hard on motorways do diesels lose some of their economy benefits. Even then, they are still less thirsty than petrol cars. Economy over very large mileages once was the only reason for buying a diesel because they were less attractive than petrol cars to drive, had basic trim and cost more. None of these disadvantages applies now. Diesel cars burn fuel so efficiently that they cause less atmospheric pollution than petrol cars - less even than the latest ones with exhaust catalysers. A diesel car is noisier than a petrol model at start-up but, after a couple of minutes, it will be hard - in some cases, virtually impossible - to tell the difference. And turbo-charged diesels have similar acceleration to petrol cars; the Citroen ZX actually out-performs some petrol-engined rivals in the same price class. Trim and equipment levels are no different, and the hefty price premium once charged for a diesel has almost disappeared, not least because all petrol cars must now have fuel injection and a catalyser. The new Citroen Xantia 1.6i petrol and 1.9 diesel are both Pounds 10,895. The cheapest Vauxhall Cavalier is the entry level 1.7D Envoy at Pounds 10,360, which is Pounds 170 cheaper than the 1.6i petrol. Reliability is another good reason for buying a diesel as a second car. A diesel engine has no electric ignition, which removes at a stroke the main cause of roadside breakdowns. For starting from cold, a diesel has glow plugs. All you need do is leave the ignition key in the pre-start position while you fasten your seat belt, and then turn it to operate the starter. The engine fires instantly and runs untemperamentally while warming up. (For more than 15 years, my personal cars have been diesels. None has ever failed to start first time; none has ever let me down on the road. I cannot see myself ever buying a petrol-engined car again). Diesel car prices start at under Pounds 7,000. Among the cheapest are the Vauxhall Corsa Merit 1.5D, Rover Metro 1.4CD and Seat Ibiza 1.7D, all three-door hatchbacks. The Corsa's engine is a Japanese-made Isuzu while the Metro has the same PSA (Peugeot-Citroen) diesel used in the Citroen AX and Peugeot 106. Most Seats, although not the Ibiza, have Volkswagen engines. PSA is the leading European manufacturer of small diesels; its 1.9-litre engines power the Rover 200 and 400 diesels as well as the Citroen BX, ZX and Xantia and Peugeot 205, 309 and 405. Although, litre for litre of cylinder capacity, diesels do not develop as much power as petrol engines, they tend to pull very hard at low revolutions. In practical terms, this means that a diesel in fifth gear often will climb a hill that would call for fourth or even third gear in a petrol-engined car. And the need for fewer gear changes makes for relaxed driving. Is there no diesel down-side? Honesty compels me to admit that no diesel ticks over as quietly as a petrol engine, and some can sound rather gruff when accelerating hard. But there is no truth in the hoary old myth that diesel pumps are so filthy that, after tanking up, your next stop is the dry cleaner. At modern sites, the pumps are on same islands as those dispensing unleaded and premium petrols. Disposable plastic gloves are there for the taking. I never bother and rarely have to wipe my hands on a free paper towel. Another complaint was that diesel cars were smelly. Yes, they were - but not any more. Now, the really smelly ones are hard-driven petrol cars with catalysers which leave a strong aroma of rotting cabbage. The more you look at the case for buying a diesel second car, the more compelling it becomes. In the last Budget, all motor fuel duty went up 10 per cent. The chancellor said it would continue to rise annually by at least 3 per cent over inflation. As the running costs of a second car in most households cannot be set against tax, curbing its fuel consumption will become progressively more important. There is no better way of doing this than going for a diesel next time.</p>

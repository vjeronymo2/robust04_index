			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Tatyana Vasileva: "Rating"] </F>   [Text] What would happen should Dr. Zhelev decide to test  the voters' confidence, namely the confidence of those who  already cast their vote for him in the direct elections? Despite  the endless attacks launched against him, Dr. Zhelev does not  seem afraid and is not behaving accordingly. He by no means  appears helpless either.    He hardly relies solely on his popularity which, as  reflected  by the results of all public opinion polls on political figures,  seems to be the most stable.    In an interview with the Bulgarian National Radio Network  yesterday, Dr. Zhelev declared that if anyone should try to  jeopardize the successes achieved in settling Bulgaria's foreign  debt or boycott the restored confidence of the international  financial circles in our country, he would be forced to publicly  declare such acts as high treason against the nation.    Naturally, his statement should not be interpreted as  digging  up the tomahawk against his opponents.    Dr. Zhelev has long since and repeatedly proposed the option  of a political and parliamentary consensus as the only possible  method of coping with the difficulties of the transition period  and of successfully proceeding with the reform.    Both parliament and the relevant political forces rejected  his offer.    Hence, one should not be surprised if the attacks against  the  Presidency should ricochet in the form of a boomerang.    It was hardly false modesty that prompted Dr. Zhelev to  admit  that he considers himself a president for the transition period  and to add that he would not run for a new term of office.  Nevertheless, he will see to it that the tasks, for the sake of  which he was elected by direct vote, should not remain  unfinished and he will take advantage of his remaining three  years of office for this purpose.    This is so because he does not feel isolated from the  people.    Hence, Zhelev being convinced of public support for his  cause, we should not be surprised if he should seek confirmation  for this support through a public referendum in an attempt to  find out how much the constantly quoted "people" appreciate him.    In case of his defeat in such a referendum, he should blame  his advisers and the sociologists.</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas to sell cheque acceptance service McDONNELL DOUGLAS, the financially-stretched US aerospace group, is selling Telecheck Services - which provides cheque acceptance and guarantee services to retailers - to Atlanta-based First Financial Management. McDonnell Douglas said the deal was part of its strategy of focusing on its aerospace business. Telecheck, which it acquired in 1984, is based in Denver, Colorado, and employs about 700 people. The aerospace group did not put a price on the deal, but First Financial Management said it would be paying Dollars 159m both to buy Telecheck and Payment Services, its principal franchisee, which is not owned by McDonnell Douglas. McDonnell Douglas has been slimming down its sizeable financial services operations, to focus on aircraft financing and commercial equipment leasing. Last year it even considered selling off the entire financial services arm as a means of raising cash.</p>

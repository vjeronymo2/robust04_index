			<p>BFN     [Text] In Maglaj a general alert was sounded at about 1200  as the aggressor fired several artillery shells at the town.  Fortunately, there were no civilian casualties. At the same  time, Britsh UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] soldiers clashed  with the Serbian aggressor.    [Reporter Hajrudin Ceric] First, the British were caught in  fierce sniper fire from the criminals on the slopes of Mount  Ozren. To protect their lives they returned fire from the  small-caliber guns mounted on their combat vehicles. This was  no convincing reason for the aggressor to cease fire. On the  contrary, they opened up with brief but fierce bursts of fire  from a Bofors gun. There was not the slightest trace of NATO  aircraft in the sky as the blue helmets were stranded in dire  straits. We have unofficially learned that there are no  casualties among the ranks of the UNPROFOR unit.</p>

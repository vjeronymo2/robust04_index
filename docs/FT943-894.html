			<p>940927 FT  27 SEP 94 / Disposals at Kodak near end The sale of L&amp;F Household to Reckitt &amp; Colman brings Eastman Kodak almost to the end of the ambitious disposal programme announced in May by Mr George Fisher, its new chairman. The deal also brings total cash raised by the programme to Dollars 7.2bn (Pounds 4.6bn), leaving Kodak apparently debt-free. More important in strategic terms, it virtually completes Kodak's strategy of returning to its basic business. This the company defines as 'imaging' - not only traditional photographic activities but the high-tech world of multi-media, with which Mr Fisher is familiar from his previous job as boss of the electronics firm Motorola. The one substantial disposal remaining is the rest of L&amp;F, consisting of DIY products such as wood finishers. Kodak is coy about the size of this business or how much it might fetch. However, a clue can be derived from the fact that when it decided to sell L&amp;F in two parts - on the grounds that it could not reach its target price for the business as a whole - that price was rumoured to be about Dollars 2bn. Also to be sold are a small technology subsidiary, NanoSystems, and the research and development headquarters of Sterling, the drug company which Kodak sold to Sanofi of France earlier this year. Sanofi has agreed to lease the building from Kodak for a year. When Mr Fisher arrived at Kodak last December, some observers were sceptical about his ability to turn around a company which seemed to have lost its way. However, the speed at which he has moved has won Wall Street's admiration.</p>

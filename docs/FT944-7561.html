			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / BSA neutral on regulation change The prospect of bringing building societies within the same regulatory regime as banks was highlighted yesterday by MPs on the Treasury committee. The Building Societies Association was asked about the idea of merging the Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, with the supervisory division of the Bank of England. It was giving evidence to the committee's inquiry into financial regulation. Mr Donald Kirkham, association chairman, told the MPs: 'We are fairly neutral about who regulates us, provided that it's effective.' While the association said it did not see the need for change and that the commission had been a successful regulator, Mr Adrian Coles, director-general, said 'it would not be a dreadful disaster if it was merged' provided the supervisor's expertise was not lost. The comments came the day after Nationwide Building Society, the UK's second largest, called for a single regulatory framework for financial services with one watchdog covering areas currently handled by a range of organisations. Until recently, the arguments for regulatory convergence came largely from banks and their supervisors, with societies merely expressing support for their regulator. The Treasury did not address regulation in the consultation paper it published for its review of societies' powers.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Morning Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Participants at the 20th Council of the Latin  American Economic System [SELA] in Mexico condemned the blockade  imposed on Cuba by the United States over 30 years ago.    A resolution approved by representatives from 27 of the  regional organization's member countries urged the U.S.  Government to lift its restrictions against the Caribbean  island, characterizing their effects as harmful to the Cuban  people.    The SELA text contemplates the need to reaffirm, among other  principles, the sovereign equality of states, noninterference in  the internal affairs of states, and freedom of trade and  navigation, which are established in various international  agreements.    It is estimated that Cuba has lost approximately $40 billion  as a result of the U.S. restrictions and efforts to hinder trade  negotiations between the Cuban Government and foreign  businessmen and institutions.</p>

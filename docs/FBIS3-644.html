He said the SADF was not on a basis of alertness  specifically  with regard to Bophuthatswana. Dr Herbst was speaking against  the background of ongoing speculation that the SADF had moved  into the riotous homeland.    "Any decision about Bophuthatswana will be made by the South  African Government and in which the Transitional Executive  Council will be involved," Dr Herbst said.    He pointed out however that the SADF had, on an ongoing  basis, contingency plans for all events.</p>

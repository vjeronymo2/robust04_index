			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO'S SPIRITS HIGH AFTER SEMIFINAL LOSS;  </P> <P> JC BASKETBALL: PLAYOFF WINNING STREAK SALVAGED THE WARRIORS' SEASON. NOW  THEY'RE LOOKING TO NEXT YEAR.  </P> <P> The phrase coming out of Ron McClurkin's mouth Friday night had a familiar ring  to it.  </P> <P> For the second year in a row, his El Camino basketball team lost in the state  semifinals, and the coach said simply: "We'll be back. El Camino will be back  next year."  </P> <P> Last season the Warriors were eliminated by Chabot, which made its second  consecutive appearance in the state finals Saturday.  </P> <P> On Friday, El Camino lost, 81-70, to a powerful Rancho Santiago club that has  an impressive 31-3 mark.  </P> <P> Ironically, the two teams that beat Rancho Santiago this year (Santa Monica and  Cypress), were upset by El Camino in the playoffs.  </P> <P> The Warriors defeated Santa Monica, 81-79, in the opening round. Then they  defeated Cypress, a two-time winner over Rancho Santiago, in the third round,  80-71.  </P> <P> The Loss to Rancho Santiago was disappointing but not tragic for an El Camino  team that failed to at least share the South Coast Conference title for the  first time since joining the league five years ago.  </P> <P> The Warriors surprised many by finishing in a three-way tie for third in the  five-member conference. They entered league play with a 15-5 mark and were  favored to contest the title with Cerritos, the eventual champion.  </P> <P> Instead, the conference schedule proved a nightmare for El Camino, whose  basketball teams had won three junior college state titles in the 1980s under  former Coach Paul Landreaux.  </P> <P> In the league opener Jan. 6, El Camino suffered a stunning loss to Mt. San  Antonio College, the SCC's worst team at the time.  </P> <P> The Warriors dropped out of the state's top 20 after losing to Mt. SAC a second  time Jan. 27. They never crawled back into the state rankings.  </P> <P> "There were times," McClurkin said, "when we just couldn't suck it up and do  it. We ran into a rough spot."  </P> <P> But El Camino got going again on the road to the state finals. The Warriors  ripped four higher-ranked teams in the playoffs to turn around what had  appeared to be a disappointing season and earn a spot in the Final Eight  Tournament at UC Irvine's Bren Events Center.  </P> <P> "We knew it was going to be a tough game because we knew El Camino had a very  tough road to get here," Rancho Santiago Coach Dana Pagett said after his  team's victory. "And it turned out that we had a lot of cause for concern."  </P> <P> The Warriors, seeded 23rd in the playoffs by virtue of their conference finish,  had defeated No. 10 Santa Monica, No. 7 L.A. City and No. 2 Cypress, all on the  road.  </P> <P> "We finally came together as a team," reflected guard Frank Beatty after  Friday's loss. "Everybody woke up for the playoffs, 'cause everybody was asleep  during league."  </P> <P> McClurkin, in his second year as interim head coach, said the best part of his  two seasons at the helm was this year's playoffs.  </P> <P> "We had good togetherness," he said. "We played real well as a group. I mean  just to be here (in the state Final Eight Tournament) is great."  </P> <P> The Warriors finished with a 24-11 record, including a 4-1 post-season mark  against favored teams.  </P> <P> Sophomore Larry Lockley led El Camino's balanced scoring attack throughout the  season. The 6-foot-4 guard averaged 18.8 points in the playoffs. Sophomore  forwards David Keeter and Steve Leary were also impressive during the  post-season with 14.0 averages.  </P> <P> "It wasn't a bad season," McClurkin said after the loss to Rancho Santiago. "We  got 24 wins. We wanted to get 20, and we ended up with 24. That's not bad."  </P></p>

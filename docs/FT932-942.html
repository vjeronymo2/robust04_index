			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: Bosch to shed more jobs as earnings tumble BOSCH, the privately-owned motor components, electronics and appliances group, is to press ahead with further rigorous cost-cutting measures following a 29 per cent drop in pre-tax earnings last year. The workforce will once again bear the brunt of the group's attempts to combat recession and vehicle makers' demands for cheaper components. Bosch, which shed almost 11,000 employees last year, has already cut a further 4,400 workers since January, and a further 6,000 will go by the year end, Mr Marcus Bierich, retiring chairman, said yesterday. In addition, cuts in employee fringe benefits - which cost more than DM1bn (Dollars 600m) a year in the German parent alone - reduced capital spending and lower material costs will save at least DM500m this year, he said. Reviewing prospects for 1993, Mr Bierich said group turnover would fall for the first time since the 1960s' recession. Bosch would remain profitable at the pre-tax and net levels, but he was 'not sure' about operating earnings. First-half sales were down 9.3 per cent at DM13bn, with domestic turnover 12 per cent lower and overseas business down only 3.4 per cent. Turnover in vehicle components, 50 per cent of Bosch's business, was 14 per cent lower for the six months after a 3.7 per cent gain to DM17bn for last year as a whole. A 10 per cent improvement in public telecommunications in the period to the end of June, due to continuing installation work in eastern Germany, helped this sector to restrict the sales fall to 4.4 per cent. Communications technology divisions increased sales 3.2 per cent in 1992 to DM8bn. Talks with Northern Telecom, of Canada, over collaboration in this sector were continuing, and were 'not urgent,' Mr Bierich said. Referring to efforts to build up a Bosch service network in China, he said the first authorisation had required around 200 signatures. Reporting on the group's 1992 performance, he said sales rose 2.5 per cent to DM34.43bn, 'the smallest increase in percentage terms since 1971'. Turnover in Europe, accounting for 85 per cent of the group total, was restrained by the second-half downturn in the German market and a decline in non-EC countries. Pre-tax earnings fell to DM1.36bn from DM1.91bn in 1991 with net profits down to DM512m from DM540m.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Tecs seek green light for chambers merger Training and Enterprise Councils are to advise the government not to object to their integration with chambers of commerce, provided that a number of quality criteria are met. If ministers give the green light to such advice, which comes after the government invited Tecs' comments, a number of mergers could take place. Approval, which would be unpopular in some areas, would be in line with wider moves to redraw the map of locally delivered business and economic development services. Kent Tec, for example, is negotiating with Kent County Council over its integration with the county's economic development unit. Mr Michael Heseltine, secretary of state at the Department of Trade and Industry, which takes a close interest in chambers, and Mr David Hunt's employment department, which funds Tecs, met this month to discuss whether they believed barriers to the integration of the two bodies should be removed. The quality criteria could include obliging the new bodies not to be delivers of services. At present many chambers contract to Tecs to provide training. Tecs and chambers, which are private bodies, are already co-operating in the new Business Links outlets which deliver services to small businesses. But a number of Tecs and chambers would like to go further, and moves to full integration have been mooted at some Tecs. In the past the employment department has set demanding criteria before considering mergers, saying that the two organisations have different aims and remits. Chambers, it has said, exist to serve the needs of their business membership while Tecs were set up by the government to provide support for training and economic development at the local level.</p>

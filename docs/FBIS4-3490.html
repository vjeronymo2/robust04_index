			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 20 (CNS) -- The Mainland-based  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) today  sent a letter to the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation  (SEF) reporting on the findings on the extraordinarily big case  of robbery, murder and arson on Qiandao Lake and informing the  SEF that the mainland's public security authorities are still  investigating the case in order to gather further information  about it following which ARATS will report to its Taiwan  counterpart.    The letter said that according to early findings, Wu Lihong,  male, aged 22 and Hu Zhihan, male, aged 24, both from Chunan  County in Zhejiang Province together with Yu Aijun, male, aged  23, from Jiande City in Zhejiang Province, conspired last year  to plan robberies on pleasure boats.

The public security authorities seized their booty such as  video cameras and cameras. The details of the crime confessed  to by the three criminals basically matched the findings of the  official investigation and analysis.

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: New York flotation raises Dollars 479m for Bell Cablemedia Correction (published 27th July 1994) appended to this article. Bell Cablemedia, the UK's third largest combined cable television and telephone operator, has raised Dollars 479m (Pounds 309m) in equity and debt on the New York Stock Exchange. The public offering of 13.1m American Depositary Shares raised Dollars 204m, and an issue of senior notes - 10-year debt - another Dollars 275m, in the second and largest cash-raising exercise for UK cable on the New York exchange. Bell Cablemedia groups the UK cable interests of Bell Canada International, the international arm of Canada's largest telecommunications operator, Cable and Wireless, the UK telecoms group whose subsidiaries include Mercury, the main long-distance competitor to British Telecommunications, and Jones Intercable, one of the largest US cable television operators, with systems in 24 states. Following the ADS offering BCI owns 42.2 per cent of Bell Cablemedia, C&amp;W 12.8 per cent, and Jones Intercable and affiliates 14.1 per cent. Bell Cablemedia has outright ownership of 18 UK cable franchises, and in addition a one-third stake in Videotron's UK cable interests. Its largest franchises cover Leeds (282,000 homes) and greater London east (229,000 homes). Allowing for the equity share in Videotron, its franchises cover 2m homes, which puts it behind Telewest and Nynex, both US groups, in size. Bell Cablemedia is, however, the largest UK cable company yet to have floated. Telewest and Comcast pulled flotations planned earlier this year in the face of market weakness. The only flotation to date was of International Cabletel last summer, which raised about Dollars 450m in debt and equity in New York to finance new UK cable ventures. Last autumn it established a Pounds 200m joint venture with South Wales Electricity to build a cable TV and telephone network covering most of urban south Wales. When the Bell Cablemedia grouping took shape earlier this year, in advance of the flotation, it said it was likely to float in both London and New York. The company yesterday blamed logistical difficulties and market conditions for the decision not to float in London, but said it hoped to attempt a London flotation within 12 to 18 months. At least four other cable groups are also hoping for flotations in the next 18 months, but are waiting for a market revival before committing themselves. Some UK investors are cautious about cable prospects in the face of BT's strenuous campaign to end the government ban on its providing entertainment services, imposed in 1991 as an encouragement to cable investment. A House of Commons select committee will report on Wednesday in favour of an easing of the ban, in a move likely to unsettle investor confidence. CORRECTION Bell Cablemedia has secured a listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange, not the New York Stock Exchange as reported in yesterday's FT.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Georgetown, Guyana, 28 Jan, CANA -- Guyana's main  parliamentary opposition group, the People's National Congress  (PNC), has urged the international donor community to withhold  aid to the country unless it agrees to stay clear of the  Marxist/Leninist ideology.    The PNC, in a message aimed at the World Bank-organised  Conference of the Caribbean Group for Economic Co-operation and  Development (CGCED) here, also said further support for the  government would be fruitless unless it was accompanied by good  governance and sound economic policies.    The party says the donor community must insist that the  Cheddi Jagan administration formulate, publish and table in  Parliament a policy paper committing itself unreservedly to a  free and open society and a market-oriented economy.    "They should require of the government a firm undertaking to  eschew Marxist/Leninist ideological considerations in the  determination of economic reforms," the PNC said.    About 70 supporters of the party, including several former  top government ministers, picketed the opening of the two-day  CGCED and chanted "broken promises" when former U.S. President  Jimmy Carter arrived at the forum.    The umbrella Trades Union Congress (TUC), the Amerindian  People's Association (APA), the Guyana Human Rights Association  and the Guyana Consumers Association also picketed the  conference.    The PNC, in the lengthy statement, accused the government of  spending too much time "bemoaning" the state of the country's  economy, harassing and dismissing black public servants, of  reneging on promises and displaying a lack of enthusiam for free  enterprise and market policies.    The Jagan administration, the opposition party said, has  "dithered with respect to privatisation. After some 15 months  in office, no state-owned enterprise has yet been privatised".    It also accused the government of unnerving businessmen and  investors with unfavourable statements, shown hostility to  private investment, mismanagement, bad faith and corruption.</p>

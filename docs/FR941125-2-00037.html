As one of the proposals selected under Round I of the Clean Coal Technology Program, the Cogeneration Project would demonstrate the applicability of atmospheric circulating fluidized bed combustion and cogeneration technology at a utility scale. This technology, when compared to conventional coal burning technologies, would result in a cost effective reduction in emissions of sulfur, oxides of nitrogen, and particles from a nominal 250&hyph;MWe (227 MWe net) coal-fired power plant. The proposed action is the cost-shared Federal funding of the project by the Department of approximately $75 million (about 20 percent of the total cost of approximately $350 million). The industrial partner for this proposed project is York County Energy Partners, L.P., a project company of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. The proposed project would be a cogeneration facility, supplying steam to be purchased by  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> P.H. Glatfelter Company, and electricity that would be purchased by Metropolitan Edison Company. As a result of the purchase of steam, P.H. Glatfelter Company's No. 4 power boiler would be placed on hot-standby status and operated up to 720 hours per year in parallel with the proposed project. This would result in a net reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide and particles within York County, Pennsylvania. In addition, emission reduction credits for oxides of nitrogen emissions would be transferred, in part, from the No. 4 power boiler to the proposed project in order to generate the 1.15 to 1 offsets required by law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Draft Statement assesses the environmental impacts of the atmospheric circulating fluidized bed combustion and cogeneration technology at a large utility scale and setting. The technologies to be demonstrated include a Foster Wheeler 2,500 MMBtu/hr single-train atmospheric circulating fluidized bed boiler, incorporating selective non-catalytic reduction for reducing emissions of oxides of nitrogen, limestone injection for reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide, and fine particle filters for reducing particulate emissions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department invites comments on the Draft Statement from all interested parties.

The proposed project was selected by the Department for negotiation of a Cooperative Agreement for Federal assistance under the Clean Coal Technology Program. Following a 24-month demonstration period anticipated to conclude in December, 1999, the facility would enter into commercial operation for a period of approximately 23 years. The proposed project would be located in North Codorus Township in York County, Pennsylvania, approximately 6 miles southwest of York, Pennsylvania. The proposed project would be built on property currently owned by P.H. Glatfelter Company, which would purchase approximately 400,000 lbs/hr of steam for industrial use from the proposed cogeneration project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In December 1985, Congress allocated funds to the Department for conducting the first round of the cost-shared Clean Coal Technology Program. On  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 17, 1986, the Department issued a Program Opportunity Notice soliciting proposals to conduct cost-shared projects to demonstrate innovative, energy efficient, economically competitive coal-based technologies that had potential for commercialization in the 1990s. In response to the solicitation, 51 proposals were received. From these proposals, nine projects were selected by the Department in July of 1986 for negotiation, and a list of alternate candidates was established in the event that one or more of the initial nine projects did not proceed. In June of 1989, the Arvah B. Hopkins Circulating Fluidized Bed Repowering Project, proposed by the City of Tallahassee, Florida, was selected from the alternate list. As originally envisioned, this project would have repowered one of the City of Tallahassee's municipally-owned natural gas boilers with atmospheric circulating fluidized bed combustion technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

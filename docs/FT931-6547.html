			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Letter: Government must play part in boosting industry Sir, We shall do nothing for Britain's vital export trade if we continue to talk in terms of problems rather than solutions in the manner of your articles 'Industry's unstoppable slide' (February 19) and 'Charting the mechanics of decline' (February 22). No one disputes that the UK has an unacceptable trade deficit. Britain needs to capture an extra 1 per cent of world trade in manufactured goods and increase exports by at least Pounds 12bn a year to balance the books. But to suggest, as you do, that the prime minister may be disappointed in looking to industry for an export-led recovery is rather like shrugging your shoulders and saying nothing can be done. A more positive approach is needed. The CBI's National Manufacturing Council is carrying out an examination of those sectors of industry which have a trade imbalance, especially those in which the deficit is increasing, with a view to finding ways of reversing the trend. In addition, we are studying 11,000 categories of imports to establish why such products are bought in from overseas rather than being produced in the UK. The CBI is also seeking improvements in the UK's inadequate education system and weak transport infrastructure, to overcome their adverse effects on our industrial performance. Improved international competitiveness is the only real solution to capturing a greater share of world markets, recognising, as we must, that 96 per cent of market potential is outside the UK. One solution to Britain's inadequate performance is to raise the standards of many average UK companies to world-class levels. The NMC is seeking to do this by spreading best practice, and attracting the best people into industry to make this happen. World-class performance depends on world-class talent. However, the government also has a role to play and we will be looking to the forthcoming Budget for evidence that the government recognises the need to encourage investment and exports to provide the basis for a sustained recovery.

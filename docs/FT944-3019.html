			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Cashing in the Kwanzaa way A new breed of December shopper is hitting shops in the US, searching for gifts and cards for Kwanzaa, as opposed to Christmas or Hanukkah. The popularity of Kwanzaa, created in 1966 by pan-African studies professor Ron Karenga as a black American alternative to Christmas, has snowballed in recent years. Kwanzaa, which means 'harvest' in Swahili, is a seven-day celebration that includes fasting, family dinners, candle-lighting ceremonies and group discussion on topics such as unity and co-operative economics. About 5m Americans now celebrate the holiday, which begins on December 26. Retailers have started to cater specifically to Kwanzaa shoppers. Book stores do a brisk business in Kwanzaa publications. Because the holiday is relatively new, many participants are still unsure of the traditions, so books explaining Kwanzaa customs are popular. Kwanzaa cards are also in demand. The greeting card maker Hallmark, for instance, retails 16 versions of cards for the holiday. 'It's a growing market, especially in urban centres,' says Rashena Lindsay, marketing co-ordinator for the group. 'We may offer a new line of Kwanzaa gift bags and wrapping paper next year.' A number of stores sell Kwanzaa decorations and ceremonial items, such as seven-place candelabras - participants light one candle each day. Flower shops, which once carried decorative corn husks and gourds only for the American Thanksgiving Day holiday, now offer them in December. But Kwanzaa gifts are tricky to pitch. The holiday is supposed to reject the commercialism of Christmas, and Kwanzaa presents were meant to be simple, homespun items such as candles. However, stores say that an increasing number of shoppers are looking for Kwanzaa presents. The chain store Learningsmith, for instance, says its African stone game is a best-seller during the holidays. 'We get quite a few people looking for Kwanzaa presents,' says Ellie Hendrie, who runs the Vilunya Folk Art store in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 'They buy things like baskets, jewellery, blankets, anything that comes from Africa.' The success of Kwanzaa is an enigma to some, who thought a holiday promoting group discussions on abstract subjects would not become popular. But many black Americans are looking to African themes to cultivate a sense of pride in their heritage. And Kwanzaa has become more flexible with the years. Some Americans have started to bend the strict gift-giving rules. The result may not be the anti-commercial alternative to Christmas that the holiday's founders had in mind, but for the retail market it is a lucrative bonus.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 8 KYODO -- Japan and Russia reaffirmed  Wednesday [8 June] cooperation in developing bilateral relations  and continued negotiations for a settlement of the long-standing  territorial dispute, Japanese officials said.    The agreement was reached in a meeting between Nobuo  Matsunaga, Japanese Government representative for external  affairs, and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, the  officials said.    Matsunaga and Kozyrev are in Paris to attend a ministerial  meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD).    The officials said Matsunaga and Kozyrev also agreed the  countries will coordinate efforts to solve a crisis arising from  suspected nuclear weapons development by North Korea.    Matsunaga told Kozyrev that political and economic dialogue  has progressed since Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited  Japan last October.    He stressed the need for further development of bilateral  relations under the Tokyo declarations issued during Yeltsin's  visit, including negotiations for a settlement of the  territorial dispute in accordance with law and justice, the  officials said.    Kozyrev agreed with Matsunaga's view and expressed hope that  Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will visit Russia.    Matsunaga withheld an immediate response, the officials  said.</p>

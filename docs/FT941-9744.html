			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Keep track of your trips home - Expatriates Every expatriate knows that the length and frequency of visits to Britain can affect residence status and, as a result, exposure to UK tax. Often, though, the certainty ends there. Few can pick their way unerringly through the complications of the 'six months' rule,' the 'three months' average rule' and the '62-day rule'. The problems start as soon as you leave the UK. For tax purposes, you can be treated as not resident and not ordinarily resident from the day after your departure, whether for employment or emigration. If for employment, both your absence and the job must extend beyond a complete tax year (until April 6 1995, at least, if you were leaving now). If for emigration, you need to produce evidence of having left permanently  - say, by acquiring a permanent home in your new country of residence. Most importantly though, a ruling that you are non-resident depends on subsequent visits to the UK not exceeding either 182 days in a tax year, or 90 days a year on average. A great deal can hang on this because, if you are resident and ordinarily resident in the UK, you can be taxed on world-wide income and gains. But not resident/not ordinarily resident status limits your exposure to UK source income (even some of that escapes the charge), while only capital gains derived from selling assets used in a British business remain taxable. Even when non-resident status is achieved, you cannot afford to relax. Visits to the UK totalling more than 182 days in a tax year will make you resident for that year. Visits exceeding 90 days a year, on a rolling four-yearly average, will make you ordinarily resident from the fifth year - indeed, they will make you ordinarily resident from the start if you plan to make them. And, once you are ordinarily resident, a visit of just one day will make you resident for the year. In practice, full-time workers are unlikely to be able to exceed these limits in any event, but they must be kept in mind by retired emigrants, non-working spouses and those between jobs. For them, though, keeping non-resident status has been made easier by the abolition from 1993/94 of the 'available accommodation' rule which meant you were treated as resident in any year you visited the UK if you maintained accommodation there for your use. But this did not apply if you were employed full-time overseas or had a business abroad. (These rules are concerned only with visits to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and the three-mile territorial limit surrounding them. If you are on an oil platform or other installation within that limit, you are treated as being in the UK. But this is not the case with installations in 'designated areas' of the continental shelf outside the limit, even though your salary will be deemed to arise in the UK.) The manner in which visits should be counted was determined by a 1951 case (Wilkie v. CIR) which concluded that total elapsed time - not just days but hours, too - must be taken into account. But since this would have caused the Inland Revenue big administrative problems, it adopted a standard procedure which ignores days of arrival and departure - subject, of course, to your right to insist on the strict legal treatment if that works to your advantage. Applying the standard procedure has the strange effect that, if you arrive in the UK one day and depart the next, you are treated as not having been there at all. Some other periods spent in the UK also can be ignored. After Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, the Revenue announced in March 1991 that periods spent in Britain because of exceptional circumstances beyond an individual's control - such as illness - could be ignored, but only for the purpose of the 90-day average calculation. It is not only non-residents who need to count their visits. So also must short-term overseas employees who do not become non-resident. Their salaries are excluded from UK tax liability if their work is carried out in the course of a qualifying period exceeding 365 days, regardless of whether that involves a complete tax year. For this purpose, 'qualifying period' covers days spent outside the UK, together with intervening days spent in Britain provided that these do not exceed either 62 consecutive days or one-sixth of the days in the period. (For seafarers, these limits are extended to 183 consecutive days, or one-half of the days in the period, respectively). In this case, the legislation sidesteps the problems of Wilkie v. CIR. The question of whether you are regarded as present in the UK for a day is determined by where you are at the end of it. Even though there is no chance of your carriage turning into a pumpkin, there could be times when you are just as anxious as Cinderella to leave by midnight. Donald Elkin is a director of Wilfred T.

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not yet last of a line Sir, I would question the statement in your news item 'End of the line' (August 27) about the last button A and B pay phone being in the Shetland Isles. During a sailing holiday to the Small Isles in the Inner Hebrides my husband and I visited the island of Soay off the south coast of Skye. There, on August 1 1994, we saw a telephone box with buttons A and B and powered by solar panels. I suspect it is still there. Florence Gilkes, Creran Cottage, Eriska road, Ledaig, Oban, Argyll</p>

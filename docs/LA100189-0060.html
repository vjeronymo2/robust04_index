			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRUISE VIEWS: NOT REALLY SHIPS BUT FANTASY ISLANDS  </P> <P> Don't be surprised if tomorrow's cruise ships look more like adult amusement  parks than ocean liners.  </P> <P> According to Joe Farcus, a Miami-based architect for Carnival Cruise Lines, his  design for Fantasy -- the first of three mega-ships being built by Wartsila  Marine shipyards in Finland -- is intended to make it an "entertainment  facility (with) an environment different from anything they (passengers)  experience in their normal life."  </P> <P> For example, aboard the Fantasy, Farcus is creating a bar called Cats, inspired  by the set from the hit theatrical musical. Patrons will enter through a round  doorway that looks like a gigantic overturned evaporated milk can, then sit on  banquette seats resembling old rubber tires or soda-pop cans.  </P> <P> Another shipboard bar, Cleopatra's, will give passengers the chance to puzzle  over hieroglyphics on Egyptian temple columns while surrounded by mummy cases  and statues of Egyptian gods and Pharaohs.  </P> <P> Or you can check out some reading material by going through a door flanked by  two granite lions (but made from a granite-resin compound) like those in front  of the New York Public Library.  </P> <P> The ship will be ready for its first cruise in early January, sailing on three-  and four-day itineraries to the Bahamas out of Miami. Carrying 2,600  passengers, the 70,000-ton Fantasy will be second in size to Royal Caribbean  Cruise Line's Sovereign of the Seas, the largest cruise ship ever built.  </P> <P> While Farcus concentrates on the inside of the ship, Kai Levander and his  design development team at Wartsila have been devising revolutionary ideas for  ship shapes for almost a decade. Their Windcruiser concept for a computerized  sailing ship, for example, was the prototype for the Windstar Sail Cruises  vessels and the upcoming Club Med I.  </P> <P> "There is more and more interest in providing a ship that sticks out of the  crowd," Levander said. He visualizes a multiple-appeal ship carrying 3,000  people that will offer, among other things: sporting events for participants  and spectators; full-scale stage shows with well-known stars; large marinas for  water sports; a multitude of restaurants; windows and private balconies for all  cabins, and a full range of shops comparable to a major shopping mall. The ship  itself would be the traveler's destination.  </P> <P> Some of Levander's concept sketches show floating 10-story resort hotels,  self-contained islands in themselves, with huge swimming pools surrounded by  palm trees and fountains thrust out on all four sides of the ship, or vast  apartment towers that would look at home in Manhattan.  </P> <P> On the Fantasy, Farcus is working with colored light in the largest single  installation of neon in the world -- 12 miles of red, blue and green tubing,  most of it concealed behind diffuser panels. Computers will control color  changes.  </P> <P> "You won't be able to just sit and watch it happen," he said, "because the  color changes are subtle. One evening during dinner the dining room may be red,  another evening, blue."  </P> <P> Lights will also help create a sense of motion along the double-width walkway  called Century Boulevard, which stretches 450 feet past the casino, cafe, bars  and shops.  </P> <P> Stationary trams along the roadway are seats that will resemble "futuristic  cars floating on the road," with floor-mounted strobe lights that make them  look as if they're moving.  </P> <P> Not far away, the disco, called Electricity, will be vivid with dazzling neon  streaks and strobe lights bouncing off a glass dance floor with copper strips  and shiny gray tile floors.  </P> <P> Passengers seeking quiet can retreat to the nearby Majestic Bar, a "subdued and  highly elegant" area, according to Farcus, with its own pianist playing  before-dinner melodies.  </P> <P> The heart of the ship is a six-deck atrium called the Grand Spectrum, a vast  open space that will twinkle with Tivoli lights, ever-changing colored light  and two glass elevators.  </P> <P> Also reflecting new trends in ship amenities is the 12,000-square-foot Nautica  spa, with gymnasium, sauna, steam rooms, beauty salon, aerobics and massage  rooms.  </P> <P> Between shows on the quick-change, state-of-the-art stage in the main lounge,  mirrored walls and ceiling will slide into place to create a romantic dance  floor sparkling with tiny lights.  </P> <P> Farcus said he has made no special design concessions for the three- and  four-day Fantasy cruises. Still, the frenetic sense of brightness and motion in  the public rooms would seem more appropriate to short-term sailings than long  cruises.  </P> <P> Prices will range from $475 to $1,125 per person, double occupancy, including  round-trip air fare from most U.S. cities. Ports of call for the four-day  cruises are Freeport and Nassau; only Nassau will be visited on the three-day  sailing.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, May 28 (AFP) -- UN envoy Yasushi Akashi has  invited the warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina to negotiate a  comprehensive cessation of hostilities at a meeting in Geneva  next week, the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] announced Saturday  [28 May]. The co-chairmen of the peace conference on the former  Yugoslavia, Lord Owen of the European Union and Thorvald  Stoltenberg of the United Nations, as well as U.S. special envoy  Charles Redman and his Russian counterpart Vitaliy Churkin, were  also invited, an UNPROFOR statement said. Akashi will be  accompanied at the Geneva meeting, to be held Thursday and  Friday [2-3 June], by UNPROFOR commander for ex-Yugoslavia  Lieutenant-General Bertrand de Lapresle, and the UNPROFOR  commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Lieutenant-General Sir Michael  Rose, the statement added.    Akashi, in letters sent to Bosnian President Alija  Izetbegovic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic on Friday,  "drew attention to the presidential statement adopted by the UN  Security Council on 25 May 1994 in which the Council reaffirmed  the urgent need for a comprehensive cessation of hostilities  throughout the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and  Herzegovina."    Next week's meeting aims to build on Akashi's May 21  initiative "putting forward a framework for an immediate  cessation of hostilities between the parties, including  provision for the disengagement of forces and the  interpositioning of UNPROFOR troops between the forces."    The announcement comes after France hosted two-day talks  between the so-called contact group on Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the  European Union, Russia and the United States -- and Bosnian  Croats, Moslems and Serbs Wednesday and Thursday in the Alpine  hideaway of Talloires, not far from Geneva. The session reached  no apparent agreement, but another round was scheduled in the  French resort town on June 6 and 7. The contact group  negotiators tried in vain to get the factions to agree to a  four-month ceasefire and to accept a European plan for partition  that would give 51 percent of territory to a Croat-Moslem  federation and 49 percent to the Serbs.</p>

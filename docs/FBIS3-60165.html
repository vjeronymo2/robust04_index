The clandestine group made the announcement in a letter to  Hermilda Gaviria de Escobar, mother of the late drug trafficker  Pablo Escobar, in which it reported that, contrary to the  intentions of the Escobar family to sign a peace agreement,  remnants of the Medellin Cartel are not thinking of peace.    "You and the criminal organization of your late son know of  our capacity. Our objective is to stop the appearance of new  Machiavellian individuals like Pablo Escobar," the Pepes noted.  It added that "your intention is not shared by the remaining  Medellin Cartel members. This is an aspect that worries us  because it would turn us into victims, a situation that we will  not accept under any circumstances."</p>

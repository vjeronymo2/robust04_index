			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REVIEW OF AUSTRALIA'S RATING FUELS ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY  </P> <P> The Australian government is coming under fire from the financial community and  voters unhappy with an economic policy they fear has gone badly awry.  </P> <P> An announcement Friday by the credit agency Moody's that it might downgrade  Australia's rating because of concerns about its huge debt load and continuing  trade deficits could not come at a worse time for the Labor government.  </P> <P> Mortgage interest rates of 17%, a direct result of a year-long monetary squeeze  by Treasurer Paul Keating, have alienated thousands of voters and propelled the  new-look opposition coalition to a healthy lead in the opinion polls.  </P> <P> A series of poor economic figures, which has led to a sharp fall in the  Australian dollar, is likely to continue the downslide Wednesday when figures  outlining the country's debt problem are released.  </P> <P> Analysts expect net foreign debt to rise to more than $75 billion for the first  time -- equal to $4,700 for every Australian or about 31% of the value of gross  domestic product.  </P> <P> "A . . . concern is the high and growing level of foreign-currency debt which  makes the country vulnerable to interest rate and exchange rate movements,"  Moody's said in a statement saying it was considering a possible downgrading of  Australia's Aa1 rating, the second highest granted.  </P> <P> The Moody's announcement lopped another 1.5 cents off the value of the dollar  in about 90 minutes. The currency, quoted at 74.3 cents over the weekend, will  come under pressure when Asian markets open today, dealers said.  </P> <P> Moody's is reviewing about $30 billion of government debt. A downgrading would  increase the government's costs of borrowing.  </P></p>

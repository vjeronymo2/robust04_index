			<p>BFN     [Text] Al-Fujayrah, United Arab Emirates, April 2 (AFP) --  The Gulf emirate of al-Fujayrah called Saturday [2 April] for  international help to fight an oil slick which has hit 30  kilometers (18 miles) of coastline, killing fish and turtles.    Al-Fujayrah officials said Saturday that 15,900 tonnes of  oil  -- more than twice the initial estimates -- spilled from the  supertanker Seki after it collided with the tanker Baynunah in  the Gulf of Oman on Wednesday.    International "help is now required to prevent a major  disaster to the area's beaches and marine life," a al-Fujayrah  government spokesman said.    "Large quantities of oil have come ashore on the beaches  between Lu'lu'iyah and Ras Qadnah, accompanied by dead fish,  turtles and other forms of marine life," he said, adding that  scientists had been sent to investigate the damage.    Salvage teams from several oil and shipping companies were  so  far working with the UAE coast guard.    Al-Fujayrah port officials said Hugh Parker, a pollution  expert from the London-based International Tanker Owners'  Pollution Federation, had arrived in the emirate and started  helicopter flights over the spillage.    The anti-pollution firm Fairdeal deployed three skimmers to  tackle the slick, and operators said later they had collected  more than 1,500 tonnes (10,950 barrels) of oil.    Each of the skimmers can collect 20 tonnes (146 barrels) of  crude every 30 minutes and salvage experts said more than three  days would be needed to clear up the slick.    "We are focusing on the beach area to prevent pollution, but  the problem is that the wind is variable and the crude is  spreading," Fairdeal general manager Captain Michael Sarros said.    "So far there is no threat to the desalination plants or the  nearby Omani coast. But we cannot speculate on the consequences  right now," he said, adding that the spillage covered around  eight square kilometres (3.2 square miles).    Captain Musa Murad of al-Fujayrah port told AFP that the  slick covered the stretch of coast north of Khawr Fakkan.    "It's a catastrophe. Thirty kilometres of coastline have  been hit by the oil slick," he said.    The al-Fujayrah spokesman said that according to Seki  officials around 15,900 tonnes of oil was spilled into the sea,  but the spillage from the ruptured tank had stopped Saturday.    First reports said around 7,000 tonnes had leaked.    "Our initial hopes of containing the spill were dashed when  weather conditions altered during the early hours of Friday  morning moving the slick directly to our shores," he said.    The 56,300-tonne Baynunah, built in South Korea, joined the  Abu Dhabi National Tanker Company (ADNATCO) in 1983.    ADNATCO said the tanker was about to head for Kuwait to pick  a shipment of crude for Japan when it collided with the  282,000-tonne Panama-registered Seki some 10 nautical miles (17  kilometres) off al-Fujairah.    Port officials in al-Fujayrah daily handle up to 50 tankers  arriving to load up with fuel by ship-to-ship transfers.    The last accident at the port occurred in 1986 when a tanker  hit a mine during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.    In another accident, a fire-gutted supertanker barred from  port for two weeks will be allowed to dock in the Gulf after it  has unloaded its oil in the next few days, an official with the  firm towing the tanker said Friday.    The Greek-owned Stolidi, carrying the charred bodies of 18  Filipinos killed in a March 20 fire, will transfer its 225,000  tonnes of oil to another ship, an International Marine Services  official said.    "The Stolidi is now in Gulf waters and unloading operations  may start in two or three days about five to 10 nautical miles  off the coast of Dubai or Sharjah" in the United Arab Emirates,  he said.</p>

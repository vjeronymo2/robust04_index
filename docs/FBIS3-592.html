Central Committee spokesman T C Memela said the  pre-conditions were those outlined by the IFP last Friday, which  included: international mediation in the constitutional  deadlock; amending the interim constitution; and, mediation to  allow Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini to secure the interests of  his nation.    The Central Coomittee also wanted a rationalisation of the  electoral process and timetables to translate constitutional  agreements into a fair and free election in which all parties  could compete on an equal footing.    Mr Memela also said the ball was now in State President F W  de Klerk's court to extend the deadlines for registration of  parties and submission of candidate lists because he was  empowered to do so in terms of the electoral act.    He said the Central Committee wanted international  mediation to take place to assist in the resolution of  constitutional differences and the process of amending the  interim constitution. Mediation should also focus on whatever  steps King Zwelithini decided to take to secure the interests of  the Zulu kingdom.    Mr Memela said mediation was necessary on the question of  conflict resolution and investigation into criminal violence.  The Central Committee, he said, reconfirmed its commitment to  pursue the international mediation process with "resolution and  urgency".    Wednesday night's decision by the IFP is a reaffirmation of  its stance adopted ast week after a summit between the party's  leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and African National Congress  President Nelson Mandela in Durban.    There the IFP said it would provisionally register for the  April elections, and participation in the poll would be subject  to the success of talks in meeting its pre-conditions.</p>

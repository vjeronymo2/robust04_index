			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Bonds: EIB DM1bn offering starts firmly in nervous trading Eurobond dealers had another frustrating day, with only a handful of issues dribbling into the market amid volatile trading in European and US government bonds. After the recent heavy flow of floating-rate notes, a handful of borrowers brave enough to issue fixed-rate bonds saw their efforts thwarted by a further tumble in underlying bond markets. Amid current nervousness, traders expect issuer and investor-activity to remain thin ahead of the Easter break. 'We're seeing zippo client flows of real consequence or depth in this environment,' said a London syndicate manager. The European Investment Bank issued DM1bn of 6.5 per cent 10-year bonds which started out on a strong footing, supported by early strength in the German government bond market. 'We launched it 10 minutes after the M3 (money supply) numbers - which were slightly better than expected - and placed a lot of paper quickly,' said an official at lead manager Deutsche Bank. However, when government bonds fell in the afternoon, the EIB bonds slipped in line with bunds. Their spread over the benchmark 10-year Treuhand bond, however, tightened by one basis point to 14 basis points, the lead manager said. 'This shows the deal is in good shape,' said a dealer at another house. Meanwhile, Germany's triple-A rated reconstruction agency, Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, issued L200bn of 8 3/8 per cent five-year bonds via Deutsche Bank in London. Despite the Italian government bond market's turbulence, the lead manager reported a solid syndicate and investor response. The bonds closed at around 98.90 bid, just outside fees. At the initial offer price of 98.95, where they yield 8.64 per cent, the bonds pay a juicy yield pick-up over comparable lira paper: Bayerische Landesbank's 7.5 per cent bonds due 1999 yield 8.42 per cent, while the EIB's 7.45 per cent bonds due 1999 yield 8.01 per cent, the Deutsche Bank official said. In the Ecu market, General Electric Capital Corporation launched Ecu100m of 6 1/8 per cent five-year bonds. The deal, jointly led by Credit Commercial de France and Merrill Lynch, was targetted mainly at Swiss and Benelux retail investors. Standard &amp; Poor's ratings agency affirmed its triple-A ratings on the long-term senior debt of France Telecom and British Telecommunications (BT). It also affirmed its A-1 ratings on both of these issuers' short-term debt. However, it said the long-term rating outlooks for both are changed to negative from stable as momentum builds to foster competition in the European telecommunications market.</p>

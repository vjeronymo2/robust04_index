			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Profits for the thundering herd: Merrill Lynch's efforts to shake off its wire-house image Merrill Lynch has an identity problem, although it may not seem a particularly pressing issue for a company that has just reported record profits of Dollars 696m (Pounds 384m) for 1991. Merrill has long been known as the king of the US wire houses, the Wall Street firms whose armies of brokers send by wire their customers' stock orders to the markets in New York. In recent years, however, the company has changed shape, a process which accelerated at the end of the 1980s as excessive costs and unfavourable market conditions led to losses and a rapid restructuring. Merrill, known as the 'thundering herd' on Wall Street, has emerged a hybrid, a one-stop financial services giant with a large presence in retail stockbroking, wholesale capital markets, institutional investment banking and asset management. The company, therefore, dislikes being categorised as merely a retail stockbroker. 'We are always fighting our wire-house image,' says chief executive Mr William Schreyer. Merrill's strength as a wire house helped fuel last year's record earnings. Lower interest rates attracted investors to equities and lured companies into issuing billions of dollars of bonds and stocks. Merrill, the largest stockbroker and underwriter of debt and equity, reaped the benefits. Merrill's wire-house strength also encouraged big growth in its asset management business, as the company's network of brokers persuaded stockbroking clients to hand their assets over to Merrill for management. Mr Daniel Tully, Merrill's president, explained how the company forged new skills from old strengths: 'We stopped asking, 'what do we have to sell?' and instead asked, 'what do our clients want to buy?'' As a result Merrill now manages Dollars 435bn of client funds, making it the largest custodian of individual assets in the US. Although expansion of the asset management business has been part of a plan to smooth the earnings stream by bolstering fee-based revenues, stockbroking remains the most important source of revenue. Taking a 10-year view, the percentage of operating revenues accounted for by commissions has fallen sharply. In 1981 it was 42 per cent while last year it was down to 32 per cent. Although earnings from principal transactions and investment banking grew during the decade, the biggest difference was in the amount Merrill made from looking after investors' money. At the start of the 1980s, fees from asset management and custodial business were so small they did not get a mention in the annual report. Ten years later, they make up 12 per cent of operating revenues, bringing in income of Dollars 774m in 1991. Estimates put Merrill's 'recurring revenue' at between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of earnings. Yet Mr John Keefe, a brokerage analyst at Lipper Analytical, argues that Merrill is still a hostage to market cycles. The difference between a good quarter and a bad quarter remains considerable  -for example, Dollars 372m between the fourth quarter of 1990 and the second quarter of 1991. Of that gap, Mr Keefe says about Dollars 60m was accounted for by repeat revenues, while the remainder originated from trading, banking and broking commissions. If Merrill is still largely a wire house, it is at least a slimmer wire house. During the 1980s Merrill over-expanded, and by the latter half of the decade the company was overmanned and its staff overpaid. In 1989 the management adopted what Mr Schreyer terms a 'lean and tough-minded' approach to cost management. Merrill took a charge, layers of management were eliminated, unprofitable lines of business were sold, and the workforce reduced from 47,000 to 38,000. 'In two years we took Dollars 400m out of our basic cost structure,' boasted Mr Schreyer. The effect on profitability was dramatic. In 1990, Merrill's return on equity was 6 per cent. By the end of 1991 it had risen to more than 20 per cent. However, Merrill still has weaknesses. In investment banking the company is the biggest stock and bond underwriter, but it dominates the less profitable, bulk end of the business. Its lack of an extensive network of established corporate contacts means Merrill has less of a presence in the businesses that pay higher fees, such as initial public offerings, and in the high-margin world of mergers and acquisitions. In 1991 it ranked fourth in the league table of top Wall Street M&amp;A advisers. A key problem is that in the eyes of many big US corporations, Merrill is still regarded as a retail broker lacking the wholesale investment banking experience and institutional reach of Morgan Stanley or First Boston. Hence Merrill's uneasiness with the 'wire house' tag. Mr Schreyer acknowledges the weaknesses, and says more time is needed to build up M&amp;A. However, Merrill will not chase market share for the sake of becoming number one. 'We have learned that you don't have to win all 10 events to win the decathlon,' he said. In spite of the turnaround in returns, the tighter controls on costs, and the record earnings, perceptions about the quality of the company's management have been slower to change. Mr Schreyer and his number two, Mr Tully, have endured criticism, mostly about the rise in costs during the 1980s. In 1989, with Merrill knee-deep in red ink, such criticisms seemed valid. Today, however, Wall Street sings a different tune about the Schreyer-Tully partnership. Mr James Hanbury, analyst at Wertheim Schroder, says: 'Yes, they were responsible for the blow-up of expenses and the disastrous results in the 1980s, but they're still there. You give them the blame for the crummy results, and the credit for the good ones.' What of the future? 'We are the only firm in the world that does not have to compete with Merrill Lynch,' says Mr Schreyer. His partner thinks there is room for expansion in the fee-based business, thanks to the greying of America and the demands of newly middle-aged baby boomers. The company, however, still makes more money from stockbroking than from any other business. Given this reliance on market-related earnings, whether it can thrive during a prolonged market slump will be the real measure of the new Merrill.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          MERRILL LYNCH  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Breakdown of operating revenues &amp; expenses (Dollars million)                                  1986   1987   1988   1989   1990   1991 Commissions                     2,199  2,388  1,587  1,773  1,699  2,137 Principal transactions          1,091    728  1,491  1,237  1,441  1,893 Investment banking                981    996  1,196  1,095    795  1,175 Asset management &amp;       custodial fees              413    455    506    561    511    774 Non-interest expenses           5,092  5,661  5,486  6,394  5,504  6,239  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

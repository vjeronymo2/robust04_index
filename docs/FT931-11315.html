			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Damages against 3M total Dollars 29.9m Fairhaven International yesterday announced the final verdict of the court judgment between its 36 per cent-owned Nishika Group and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company. Fairhaven, a specialist within the oil, gas and petrochemical construction industries, was seeking damages from 3M after it changed the emulsion formula of its 3-D print material, causing Nishika 3-D photographs to fade and lose colour. The value of the final judgment against 3M is Dollars 29.9m (Pounds 19.8m), which includes the initial award of Dollars 25.5m made on December 31 for damages plus pre-judgment interest. 3M may appeal against the judgment but will have to pay interest of 10 per cent on the full Dollars 29.9m until it is settled.</p>

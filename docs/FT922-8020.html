			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / A cartoon Community The relationship between the European Commission's president Jacques Delors and the British government is like a Tom and Jerry cartoon. Tom, the cat, will stop at nothing in his efforts to swallow Jerry the mouse. Traps are set. Dynamite is fused and lit. Anvils are dropped. There are hair-raising moments, and sometimes a trick or two is won by Tom, but in the end Jerry always skips away free. That is what happened at Maastricht in December. The draft treaties on European political and monetary union gave the Commission powers to make policy and issue directives in most areas of government. Brussels proposed to use the European parliament to impose direct taxes, and even to rule in matters of foreign policy and defence. Every paragraph contained a pratfall for believers in a Europe des patries. The actual treaty, to be presented to the Commons next week, maintains the EC as a congeries of states. Its policies are determined by negotiations between member governments. Some - perhaps too many - involve majority voting, but the nature of the association is such that consensus is usually sought. Tom would dearly love the EC to be a superstate, but it is not; nor is it inevitable that it will become one. The dwindling band of Thatcherite nationalists disagrees. So does Mrs Thatcher herself. Her few remaining acolytes in the lower house will vote against the treaty, but since Labour plans to abstain that is of merely symbolic importance. What matters now is the next stage of the argument. For in spite of his recent equivocations in advance of the Danish referendum on Maastricht, Mr Delors remains a sincere believer in a united states of Europe. The Commission may have been frustrated in December, but it will be back. It never gives up. There are two possible strategies that might ensure that it continues to lose. One is defence, the other is attack. The first is favoured by the British government, as Mr Douglas Hurd indicated a fortnight ago. In his Guildhall speech, he urged the EC to wait until the agreed date of 1996 before reviewing the Maastricht deal. The foreign secretary could not resist a dig at Mr Delors' dream of a strong single executive, a council of ministers working by majority voting and a strong single parliament - in short a powerful government of a centrally-managed superstate. 'I believe that concept is now looking somewhat old-fashioned,' said Mr Hurd. Echoing his boss, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the junior minister for Europe, said in Bonn yesterday that 'Britain stands firmly by the Maastricht treaty'. It is not difficult to see why. Mr Garel-Jones stressed every clause that strengthens the powers of national governments rather than the Commission. Foreign and security policy will be dealt with by a separate mechanism, as will cross-border policing. National parliaments could take the opportunity to scrutinise Commission proposals before they are debated in the Council of Ministers. He hoped that 'on the analogy of the US Supreme Court, the European Court will give increasing emphasis to the rights of member states'. This could be easier now that the principle of subsidiarity is 'enshrined' in community law. We could call this aggressive defence. Attack might be better. One strategy is suggested by Mr Frank Vibert in a paper published by the European Policy Forum*. He proposes that commissioners should be limited to two five-year terms; that national parliaments should be able to propose EC legislation; that the Commission itself should be 'unbundled', thus separating its administrative, judicial and regulatory functions; and that the EC should recognise that not all member states will always want to participate in all areas of policy. He speaks of extending the European Union 'on the basis of 'non-coercive' techniques for joint action'. The precise details are of less immediate moment than the question of whether Britain should thus attack Brussels expansionism. Re-opening Maastricht before 1996 would be a nightmare; sending out signals of the Vibert kind might dissuade the Commission from making any such attempt. Britain is in a strong position in the EC this year. The French and German governments are in temporary difficulties. There will be plenty of miniature 'Euro-rows' - over border controls, for example, or social policy - but Mr Major's stance, at the 'heart of Europe' is convincing. The British presidency, which begins in a few weeks' time, will take further the debates on enlargement and the Community budget. The single market has yet to be completed. The Common Agricultural Policy needs restructuring. It is tempting to regard this full agenda as a protection against the introduction of further structural ideas before 1996. Perhaps it is. Yet the best defence is counter-attack, as when Jerry ties the cracker on Tom's tail. Remember? *20 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9AA</p>

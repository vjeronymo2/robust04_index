			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures came under heavy pressure, responding to selling by US investment banks. After opening at 3,015 and moving ahead to 3,024 in quiet trading, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 faltered as one of the big UK investment houses sold 1,000 contracts into the market. The big hit came around midday when one of the writers of over-the-counter tailored options sold the market aggressively. The future plunged through the 3,000-mark, hitting the session low of 2,932 before closing at 2,940.</p>

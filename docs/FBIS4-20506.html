Less money </H5> for research and development does not automatically dictate a  step backward for a company. Consultants of Prognos AG see in  outsourcing a chance to become more successful by way of a  decreasing trend in costs.  <H5>  Michael Eyett is a physicist with a PhD. He was the </H5> technology consultant at the VDI [Association of German  Engineers] Technology Center in Duesseldorf. He has been a  project manager for Prognos AG in Basle since 1991.  <H5>  Jorg Thietke is a chemist with a PhD. He also worked at the </H5> VDI Technology Center in Duesseldorf before he began as a  project manager at Prognos Ag in 1991.    [Hess] German industry spends too little money for research  and development. Do you believe this, Dr. Thietke?    [Thietke] I don't buy that lock, stock and barrel. The  economy spent just under 56 billion marks for research and  development -- R&amp;D for short -- in 1992. This continues to  be a  large amount. However, in contrast to earlier, the competitive  pressure has changed and thus the pressure on the costs for  research and development. Results that can be more quickly  converted are expected today.    [Hess] Consequently, the size of R&amp;D outlays may not be  used  as the only indicator to measure the economic significance of  research.    [Eyett] The effective and efficient acquisition of  technologies for practical use is much more important.    [Hess] Have German companies become too complacent?    [Eyett] We find repeatedly that the greatest source of  inefficiency in the area of research and development is setting  hazy goals. Technology strategies should be matched to the  company strategy. For example, take a sensor manufacturer who  wants to offer his products for sale at the lowest price. The  R&amp;D efforts of this company must consequently concentrate on  shorter turn-around times, a lower reject rate, and higher  reliability. Too great a fixation by R&amp;D on the further  development of product features misses this business strategy.    [Hess] Are you saying that in industry often the wrong thing  is being researched or developed?    [Eyett] In many companies, this is unfortunately correct.    [Hess] Can you be somewhat more specific?    [Eyett] I do not know of any empirical data. I believe,  however, that more than half the companies suffer from the  situation that the R&amp;D department is not working in accord  with  the company goals.    [Hess] Does this mean that even industrial researchers are  sitting in an ivory tower?    [Thietke] I think so. Meanwhile, many companies have  recognized this problem. This is one reason why R&amp;D is being  decentralized more frequently and organized as a profit center.  Such a profit center must finance itself by getting contracts  from the operating sectors.    [Hess] Prognos AG has recently been advocating the  outsourcing of research and development. What do you understand  by this?    [Thietke] On the one hand, a company can do research and  development alone. On the other, it is possible to acquire  technologies under license. However, this only works if a  developed technology is also available on the market. If this is  not so, there is a third option known as outsourcing. This means  getting the technology by awarding R&amp;D contracts to third  parties. Ideally, this allows access to external know-how  permitting a quicker, less expensive and lower risk development  than would have been possible within the company.    In production, outsourcing is already practiced extensively  by shifting component manufacture onto suppliers to an ever  increasing degree. After reducing the manufacturing depth,  optimization of the R&amp;D depth is the next step. Lean research  and development follow lean production.    [Hess] To make progress with the development of a product,  you need an intensive insight into the problems accompanying  this. A company allowing insight into their blueprints opens the  way for industrial espionage.    [Eyett] In those segments that a company counts among its  technological core areas, thus to its main body of knowledge,  the company must of course pay attention that not too much of  the know-how leaves. This is especially the case for know-how  that a company is counting on for its future competitiveness.    [Hess] Consequently, is outsourcing only considered if a  product development is being started from scratch and thus no  know-how can be lost?    [Thietke] That is one area. However, even outside the  technology core areas--if the object is to round out the main  body of knowledge of a company--outsourcing can be worthwhile  from a cost perspective in the core business. If the core area  of a company lies in the development of complex systems,  individual components may be developed somewhere else without  the company having to fear that the contractor will turn around  and work itself up to become a direct competitor.    [Hess] Despite the advantages that you have pointed out,  industry is exploring the path of outsourcing only cautiously.    [Eyett] That is not so. Of the almost 56 billion that German  industry spent for R&amp;D in 1992, six billion flowed to  external  institutes or companies. I can confirm with numbers that  outsourcing in the economy is becoming more popular. In the past  15 years, the total R&amp;D outlay by German industry has  tripled.  However, the outlay for external R&amp;D increased tenfold in the  same time.    [Hess] And how will Prognos AG earn money by outsourcing?    [Eyett] The matter of concern for us is strategic  consulting.  In this framework, we can support our customers in deciding what  they should outsource and what not for reasons of company and  technology strategy. We can also investigate the market to find  out which third-party vendors can be brought on board at a  reasonable cost for research and development projects.    [Hess] Please show us with an example how your outsourcing  approach looks.    [Eyett] Let us take the following case. A company is a  leader  in the market of special optical systems and, with a lower  priority, active in optical components and measuring technology.  For producing the systems, both in-house developed components  such as interference mirrors and coated precision mirrors are  necessary as is sophisticated measuring technology. The decisive  feature, however, is the precise knowledge of the system  properties and of the precision mechanics.    Our analysis showed that here it would be best to turn the  component development over to a supplier, thus to outsource. The  analysis also showed that the capacities of the existing and  absolutely necessary holographic and interferometry measurement  devices could be better exploited by finding contracts from  aerospace companies. Here, we speak of insourcing. The company  could save costs by this optimized mix.    [Hess] Just how good externally developed products are can  be  proven by means of quality control. However, how do you check  the intellectual performance of external researchers?    [Thietke] In the example described, a project close to  development was involved. The quality of this project could be  checked simply because the system vendor continued to have the  optical measuring technology in-house. For outsourcing close to  development, this is more difficult. The basis for the joint  venture can then usually be service contracts. In such cases,  project management and R&amp;D controlling similar to that used  for  internal central departments must be used. Most of such central  departments are run as cost centers.    [Hess] Which branches are particularly suited to R&amp;D  outsourcing?    [Eyett] The stronger a company is in the sector of high  technology, the more R&amp;D outsourcing is used.  Electrotechnology,  electronics and the automotive industry make particularly  extensive use of this potential. In Japan, for example, half the  development cost for a new automobile is borne by the suppliers.  In Europe, on the other hand, the portion provided by suppliers  is less than one third.    [Hess] How is that?    [Eyett] The integration between research institutes and  industry on the one hand and suppliers and consumers on the  other is generally closer in Japan than here. Also, the interest  in achieving a lofty goal together is very pronounced in Japan.  In addition, the companies exert enormous pressure on the  supplier.    [Hess] German industry is currently spending more than 50  billion marks on research and development. How many billion  marks could, in your opinion, be used to better effect if  industry would make consistent use of R&amp;D outsourcing?    [Eyett] That depends greatly on the individual company. For  a  company that previously made no use at all of external  technology sources, the potential for savings in the R&amp;D  area is  more than 20 percent. To estimate this potential savings over  all branches using a non-representative basis of individual  cases would not be reputable. You will not get a number on that  topic from us.</p>

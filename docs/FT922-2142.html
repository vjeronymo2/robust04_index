			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / EC agrees E German shipyard aid deal EC industry ministers last night agreed controversial European Commission proposals to cut capacity in the ailing east German shipbuilding industry by 40 per cent. The deal will be backed by safeguards to prevent the rest of the EC industry being undercut by subsidised east German competitors. The agreement should allow the Treuhand to sell off some yards to private companies. The restructuring programme, which began after German unification, will eventually have cost 25,000 shipbuilding jobs in east Germany. Under the Commission plans, Bonn can provide operating aid up to 36 per cent of the yards' estimated turnover after restructuring. The exact amount of aid will be adjusted for each yard according to a complex formula. Subsidies have to be paid before the end of 1993, in exchange for drastic cuts in capacity by 1995. French, Spanish and Italian ministers had been pressing for capacity cuts of as much as 57 per cent. They held out for assurances that the aid level would be strictly observed and supported by safeguards for their own shipyards, which are subject to a general EC ceiling on production aid of 9 per cent. The future of the east German shipyards is a highly sensitive political issue in Germany. Yesterday's meeting of ministers in Luxembourg was lobbied by shop stewards of the German yards and mayors of ports of the region of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where shipbuilding accounts for 40 per cent of industrial employment. Only yards which opened before October 1990 will be eligible for the subsidies. The Commission plan has to be approved by the European Parliament. The EC decision came as forecasts for early recovery of the East German economy were scaled down. The German government and some economists had predicted a recovery beginning this summer, but the Federation of Berlin and Brandenburg Employers (UVB) said yesterday that reports from companies showed it was still far off. In one of the most sombre assessments yet of east Germany's prospects, Mr Hartmann Kleiner, head of the UVB, said he expected that by next year only 15 per cent of nearly 4m industrial workers in east Germany in 1990 would still have jobs.</p>

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Credit card warning SUPERMARKETS may lose more than half of their card-carrying customers if they decide to charge shoppers extra for paying with debit and credit cards, according to the Credit Card Research Group (CCRG). They would lose just as heavily if cards were banned. The CCRG says any surcharge of card customers or boycott of cards by big grocery retailers will cost them billions of pounds in lost sales. The forecasts are from a survey of cardholders by Gallup which shows that customers are angry at threats of either not being able to use their cards or being made to pay more for their goods than people paying in cash.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Companies welcome export opportunities THE proposed abolition or lowering of tariffs was welcomed in most sectors of British industry yesterday. Makers of drugs, textiles and construction equipment said it could lead to higher exports and profits. The beer industry, however, warned it could mean unfair competition. A producer of construction equipment said: 'This gives us room to increase our profit margins or sell 10 per cent more in the US.' Textile industry officials pointed out that the UK has no tariffs on textiles above 15 per cent, whereas US tariffs on UK goods range above 40 per cent. An official said 'halving such tariffs would provide significant export opportunities'. The pharmaceuticals industry welcomed the move. Some medicines are subject to tariffs of about 5 per cent into both the EC and the US. The UK exported Pounds 324m of drugs to the US last year, compared with American imports worth Pounds 121m. Imperial Chemical Industries, Britain's biggest chemical producer, said the progress was encouraging but begged a lot of questions. The company pointed out that many British companies already had operations in North America and Japan, and would therefore not benefit directly from the reduction in tariffs. The steel industry was equally cautious, noting that any elimination of tariffs in steel would be subject to a Multilateral Steel Agreement, which is still under negotiation. However, British Steel, which wants the MSA to eliminate subsidies to steel producers and encourage free trade, said yesterday's announcement meant the MSA was now linked to the Gatt talks more closely than before. The UK Brewers' Society said the abolition of tariffs on beer could expose EC brewers to unfair competition. This was because EC producers had to pay the price for barley set under the EC's common agricultural policy. Non-EC brewers were free to buy barley cheaply on the world market.</p>

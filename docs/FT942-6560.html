			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Conservatives win few points in opening round The first week of full campaigning has brought no comfort to the Conservatives. Every poll and every further analysis of its implications must have lowered any hope of a respectable performance for the government. The nationwide polls show no response to the better economic news. The simple 'How will you vote?' questions reveal no trend. But the bad news for the Conservatives lies in two factors concealed in these simple nationwide figures. The swing has been different in different regions: the Conservatives have slumped most in the south and 28 of the 32 Euro-seats now held by the Conservatives are below the line from the Severn to the Wash. One MORI calculation shows the polls pointing to Labour winning 66 seats, leaving the Tories with 15 and the Liberal Democrats with three. However, when regional variation in swing is allowed for, the figures change to Labour taking 69 seats and the Conservatives only six - behind the Liberal Democrats' nine. Even in the residual six Conservative seats, some seem too near the margin for there to be any certainty about the outcome. The Guardian interpretation of its poll is no less depressing for the Conservatives. Allowing for regional variations, Mr John Curtice of Strathclyde University suggests that the Conservatives will take only six seats of the 83 shared by the three main parties, to Labour's 65 and the Liberal Democrats' 12. Neither of these polls makes much allowance for turnout, which could be about 40 per cent. A great deal, therefore, depends on who gets to the polling booths on June 9. Moreover, neither poll takes into account the impact of last-minute tactical voting. The local elections showed that an increasing number of Labour voters are ready to switch to the Liberal Democrats if that will defeat the Tories. A smaller number of Liberal Democrats will vote Labour where it makes sense locally. Polls have, of course, not been confined to voting intentions. They show that the public, while not nearly as fearful as arch-sceptic Tories Mr William Cash and Lord Tebbit would have us to believe, still rejects overwhelmingly the idea of a federal Europe, and more narrowly opposes a common currency. The Conservatives naturally are playing on these fears but there is no sign that they are winning further votes. The main reason is that European issues are so low in popular importance compared with full employment, law and order and the health service. For poll-watchers the most innovative surveys this week involved the Labour leadership. MORI and ICM have both found Mr Tony Blair well ahead among both the general public and among those who vote Labour. But, much more importantly, an ICM telephone survey among levy-paying trade unionists with votes in the leadership race showed that their preferences were much the same as those of the rest of the population. Since inquiries among MPs and constituency activists - admittedly more dubious as sample surveys - yield very similar findings, a Blair victory for the leadership looks almost as certain as a Labour victory for Strasbourg. But perhaps the most interesting poll of the week was the most amateur. A survey carried out on behalf of a local newspaper in Eastleigh, Hampshire  -where the by-election takes place simultaneously with the Euro-vote - found the Liberal Democrats leading Labour by two to one, with the Conservatives in third place - in a seat which they won with a majority of 17,000 at the 1992 general election.

			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: THE NAKED TRUTH IN CINCINNATI  </P> <P> I never saw a Mapplethorpe.  </P> <P> I hope I never see one.  </P> <P> But I can tell you this right now.  </P> <P> I'd rather live in Cincinnati than be one.  </P> <P> The rumor that an exhibit of nude baseball player cards was coming to  Cincinnati hit the town like a tornado. Following the Mapplethorpe photographic  showing, people were quaking with fear.  </P> <P> Where the rumor started no one knows, but by the time it reached downtown,  people were telling each other: "They're going to show Pete Rose in the buff."  </P> <P> Cincinnati has a law specifically forbidding the display of baseball nudity on  the grounds that it is offensive and generates controversy. This includes not  only the Cincinnati Reds but visiting teams as well. It specifically forbids  card trading of all players who are not in full uniform. That is why the news  of a nude baseball player show caused so much alarm.  </P> <P> Authorities warned that if any baseball cards were hung in a public place, the  police would take videotapes of them, which would then be used in court. The  sheriff and the mayor said that they would not stand by and see first and  second basemen exposed to the elements. They promised arrests and jail terms  whether the players were posing in left field or at home plate.  </P> <P> A law enforcement officer said that Cincinnati is the baseball card capital of  the world. "Anybody who would show a naked shortstop deserves to have the book  thrown at him."  </P> <P> On the other side are those who maintain that displaying a nude player on a  card is a form of free expression -- and preventing the public from seeing them  is censorship. They feel that the city fathers not only want to do away with  nudity on baseball cards but nudity on Nintendo games as well.  </P> <P> This is the first time the baseball card issue has become a constitutional one.  The people who want to ban them swear that the cards are pornographic -- pure  and simple -- and that the community has a duty to stop them from being  exhibited. The other viewpoint is that it doesn't matter if they are baseball  players or weightlifters, they have as much right to be displayed in a museum  as members of Jesse Helms' family.  </P> <P> What makes it all so sad is that no one actually has seen a nude player on a  baseball card. At first it was believed that the entire New York Yankee team  had posed without clothes. Then that rumor changed to the Los Angeles Dodgers.  But there is still a question of whether the pictures exist or not.  </P> <P> This has not stopped Cincinnati citizens from lining up in front of the  Baseball Card Museum to get a look at the exhibit. Police estimate that at  least 56,900 people have been waiting -- not counting 4,000 undercover agents  from the prosecutor's office.  </P> <P> "We have a right to see Dave Winfield without his clothes on," a female art  lover declared, "before they take him away."  </P> <P> Her companion said, "I drove all the way from Louisville, Ky., to get a peek at  Yogi Berra in his birthday suit."  </P> <P> It's been so long since the whispers about the baseball cards were first heard  that many art patrons are befuddled. That's why the rumor of them has split  Cincinnati wide open.  </P> <P> You can't tell other folks what they can or cannot see without them getting mad  at you.  </P> <P> You may be curious about where I stand on all this. Personally, I don't like  pictures of nudes. I prefer people with their clothes on.  </P> <P> That's why I read the Victoria's Secret catalogue from cover to cover.  </P></p>

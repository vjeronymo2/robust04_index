			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Age of automation reaches New York bond auctions - From today, dealers will bid by computer on the world's largest securities market JUST before 1pm today, bond traders at 39 big banks and securities houses in the US will enter their bids for a new issue of Treasury bills into a computer, and the world's largest securities market will move one step closer to coming of age in the electronic era. Until today, the method the 39 primary dealers in government securities  - those banks and Wall Street firms allowed to bid directly with the Federal Reserve of New York for Treasury securities on behalf of customers - employed to place their bids for new bills notes and bonds was embarrassingly antiquated. In a ground-floor corridor at the New York Fed's Manhattan headquarters, messengers would crowd around telephones anxiously waiting for instructions from their firms' bond traders. Moments before 1pm, the messengers would rush from their phones to stuff pieces of paper into an old brown box. On the paper would be written details of each primary dealer's bid - how much of a new government issue it wanted and the yield it was willing to accept. After 1pm, the Fed would sort the tenders and begin awarding dealers their allocation of the new issue. Final details of the completed auction would not be released until about an hour after the bidding closed. Now that primary dealers can bid via an on-line computer link to the New York Fed, the whole cumbersome process will be simplified and speeded up. The dealers are not the first to use computers in the auctions. In the past year, some 600 smaller bidders in the market have been submitting their tenders by computer, but only for non-competitive bids - where the bidder agrees in advance to buy the securities at the average yield determined by the auction. Automation of primary dealer bidding is part of the overhaul of the government securities market that was triggered by the Salomon Brothers scandal of August 1991, when the Wall Street firm's bond desk was discovered to have submitted false bids for new government secur-ities in several Treasury auctions. Primary dealers will find it easier to submit their tenders for auctions at the last moment and to keep records of bids. The smaller bidders will no longer have to go through either the dealers or their local Federal Reserve banks to bid for a new issue - they can do it on their own computer. Equally important, the compilation of all information on computer will improve the New York Fed's supervision of auctions. The absence of an electronic auction record was seen as one of the reasons why the Salomon bond desk was able to break Treasury rules on bidding limits without being caught in several 1990 and 1991 auctions. It is uncertain whether automation will have any effect on the pricing of auctions. Mr Lee Olesky, assistant general counsel at the Public Securities Association, the industry body that has liaised with the Treasury on automation, believes the rapid release of computerised auction results may mean dealers will have to worry less about hedging the positions they hold in the hour or so between the end of the auction and the publication of the final results. Mr Olesky says: 'The only real dollar impact in terms of pricing is a reduction in that window when you are waiting to get the results back - that's an exposure that dealers may have had to hedge in the past.' As part of its reforms, the authorities decided to widen the pool of firms allowed to bid directly in the auctions. This measure was designed to ensure that it would no longer be possible for the primary dealers to control the auctions. Regulators and legislators believed it was the concentration of too much power in too few hands that encouraged the Salomon bond desk to break the rules. The Treasury, however, is not stopping at automation and primary dealer reform. It is also considering changing the system it uses to sell government debt. Since September, the Treasury has been experimenting with a single-price auction, using it for every sale of two-year and five-year notes. The old system, used for decades, involves selling securities to dealers at different prices. Dealers willing to pay the highest price were awarded their bids first. Dealers willing to pay the next highest price were then awarded their bids, and so on, until each issue was fully subscribed. In the single-price auctions being tried by the Treasury, dealers and others bid openly at ever-increasing prices. The price of the issue rises until it is no longer over-subscribed, at which point everyone still in the bidding is awarded their securities at the last fully-subscribed price. Any securities left over are awarded on a pro-rata basis and at the same fully-subscribed price to those who dropped earlier in the bidding. So far, Wall Street has taken to the new system quite well. One of the reasons for introducing the single-price auction was that it made it much harder for one, or a few, bidders to manipulate the auction by bidding extremely high and cornering the market in the new issue. It is an improvement that the market welcomes. The Treasury hopes that, by allowing many more financial institutions to bid competitively in auctions (in multiple-price auctions only the primary dealers tender competitive bids), the government will be able to sell its securities at a higher price, and at a lower cost to the taxpayer. Yet, as bond traders point out, everything depends on market conditions. If the market is buoyant, bidding will be aggressive. If it is weak, bidding will be more cautious. As one trader put it yesterday: 'So far, about 75 per cent of the new auctions have saved the Treasury money, because were are in a market where rates are trending down and a lot of people are bidding aggressively. 'I think in a bull market the single-price auction is a big winner for the Treasury. But in a bear market, it's a big loser.'</p>

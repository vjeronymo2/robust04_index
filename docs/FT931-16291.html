			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Punt under intense pressure THE French franc improved against the D-Mark inside the European exchange rate mech-anism yesterday, but pressures on the Irish punt intensified sharply, writes James Blitz. A series of measures taken on Tuesday by the Bundesbank and the Bank of France to support the franc continued to have a positive effect on the currency yesterday. It closed  1/2 centime higher at FFr3.409 to the D-Mark. However, the focus of attention inside the system moved to the Irish punt. In early afternoon trading in Europe, the punt fell to its ERM floors against the Dutch guilder and Belgian franc, the strongest currencies operating within narrow bands in the system. In consequence, the Irish authorities announced at the end of ERM trading that they would be hoisting the overnight rate in the Irish punt money market to 50 per cent today from around 14 per cent. The move could not prevent the punt falling below its respective ERM floors against the guilder and Belgian franc later in the US. The Irish pound is certain to be the focus of attention in currency markets today. But the key question in the ERM remains whether the French franc can survive the recent pressures. There were more indications yesterday that a number of continental fund managers had actively hedged themselves out of French francs in recent days, believing a devaluation could occur. But several analysts pointed out that French corporates remain long of French francs, and that greater pressure on the currency now requires weakness from France's domestic investors. There will be a strong focus today on the Bundesbank council meeting, and the possibility that interest rates may be cut. Few in the market believe that there will be an easing in official rates. But a new set of economic forecasts has underlined the need for a policy easing. The DIW Institute's forecast for 1993 was particularly startling, predicting a 1 per cent drop in GDP in western Germany this year. There was some speculation that the Bundesbank might carry out a 'cosmetic' 50 basis-point easing in the Lombard rate today. At 9.5 per cent, its level is well above market rates of about 8.75 per cent. The omens for this were not promising, however. The Bundesbank said there will be no press conference after today's council meeting, and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the central bank's president, yesterday reiterated his counter-inflationary policy in a speech in Oslo. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, continues to believe that the French franc will survive the present crisis. 'I simply do not believe that something like the devaluation of the franc, with all the political consequences it would have, could occur without a real fight,' he said. 'We have not seen anything like the number of rabbits that could be pulled out of the hat by the French.'</p>

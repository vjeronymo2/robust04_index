			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stephen Laufer] </F>   [Text] At least one major European aircraft manufacturer  has withdrawn from this month's Johannesburg air show, Aviation  Africa '94, after direct intervention of ANC military chief Joe  Modise. Several other companies, including French aircraft  builders and a Swiss manufacturer, have considered cancelling  their stands at the event.    British Aerospace [BAe] said it would not participate in the  continent's premier air exhibition because Modise "made quite  clear" to the Gompany's South African representative that "an  exhibition of defence equipment would break the United Nations  arms embargo" against South Africa, which is still in place.  BAe was planning to show its Hawk jet trainer system, of which  it has sold close to 800 aircraft to the U.S. Navy, the  Zimbabwean, Kenyan, and other air forces worldwide. Aware that  the South African Air Force is currently investigating potential  replacements for its aging Impala trainer, the company was keen  to show its system at the bi-annual air salon.    Buying the Hawk, argues BAe, would allow Atlas Aircraft  Corporation and Denel to pitch for maintenance work for other  African air forces. BAe was to have displayed a full-scale  model of the Hawk, said the company's representative in South  Africa, Robbie Roberts. "But of course we were in a bit of a  predicament when the good Modise said forget the future if you  come to this show."    Modise is widely tipped to play a major role in military  affairs in future, either as minister of defence or chief of the  defence force. In either positions, he would be key to any  large-scale procurement decisions, including the purchase of jet  trainers. Observers have expressed surprise at Modise's apparent  determination to see the arms embargo adhered to, despite its  imminent demise. But ANC spokesperson Gill Marcus explained that  the organisation felt "that South Africa's policy on arms should  only be looked at once the UN embargo has been lifted". That  will happen only after the elections.    Other European manufactures were also approached, via their  embassies in Pretoria. According to French sources, the first  call from Modise was rather unspecific and seemed to suggest the  ANC was opposed to Aviation Africa '94 as a whole. The embassy  was told "it would be insensitive to be represented at the air  show", without being told specifically whether this referred to  civil or military participation in the event. A subsequent  letter from foreign affairs chief Thabo Mbeki said there had  been a misunderstanding, and that civil aircraft were welcome.  But French manufacturers, including Airbus Industrie,  Aerospatiale, and Eurocopter France, met in Paris early this  week to consider withdrawing completely from the show. It is  understood they agreed to participate, showing only civilian  aircraft.    Swiss manufacturer Pilatus, which produces short take-off  spotter aircraft and recently sold replacements for the obsolete  Harvard trainer to the SAAF [South African Air Force], is also  rumoured to be considering withdrawing from the air show after  an approach from Modise. Aviation Africa '94 organiser Lynn  Brown said she had been in touch with the ANC's foreign affairs  department, which had "expressed support for the show, but asked  us to remind all participants of the UN arms embargo".    But press information issued by the organisers still refers  to "a number of local and international exhibitors" which "will  be exhibiting military hardware, including Denel's Rooivalk [red  falcon]".    Czech manufacturer Aero, which built MiG fighters until 1972  for the Warsaw Pact air forces and which currently has light  attack aircraft in its manufacturing programme, is featured in  publicity material for Aviation Africa '94.</p>

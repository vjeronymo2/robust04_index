			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Technology: Consultant's Critique The Know-How system seems to be the latest demonstration of the 'wheel of reincarnation', which occurs every 10 to 20 years in the computer industry. In the beginning, few people understood computers. Answers were sought from 'priests' in white coats. They composed the questions into arcane symbols, presented them to the oracle and interpreted the results. The PC revolution changed this. But as information technology spread, the amount of information escalated. A poorly specified search could take days, so again it had to be framed by specialists. The computer reverted to the control of experts who composed the questions and filtered the replies. I eagerly await the next cycle of software development which will put the information back into the hands of those who want to use it. Whatever computer gurus may babble about 'neural networks', this has not happened yet. An interesting development of this system is the re-use of expertise. The notes appended to documents are often more important than the documents. They are the distilled wisdom of highly paid lawyers. Also, indexing by skilled professionals adds considerable value to the data. It imposes extra structure through a layer of analysis and understanding. Once in the system, the knowledge is available to less-skilled workers. The real question is how to make money out of the system. In the UK, lawyers' charges are nominally based on the time taken by particular members of staff. Decreasing this would imply loss of fees. But many searches are not billable and cost savings here could be important. For clients, increased cost may be acceptable if answers arrive more quickly. The amount of data available for examination may yield a better or more reliable answer for the same cost. Linklaters might thus recoup its costs through extra business.

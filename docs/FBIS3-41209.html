Although no specfic information is available, experts  suppose  that the Baltic states have become a new transit point for drugs  smuggled to the West.    Ona Grimalauskiene, consultant at the Lithuanian Ministry of  Health Care, said the step will make the struggle against drug  abuse and drug transit through Lithuanian territory more  efficient. The above conventions not only oblige Lithuania to  observe international drug control standards, but also offer  technical assistance to Lithuanian customs, police and doctors,  she said. Lithuania can expect help in this field from both  international organizations and European countries.    The Lithuanian Government intends to create a National Drug  Control Committee that will coordinate the country's drug  control policy. Drug abuse prophylaxis will be one of the  committee's principal fields of activity.    According to a Jan. 27 government resolution, antidrug laws  will be drafted in accordance with the two conventions by next  fall.</p>

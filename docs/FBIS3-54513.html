			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Closing speech by Youcef Khatib, chairman of the National </F> Dialogue Commission, at National Conference in Club des Pins,  Algiers, on 26 January -- recorded]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate:  Brothers and sisters, here we are now after two days' work  reaching the end of this national conference. First of all I  thank all the brothers and sisters for the patriotic spirit they  have shown and I thank you for enabling this conference to  approve the platform for national consensus which we consider to  be in fact a program of action which can be adopted during the  transitional period.    We consider that this platform which has been approved today  is in reality the result of a collective endeavor in which all  the quarters which have worked with the National Dialogue  Commission have participated, regardless of whether they  participated in the conference, boycotted it, or withdrew from  it.    Since it was set up, the Commission has tried with all its  force to secure the participation of all parties in the dialogue  and not to exclude anybody apart from the party which excludes  itself. Also from the outset, it has endeavored and made all  efforts to bring views closer, to get everybody to work with all  sincerity toward implementing the contents of the platform for  national consensus, and for all to try to give priority to the  supreme interest of the nation so that Algeria can get out of  the crisis from which it is suffering as soon as possible.    Brothers and sisters, we call on all members of Algerian  society to show a patriotic spirit and wisdom and place  Algeria's interest above any other consideration. I will not  miss the opportunity also to thank all the brothers and sisters  who have worked assiduously in preparing this conference.    May God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you.  [applause]    I officially announce the end of the conference. [National  anthem played]</p>

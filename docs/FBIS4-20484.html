Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the  length of the cloned fragment was 604 base pairs (bp) and the  fragment contained a single open reading frame. It also revealed  that the gene had its own promoter because it had typical  ribosome-binding site (rbs), -10 and -35 promoter sequences. The  amino acid sequence of CS3 deduced from the nucleotide sequence  was composed of 168 amino acids. The first 15 amino acids were  considered to be the possible signal peptide of the CS3 protein.  Such protein was very hydrophobic because 46.5 percent amino  acids of it were hydrophobic. Like CFA/I, CS1 and K88ab  fimbriae, CS3 protein did not contain Cys residues. These  results suggest that CS3 subunits are held together mainly by  hydrophobic interaction. In situ hybridization test demonstrated  that there were no homologous sequences between the gene of CS3  and the genes of CFA/I, CS4 and CS6.</p>

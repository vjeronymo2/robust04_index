			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. HALTS DEVELOPMENT OF SHORT-RANGE MISSILES  </P> <P> With East-West tensions in decline, the Bush Administration is postponing  indefinitely the development of new short-range nuclear missiles that were to  be based in West Germany, U.S. officials said today.  </P> <P> The 88 new launchers, 36 of which were to be controlled by the United States  and the others by West Germany, Britain and the Netherlands, were designed for  targeting on East Germany.  </P> <P> They would have been capable of launching about 1,600 missiles.  </P> <P> The tentative U.S. goal had been to begin deploying the missiles in 1995 to  replace the current mixture of nuclear-armed and conventional Lance missiles  with an all-nuclear force and an expanded range.  </P> <P> But East Germany is rapidly moving out of the Soviet orbit and preparing for  union with West Germany. It is no longer perceived as a threat to the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization countries.  </P> <P> The current arsenal of Lances will remain in West Germany. About 700 carry  nuclear warheads and have a range of about 75 miles. The 900 or so non-nuclear  missiles in the arsenal are designed to hit targets within 45 miles.  </P> <P> The new launchers were intended to have a range of about 280 miles, just below  the level of intermediate-range nuclear missiles that were banned in a  U.S.-Soviet treaty in 1987.  </P> <P> Congress appropriated $32 million last year to develop the new Lance missiles.  The Pentagon has requested $112 million for this year. Overall, the program  would have cost more than $1 billion, Dunbar Lockwood of the private Arms  Control Assn. estimated.  </P> <P> Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, said the future of the Lance was a  decision for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  </P> <P> He said, however, that the Army Missiles Command had put a hold on plans to  issue a formal request for contractors' proposals for building the new weapons.  </P></p>

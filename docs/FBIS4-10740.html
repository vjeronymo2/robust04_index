			<p>BFN     [Text] Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta has  described certain decisions by Prosecutor General Gustavo de  Greiff as being "isolated," and he said such decisions generate  reactions that make people question their institutions and their  coworkers.    "I am respectfully calling on the prosecutor general to stop  making isolated decisions that can adversely affect the  country's criminal policy," Arrieta said.    The attorney general also referred to Justice Minister  Andres  Gonzalez's position: "I have observed with irony and sadness  how, by way of a letter a few days ago, the justice minister has  established conditions for subjecting drug traffickers to  justice, even though more than a year ago the Attorney General's  Office had requested the inclusion of these same conditions in  the Criminal Code."    Arrieta spoke to journalists yesterday to explain his views  regarding the controversy that has emerged in the relations  between U.S. officials and the Colombian Prosecutor General's  Office, and he called on De Greiff to act in harmony and to  cooperate with other institutions.    He added: "Serious harm will be done to Colombia and all of  its citizens when, by way of isolated decisions, certain  reactions are generated that make people question their  institutions and their peers, because for every criminal there  are thousands of decent citizens who are demanding respect for  their dignity and rights."    According to the attorney general, the prosecutor general's  isolated statements and decisions should not be allowed to  endanger the state's criminal policy, because "no institution  can claim for itself the exclusive handling of the state's  criminal policy." He added: "There is a constitutional mandate  that calls for harmony and cooperation among all branches of  government. It is necessary to understand that the legal  strategies of prohibition and prevention should parallel one  another and be harmonious within the state."    The attorney general added: "I do not want this statement to  be interpreted as if I am supporting someone. I simply want to  make a constructive contribution toward resolving a national  problem that has resulted in serious consequences, such as the  labeling of Colombia as a narcodemocracy."    Arrieta admitted that the current Criminal Code is a failure  because of all of its legal flaws and contradictions. He said  the drug traffickers' lawyers have taken advantage of these  shortcomings.    Arrieta said: "The lack of standards has prompted attorneys  for drug traffickers to try to obtain more favorable conditions  for their clients." The problems with the code, according to  the high-ranking official, can be summarized this way: "There  are confusing standards in terms of protocol, advantages and  benefits of the law, and the application of differing views, and  these eventually lead to lenient decisions."    Arrieta also said there are documents that prove that since  February 1992 the Attorney General's Office has been insisting  on the need for a tougher Criminal Code.  <H5>  Another Criminal Code </H5>   Arrieta said: "It is no secret that the Attorney General's  Office was the only office that originally opposed the reform of  the Criminal Code, because it believed the discretionary powers  given to prosecutors in doling out benefits were too broad."  The attorney general said there are 60-70 criminal policy  standards, but he added that all of these are confusing and  contradictory. "This is why, according to the Attorney  General's Office, as far as the struggle against drug  trafficking is concerned, it is important for the government,  the Congress, and the judicial branch to assume the challenge of  issuing as soon as possible significant procedural standards  that reflect a clear-cut criminal policy."    The attorney general said the new criminal code must include  guidelines for meting out sentences that correspond to the  seriousness of the crime. He said: "They should offer viable  judicial alternatives that will generate neither impunity nor a  sense of impunity."    While waiting for these kinds of reforms, Arrieta promised  "to proceed forcefully and seriously in such a way that those  guilty of crimes receive punishment that correspond to their  acts." He also said he will continue to work within the  framework of the legal and constitutional responsibilities the  Attorney General's Office has in criminal cases.    Arrieta added: "If, as a state, we are unable to promote a  comprehensive Criminal Code that features sentences that are  proportional to the crimes and establishes clear criteria for  the application of benefits, then something is seriously wrong  here."</p>

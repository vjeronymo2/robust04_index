			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Co-operating to survive in a global market: Paul Betts explains why a group of smaller airlines is talking about partnership Mr Jan Carlzon, the chief executive of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), describes the current flurry of mergers and partnerships in the airline business as the ketchup bottle effect: 'You shake and shake the bottle and nothing seems to happen until it all comes pouring out at once.' For the past eight years, the SAS boss has been one of the most consistent and ardent proponents of transnational co-operation to enable smaller and medium-sized airlines like SAS to compete against the larger European, American and Asian carriers in an increasingly deregulated and global industry. He is now in the throes of complex partnership discussions with three other medium-sized European carriers - Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Austrian Airlines - to try to establish a 'fourth force' in the European airline market to compete against the big three - British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa of Germany. If successful, the current talks could ultimately lead to a merger of the four carriers which combined would be larger than BA, Air France or Lufthansa. It would have a fleet of around 270 aircraft, employ more than 80,000 people, and carry around 30m passengers a year. The four carriers have already established 16 working parties to study how they could work more closely together by creating a multi-hub traffic system based around Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Geneva and Vienna; integrating their fleets and future aircraft purchasing policies; combining frequent flier programmes; rationalising their structures and cutting costs by setting up, for example, one head office instead of four. One working paper leaked last week goes as far as proposing a full merger with a joint company controlling four separate operating arms with aircraft flying under the same logo and common colours. The four airlines insist that nothing has yet been decided and that a wide range of proposals are still under consideration. The conclusions of the different studies are to be submitted to the heads of the four airlines next month. By the end of June, they are expected to take a decision. 'What is clear is that the four airlines want to move quickly', said one party to the talks. The convoluted ownership structure of the airlines, especially SAS in which the Swedish, Danish and Norwegian governments all own stakes, is likely to complicate merger plans. The unions and some vocal sections of government are also expected to resist radical merger proposals to protect employment and defend national pride. But there are compelling reasons for the four airlines to gang together. All four share common problems as well as similar strategies. Their domestic markets are too small to support a strong international airline. For this reason, they have all long branched out to forge links with carriers around the globe to operate viable traffic networks. SAS has developed links with Continental in the US, Lan Chile in South America, Thai in south east Asia, ANA in Japan. In the UK it owns 25 per cent of Airlines of Britain which operates the regional carrier British Midland. Swissair has cross-equity partnerships with Singapore Airlines and Delta in the US. KLM holds a stake in Northwest Airlines of the US, has a long standing relationship with Garuda of Indonesia and a stake in the British regional carrier Air UK. Swissair and ANA both have minority stakes in Austrian, the smallest and weakest of the four. As an initial response to growing competition in Europe and the emergence of so-called 'mega carriers' in the US and Asia, SAS, Swissair and Austrian formed four years ago what they termed the European Quality Alliance. Originally, the three airlines envisaged swapping stakes, but this proved too difficult because of the complex SAS ownership structure. However, the partnership has slowly started to bear fruits. The three carriers co-ordinated last year the launch of new services to eastern Europe. Swissair and Austrian have combined marketing forces in their domestic markets. SAS has been marketing its African and South American traffic through Swissair. Some co-ordination in the use of equipment has already taken place. Early on, SAS also sought to attract KLM to the table. But the talks were interrupted two years ago when the Dutch carrier decided to enter into merger negotiations with BA. The dialogue was renewed after the BA-KLM talks collapsed largely on the issue of control. It has since gathered pace with the advent this year of the new single European aviation market and the industry's financial troubles due to recession. These combined pressures have, in turn, intensified the trend towards greater consolidation. In Britain, BA bought stakes in USAir, Qantas in Australia and in two small regional carriers in Europe. Meanwhile, Air France has taken control of Air Inter, the French domestic carrier, and UTA, the independent French long-haul airline, as well as buying stakes in Sabena of Belgium and CSA of Czechoslovakia. Lufthansa is also scouting for partnership opportunities while it aggressively restructures itself. Time is running out for Europe's medium-sized carriers. However, a merger could take some time. After all, it took five years to find the proper corporate structure for SAS before the airline was created from the separate Swedish, Norwegian and Danish international airline operations in 1951. But as one executive close to the current talks said: 'That does not mean we cannot agree quickly to have the benefits of a merger without actually having a merger.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FOUR AIRLINES IN SEARCH OF A FUTURE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Pre-tax       Revenue                 Sales     profit/loss   passenger    Employees  Aircraft                 1991      1991          kilometres   Dec 31,    Dec 31,                 Dollars   Dollars       1992         1991       1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Swissair        3.850bn    66.9bn       15.967bn     20,301      60 Austrian   Airlines      0.805bn    -3.3m         3.681bn      4,305      22 KLM             4.182bn    41.5m        31.799bn     25,638      59 SAS             3.895bn   127.5m        12.731bn     21,150     131  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: RPKs IATA/SBC, employee and aircraft numbers Association of European Airlines  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

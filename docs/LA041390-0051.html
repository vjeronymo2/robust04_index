			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'SHANNON' GETS A RAW DEAL IN JOURNEY FROM PILOT TO SERIES  </P> <P> Flashback:  </P> <P>  The NBC movie "Shannon's Deal" airs June 4, 1989. It gets the highest Nielsen  ratings in its time slot. What's more, it finishes in the Nielsen Top 10. As a  bonus, the critics love it too.  </P> <P>  And no wonder, for "Shannon's Deal" is one terrific zinger, an excellently  made, distinctively crafted, mostly cream-of-the-crop series pilot that  introduces one of the more interesting and appealing TV characters to come  along in years.  </P> <P>  Jack Shannon is a divorced, disenchanted Philadelphia lawyer who once made big  money helping corporate polluters finesse environmental groups, but is now so  much in debt from gambling that he's stalked by a loan collector and has to  borrow $10 from his precocious 12-year-old daughter to take her to lunch. He  takes public transportation. He has a smoky office in a crummy building  inhabited by a subculture of professional low-lifes. He's a flawed hero who  cuts corners and makes deals.  </P> <P>  "You're a good man," his new secretary tells him. "No," he replies, running  his hand through his thick unruly hair. "But I'm a good lawyer . . . at least I  used to be."  </P> <P>  It is that interestingly off-center filmmaker John Sayles ("Eight Men Out,"  "Return of the Secaucus Seven," "The Brother From Another Planet," "Matewan")  who has created "Shannon's Deal" and written the script interlaced with  poker-playing metaphors. It's director Lewis Teague who has guided the  characters through this fascinatingly underlit, grainy haze. It's Wynton  Marsalis who has provided the simple score that gives musical resonance to the  story's moody urban tone.  </P> <P>  And certainly not least, Shannon has been given a continuously charming  presence by Jamey Sheridan, an actor whose rugged, furry browed  street-fighter's face belies his easy way with his character's bemused humor.  </P> <P>  Swell cast. Swell movie. Swell ratings. Swell ending to story, right?  </P> <P>  Uh, not quite.  </P> <P>  Cancel the flashback. We're now in the present, with last year's "Shannon's  Deal" pilot rerunning tonight at 9 on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39) in advance of  Monday's 10 p.m. premiere of "Shannon's Deal" the series, a six-episode trial  whose opener is shockingly unlike the admirable movie that spawned it. A  leopard has given birth to a cocker spaniel.  </P> <P> Those choosing to watch both tonight's and Monday's programs will see a  textbook example of a pilot being unrepresentative of the series it precedes.  </P> <P> Oh, Sheridan (in a goofy new yuppiesque hairstyle) remains as Shannon in this  utterly artless, sanded-down premiere written by Sayles, who is supplying two  of six scripts. But most everything else that made the pilot special has been  diminished, if not eliminated.  </P> <P> The result is that "Shannon's Deal" is now undistinguishable from the rest of  TV. That intriguingly dark, brooding tone is gone, erased by simpleton  brightness in an hour so overlit that you almost need sunglasses to watch.  </P> <P> Even worse, there is no mystery or edge Monday, only rosy comfortableness  throughout a played-for-laughs hour in which Shannon reluctantly takes the case  of a young country songwriter (Michelle Joyner) who claims one of her tunes has  been ripped off by a shady recording firm. The romance between Shannon and this  grating gee-whiz of a hillbilly is never convincing, nor is there any logic to  her hickishly stereotyped Tennessean ex-husband (played by Sayles) being able  to repeatedly locate Shannon in the big city and harass him. Meanwhile,  real-life singers David Crosby and Tanya Tucker also have cameo roles.  </P> <P> Not only does the premiere soften Shannon, it also mostly squanders two of the  pilot's best and most-amusing supporting characters. One, a comic shyster  lawyer played by Martin Ferrero, surfaces all right, but far too broadly. Even  worse is the inexplicable near-omission of Shannon's secretary Lucy, played so  engagingly by Elizabeth Pena in the pilot. Better more of Pena than  manufactured time for David Crosby.  </P> <P> Good as it was, the pilot could have been better. Its now-outdated plot --  ensnaring Shannon in a conspiracy involving right-wingers, drugs and arms to  the Contras -- got ever thinner as it neared conclusion. At all times, however,  the pilot held your interest, ending on an unconventional note that showed  Shannon to be more pragmatist than idealist.  </P> <P> If not downbeat, this was at least refreshingly middlebeat, in contrast to  Monday's standard upbeat conclusion offering triumph, closure and  predictability. Now that's the old-fashioned television we've come to expect.  </P></p>

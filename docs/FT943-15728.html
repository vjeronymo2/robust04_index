			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (4): Attempting to take on the west - Helen Mingay examines the way the emphasis on pre-war excellence is having marked success in attracting international business / Czech manufacturers / Strategy, industrial reform, global sourcing of car components and technology transfer arrangements demand a variety of approaches to exporting Czech companies are entering the modern world of marketing by reverting to their pre-communist past. The Sellier Bellot Munitions Company, which has reverted to its pre-war name, is advertising for a foreign partner, while the country's most popular beer, Staropramen, is relying on its 1842 pedigree and name, which roughly translated means 'from the ancient well'. As British beer drinkers adopt continental lager drinking habits, Bass is expecting its Czech connection will bring in the punters. Bass Breweries has bought a 34 per cent stake in Prague Breweries and the company plans to introduce Staropramen to the British market next year. The beer is already selling in Sweden and Germany. Prague Breweries is the first leading Czech brewer to bring in an international partner, although other Czech brands are already making an impact on the western markets. Last year Germany alone imported half a million hectolitres of Czech lager. Guinness won the contract to market the Pilsner Urquell beer in the US and UK, while Sainsbury has a contract to brew its 'own brand' with a Czech brewery. The strategy of stressing a reversion to pre-war quality seems to be having some success. Like other central European countries of Hungary and Poland, the Czech Republic has registered a remarkable increase in exports to the west, a process which began immediately after the velvet revolution and was intensified by the mass privatisation programme. The division of Czechoslovakia, formally enacted on 1 January last year, slowed the march of Czech exports, as many companies were forced to restructure their production, causing interruptions to supplies for western markets. Western importers now report that this period of dislocation is well behind them and that supplies are coming in smoothly. With the demise of communism, the larger Czech companies tended to recruit officials from the communist foreign trade companies, which had been responsible for exports. Other officials set up export/import companies and agencies. The large headline deals such as those involving car manufacturer Skoda and in the beer industry only form part of the picture. The Czech republic has always exported a wide range of engineering products, and has a reputation for excellence in specialised items such as hunting guns and gliders. Many of these smaller companies also continued marketing through their well established agencies in the west, with little change from the communist era. In the UK, for example, the Vitrea company continues to market Czech glassware, while the Exico company continues to deal in shoes, toys and leather goods and electric motors. 'We still have the majority of Slovak factories, as well as Czech products,' says M. Sebek, managing director of Exico. 'There has been little change from our point of view since the communist era,' he adds. However, Exico's sales and marketing operations are now in the hands of a western partner. Many other companies, such as the Sellier Bellot Munitions Company, can be found advertising for a foreign partner which would be likely to take over export sales. Volkswagen's investment in Skoda has led to a fully-fledged advertising campaign in the west. The campaign aims at a rehabilitation of the car to release it from its former communist image and a revamping of the marketing effort in separate companies under the VW wing. Sales to the UK are showing a constant improvement, registering a 177 per cent growth at 5,000 cars sold, compared to the first five months of last year. A company spokesman admits that these figures are inflated, however, as deliveries were interrupted last year as the Czech factory adapted to new conditions prevailing following the division of Czechoslovakia. The sales effort concentrates attention on the benefits of 'a lot of car for your money', adding somewhat less complimentarily that 550 improvements have been made to the model since the VW investment. The marketing strategy has had to find a delicate balance between the relatively cheap price of the models and the fact that Skoda is now a car matching up to contemporary standards. 'It is not bristling with the latest technology, but it is a fairly modern car,' says John Edwards of Skoda Automobile UK. 'Historically, the Skoda has been compared to the Lada from Russia. We do not like to be compared with the Lada as now they are two very different cars,' he adds. The price advantage, primarily generated by low wages, will continue to be the best selling point for the Czechs. But the remarkable reorientation of exports to the west in such a short space of time vindicates their emphasis on pre-war excellence.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] A commentary by the newspaper TISHRIN addresses  reactions to the Geneva summit, saying: Politicians, observers,  and political analysts were unanimous that Syria has clearly and  favorably responded to all peace requirements, and that the  Geneva talks have opened all the doors for a true, just, and  comprehensive peace in the Middle East. The appeal President  al-Asad has made, urging Israeli rulers to accept the peace of  the brave, and to make efforts to achieve comprehensive and just  peace in the region puts Israel to the test, particularly since  U.S. President Bill Clinton has declared his support for this  appeal by President al-Asad. Similarly, the U.S. president has  clearly committed himself to work to achieve just and  comprehensive peace on the basis of the relevant UN Security  Council resolutions.    TISHRIN adds: The Geneva summit has paved the way for a  durable peace in the Middle East. However, the materialization  of such a peace is contingent upon a positive position on  Israel's part. But, Israeli rulers have chosen to cast doubts,  voice reservations, and float the idea of holding a referendum  on the future of the Golan, as if it were not occupied Syrian  territory.    TISHRIN goes on to say: The game of referendum on the Golan,  which is ostensibly backed by Rabin, is opposed by many. This  game is designed to circumvent the summit outcome and the  categorical Syrian-U.S. reaffirmation of efforts to achieve just  peace in the Middle East. It is a declaration of intent meant  to evade the requirements of the peace desired by the  international community.    Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN says: President al-Asad  has repeatedly affirmed, as he did during the Geneva summit,  that there can be no bargaining over the Golan, and that Syria  will not cede a single inch of its territory. For peace must  terminate occupation. Otherwise, it will not have any chance of  success. Moreover, Syria cannot abandon its territories or  rights, nor can it bargain over them. As far as the Israeli  rulers are concerned, peace is close at hand. They could help  achieve it if they only have the necessary courage, as President  al-Asad has, indeed, said during the Geneva summit.    For its part, the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: The Washington  bilateral talks will be resumed as a result of the Geneva summit  between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. Israel has again  returned to the method of maneuvering to thwart the efforts to  achieve the objective of the peace process, namely, the  attainment of just and comprehensive peace on the basis of the  relevant international legitimacy resolutions. Israel's return  to the methods of maneuvering, procrastination, and word play is  nothing new. It attempted to belittle the importance of the  Geneva summit prior to its convocation through a deceptive media  campaign. Right now, it is attempting to launch a similar  campaign to dilute its outcome.    The paper adds: Israel's initial reaction to the summit  outcome concerned the Golan. Israel has begun to promote the  so-called referendum on the Golan under the guise of making  concessions for peace.    The paper wonders: About which concessions is Israel  talking? For only property owners have the right to make  concessions. Does Israel own anything on the Golan? Since the  answer is in the negative, Israel does not have the right to  claim that it would be making any concessions for peace. Does  the decision to annex the Golan, which was deemed null and void  by UN resolutions, give Israel the right to make any such claims?    Concluding its commentary, the paper says: It is clear that  Israel, which has found itself facing an impasse in the  aftermath of the Geneva summit, still clings to intransigent  positions on peace. Hence, the bilateral talks, due to resume  soon, will test Rabin's true intentions. The international  consensus on peace, which has been manifested in the reactions  to the Geneva summit, is in line with the need to see stability  in the region. It is believed that this consensus will not give  Israel ample room for maneuvering.    In a commentary published today, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH  says: The Geneva summit between His Excellency President Hafiz  al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton is an extremely  important event. It is a turning point in the region's history.  Many convictions, misconceptions, and fallacies have been  removed when faced with the glow of hard facts.    AL-THAWRAH adds: With an open heart and mind, al-Asad's  Syria, backed by the entire nation, was in Geneva. Thanks to  its weight, its special pioneering and historical role, and its  constant determination to accomplish difficult pan-Arab  missions, President al-Asad, the man of the hard missions who is  always willing to make firm and tough decisions, has managed to  entrench the constant Arab rights, and to make it clear that the  achievement of a solution is contingent upon the restoration of  such rights.    AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: The peace of the brave leader  al-Asad has promoted at the Geneva summit is the height of  loyalty to the sacrifices made by convoys of martyrs. It  reflects Syria's desire for a just and honorable peace, as well  as Syria's commitment to work to achieve peace. The appeal  President al-Asad has made in this regard is a fresh challenge  to Israeli politicians and rulers, who profess to be advocates  of peace. Al-Asad has challenged them to adopt credible  positions.    Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: If there is a  sincere effort to achieve such a peace, there would be no room  for differing interpretations. Any solution that falls short of  ensuring the restoration of all occupied Arab territories cannot  bring peace.</p>

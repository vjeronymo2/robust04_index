			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chan Wai-fong] </F>   [Text] Instead of being outlawed by new regulations on  religious venues, Chinese church leaders argue that a great  majority of house churches will gain legal recognition and  protection. But resistance is anticipated, particularly from  lower level cadres, and conflicts are expected in the process of  implementation. "There were reasons to fear that the process of  implementation would not be without conflicts," Dr Konrad  Raiser, general-secretary of the World Council of Churches,  yesterday quoted church leaders in China as saying after a visit  to China from May 5 to 11.    Official figures show that there are about seven million  Christians in China, with a widely quoted 8,000 registered  Protestant churches or 20,000 meeting places. But a larger  number of believers stay outside the official Three Self  Patriotic Church of China and prefer house churches.    House churches are estimated to have about 70 million  members, and are branded underground by the Chinese Government.  Violations against religious liberty by the state reportedly  occur in these venues. "There is no prediction on what impact  these decrees will have," Dr Raiser said.    But Chinese church leaders consider these rules progressive,  he said, because local cadres who were largely without any  control could now be held accountable. According to the new  rules, the house churches now have to supply clear addresses,  defined membership and clear financial conditions in order to  register. Chinese church leaders expect a large number of the  now unregistered meeting points to seek registration and public  recognition for legal protection, Dr Raiser said.</p>

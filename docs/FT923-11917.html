			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India seeks rise in leather exports INDIA IS aiming for a 13.5 per cent growth in leather and leather products exports to Dollars 1.48bn in 1992-93 (April to March). According to the Council for Leather Exports, India is capable of achieving this growth in spite of the continuing recession in European Community, the destination for more than 60 per cent of its leather exports, and the economic constraints on Russian buyers. Last year, however, India's leather exports declined by 8 per cent in dollar terms. Having already banned overseas sales of semi-finished leather, India will seek to raise further the share of value -added leather products in its export total by 3 per cent to 77 per cent in the current year. The export target for leather garments is Dollars 370m, for shoe uppers Dollars 320m, for footwear Dollars 240m, for other leather goods Dollars 255m and for finished leather Dollars 295m. The country plans gradually to phase out the export of finished leather. The council has urged the federal government to give Russia immediately a technical credit of Dollars 40m to enable it to pay for last year's imports of shoe uppers and garments and also open letters of credit for fresh imports. A large number of Indian exporters to Russia have closed shop because they have not been paid for earlier shipments. While Germany will remain by far the largest importer of Indian leather, the council points out that the US, the UK, Italy, France, Spain and Australia are also important buyers. Leather export prospects have improved following the steps taken by Indian manufacturers to control the incidence of carcinogenic substances in leather. India has the largest bovine population in the world, estimated at 250m. This gives an idea of the unrealised export potential of leather. But the country has still not been able to organise scientifically the collection of carcasses and the preparation and preservation of the hides.</p>

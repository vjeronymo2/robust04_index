			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / No-claims discount for Pool Re clients The government has agreed to a 'no-claims discount' for policyholders at Pool Re, the government-backed reinsurance company which was set up after an IRA attack on the City of London to help provide terrorism cover. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, announced yesterday that next year's premiums would be payable in two instalments. The first 60 per cent is due at the start of the policy period and the remainder at the end. But if total losses notified to Pool Re do not exceed Pounds 50m the second instalment will be waived.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 10 Jun (AFP) -- Tonight through its  internal telecommunications network, the Canadian Embassy will  recommend that Canadian citizens who do not have specific  reasons for staying in the country after 25 June leave Haiti, a  Canadian embassy spokesman told AFP. "The final decision will  have to be made by each individual, however," the source said.    Today, the government of Ottawa joined the U.S. position by  announcing that flights from Canada to Haiti will be suspended  as of 25 June. The source added that the embassy had expressed  a similar position twice in the past two years but that numerous  Canadians, some of whom had been living in Haiti for 30 or 40  years, had elected to stay.    According to the embassy, 2,400 Canadians, most of them  holding double nationality, live in Haiti. These people include  some 300 male and female religious teachers, most of whom come  from Quebec province.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Military Pressure Cannot Be Justified"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- The United States is  massing huge aggression forces around the Korean peninsula,  scheming to impose "sanctions" upon the DPRK. Commenting on  this, NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article today says:    This eloquently proves that it does not want to truly solve  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, but is trying to  stifle the DPRK militarily on the pretext of the "nuclear  development".    It is entirely wrong for the U.S. to put military pressure  on  the DPRK over the "nuclear issue".    The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula cropped up when  the  U.S. deployed nuclear weapons in South Korea and resorted to  nuclear threat against the North. The United States has turned  South Korea into the largest nuclear base in the Far East,  targeting its Asian strategy against the Korean peninsula.  Owing to the nuclear war moves of the United States, South  Korea has turned into a most dangerous hotbed of a nuclear war  in the world and the Korean people have to live under a constant  nuclear threat of the U.S. thus the United States gave rise to  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and is gravely  threatening the DPRK with nuclear weapons. Yet it is increasing  military pressure on the DPRK over its "nuclear development".  This is a shameless act which reminds us of a guilty party  filing the suit first.    The DPRK's nuclear activities, in view of their peaceful  nature, cannot be a pretext of pressure. Its nuclear activities  are designed to solve the problem of energy badly needed for  economic construction and the DPRK's atomic energy facilities  strictly serve this purpose. There is nothing else in its  nuclear activities. Nevertheless, the U.S. is putting military  pressure on the DPRK on groundless charges. This tells that the  United States has not yet given up the scheme to stifle Korean  socialism with strength.    In view of the sincere efforts made by the DPRK till now for  a solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, the  U.S. military pressure cannot be justified.    For a peaceful and fair solution to the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula, we have consistently called for dialogue and  negotiation and made a signal overture for a package solution to  the issue.    If the United States had come out to the third-round  DPRK-U.S. talks and the nuclear issue had been solved in a  package deal, the state would not have developed as now.    The DPRK's reactor core refueling cannot be a pretext of  military pressure.    We urged the International Atomic Energy Agency five times  to  take measures needed for core refueling and notified the U.S.  side that, if a package solution were achieved and the unique  status of the DPRK removed, though belatedly, we could allow all  the routine and ad hoc inspections including the selected  preservation of fuel rods even in the course of core refueling.    Facts show that the failure to resolve the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula is wholly attributable to the United States  and some dishonest quarters of the IAEA secretariat.    The criminal attempt to stifle the DPRK under the pretext of  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula while blocking its  solution can never be tolerated.    The Korean people who regard independence as their life and  soul would decisively react, if the United States ventured a  military provocation against the DPRK over the nuclear issue.</p>

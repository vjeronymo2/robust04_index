			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Record Store Owner Back in Court: Tommy Hammond, who was convicted in Alabama  in 1988 of violating an obscenity ordinance by selling a recording by the rap  group 2 Live Crew, has taken his case back to court.  </P> <P> Under Alabama law, any conviction before a Municipal Court judge must receive a  jury trial at the circuit court level before it can be appealed. Hammond, who  was fined $500 after his municipal court conviction in Alexander City, was  charged after a woman complained about her son buying a copy of the "Move  Somethin' " cassette at Hammond's store. His case is believed to mark the first  time music has been found to be legally obscene in the United States. Shauna  Snow  </P></p>

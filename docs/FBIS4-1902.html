			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanning, April 3 (XINHUA) -- Farmers are benefiting  from a comprehensive agricultural development project aided by  the World Food Program (WFP) in three poverty-stricken counties  in the Guangxi Autonomous Region, southwest China.    Mr. Dean Everts, of the WFP, said that the project played an  exemplary role showing how to relieve poverty in developing  countries.    The project, with the free offer of 93,925 tons of wheat  from  the WFP and 103.73 million yuan of coordinating funds from the  Chinese Government, started on February 1, 1991, and is due to  be completed in five years' time.    The project mainly focuses on building water conservancy  facilities, upgrading soil quality, planting trees, developing  orchards, constructing roads and technical training.    Thanks to the on-going project, the counties have another  10,361 ha of fairly well irrigated farmland and additional 1.6  million kwh. As a result an additional 61,820 tons of grain has  been produced.    Technical training has also helped more and more surplus  local farmers find other jobs, and thus cut down the exodus of  labor to other parts of the country.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool WOOL Australian wool prices drifted gradually lower at the opening sales of the second half of the selling season this week. The AWC market indicator was 500 cents a kg on January 13, down 9 cents. Farmers are putting up some resistance to what for the vast majority are uneconomic prices and withdrawing wool at their own reserves or prior to the sale, but this in the longer term only means that more re-offered wool may later come onto the market. Christmas Sales were very low with almost 4 million bales overhanging the market. Excess of supply keeps buying slow and cautious.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Wakeham offers words of hope - Coal Industry MR JOHN WAKEHAM had some half-comforting words for the British coal industry yesterday when he said it might possibly supply the bulk of the needs of the fossil-fuel generators in years to come. The generators' current contracts with British Coal expire in March 1993. Negotiations over how much domestic coal electricity producers will take after that date are already at the centre of a political row after the dismissal of the British Coal executive who was expected to be the company's leading voice in the talks. In Commons exchanges over the competitiveness of domestic coal, the energy secretary also referred to an 'encouraging' report from John T. Boyd, a US mining consultancy, which he said suggested that British Coal should be able to compete on price. While productivity in British coal mines was now the highest in Europe, it needed to be raised still further in order to compete with output from other countries. For Labour, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, asked why the government was making miners redundant in what was 'the most efficient colliery in western Europe'. Mr Peter Hardy, Labour MP for Wentworth, complained that the reward for the industry's recent productivity gains was 'brutal' loss of employment.</p>

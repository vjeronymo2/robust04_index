			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Regional expertise in niche markets - Business services Business services such as telecommunications, air transport and accountancy are not only large sectors in their own right: their performance also strongly influences the success of the economy as a whole. Unfortunately, Europe's performance in many business services leaves much to be desired. Compared to the US, productivity is often poor, markets are shrivelled and services are expensive. A services study by McKinsey, the management consultants, in 1992 concluded: 'US industries generally continue to show a higher level of productivity than their European counterparts.' As a result, Europe does not have as large a presence as the US in what are often high value-added businesses, and other industries reliant on business services suffer from high costs and poor quality. But the picture is not all gloom. Europe, notably the UK, does quite well in accountancy, law and management consultancy. Britain's leading law firms are the main competitors for US firms in the growing market for international legal services. The 'Big Six' global accountancy firms still have strong UK roots. An important explanation is that London's highly developed financial markets have proved demanding customers for accountants and international lawyers. Not only has this meant a high standard has been required of them but it has also enabled them to win business abroad by hanging on to financiers' coat-tails. Europe usually does well in business services needing a high degree of customisation as opposed to mass-market solutions. A history of fragmentation seems to have given the region's businessmen an expertise in niche markets. For example, Europe's computer services industry performs well in designing 'bespoke' software - tailor-made solutions for individual companies. By contrast, the market for 'packaged software' is dominated by the US. It supplied 78 per cent of the world market in 1991, with European production accounting for only 16 per cent. Europe's tradition of monopoly and state-ownership has contributed to its lack of dynamism in sectors such as telecommunications and air transport. Fragmentation of these industries on national lines has also prevented the development of high-quality cross-border networks. The consequences in telecommunications are quite high prices for basic phone services, especially cross-border calls. There has also been a low take-up of more advanced products, such as freephone services, while Europe is behind in developing 'electronic superhighways' which could revolutionise distribution arrangements for many industries. In airlines, the picture is similar. A recent report for the European Commission showed Europe suffers from quite high airline operating costs and antiquated air traffic control systems. High fares and delayed flights not only harm business travellers and undermine development of a single market: they also undermine the competitive advantage of the EU's travel and tourism industries, which employ 19m people.</p>

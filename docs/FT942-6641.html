			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Why wine can cost so much - The price of a bottle explained Financial Times readers have probably long suspected that the relationship between a wine's retail price and its production cost is as variable as a winemaker's ego. Even some of the most enthusiastic wine drinkers, however, may not realise how varied are the factors which currently influence wine costs and prices. Although duties are minimal in much of Europe and the Americas, regular UK excise duty on a bottle of still table wine is Pounds 1.01 a bottle, regardless of quality. An additional customs duty of about 10p a bottle is levied on all still wines produced outside the EU (21p on sparkling wines). Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania have negotiated exemptions from this additional duty. Grapes, the raw material of wine, often cost very little indeed, especially workhorse grape varieties of which there is a surplus (La Mancha's Airen, for example) and the produce of heavily irrigated regions with high yields such as South America and the Australian Riverland: a few hundred US dollars a ton, or the equivalent of only 10p to 20p per bottle. Europe's mass market products, Liebfraumilch and Lambrusco, are traded even more cheaply, as commodities. At this bottom end of the market, the exchange rate can have as big an impact on cost as grape price. The costs of growing, picking, and processing grapes can be extremely low, either in those increasingly rare regions with low labour costs (South Africa and Portugal have been examples) or where most vineyard operations have been completely mechanised. (Australia, with a sparse rural population and sophisticated technology is the prime example.) Vines in damp climates are usually more expensive to keep healthy than those in hot, dry ones where the need for fungicides is minimal. Only when it comes to winemaking do costs vary considerably, according to wine style. Early drinking wines that need no expensive oak and can be bottled and sold young - 95 per cent of whites and 90 per cent of reds - are many times cheaper to make than wine of any colour matured in small oak barrels which are expensive to buy and maintain. A top quality new French oak barrel, amortised over three years' harvest, can today add between 30p and 60p to the production costs of a bottle of wine. (Oak chips are a much cheaper alternative.) Apart from the cellar techniques, white and pink wines should cost less to produce than reds since heavy irrigation and high yields are generally less obvious, or at least more bearable, than in red wines of which we demand a certain weight and colour intensity. (Energy costs are likely to be higher for white wines, however, as refrigeration is a more significant part of the production.) Packaging costs - generally bottling - tend to vary according to country. They are particularly high in Australia, thanks to the ACI glass monopoly. It would probably be cheaper to ship all Australian wine to Europe to be bottled before selling it - even in Australia, and more British retailers are having their cheaper Australian wines bottled using surplus bottling capacity in northern Europe. Bottling lines are often the most expensive long-term plant investment for a winery, justified only by high volume or extremely high quality and prices. Contract bottlers are more common in the new world; mobile bottling lines in the old. Increasingly squeezed on margins, producers have been trying to cut costs by using thinner glass and shorter corks. The cost of buying and running cooling equipment can be high in hotter wine regions far from manufacturing centres, notably Italy in the case of wine technology. However, many Italian manufacturers have been offering keen prices to producers in the emerging wine regions of eastern Europe and South America as orders have slowed from the developed markets of Europe and North America. In 1993, for example, Italy shipped Dollars 44m (Pounds 29.3m) worth of equipment to Chile, most of it to wineries. European wineries, particularly co-operatives, have benefited from interest-free loans and sometimes grants for equipment, leading to new world charges that the European wine industry is state subsidised. The wine industries of Spain and Portugal have been heavy beneficiaries of EU funding, which continues until 1996, and Portugal has been targeted by the World Bank for economic development. There are also price support mechanisms throughout the EU, including compulsory distillation of surplus wine, which is forcing up the price of basic Spanish table wine, Europe's wine bargain. EU producers of better quality wine are restricted, however, by limits on yields and all have to pay relatively high social costs. Transport costs are remarkably similar regardless of distance. Ocean freight costs are much lower than land transport costs and have been falling. The cost of shipping a container (1,100 cases of a dozen bottles) from Valparaiso to Hong Kong, for example, has fallen from Dollars 5,000 to Dollars 2,000. The Chileans claim they can ship a case of wine to New York cheaper than their California counterparts. Marketing costs for most wines are relatively minimal, with the exception of a handful of heavily promoted brands. There may be as much as Pounds 1m worth of marketing built in to a bottle of branded Liebfraumilch, for example. Retailers' margins are generally between 18 and 33 per cent, depending on turnover and market position. Supermarkets have become so powerful in the UK that they have often been able to demand that wine producers take the strain of small duty increases to maintain precious price points.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Lloyd's re-enters export credit insurance market After an absence of more than 70 years Lloyd's is to re-enter the export credit insurance market. Syndicate 33, managed by Hiscox, a prominent agent, said yesterday that it was to lead a new insurance facility through the Lloyd's market which would offer short-term cover against the insolvency or default of trade debtors, Christopher Price writes. Mr Neil Ross at the underwriter said that Hiscox's entry into the market would give exporters a wider choice and allow them to gain cover for both trade and political risk. He said, however, that he did not foresee the new competition having an impact on premiums. Income on export credit premiums is more than Dollars 1bn a year.</p>

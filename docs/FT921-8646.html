			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Germany cuts transatlantic phone charges DEUTSCHE TELEKOM, the German state telecommunications monopoly, is to cut transatlantic call charges by up to 37 per cent, and will investigate its entire tariff structure. The aim, according to the group, is to bring its charges closer into line with the demands of international competitiveness and justified costs. However, the drastic cuts in transatlantic charges, which will lower the cost of a three-minute call to New York from DM9.43 to DM5.98 (Pounds 2.08), follow strong pressure from both US and German industry. Deutsche Telekom, one of the last great bastions of state monopoly in telecommunications in the west, has been under attack from customers for its high international call charges, especially since both Britain and France have reduced their transatlantic tariffs. At the same time, Germany has faced US pressure to bring its charges into line as it is one of the largest net beneficiaries in the bilateral pooling of telecommunications income: far more calls are made from the US to Germany than vice versa because of the disparity in charges. Earlier this year the two governments agreed substantial cuts in the 'accounting rates', according to which the telecommunication income is divided. The Deutsche Telekom decision also includes the first step towards a 'radically new tariff structure' for leased lines. According to the new structure, lines for longer distances will become significantly cheaper while short-distance traffic will be more expensive. The charges will come into effect from July 1, but will make no overall difference to the organisation's income. In a second step, however, Deutsche Telekom said it intended to reform overall tariff levels for leased lines from January 1 1993. The group also decided to increase charges for cable TV connections by up to DM3 per home, arguing that the rate remained well below comparable levels in Sweden and France.</p>

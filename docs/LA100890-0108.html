			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALEXANDRA: THE PRINCESS AND THE PEDIGREE;  </P> <P> ROYALTY: SOUTHLAND WILL GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE MOST POPULAR AND ACCESSIBLE  MEMBER OF THE BRITISH ROYAL FAMILY THIS WEEK.  </P> <P> When she was a child, she liked to turn cartwheels and be called Sandra. Her  ambition was to be a circus bareback rider.  </P> <P> She did become an accomplished horsewoman, but these days, don't call her  anything but "your royal highness." Because Alexandra Helen Olga Christabel,  Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra, Hon. Lady Ogilvy, GCVO, has a richer  royal pedigree than the Queen of England.  </P> <P> When Princess Alexandra arrives in Southern California this week to lend the  British Royal Family's presence to the Festival of Britain in Orange County,  residents will get a look at not only the queen's first -- and favorite --  first cousin, but a descendant of King George V, King Edward VII, Queen  Victoria, King George I of Greece, King Christian IX of Denmark and the  ill-fated Czar Alexander II of Russia.  </P> <P> Although she is unknown to most Americans, in Britain, Alexandra is the most  popular and accessible of the royals.  </P> <P> Throughout her adult life she has taken on the role of what has come to be  known as the "professional princess," representing Britain and the Royal Family  at official engagements at home and abroad.  </P> <P> She wears the royal mantle lightly, however.  </P> <P> She is " . . . a woman of unstuffy charm and classic beauty, regal in presence  but highly accessible," author Ralph G. Martin wrote in his book, "Charles and  Diana." "When she was Diana's age, she was also known as a marvelous dancer, a  gay conversationalist who loved to laugh, adored children, had a craving for  sweets and was a ballet addict. Her favorite jazz piece was 'Ain't Misbehavin.'  "  </P> <P> But in her professional role, "she's got an enormous interest in whatever she's  doing. That's the main thing that comes across," said Sir Eldon Griffiths, a  member of Parliament who lives part time in Orange County, lectures at UCI and  is the president of the county office of the World Affairs Council. "She does  her homework and she's very well briefed. She, in fact, goes at it very hard."  </P> <P> The princess visited Los Angeles in 1971, in connection with a promotion of  British menswear. She will return briefly after her Orange County visit -- next  Monday and Tuesday -- to, among other things, meet with Mayor Tom Bradley,  visit Union Avenue Elementary School and observe a program for mothers of  children born with a crack addiction at County Harbor/UCLA Hospital.  </P> <P> Mona Mitchell, the princess' private secretary, said in a telephone interview  from London that Alexandra was delighted by her last visit to Southern  California and "thoroughly enjoys travel."  </P> <P> That sort of schedule has become meat and potatoes for most members of the  Royal Family, said John Houlton, a British vice consul based in Los Angeles.  "They take their profession quite seriously," he said. "We think the princess  in a sense serves in an ambassadorial role. She's a figurehead that people are  interested in meeting."  </P> <P> In a country of people whose ancestors absolutely hated King George III, modern  British royals often are received with the sort of adulation usually reserved  for rock stars.  </P> <P> "In California," said Griffiths, "royalty is a rarity and its scarcity value  gives it a much higher profile. There's a curiosity that is much more acute  here than in Britain."  </P> <P> Mere curiosity, however, does not fully explain the fawning looks that members  of the British Royal Family see turned on them when they come here.  </P> <P> "We find it intriguing, too. I have to say, that people in the U.S. -- and in  France, too, which is also a republic -- are so intrigued," said Houlton. "I  think that part of it is that the Royal Family are very much a national symbol  of something that has endured for centuries. It has an air of majesty and  romance to it. They're a symbol of permanence in a rather impermanent world  these days."  </P> <P> Princess Alexandra has felt the glare of celebrity almost all her life.  </P> <P> Born on Christmas Day, 1936, (her fourth name commemorates her birthday),  Alexandra is one of three children, and the only daughter, of Prince George and  Princess Marina, Duke and Duchess of Kent. Her birth, said her grandmother,  Queen Mary, was "the only nice thing to have happened this year" -- the year of  the abdication of Edward VIII.  </P> <P> She can trace her paternal lineage to Queen Victoria and, on her mother's side,  to Czar Alexander II of Russia. (Queen Elizabeth is descended from royalty only  on her father's side.)  </P> <P> Alexandra's father, the son of King George V and Queen Mary, died in 1942 in a  plane crash on his way to tour RAF bases in Iceland. The princess was raised at  Coppins, her family's country home in the Buckinghamshire village of Iver, by  her mother, who was a daughter of Prince Nicholas of Greece and his wife, the  former Grand Duchess Helen of Russia.  </P> <P> Though Alexandra's mother was known as one of the most stylish and glamorous  royals of her day, she enrolled her daughter as a student at Heathfield, an  exclusive English girls' boarding school, making Alexandra the first British  princess to attend a regular school.  </P> <P> She continued her formal education in 1953-54 at a finishing school in Paris,  staying with the family of the Count of Paris and studying French and music.  When she returned to England, she took a nursing course at the Great Ormond  Street Hospital for Sick Children in London, where she was known simply as  Nurse Kent.  </P> <P> By the late 1950s, Alexandra had begun to take on more official royal duties,  but she had also come to be known as the eligible young princess and began to  be seen more in London social circles.  </P> <P> Confrey Phillips, a English-born pianist who performs regularly at the Westin  South Coast Plaza Hotel in Costa Mesa and once played in London hotels and  nightclubs, remembered that during that time Alexandra was "a very likable  lady. At that time she was first sort of stepping out. She liked to be with  friends and have a nice social evening somewhere privately. When I had my  nightclub in Mayfair (The Colony on Berkeley Square) she'd come along with her  friends and a couple of times with her husband-to-be, although that hadn't been  announced at the time. She liked dancing and loved music."  </P> <P> She apparently loved Phillips' music, because Phillips said he and his trio  were hired to play at Buckingham Palace for the princess' 21st birthday  celebration.  </P> <P> "There were about 200 people there," said Phillips, "and it was a great  success, a great party. There was continuous dancing."  </P> <P> The dancing kept up, said Phillips, even when his band took a break. A group of  Princess Alexandra's friends who were amateur musicians acted as a relief band.  </P> <P> "She's not at all aloof," said Phillips. "She's very relaxed and always has a  lovely smile and a wonderful soft disposition about her. She's not wet and  frumpish like some of these aristocrats can be. She's the least forbidding  person you could meet."  </P> <P> During the time she knew Phillips, Alexandra also became acquainted with a  young commoner named Angus Ogilvy. Born in 1928, Ogilvy was the younger son of  the Earl of Airlie and grandson of Mabell, Countess of Airlie, who was a close  friend and lady-in-waiting to Alexandra's grandmother Queen Mary. After an  eight-year friendship, the princess and Ogilvy were married in Westminster  Abbey on April 24, 1963.  </P> <P> Ogilvy, by his own choice, was not catapulted into the aristocratic  stratosphere by his marriage to Alexandra. When the queen offered him an  earldom (a common practice when a princess marries someone of lesser rank),  Ogilvy refused.  </P> <P> "I don't see why I should get a peerage just because I married a princess," he  said at the time.  </P> <P> But the queen did confer a knighthood on Ogilvy in 1989, making him a Knight  Commander in the Royal Victorian Order. A businessman who is on the boards of  directors of several British companies, Ogilvy accompanies the princess on many  of her trips abroad (he will come with her to Southern California) and is  properly addressed as Sir Angus.  </P> <P> The Ogilvys have two children, James Robert Bruce, born in 1964 and now married  to Julia Rawlinson, and Marina Victoria Alexandra, born in 1966 and now married  to Paul Mowatt. Neither are titled and are not considered to be royal. Ogilvy  once underscored the somewhat hybrid nature of his immediate family by  referring to its members as "mini-royals" -- on the fringe of the queen's  immediate family.  </P> <P> Alexandra's many tours, duties and appearances -- Houlton estimated that she  has made 90 official foreign tours -- entitle her to receive money from the  Civil List, which is an allowance given to members of the Royal Family by  Parliament to help pay for staff and expenses.  </P> <P> "Much of the public wrongly assumes that all royals are rich," wrote Ralph  Martin. "Princess Alexandra . . . had no money of her own. Neither did Angus  Ogilvy, since his older brother inherited both the family title and the family  fortune."  </P> <P> Griffiths said he believes the princess was the first member of the Royal  Family to routinely drive herself from place to place and ride on the London  Underground, rather than be chauffeured. (In fact, in 1962, she crashed her  Austin Mini into a truck on London's Kensington High Street. She later admitted  she had been driving a bit too fast.)  </P> <P> Alexandra does, however, have an extensive collection of jewels that have come  to her through her royal relatives.  </P> <P> But the woman wearing the gems, so firmly rooted in royal tradition, apparently  has little use for any pretense that might be attached to them. In the midst of  the sometimes stifling pomp associated with royal appearances, she has shown a  sense of good-humored proportion.  </P> <P> "Don't forget," she said of the Royal Family in the 1960s, "that nowadays we  have to compete with Elizabeth Taylor and the Beatles."  </P> <P> Times Staff Writer Patt Morrison contributed to this story.  </P></p>

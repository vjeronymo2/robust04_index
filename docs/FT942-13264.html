			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: The best way forward for life insurance accounting Sir, Chris O'Brien's article on true and fair accounting for life insurance companies (Accountancy column, April 7), in which he seeks to promote the earned profits method, may give rise to some misconceptions among your readers. He accepts the role for embedded value as a good indicator of a company's progress in improving profits and this should not be underestimated. The method is used in the majority of life offices for measuring performance for management purposes and is almost universally used as a basis for valuing existing policies when a company is sold. The first point which may not be fully appreciated by many of your readers is that the embedded value method has gained much acceptance in published accounts particularly among bancassurers; for example, it is used for reporting profits of the life insurance subsidiaries in the group accounts of Abbey National, Barclays, Lloyds, Midland, NatWest and TSB, giving much more meaningful information than traditional solvency-based accounting. Other companies, such as Prudential and BAT, have published information at group level computed under the 'accruals method', a different but not wholly dissimilar method, in order to give more realistic information on their performance. The second possible misconception arises from the statement that embedded values (or, indeed, the accruals method) include profit from future performance. Current period profits do reflect an estimation of future cash flows but this is no different from many accounting principles applicable to the generality of companies. Finally, the Association of British Insurers is developing accounting recommendations which will enable life insurers to satisfy the new true and fair requirements. In my opinion, this can easily be achieved by removing the main distortions from the traditional solvency-based method, by requiring the deferral and amortisation of new business costs and by the release of undisclosed reserves. While this, the modified statutory method, should satisfy the majority, if not all, of life offices for the purposes of their own accounts, the ABI's recommendations should not preclude the provision of information on alternative bases at holding company level. This appears to me to be an eminently sensible way forward but what is needed is a consensus on the alternative to the modified statutory method. While Chris O'Brien's earned profit method is an interesting approach, I consider that, given the stage which has been reached in the debate, the appropriate alternative method is a combination of the embedded value and accruals methods.

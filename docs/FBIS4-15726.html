			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>   [Text] United Nations April 12 TASS -- It has been learned  here from sources within U.N. lobbies that Russia's permanent  representative on the United Nations Yuliy Vorontsov expressed  profound regret, during a consultative meeting of the Security  Council, that Russia was informed "post factum" on the decision  to use military aircraft in the area of the Bosnian town of  Gorazde. The Russian delegate called for an urgent report of the  U.N. secretary-general to the Security Council on the details of  the event.    The Russian side insistently demands explanations from the  U.N. Secretariat on the practical implementation of the  procedure for using military aircraft, envisaged by the  council's decisions, including the need to hold consultations  with its members. It wants to know what concrete targets were  subjected to air strikes and what were the results of these  blows, etc. The Russian side also wants to know whether there  were victims among the civilian population.    Vorontsov stressed the impermissibility of violating the  resolutions adopted by the Security Council on "safety enclaves"  in Bosnia and Herzegovina, noting that, at the same time, it was  wrong to connive at Muslim provocations, which were repeatedly  recorded by U.N. representatives. He referred to the Security  Council's call to all the sides involved in the conflict to stop  provocations, contained in the latest statement by the council  chairman, released on April 6. Vorontsov called for urgent  measures in the Gorazde area -- the deployment there of U.N.  troops, withdrawal of Serb units from their present positions,  demilitarisation of this "safety enclave", including the  disarmament of Muslim units now active there.    Vorontsov stressed that the Russian side believed it was the  duty of the Security Council to actively contribute to the  achievement of these goals. He noted that Russia, as a direct  and active participant of the Bosnian settlement, wanted to  prevent the escalation of this conflict and expected more  vigorous efforts by the world community to indicate the way to  peace to all the sides involved in the conflict.</p>

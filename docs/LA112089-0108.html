Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> L.A.-BOUND AIRLINER FORCED BACK TO EMERGENCY LANDING IN BOSTON  </P> <P> A Los Angeles-bound American Airlines flight carrying 165 people returned to  Logan International Airport for an emergency landing this morning when smoke  was detected in a rear cargo bin, airport officials said.  </P> <P> Passengers and crew used emergency ramps to leave the aircraft after it  returned without incident about five minutes after takeoff, said spokesman  Maynard Scarborough of Massport, which operates the airport.  </P> <P> Four people suffered minor injuries during the evacuation and were taken to  hospitals, Scarborough said. The 156 passengers included four infants; nine  crew members were also aboard.  </P> <P> The smoke was detected just after the plane left Logan, and it immediately  returned, landing at 9:23 a.m.  </P> <P> Mary O'Neill, a spokeswoman for the airline, said she didn't know what might  have gone wrong after the Airbus A-300 took off. "This is a very reliable  aircraft . . . and is less than 2 years old," she said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 INJURED IN COLLISION NEAR IRVINE;  </P> <P> ACCIDENT: A TEEN-AGER LOSES CONTROL OF HIS CAR ON JEFFREY ROAD AND HITS A SEDAN  CARRYING A WOMAN AND HER SON, CHP SAYS.  </P> <P> Three people were injured, one critically, when a 17-year-old youth lost  control of his car Saturday on Jeffrey Road near Irvine and crashed into an  oncoming sedan carrying a woman and her son, authorities said.  </P> <P> Officials closed Jeffrey Road for 90 minutes between Irvine Boulevard and  Trabuco Road as emergency crews removed the victims.  </P> <P> Eleanor Young, 46, of Irvine suffered severe head injuries and both of her legs  were broken, according to Orange County Fire Capt. Dan Young, who helped  supervise the removal of victims from the wreckage. She was listed in critical  condition late Saturday at UCI Medical Center in Orange.  </P> <P> Her son, 12, whose name was withheld because of his age, sustained a broken arm  but no other apparent injuries, Young said. The boy also was treated at UCI  Medical Center.  </P> <P> The 17-year-old, whose name was not released, suffered facial cuts and a broken  hip and legs and was flown to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in  Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> Based on observations by Dan Young and comments from a spokeswoman for the  California Highway Patrol, this is what happened:  </P> <P> At 12:48 p.m., the 17-year-old was traveling on Jeffrey Road, just north of  Irvine Boulevard, a semi-rural stretch bordered by an orange grove. He drifted  to his right, losing control of his 1983 Mazda. In an attempt to regain  control, he over-corrected to the left, colliding head-on with the car carrying  the mother and her son, who were traveling in a 1985 Volvo sedan.  </P> <P> Firefighter Young said Eleanor Young was removed after 10 minutes and taken to  the hospital. Crews had to slice off the top of the Mazda and use the hydraulic  "jaws of life" to free the 17-year-old, Young said.  </P></p>

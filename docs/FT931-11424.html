			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Frankfurt dissident targets Emu again MR Reimut Jochimsen, a leading Bundesbank official, yesterday took further aim at the Maastricht treaty by saying that Germany was being 'forced' into economic and monetary union. Confirming a reputation for outspokenness which has attracted criticism from the Bonn government, Mr Jochimsen said Emu 'was more forced on the Germans than that we wanted it'. Speaking at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, Mr Jochimsen singled out the French government as the main force behind the drive for a single currency. The quest for monetary union had been a 'recurrent' feature of French politics since 1973, he said. Mr Jochimsen, president of the North Rhine-Westphalia central bank, said the present franc-D-Mark exchange rate was in line with the fundamentals in the French economy. But he called on Bonn's partners to 'depoliticise' exchange rate changes in the European monetary system. In a pointed reference to recent attacks on 'speculators' by Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, Mr Jochimsen called operators on currency markets 'portfolio managers and investors'. He said he did not want to use methods of the French revolution against them. Mr Jochimsen, a heavyweight member of the Social Democratic party, has earned the ire of both the Bonn government and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, since he joined the Bundesbank council in 1990. In August 1992 he caused controversy by stating, in remarks prepared for a speech in Dusseldorf, that EMS members were shunning realignments for 'prestige' reasons. Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in the Bonn Finance Ministry, took Mr Jochimsen to task this week for having criticised the government's recent efforts to cut spending.</p>

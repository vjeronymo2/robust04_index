			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev 12 May TASS -- "We all are overwhelmed with  the warmest feelings towards the Russian people and its  legislators," the Ukrainian newly-elected parliament said in  today's address to the Russian State Duma.    In their address, issued at the parliament's first session,  Ukrainian lawmakers said they strongly believed in mutual  understanding and ability of both parliaments to settle  differences between newly-independent states by means of  reasonable political bargaining and compromises not infringing  upon the vital interests of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples.    It is noteworthy that Ukrainian lawmakers unanimously agreed  with the wording of the telegram, but radical nationalists  demanded that the telegram be written in the Ukrainian language,  which is still unlikely to change the content of the address.</p>

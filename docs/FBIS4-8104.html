			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Dr. Janez Drnovsek, prime minister and  president of Liberal Democracy of Slovenia, dedicated the first  part of today's news conference to the international activity of  our country. According to him, Slovenia has won considerable  recognition recently. Brussels supported our country's becoming  an associate member of the European Union, while NATO, after the  signing of the Partnership for Peace agreement, expressed full  readiness for cooperation with us. Praise for the improving  economic situation could also be heard from the leading  international economists. The prime minister also analyzed the  domestic political situation thoroughly. Sandi Frelih reports:    [Begin recording] [Frelih] [passage omitted] Regarding the  political situation, the prime minister says that, after last  night's departure of the Social Democrats from the government,  all three major parliamentary parties are analyzing the  situation, by which they will try to redefine the relations  between the coalition partners in such a way that the coalition  could function until the end of its mandate.    [Drnovsek] A wider parliamentary support suits me, as prime  minister, more--therefore, the support of all three biggest  parties, which gives me a certain majority in the parliament.  Of course, all this is on the condition that their mutual  differences can be settled in such a way that the efficient  functioning of the government and parliament would be possible.  If this wider option does not materialize--that is, if one of  the partners can no longer participate in the tripartite  coalition--we will consider the next best option, that is, the  option that would secure the most stable work of the government.    [Frelih] [passage omitted] When asked about the  participation of the Christian Democrats as a government party  at the anticorruption rally, Drnovsek replied that the party  president, Lojze Peterle, had assured him that the rally was not  a meeting directed against the government.    [Drnovsek] [words indistinct] the assurances that the  president of the Christian Democrat,s Mr. Peterle, gave to  me--that is, that if the party takes part it will under no  circumstances participate in an antigovernment meeting because  it is a government party and bears the responsibility for all  the hitherto events, and so does Mr. Jansa, who was a member of  this government for four years and who, because of the duration  of his mandate and his post, had more scope to influence affairs  than I had in my two years of work in this government. Mr.  Peterle, too, enjoys a rather long mandate in this government as  do other Christian Democrats. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

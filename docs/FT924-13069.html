			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Milan's recent rise perplexes the analysts - Haig Simonian asks whether this is the start of a long-awaited recovery, or just a technical rebound A big question mark is keeping Italy's equity analysts and investors awake at nights. Does this week's sharp recovery in the Milan stock market signal the long-awaited turning point after its long decline or is it just a technical rebound? 'More mileage in Milan?,' asks Ms Marie-Christine Keith of County NatWest in London, in her latest market briefing. The consensus among analysts is that the latest surge in share prices, which saw the Comit index jump by 20.13 points or 5.1 per cent to 417.70 this week, is largely technical, supported by a smattering of special situations. But a few brokers believe that the climb could turn into a stampede if sentiment among Italian investors swings in favour of equities. The main reason for the scepticism is that fundamentals remain very poor. 'Judging by the surge in prices, you'd think Italy had turned the corner,' says Ms Keith. This week saw some parliamentary progress on the government's 1993 budget plans, while there was only a lukewarm response to the general strike called by union leaders. But the Italian economy is hardly out of the woods. Even assuming that the budget is approved by the end of next month, the prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, will remain on a knife edge. His successful use of confidence motions to pass legislation has shown that members of parliament are unwilling to topple the government. But with a majority of just 16 seats in the lower house, his coalition remains at risk. Short-term interest rates have edged down, raising expectations of a cut in the Bank of Italy's discount rate. However, the Bank will not want to risk a run on the lira, and analysts do not expect a reduction before the budget is passed. Long-term interest rates remain high, reflecting continuing concerns about currency risk and rising inflation. Devaluation will help some companies' earnings next year. Mr Massimo Cenci, of the Milan brokers Milla-Sommariva, thinks that the market has not paid enough attention to the potential boost. One leading bank estimates that gross operating profits should rise by 20 per cent in 1993 thanks to the currency's fall. But other analysts think the outlook for profits remains bleak. 'The first half has been awful and we know what to expect for the year,' says one. Mr Sergio Pigoli, of Pastorino in Milan, is particularly bearish about the overall economic outlook. He admits that devaluation will help a handful of companies such as Benetton and Eridania, which produce partly outside Italy, and are heavy exporters. Insurers with strong foreign earnings such as Ras and Generali also stand to gain. However, higher inflation on account of the devaluation, high interest rates and a slowing economy will have a 'dramatic effect' on corporate earnings next year, he says. Combined with the new tax on companies' shareholders' funds, there will be a 'drastic cut' in profits. Why then has the market risen so strongly? The cause is partly technical. Though turnover went up, especially in mid-week, the previous low volumes have exaggerated the climb in prices. Moreover, many professionals have been short of stock. 'Until recently, the market was oversold,' says Mr Pigoli. Milan has also regained some of the speculative fizz that evaporated over the summer, when negative news like Moody's decision to downgrade the state's credit rating and the bungled handling of the Efim liquidation seriously undermined the country's credibility. Since then, the market has received a fillip from privatisation news and plans to suspend capital gains tax for one year. Speculative trading is most active in privatisation stocks, notably Credito Italiano and Nuovo Pignone. Yesterday, shares in Credito Italiano were suspended for an excessive price rise of 9.3 per cent, following news late on Thursday that its parent Iri would hold a competitive, international auction for the sale of a stake in the bank. Apart from real or imagined privatisation candidates, Milan's 'special situations' also include a host of private-sector companies in which investors expect a change in ownership. Fiat tops the list. The admission by its chairman, Mr Gianni Agnelli, that the company may have to sell non-strategic holdings, such as Rinascente, the department stores group, Toro, the insurance company or the Cogefar-Impresit construction concern has powered a surge in their share prices. Fiat's stock has also risen on the back of perpetual rumours about a deal with a Japanese car maker, Toyota being the name which crops up the most. Though regularly denied by all concerned, such gossip has pushed Fiat's share price up by 6.3 per cent this week. Other stocks in the spotlight include Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, Italy's biggest private-sector bank. Confirmation that two of the five members of its shareholders' pact want to sell has fuelled speculation about a possible takeover. Questions have also been raised about the future of Grassetto, the construction group controlled by Mr Salvatore Ligresti, the Sicilian property tycoon still languishing in a Milanese jail on alleged corruption charges. However, few analysts believe that speculation is enough to keep the market rising. 'It's not yet a real turnround,' says Mr Michael Ierubino, of Milan broker Murchio. 'All we've seen is a return of domestic bargain-hunters based partly on bullish views about the suspension of capital gains tax.' Ms Keith agrees. 'There will be a consolidation since the the market has gone up too far, too fast,' she says. Rather than expecting the bourse to fall back to last month's most depressed levels, analysts believe that shares will give up only part of their recent gains. After all, foreign buyers may still be cautious, but Italian equities have now become even cheaper in foreign currency terms thanks to the lira's fall.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: Bund prices lead widespread rally in Europe German government bonds opened sharply higher on news of last weekend's wage settlement in the German engineering sector, pulling the rest of Europe up with them. While some of those gains were eroded by intra-day profit-taking, bonds firmed again in the afternoon on the back of buoyant US Treasuries to close up to a point higher on the day. Again, activity was mostly futures-driven, with long-term investors still on the sidelines. 'The market remains very fragile and nervous,' said a London bond salesman. Bunds opened sharply higher on the engineering wage deal, which was widely seen to facilitate further cuts in German short-term interest rates. This feeling was reinforced by comments from Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, who said that if the wage situation stabilises further, there would be more room for interest rate cuts. All eyes are now on the Bundesbank, which is due to call for bids today on its latest round of securities repurchase agreements, for allocation tomorrow. While some traders are hoping for a fixed-rate repo significantly below last week's minimum rate of 5.97 per cent, most expect another variable-rate repo, where banks bid the rate they are willing to pay. In the likely event of a variable-rate repo, 'the German banks will probe the downside on rates,' predicted Mr Stephen Dulake, bond strategist at PaineWebber, who expects the minimum rate to fall by around five basis points. However, some say cuts in German short-term rates are unlikely to give the longer maturities a big boost. 'The long end of the (bund) market has decoupled from monetary policy,' said Mr Kirit Shah, international market strategist at First Boston. 'Bundesbank easing may prompt brief rallies at the long end, but nothing sustainable.' Moreover, he says rallies are likely to trigger more selling from investors still holding long bund positions. 'I think there's still quite a bit of selling yet to materialise.' The June Bund futures contract stood at 97.24 in late trading, up 0.96 point on the day. French bonds staged a strong rally, triggered by the rise in bunds and further fuelled by strong overseas buying in the futures pits. The March notional bond future ended at 126.68, up 1.46 point on the day. UK gilts were also pulled higher by bunds, with traders reporting some cautious investor buying. However, some participants said the rally could be short-lived. 'I'm not sure I trust this - it all seems a bit too easy,' said a gilt salesman. 'If we don't get a decent cut in the (German) repo rate, it could all go sour again.' The June long gilt future rose 1 1/4 points to 112 25/32 , off slightly from its intra-day high of 112 31/32 . Europe's high-yielders, Spain and Italy, also posted gains but slightly underperformed their core counterparts. The Italian March bond futures contract on Liffe rose by 0.56 points to 112.74. The Spanish March bond future, traded in Madrid, rose to 102.40, up 0.57 points. US Treasury prices firmed across the maturity range yesterday in the wake of stronger overseas bond markets and lower crude oil prices. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was below its high for the day, up  11/32 at 93 1/16 and yielding 6.793 per cent. The two-year note was only slightly firmer, up  1/32 at 99 17/32 , to carry a yield of 4.859 per cent. In the absence of fresh US economic statistics, the market took an early lead from European markets. There, bond prices had rebounded following the news that a strike by German metal workers had been averted by a last-minute wage settlement with employers. Prices advanced further later in the morning as the market reacted to a notable decline in oil prices. Some short-covering also contributed to the upward move. Later in the day, however, the market struggled to hold on to its gains and bonds gradually eased back off their earlier highs.</p>

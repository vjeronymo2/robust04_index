			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Potosi correspondent Mario Mamani Morales] </F>   [Text] 14 February -- When assuming office as the new  national leader of the General Trade Union Confederation of  Bolivian Peasant Workers [CSTUCB], Felix Santos Zambrana  emphatically said: "We are going to launch a strong offensive  against small estates [as published] in Bolivia so that lands  may revert to their original owners--the peasantry." Santos was  elected CSTUCB leader during a convention held in Cochabamba.    The new leader stated that the problem of land will be one  of  his overriding concerns as CSTUCB leader.    According to data provided by this trade union, there are  approximately 36 million hectares of arable land in Bolivia, of  which only 4 million are owned by true peasants; the remaining  32 million hectares have been given away to the big landowners  or large estate owners, especially in the departments of Pando,  Beni, and Santa Cruz.    With regard to this issue, Santos explained that "there are,  however, 3 million of us peasants who are affiliated with the  CSTUCB, and who are demanding that we be given lands so as to be  able to eke out a living. We are not asking for a present, but  rather to be given back what has always belonged to us."    While a few big landowners have control of most of the land  in Bolivia, more than a million Bolivian peasants are tilling  others' lands in Argentina and Chile. "Need has led them to  grovel for a job in other nations, which they enrich because  they have no future in the land of their forefathers."    According to Santos, an average of 45 Bolivians emigrate to  Argentina every day from Potosi Department alone. Even though  most of them are illiterate peasants, they are skillful  agricultural workers. Argentine ranchers are thus exploiting  this situation to their own advantage.    Santos stated that in order to put an end to this situation,  the CSTUCB will further a policy of dialogue with the government  so as to effect a land reform that will enable thousands of  peasants to settle in lands located in eastern Bolivia, where  there are projects under way providing technical, agricultural,  health, and education support.    "If they do not pay heed to our demands, we will then be  forced to invade the land given out to big landowners, who  moreover do not cultivate it," he asserted.    According to Santos, Law 1008 is an enemy to coca growers  but  not to drug traffickers. "Peasants are maltreated, persecuted,  killed, their homes are burned down, their organizations are  intervened with, while drug traffickers themselves go  unscathed," he says.    He contends that the jails are packed with peasants who have  been driven by hunger to engage in processing drugs, whereas  wealthy drug kingpins who bribe authorities never have to go  through difficult moments if they are ever caught.    Santos is of the opinion that "coca ought to be processed  and  exported, whether as pharmaceutical products or for other  legally accepted uses, and for these drugs Bolivia should get  export earnings that favor peasants through legal channels."    This is the first time in 17 years that CSUTCB has entrusted  its leadership to a Quechua Indian.    The CSUTCB was established on 26 June 1979, and has been  headed by Aymara leaders from La Paz Department for 14 years.  Only once was it headed by an Aymara from Oruro City (Juan de  la Cruz Villca). Chapaco, Camba, and Quechua Indians have never  had a seat in the union's executive board.    Santos advocates that his new management strategy will seek  to "be the bulwark of a multicultural Bolivian state, which we  will seek to establish through the integration and strengthening  of Aymara, Guarani, Chapaco, Camba, and Quechua Indian cultures."    He told LA RAZON that the "military-peasant pact" made with  the help of civilians during the past military regimes was a red  herring to carve up the land, "but the time has come for us to  struggle to have our grievances met once and for all."    The multicultural state that he proposes will consist of  achieving the full representation for all nationalities existing  in Bolivian territory, through the establishment of "Assemblies  of Nationalities" first, and then of a great peasant  organization.    Santos stated that "there are qualified people among us  peasants. We have become aware of the reality that involves 500  years of exploitation and pillage of our natural resources, our  lands, and we have decided that we have had enough of so much  humiliation."</p>

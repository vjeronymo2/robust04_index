			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Nuclear electricity Would-be nuclear entrepreneurs must be chewing their fingernails as they wait for the government's much-delayed review of the industry. At one extreme, the review could result in nuclear power being allowed to wither away. Still, Nuclear Electric seems happy enough and is arguing strongly for privatisation. After the debacle of 1989, its renewed ambition to be privatised seems more than a little fanciful. Solid progress has, however, been made since the plug was pulled on nuclear privatisation. Productivity has improved, due in large part to the more reliable operation of the stations. Generating costs are now much closer to those of gas or cleaned-up coal plant. At least as importantly, progress has been made in identifying the scale of the decommissioning costs which so scared the City last time. There are still substantial uncertainties which need to be cleared up. A second bungled attempt to get into the private sector might well be fatal. Issues such as the allocation of liabilities, fixed price fuel and reprocessing contracts, the option to store spent fuel and caps on disaster risk would need to be sorted out. If these could be satisfactorily resolved, it is at least conceivable that part of the existing industry could be sold. It is less certain that such a privatised industry could carry the risks of building a Pounds 3bn new station over 10 years. For that, shareholders would require equity returns which Nuclear Electric would be hard-pressed to offer. Bankers might also demand some guarantee about the end market for the electricity. But that is not likely to be, given any government being sufficiently market-oriented to privatise the industry in the first place.</p>

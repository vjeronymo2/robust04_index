			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICHAEL MILKEN, THE MAN;  </P> <P> A GRATEFUL FRIEND DESCRIBES HIM AS COMPASSIONATE AND CARING  </P> <P> His name and photo seem to be in every newspaper and on every news broadcast  these days. Yet for all the thousands of words spoken and written about Michael  Milken, no one has succeeded in providing an accurate picture of the man he is;  lamentably, few have bothered to try.  </P> <P> I've known Mike Milken since 1982. Over the years, he has shown himself to me  to be a forthright and honorable businessman and, no less important, a  sensitive and compassionate human being. I am proud to call him my friend.  </P> <P> What angers me most is seeing this man so largely misunderstood and so harshly  condemned because he challenged the system and created change in a world too  often satisfied with complacency.  </P> <P> I believe in Milken's integrity and his courage because I've seen both in  action. He helped me realize a dream that began as a hideous nightmare when my  daughter, then six years old, was diagnosed with bone cancer.  </P> <P> My first deal with Milken was completed in May, 1983, when he helped me  reacquire my dialysis companies and launch my new company, Salick Health Care.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unprecedented Venture  </P> <P> Less than a month later, my family and I received the devastating news of my  daughter's cancer. The enthusiasm and eagerness that goes along with the  prospects of exciting new business challenges vanished.  </P> <P> In searching for treatment for my daughter, I traveled across this country and  got a discouraging personal lesson in the woeful inadequacy of most cancer  treatment centers.  </P> <P> Convenience to patients and their families was a low priority, treatment was  available when the health-care facility decided to make it available, and most  cancer care services were provided in a hospital setting with all the expense  and inefficiencies associated with such care.  </P> <P> I realized what needed to be done before consciously making the decision to do  it. There was a desperate need in this country for full-service,  state-of-the-art, outpatient cancer diagnostic and treatment centers. I wanted  to fulfill that need.  </P> <P> This was an unprecedented business venture, no one had ever tried it before.  The start-up costs were staggering. After considering various sources of  financing, (banks, investment bankers, a public offering, venture capital,  etc.), I selected a combination leveraged buyout, merger and private placement  with sophisticated investors.  </P> <P> When I went to Milken with my vision for what I believed had to be the future  for cancer care treatment, he immediately recognized the need and believed in  it. He based his decision to raise the funds for my business on my 15-year  record as a doctor and my reputation as a successful businessman.  </P> <P> Within months of presenting my concept to him, he made it happen.  </P> <P> What does this say about Mike Milken? Consistent with his character, he defies  convention to support what he believes in. He is not afraid of what does not  exist or what flies in the face of conventional wisdom. He is challenged by the  possibility of creating new ventures that fulfill a need and serve the  community.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Desire to See People Succeed  </P> <P> The idea that business supersedes all else in his life at the cost of human  relationships is absurd. When I would call to discuss our business transaction  with him, he would allow me to go no further after saying hello until he found  out about my daughter. (She's now 13, and doing very well.)  </P> <P> When I expressed concern about potential fears of other investors if I were to  be totally absorbed in a family health crisis, he would brush my concerns  aside, urging me to concentrate only on my child's health. "Nothing else," he'd  say, "is nearly as important."  </P> <P> Is this a man whose vision blinds him to everything but money matters? I think  not.  </P> <P> One of Milken's most extraordinary characteristics is his desire to see people  succeed in their field of endeavor. When asked, he lends his encouragement and  guidance whether he is involved with your business or not. He takes pride in  people's accomplishment. He enjoys seeing -- and helping -- human potential  become human accomplishment. This is a precious attribute sadly missing in many  who selfishly hoard success, and all its residual benefits, for themselves.  </P> <P> The things I say about Milken are not speculation or hearsay or taken from  third-party interviews. They are from firsthand experience with a man who  deserves not ridicule and public debasement but some degree of respect and  admiration for resuscitating the entrepreneurial and human spirit that should  be at the heart of the American system of free enterprise.  </P></p>

VAC economy, which is known  in Vietnam by three initials, V for orchard or garden, A for  fish pond and C for live-stock breeding, appeared in the country  where there remained agricultural cooperatives. The income of  families from VAC economy then only made up 5-7 per cent of  their total income.    Over the past recent 10 years, VAC economy developed rapidly  with the move towards a market economy.    According to Mr Nguyen Ngoc Triu, special envoy of the prime  minster and president of the Vietnam Gardeners' Association  (Vacvina), more than 60 per cent of the farmer households'  income is from VAC economy. He estimated this was worth about  10 million VND [Vietnam dong] per year each. The total income  of 10 million households engaged in VAC economy throughout the  country is about USD [U.S. dollars] 10 billion per year.    With the present development, VAC is a major part of the  agriculture-forestry economy of Vietnam, contributing to the  diversification of agricultural produce, creating a new strategy  for agricultural and rural development.    Many households are doing farming, gardening or  afforestation  on tens or even hundreds of hectares of land. Those who are  engaged in aquaculture have broadened their business to lakes,  channels and even rivers, covering tens or hundreds of hectares.  Others have set up snake farms, chicken farms, deer, cattle or  pig farms.    Vacvina has taken part in a national programme of reclaiming  10 million hectares of waste land and bare hills to incrsease  arable lands and create more jobs.    Under an agriculture promotion programme, the state and  vacvina are helping households engaged in VAC economy in  providing capital, technology, and products processing and  marketing.    Many households have sucessfully developed VAC economy.  Fifty thousand households in the Mekong River delta, for  instance, have become rich thanks to VAC economy. Some of them  are Vietnamese `billionaires'. In Tien Giang Province, people  work on 40,000 ha of gardens (or 20 percent of the province's  cultivated land). Their VAC output value accounts more than 20  per cent of the province's total crop production. They have  earned annually hundreds of billions of VND from selling plants  and fruits.    In the coastal districts of Tien Hai and Thai Thuy, Thai  Binh  Province, people have invested big capital in reclaiming coastal  marshes for production and earned hundreds of billion VND a  year. They invested hundreds of billion VND in aquaculture,  yielding from 100-150 million VND a year.    In the northern mountain province of Son La, about 2,600  households are engaged in fruit tree planting. Their income  from fruits is a dozen times over rice and maize cultivation.    Particularly, more than 4,000 households of war veterans in  central province of Quang Tri, the most impoverished land in the  country, the farmers have earned between 15-40 million VND from  VAC economy.    As VAC economy had helped in providing daily nutritious  foods  for aged people and children, UNICEF had decided to surport and  provide vacvina with material assistance.</p>

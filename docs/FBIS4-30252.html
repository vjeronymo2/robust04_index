			<p>BFN     [Text] Kwangju, June 23 (YONHAP) -- The South Cholla  Province police here on Thursday afternoon ceased to ferret out  the Namchongnyon students involved in the recent violence and  withdrew riot police from numerous road check points in the  outlying areas of Kwangju.    The police had been rounding up those students actively  involved in the commandeering of a passenger train near here and  subsequent violent clashes with police in Seoul over the weekend.    So far, 185 students were caught, of whom 38 were placed  under arrest and 25 others booked without physical restraint.  Nine were still being questioned and 113 were set free, a  police source said.    The stoppage of the police action came hours after a group  of  civic leaders in Kwangju called at both the police and the  Namchongnyon student organization.    Meeting with South Cholla Police Commissioner An Pyong-uk at  his police office, the civic leaders asked him to refrain from  using his police force excessively.    Also calling on Namchongnyon Chairman Yang Tong-hun at  Choson  University, they stressed that apart from the cause of the  recent incident, it would be proper for his organization to  admit to mistakes displayed in the course.    The nine met over breakfast Thursday morning and decided to  mediate between the police and students. They included Profs.  Myong No-kun and Yi Kwang-u of Chonnam University, Lawyer Yi  Ki-hong and Catholic Father Cho Pius.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondents Yang Runshi (2799 3387 2514), and Zhang </F> Kuanming (1728 1401 2494)]    [Text] Nanjing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- "Law enforcement  departments must work hard to build a social environment  favorable to reform, opening up, and economic development."  This was what Ren Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee  Secretariat and secretary of the CPC Central Committee Committee  of Politics and Law, repeatedly stressed during his inspection  tour of Jiangsu.    From 8 to 16 June, Comrade Ren Jianxin inspected Jiangsu and  chaired the national conference on comprehensive management of  public security in rural areas. Accompanied by Li Peiyou,  president of the Jiangsu Higher People's Court, Ren Jianxin  inspected Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Nanjing during and after  the conference [hui hou 2585 0683]. He also had meetings with  local party and government leaders and comrades of law  enforcement departments, heard briefings, had informal meetings  with the local police, and gave important speeches.    In his speeches, Ren Jianxin urged law enforcement  departments to continue to uphold the "crackdown" principle and  by no means waver or slacken their efforts. He said:  Proceeding from the actual state of public security, we must  constantly sum up our experience, intensify our crackdown  measures, increase the crackdown intensity, and, according to  law, harshly and promptly crack down on crimes which jeopardize  public security. He added: We must earnestly follow through  with the guidelines laid down by the recent national conference  on comprehensive management of public security in rural areas.  He said: Comprehensive management of public security is a  great innovative undertaking China has launched to maintain  social stability. Law enforcement departments must create a  good social environment through cracking down on crime and  comprehensive management of public security.    Ren Jianxin pointed out: We must proceed with the fight  against serious economic crimes. During the second half of the  year, law enforcement departments must work in close  coordination with various other departments in cracking down on  major economic crimes, especially corruption, bribery, financial  fraud, and smuggling. To deepen the anticorruption struggle, we  must publicize those major cases as soon as they have been  prosecuted and verdicts on them have been announced.    Wherever his inspection tour took him, Ren Jianxin stressed:  "We must enforce the law seriously, handle all cases  impartially, and firmly combat local protectionism." He said:  During my current inspection tour, I have been informed by  various quarters in all places that local protectionism is  serious. We must attach great importance to this problem. He  added: If we cannot enforce law impartially and if we tolerate  local protectionism, not only will we fail to protect local  economic interests, but we will also infringe the interests of  the state, and even impair our own image in international  economic relations and trade.    Ren Jianxin pointed out: While we want to open wider to the  outside world and bring in more foreign capital, we must have a  stable social environment, good technology, and a good  infrastructure; moreover, we must also have an effective legal  system. We must impartially handle economic disputes at home as  well as those disputes involving foreign concerns, and we must  protect the legitimate rights and interests of various parties  concerned on an equal footing according to law.    "Managing the police strictly and building stronger police  force contingents" is another priority which Ren Jianxin  underscored during his inspection tour in Jiangsu. He said: We  must firmly combat the unethical conduct of a small number of  law enforcement personnel. Law enforcers who have violated law  and discipline must be firmly dealt with. Effective measures  must be devised to increase the fighting power of law  enforcement personnel so that they will become the bulwark on  which the party and the people can depend and which can maintain  social stability.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Kenneth Clarke's comments on interest rates rise Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, commenting on the rise in interest rates, said: 'After my monthly discussion with the governor (of the Bank of England), I have decided to increase interest rates by half per cent, in order to sustain economic recovery with low inflation. This decision is in line with my clear policy of taking no risks with inflation. The governor decided to implement the change immediately because there were no reasons for delay and he wanted to avoid market uncertainties. 'Underlying inflation is currently 2.0 per cent, the lowest level for 27 years and well below the European average. We need to ensure that inflation remains low, so that the recovery is sustained, and leads to higher living standards and secure jobs. The only way to make sure inflation stays low is to act in good time. 'I raised interest rates by half per cent in September in order to take no risks with inflation. This further rise today is the right response to continuing indications in the last few months of inflationary pressures as growth has strengthened. I intend to deliver the plans I announced in the Budget to return the PSBR to balance and to make the economy perform better. Together with these plans, this move in interest rates will help to underpin a healthy and sustained recovery.'</p>

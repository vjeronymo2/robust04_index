			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Bolting for the exit Since the US Federal Reserve started to raise short-term interest rates in February, global markets have acquired a sporadic habit of lurching down in tandem. Yet this week's synchronised market upset was precipitated not by the Fed or the Bundesbank, but by interest rate rises in Sweden and Italy. The merits of the Swedes and Italians are many and various; but since when have markets taken their cue from the Riksbank and the Bank of Italy? True, this was a European rather than a global nudge downwards. On Thursday when the rot set in, Japan defied the trend in equities and bonds, while the US fell in response to poor domestic retail sales figures. To give Wall Street its due, it has internationalised itself to an unprecedented degree over the past decade. But the Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week will rightly take precedence over events in Scandinavia or Italy. Yet even at a European level the market slide raises several questions. The rate increases were said by the monetary authorities of Sweden and Italy to be designed, respectively, to address inflationary pressure and to defend the currency. But the markets' immediate reaction was to depress the krona and the lira, thereby undermining these twin objectives. As for the rationalisations offered by analysts for the synchronised nature of the fall, they look unconvincing. Suggestions that the central banks' decisions heralded the end of monetary easing in Europe look speculative. The Bundesbank is Europe's de facto monetary authority, and it operates largely on the basis of German domestic considerations, not those in Sweden or Italy. What is clear about recent bond and currency market behaviour is that investors are in a funk about the growth of fiscal deficits. So, too, are central bankers; and the unspoken objective of the interest rate increases last week was to fire a shot over the bows of the politicians. The real question is whether the bond market tremor is justified and whether the central banks' actions will work. Fiscal positions Italy and Sweden are in very different fiscal positions. The OECD estimates that Italy's outstanding stock of gross public debt will top 120 per cent, as a percentage of GDP, by the end of next year. Only Belgium, within the OECD area, carries a heavier burden of outstanding public debt. Yet Italy has been taking steps to put its public finances in order. It is the only country in the Group of Seven, apart from Japan, that is running a primary budget surplus. That means a surplus of revenue over expenditure equivalent to 2 per cent of GDP this year, before deducting interest on the debt. This is the traditional recipe for debt stabilisation and a return to fiscal orthodoxy. In Sweden, for decades the model of social democracy, the fiscal position is very different. Its debt stock falls short of Italy's. Yet both its general government deficit and its primary budget deficit are the highest in the OECD area. Its gross public debt, which was below the OECD average in 1991 at 53.4 per cent of GDP, is expected to top 100 per cent by next year, when it will fall short only of Italy, Belgium and Greece. In short, the rise in debt is vertiginous and the trend is adverse. Market psychology Against that background the central bankers' moves are double edged. Higher short-term interest rates will raise the cost of servicing the debt and reduce revenues if growth is restrained. Market psychology, meantime, is doubly punitive. Capital flows respond politely to changes in interest rate differentials in rising markets. But when they are worried, as at present, about the growing risk of bond market default, they recognise that no increase in rates can compensate for the risks. The danger is that the pessimism becomes contagious. If everyone rushes to be first out of the exit, the currency depreciates anyway and bond markets fall. Governments are then forced to monetise the debt by borrowing from the domestic banking system. The markets also know that, while Italy may be on the path of virtue, the temptation to stray is greater when the budget is in primary surplus, because the cost of servicing the debt alone is preventing politically attractive tax cuts. For a new coalition like that of Mr Berlusconi's, it is all too easy to blame past debts on corrupt Christian Democratics and to call for a new start with a clean slate. The Italian government is clearly determined to avoid the international opprobrium that would follow. If Sweden's social democrats return in the September election, they may prove tougher than expected. But for the moment, the European bond and currency markets are driven by fiscal fear and the electoral timetable. With Britain's Tories looking for pre-electoral tax cuts and Germany's Social Democrats hoping to improve their chances yesterday by promising the biggest programme of tax cuts for ordinary people in the history of the Federal Republic, who is to say the markets are crazy?</p>

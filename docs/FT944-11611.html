			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Chirac declares candidacy and defies Balladur Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the Gaullist RPR party, yesterday became the first mainstream French politician to declare his intention to run for president of the republic in next year's race. The surprise announcement allowed Mr Chirac, who is mayor of Paris, to seize the initiative by ignoring the request by Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, to the centre-right coalition to hold off campaigning until January. His decision to run destroys any hope among France's political right of offering a single candidate and looks sets to split the vote and trigger a bitter election contest. Mr Chirac, 61, is currently in third place in opinion polls well behind Mr Balladur of the RPR and Mr Jacques Delors, the Socialist candidate and president of the European Commission, who are running neck and neck. News of the announcement yesterday triggered the RPR to convene an emergency congress on November 12 at which Mr Chirac will press to become the official candidate of the party, in a direct threat to Mr Balladur. In an unusual move, Mr Chirac spurned the usual practice of announcing his candidature on national television, in favour of giving an interview to the Lille-based newspaper La Voix du Nord, the third largest circulation newspaper in France, with 400,000 copies sold each day. Mr Andre Soleau, the newspaper's editor in chief, said he believed Mr Chirac had taken the decision because Lille was the birthplace of General de Gaulle, for whom Mr Chirac is sometimes portrayed as the 'spiritual son'. He said Lille also symbolised 'la France profonde' outside Paris. In the interview, Mr Chirac called for the need to 'meet the challenges and restore the hope' of France through strong policies and 'rigorous ethics'. He criticised the 'hypocrisy' of current political debate. He argued for 'the necessity of change', and said that economic recovery had not dealt with 'the problem of employment which threatens the destruction of society'. Mr Francois Mitterrand, the incumbent Socialist president, ends his second seven-year term in May, although his poor health may lead to the date of the election being brought forward. Mr Chirac, who was criticised by Mr Balladur's supporters yesterday for acting prematurely, previously stood unsuccessfully for president in 1981 and 1988. He has twice been prime minister. Five other politicians have announced their candidature for the presidency. They include Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, head of the National Front, and Mr Robert Hue, leader of the Communist party.</p>

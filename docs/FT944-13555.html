			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Royal Commission on the Environment: Pollution report poses stiff challenge for ministers Sir John Houghton, chairman of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, was keen to stress yesterday that his report was in tune with the government's desire for a sustainable transport policy. On the face of it, that is true. Earlier this year Mr John Major launched a weighty document on sustainable development which spoke of the need 'to strike the right balance between the ability of transport to serve economic development and the ability to protect the environment and sustain future quality of life'. But the government has so far done little to put that policy into practice. Cynics would even say that those fine words bear little relation to actual policy, which is dominated by favouritism for the car and a desire to shuffle off the problems of public transport by privatising it. Yesterday's report is therefore a challenge to ministers to match words with deeds. But it goes further than that by urging a fundamental reshaping of the economics of transport to bring out its true costs. Professor Richard Macrory, a commission member and a barrister, described the report as 'a last chance' for the Department of Transport to become 'a real transport department' rather than just a roads department. 'Many people in evidence to us said the department was biased towards roads. We feel that is correct.' Small surprise, therefore, that ministers gave the report a guarded welcome yesterday. It puts pressure on the government on several fronts. One is taxation. Although Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is committed to raising the price of vehicle fuel by 5 per cent a year, the commission wants that rate to be doubled. The Treasury would no doubt welcome an opportunity to raise more revenue. But the closer the government moves to a general election, the less likely such a measure looks, particularly since the commission admits: 'We recognise that the policies we recommend will impose costs on the present generation.' Though it adds they could be offset by cuts in other taxes. Another is the balance between public and private transport. Although the government is showing signs of soft-pedalling its roads programme, it has done little to compensate by boosting public transport. The commission does not challenge the wisdom of privatising trains and buses, but it urges a heavy commitment of public funds to develop public transport. Interestingly, it expresses reservations about one of the few measures the government is proposing to jack up the cost of motoring: motorway tolls. Commission members fear this will only divert heavy traffic to smaller roads less capable of handling it. A further challenge raised by the report is its implication that road travel is far too cheap. Could the economy sustain a sharp increase in transport costs? What would happen to industry if some of the commission's recommendations on freight transport were adopted - for example, halting the strengthening of road bridges and banning big lorries from city centres? The government has been reluctant to land industry with environmental charges for fear of damaging competitiveness, and it has been vociferous in its opposition to Brussels' plans for a carbon tax. Even so, Sir Geoffrey Allen, one of the few industrialists on the commission, believes industry can cope. 'There's lots of flexibility in the system,' he said yesterday. 'Companies will react and find other ways of moving their goods.' The report also anticipates objections from the industrial lobby that its recommendations would damage the vehicle manufacturing and road building industries. 'There will be alternative work in providing improved infrastructure for public transport, such as new light rail systems or upgraded railway lines,' it says. For the automobile and freight industries, the challenge lies in developing new eco-friendly vehicles. On the planning front, the commission believes greater account should be taken of environmental considerations when planning transport routes. The report pointedly contains a colour picture of Twyford Down, an area of outstanding natural beauty which the Department of Transport authorised in 1991 to be destroyed in order to extend the M3. Although there have been signs of a more balanced approach since then, the government is not known for its care of the natural environment. One respect in which the government will welcome the report is that it lends support to its efforts to curb atmospheric pollution. At the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the UK signed a treaty committing it to try to bring carbon dioxide emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000. A big contribution to achieving this goal will have to come from transport. Therefore any recommendations to curb vehicle exhaust will be good news, at least for Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary. The commission is aware that its recommendations will be tough for the government, and will create divisions among departments, for example between environment and trade and industry over raising the cost of transport for industry. But, as the report points out, policymakers failed to bite the bullet when these issues arose 20 years ago. It says: 'It is a truly daunting prospect that, if the present opportunity were also to be lost, our successors would again be debating the increasing effects of road transport on the environment in the 2010s, following 20 more years of environmental deterioration.'

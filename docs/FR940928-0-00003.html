			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> As permitted by 5 CFR 2635.802, NASA is issuing &sect;6901.103(c) which sets forth prohibitions on non-Government employment that are substantially similar to those found in 14 CFR 1207.302(f). Prohibited employment listed in &sect;6901.103(c) includes employment with a NASA contractor, subcontractor, or grantee, in connection with work performed by that entity for NASA, and employment with parties to certain classes of agreements to which NASA is a party, if the employment would be in connection with work to be performed under such an agreement. NASA has determined, in accordance with the standard set forth in 5 CFR 2635.403(a), that such outside employment by employees, other than special Government employees, would cause reasonable persons to question the impartiality and objectivity with which NASA programs are administered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As permitted by 5 CFR 2635.803, and based on its finding that the long-standing requirements for prior approval for certain categories of outside employment at 14 CFR 1207.306 has helped to ensure that employees' outside activities conform to applicable statutes and regulations, NASA has determined to continue to require prior approval for those outside employment activities that, by their nature, tend to raise questions under the Standards. Before engaging in specified categories of outside employment, with or without compensation, &sect;6901.103(d) requires a NASA employee, other than a special Government employee, to obtain written approval from an appropriate agency official. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Outside Employment'' is broadly defined at &sect;6901.103(b)(2) to cover any form of non-Federal employment or business relationship involving the provision of personal services, including writing when done under an arrangement with another person for production or publication of the written product. It does not, however, include participation in the activities of nonprofit charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, and similar organizations, unless the organization is a prohibited source as defined in 5 CFR 2635.203(d), or unless such activities involve the provision of professional services or advice or are for compensation other than reimbursement for expenses. Sections 6901.103(f) and (g) set forth the requirements for submission and processing of a written request for approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure that section 6901.103 is not itself construed as authority to deny permission to engage in any outside employment activity, &sect;6901.103(g)(3) states that approval will be granted unless it is determined that the prospective outside employment is expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulations, including 5 CFR part 2635 and this supplemental regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> III. Repeal of NASA Standards of Conduct <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Most of NASA's standards of conduct at 14 CFR part 1207 were superseded by the executive branch-wide financial disclosure regulations at 5 CFR part 2634 and by the ethical conduct standards at 5 CFR part 2635. NASA is, therefore, repealing those portions of its existing standards of conduct regulation at 14 CFR part 1207 which were superseded by 5 CFR parts 2634 and 2635 or which will be superseded on the date of the current rulemaking by this NASA supplemental regulation. In the place of the superseded regulations, NASA is substituting cross-references to the new executive branch-wide regulations on ethical conduct and financial disclosure, the Office of Personnel Management provisions on employee responsibilities and conduct at 5 CFR part 735, and the NASA supplemental regulation. Consistent with 5 CFR 2635.402(d)(1), existing &sect;1207.403 of 14 CFR is being preserved and redesignated as &sect;1207.102, pending issuance by OGE of superseding regulatory waivers. Similarly, existing sections 1207.800 and 1207.801 of 14 CFR, which provide guidance to former NASA employees who desire to communicate with NASA to provide scientific or technical information in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 207(j)(5), have no counterpart in the new Standards and are being retained and redesignated, with a couple of modifications to reflect the current post-Government employment law, as &sect;&sect;1207.201 and 1207.202 of 14 CFR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> IV. Matters of Regulatory Procedure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Administrative Procedure Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> As Administrator of NASA, I have found that good cause exists under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (d)(3) for waiving, as unnecessary and contrary to the public interest, the general notice of proposed rulemaking and the 30-day delay in effectiveness as to these rules and repeals. The supplemental regulations are essentially similar to rules previously contained in NASA's standards of conduct, and I believe that it is important to a smooth transition from NASA's prior ethics rules to the new executive branch-wide Standards and financial disclosure regulations that these rulemaking actions take place as soon as possible. Furthermore, this rulemaking is related to NASA's organization, procedures, and practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In promulgating this final rule, NASA has adhered to the regulatory philosophy and the applicable principles of regulation set forth in Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. This regulation has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that Executive order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

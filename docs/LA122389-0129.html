			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> OLD CITY HALL GETS SOME NEW TENANTS  </P> <P> Outside, the sign on Jamboree Boulevard still reads "Civic Center," but city  offices are nowhere to be found. Inside the brown building, the words "Police  Department," although scratched off, can be traced on a corner partition where  they were posted for 13 years.  </P> <P> Both the Civic Center and the Police Department have moved to 1 Civic Center  Plaza, just off Harvard Avenue, where Irvine has built a new $27.8-million City  Hall. But instead of selling the old building, the city turned it into an  office complex for eight nonprofit groups.  </P> <P> "We've all learned a little about all of the organizations here," said Linda  Benjamin, program secretary for the Irvine Chamber of Commerce, the building's  largest tenant. "We all get along very well."  </P> <P> The building at the corner of McGaw Avenue and Jamboree Boulevard served as  Irvine's City Hall starting in 1975, when officials moved from the original  quarters in the old University Town Center. The Jamboree Boulevard building was  considered a temporary facility, City Manager Paul Brady Jr. said.  </P> <P> "We were supposed to have a new City Hall in 1980," Brady said. "So we actually  got a new one about eight years late."  </P> <P> After leaving the center in 1988, the city decided to keep the  40,000-square-foot building for nonprofit groups rather than sell it, Brady  said.  </P> <P> "Sometime in the future it could be sold," Brady said. "It was appraised  recently for about $5 million, but who knows what it might be worth in a couple  of years."  </P> <P> The building's tenants now include the County Historical and Cultural  Foundation, the city's Child Resource Information Center and Irvine Temporary  Housing, where the city provides 10 apartments and two farmhouses for needy  families.  </P> <P> Another cubicle houses the Irvine Baseball Assn., headquarters for the city's  baseball leagues. Also in the building is CSP Inc., which manages programs for  youths, for crime victims and in child abuse prevention. The former police area  of the building will soon become a child-care center.  </P> <P> The office of For Families, a city-run program that supplies free services to  families in stressful situations, is at the opposite end of the building from  the chamber. Among the services offered by For Families are counseling, food,  shelter and legal assistance. People contact the agency for a variety of  reasons, but receptionist Dalene Bo said callers usually have one thing in  common.  </P> <P> "It all revolves around finances," Bo said. "You wouldn't think that would be  so much of a problem, especially in Irvine, but almost without exception,  finances are the major problem."  </P> <P> Bo has been working in the building since August, when she wandered in looking  for the adult career center, whose office is in the back.  </P> <P> "They told me For Families was looking for a receptionist, up front here," Bo  said. "I've been here ever since." LEN HALL  </P></p>

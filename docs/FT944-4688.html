			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Metro Radio in talks with Minster Sound Metro Radio, the Newcastle-based commercial radio group, is in talks to acquire Minster Sound, which operates radio stations in York and Scarborough. Metro, which last week announced a near doubling of profit to Pounds 4.63m in the year to September 30, said yesterday it was in discussions with Minster 'which may or may not lead to an offer being made for the whole of the issued share capital'. The approach is being judged friendly and a deal seems likely. The acquisition would fill another gap in Metro's coverage of north-east England. Minister launched on air in York in July 1992. It won an additional broadcasting licence for Scarborough and began broadcasting there a year ago. After breaking even at the trading level in its first full year, Minster made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 154,000 on a turnover of Pounds 1.2m in the year to September 30. The two largest investors in Minster are Radio Investments, which has a portfolio of stakes in commercial radio, and GWR, the Bristol-based radio group. Minster shareholders were advised to do nothing ahead of a further announcement.</p>

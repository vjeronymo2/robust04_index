			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Diosdado Maso for the "National Radio News" -- </F> figures as heard]    [Text] The Fernando Echenique Rice Enterprise in Granma  must produce almost 50 percent of the country's rice consumption  this year, meaning 100,000 tons. The country spent $17 million  this year in fertilizers, pesticides, fuel, lubricants, and  tires. All the material is already at the Cuban rice  enterprises' warehouses.    Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan said the effort exerted  in the nation's economic sector must be complemented with more  technological discipline, efficiency, and quality in the  harvest's organization. The minister also emphasized:    [Begin Jordan recording] We must (?optimize) the efficiency  in the country's rice production again because it is clear we  cannot produce with 5,100 caballerias the same volume we  produced with 10,000 caballerias. We can, however, certainly  achieve the highest efficiency in history with 5,100  caballerias; and I believe this dignifies the rice producers.  We must work in that direction. [end recording]    Cuba consumes 500,000 tons of rice in a year. To get the  amount we do not produce -- 400,000 tons -- the economy has  alloted $110 million to purchase it abroad. The rice harvest has  officially started in Granma Province.</p>

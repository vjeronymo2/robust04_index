			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bank refuses to exonerate lenders to Schneider Deutsche Bank has refused to exonerate formally the directors of the mortgage banking subsidiary which conducted the bulk of its lending to the Jurgen Schneider property group. Schneider collapsed last month with debts of more than DM5bn (Dollars 2.1bn), owing DM1.16bn to Deutsche Bank alone. The process of what, under German law, is known as 'entlastung' - approval or exoneration of individual directors - is normally a formality by which shareholders signal their approval for the conduct of directors during the previous year. It is only under extreme circumstances that approval is not granted. Deutsche Bank, which owns more than 90 per cent of the shares in Deutsche Centralbodenkreditbank, a mortgage subsidiary which lent DM998m to Schneider, said yesterday it was inappropriate to grant approval to board directors while investigations into the bank's role in the Schneider affair were continuing. The bank is subject to three separate investigations to assess how it came to be allegedly defrauded by Mr Jurgen Schneider, the property entrepreneur who fled Germany last month and is believed to have taken hundreds of millions of D-Marks from his company's resources. A warrant has been issued for Mr Schneider's arrest, but his whereabouts are unknown. One external investigation is being carried out by the BAK, the federal banking authority. It is examining the lending procedures of Deutsche and other German banks which lent money to the Schneider group. Separately, Deutsche's credit department is conducting its own internal investigation into the lending, and the bank has employed a firm of chartered accountants to conduct an independent enquiry. The refusal to grant approval to Centralbodenkredit directors affects both the subsidiary's management and boards.</p>

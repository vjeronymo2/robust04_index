Commenting on the anti-war, anti-nuke  demonstration staged by citizens and students in Seoul Tuesday  after a rally marking the 75th anniversary of the March 1  popular uprising, the analyst says:    These days the United States is working to arm its troops  present in South Korea with Patriot missiles and the Kim  Yong-sam puppet clique, dancing to its drum-beating, is making a  frantic bid to introduce this sophisticated weapon even into the  puppet army.    The planned shipment of Patriots into South Korea by the  U.S.  and South Korean warmaniacs is a crime intended to drive the  situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.    The prevailing grave situation urges the South Korean people  and students to turn out in the anti-war, anti-nuke struggle so  as to remove the danger of war and defend the security of the  nation. It is quite natural that they are vigorously waging  this struggle.    The South Korean people and students will decisively crush  the maneuverings of the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam  puppet clique to provoke a nuclear war by invigorating the  anti-war, anti-nuke struggle.</p>

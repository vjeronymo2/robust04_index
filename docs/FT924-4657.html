			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Indian group launches global equity offering GRASIM Industries, the Indian cement, textiles and fibre manufacturer, has launched a Dollars 90m global depositary share offering. It is the second Indian company to tap the international equity markets this year, and a stream of other Indian names are expected to launch international offerings in the coming months. Grasim's share offering has had a bumpy start. The deal was originally scheduled for June, but lead managers Citicorp and Merrill Lynch were forced to pull the issue as the unfolding drama of the Indian financial scandal halted trading on the Bombay stock exchange. The Bombay exchange remained shut for several days, and the lead managers said they were reluctant to proceed with the issue during the traditionally quiet summer months. In addition, some international investors expressed annoyance at the way in which Reliance Industries, the first Indian company to tap the capital markets, conducted its international offering in May. Shares in Reliance suffered a sharp fall after the global offering, and many investors were annoyed when Reliance increased the size of the issue from Dollars 100m to Dollars 150m, as this reduced the opportunities for investors to make gains. Grasim priced its offering on Friday at Dollars 12.98 per GDS - representing one share with a nominal value of Rs10 - and at a discount of 18 per cent to the price of Grasim shares trading in Bombay. Citicorp said it was quoting the shares at Dollars 13.00 to Dollars 13.25 yesterday, compared with a trading price in Bombay equivalent to Dollars 15.09. The issue has been sold mainly to emerging market funds run from the US, London and Hong Kong, and to wealthy non-resident Indian investors. Grasim, which is part of the Birla group, will use the proceeds to help expand its viscose staple fibre and cement operations.</p>

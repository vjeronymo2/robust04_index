			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Inaugural address by President Armando Calderon Sol from </F> the Central American Pavilion at the International Fair Grounds  in San Salvador -- live]    [Text] Madame President of the honorable Legislative  Assembly and deputies; Mr. President of the honorable Supreme  Court of Justice and magistrates; Mr. Vice President of the  republic and Mrs. Borgo [applause]; Mr. Alfredo Cristiani and  Mrs. Margarita de Cristiani; [applause and cheers] Mr. [former  Vice President] Francisco Merino Lopez; [applause] Your  Excellency the President of the Republic of Costa Rica and Mrs.  Figueres Olsen; [applause] Your Excellency, the president of the  Republic of Honduras, Dr. Carlos Roberto Reina; [applause] Your  Excellency Mrs. Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, president of the  Republic of Nicaragua; [applause] Your Excellency President of  the Republic of Guatemala and Mrs. De Leon Carpio [applause];  Your Excellency the Prime Minister of the Republic of China and  Mrs. Lien Chan; [applause] Your Excellency the Vice President of  the Republic of Ecuador and Mrs. Garzoni [as heard]; [applause]  Your Excellency Guillermo Ford, vice president of the Republic  of Panama; [applause] your excellencies, chiefs of special  missions and honorable members of the retinues accompanying  them; Mr. President-elect of the Republic of Panama and Mrs.  Perez Balladares; [applause] Mr. Comptroller General of the  Republic; Mr. President of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal and  magistrates of the tribunal; members of the cabinet; Mr.  President of the Central American Parliament; honorable  representatives of international organizations; Mr. Municipal  Mayor of San Salvador and Mrs. Valiente; [applause] former  Central American presidents; Your Excellency and Most Reverend  Monsignor Manuel Monteiro De Castro, apostolic nuncio and church  authorities; [applause] members of the Armed Forces High Command  and commanders; [applause] representatives of political parties;  special guests; ladies and gentlemen:    We have the high honor of assuming today the presidency of  the Republic by the sovereign will of the Salvadoran people  freely expressed through votes and abiding by the Constitution  of the Republic. In the first place, we thank God Almighty for  this privilege of serving our beloved people. We accept this  challenge with humility and ask God to enlighten us in every one  of our actions. We know there is no privilege without  responsibility, and for that reason we accept our responsibility  with full awareness of the historic moment for the nation and  the world.    In a very special manner, we want to voice our most sincere  gratitude to the noble Salvadoran people, assuring them that we  will work for them, day after day, throughout our entire  administration. We will not forget for a single minute the  principle that public power comes from the people and that  government officials are their delegates with the powers granted  by the law. With pure patriotic fervor, we express our deepest  appreciation to all the men, women, and youth who form part of  the Nationalist Republican Alliance, ARENA. [applause, cheers]    Five years ago you forged the way toward national recovery,  and you are today propelling us toward the overall  reconstruction of the country, making it possible for us to  experience this historic moment. Once again you told El  Salvador you are here for the fatherland, a fatherland that  joins all of us [applause] in constructing a future in which  there can be coexistence and in which peace, progress, and  liberty can be shared. [applause]    We wish to make special recognition of President Alfredo  Cristiani, [applause] artisan [applause] of peace. His  administration will go into the pages of our history, and  current and future generations will reap the benefits of his  extraordinary work as president. I am receiving today the  presidential sash, which I must hand over five years from now on  a day much like today, as the symbol that the work accomplished  is just a relay to continue onward in building the future of the  nation.    We are grateful for the presence of representatives of  friendly peoples and governments. We regard it as a new  expression of support for the people of El Salvador in this  process of peace and strengthening of democracy to which we are  so fervently committed. We are building a new El Salvador, which  is modern, democratic, and participative. This demands  legality, security, honesty, respect for each other, solidarity,  and opening. The framework for our administration will be the  Constitution and the laws, which we, the government and the  governed, must all respect. Our objective is the full state of  law that will guarantee the equality of all Salvadorans before  the law, making sure that this will be the golden rule of  national coexistence, without improper privileges or unjust  exclusions.    We will work tirelessly to achieve the conditions that will  ensure the highest level possible of safety for the people,  within the framework of the law and full respect for the rights  of individuals. We will combat crime, drug trafficking,  kidnapping, extortion, and violence with total commitment. In  this respect, we will [applause] In this respect [repeats  himself] we will give top priority to developing public security  as the guarantor of internal peace and the tranquillity of  citizens.    Our administration will not tolerate corruption of any kind.  We will make sure public functions are honest and integrity  exists in all public servants so that honesty in every one of  our actions becomes the norm that guides the work of the  administration as a whole. We believe in the irresistible  force of example. That is why, before the entire nation, we  pledge to have an administration that is honest and respectful  of public affairs so that democracy can continue gaining  credibility. [applause]    We will work toward strengthening a society that lives in  harmony and where respect for human dignity is the basic rule of  coexistence among Salvadorans. We do not want any more  confrontation, much less polarization. We will work for  cooperation among all the political and social forces to advance  the important national project.    To us, it is very clear that this society should work as a  one; however, its social integration is not a beautiful [word  indistinct]. It is also a challenge to improve, directly linked  to the living conditions of human beings. In terms of  Salvadoran solidarity integration, we will work unceasingly to  improve the standard of living, particularly for the most needy  so that no Salvadoran falls by the wayside on the important road  to development.    We consider fundamental initiating broad development of all  the currents of thinking, of ideas. If ideas are not challenged  they do not develop, thereby preventing the possibilities of  finding the best options in the search of solutions to problems.    The time of dogmas and fanatics has ended. Historical  rationality prevails as a prerequisite of reality. Our country  is an example of this spirit, and we will do everything possible  for it to continue on this road. These principles are  fundamental to generating trust. This is a vital condition for  governing and leading the nation on the road to progress. A  nation without faith in itself, its government, and its future,  is prone to go under at any time.    We are faced with enormous challenges in the reconstruction  of our nation. The greatest effort should originate from  ourselves. As a nation we are grateful for the support we  received during the conflict and during the period of  fulfillment of the peace agreements. We ask the international  community to continue with the cooperation to totally  reconstruct this nation and to consolidate peace that serves as  an example for the world. [applause]    To our Central American brothers, we send you our most  sincere greetings. The significant political changes the world  has experienced in the past years and the economic globalization  process demonstrate to us the indisputable need to continue  working arduously as a region to integrate [word indistinct] and  find together favorable positions when facing third nations.  During the last years, thanks to the regional presidents' work  and dedication we have obtained significant progress toward  Central American integration. Nevertheless, we also recognize  there is still a long road ahead. Therefore, from here on we  promise to work with our counterparts, with our best resolve and  energy, within the framework of respect and sovereignty, to  contribute to the progress of our peoples.    Our administration's clear goal will be to achieve social  peace. For this we must turn El Salvador into a nation of  opportunities, with social [word indistinct]. [applause] The  lack of opportunity to progress causes poverty and frustration.  We have just come out of a conflict that to a great extent was  the result of despair over the lack of opportunities. A large  number of our compatriots live in poverty. We must break the  vicious circle of he who is born poor must die poor. [applause]  We will give special attention to education, health, child  protection, and the environment. We must work toward solving  these big problems through the participation of all Salvadorans.  We will foster support programs for human promotion to improve  the standard of living. We will put our efforts in the people  to achieve human, social, economic, and political development,  so that this can be a truly sustained development.    This demands a different attitude, a different frame of  mind, and a different focus that will allow us to move onto the  path of modernization and which, in turn, will allow us to cope  firmly with the challenges of the new millennium. We must  stress the best characteristics all Salvadorans have -- our  creativity and hard-working nature -- because this is our  greatest resource. We have attained peace, and now the guns are  silent. Nevertheless, we must still do away with senseless  rivalries and antagonism. We must rebuild our nation in a  physical, moral, and spiritual manner in order that, together,  we can achieve a social peace that will be a new means of  attaining harmony, respect, security, and participation among  all Salvadorans. [applause]    Social peace must be born in our homes, taught in our  schools, and improved in the workplace. This is the best legacy  we can leave to our children, who are the future for which we  are working today. We will prepare our youth to enable them to  face the challenges of the future, guide them along a productive  path in all branches of human knowledge, and work hard in order  that Salvadoran youths be able to live, study, and work in a  dignified and happy manner.    Our government will promote reforms that will lead to  obtaining the greatest possible degree of efficiency in our  work. Now that all currents of political thought are gradually  uniting over the social market economy, efficient government  will mark the basic difference in our ability to satisfy the  hopes of the people and to maintain their support.    Therefore, we are going to carry out a thorough reform  program in the public sector that will satisfy the demands of a  free, participative, and unified society that will promote the  most efficient use of resources and will improve the quality of  services. During this process, we will seek adequate means to  decentralize and stimulate the private sector's participation in  government services in an orderly and gradual manner, as well as  in accordance with the capabilities of local governments and the  private sector.    We are going to help strengthen the municipalities to enable  them to assume the responsibilities that result from the  decentralization of public services and that will heighten their  sensitivity to the needs of their citizens. In this way, we  will seek mechanisms that will allow greater participation of  the communities so that they can become key players in resolving  their problems and promoting their own development. In this  way, we will be respecting their dignity and putting an end to  the state paternalism that has inhibited the initiative of the  people.    In our government work, we will try to strengthen the  democratic model to create a solid foundation that will lead us  to stable and lasting social harmony. Now that all political  beliefs have room and freedom in our society to express  themselves, we must defend ideological pluralism in the face of  systematic confrontation, authoritarian impositions, arrogance,  and political violence. All political parties, social  organizations... [applause; Calderon Sol repeats himself] all  political parties, social organizations, and the government must  maintain an open and sincere dialogue to reject and eradicate,  as much as possible, those practices that generate excessive  passion, hatred, and violence, all of which undermine democracy  and take away freedom from the individual. [applause]    All political groups are present in the Legislative  Assembly.  As president, our work requires sweeping dialogue and support  to carry out the government plan. We want to tell the  opposition that we are going to maintain open channels of  communication with the assembly to listen to its opinions and to  reach a basic consensus. We hope to have a constructive  opposition so that, together, we will find the best options for  our people. [applause]    In a similar manner, we will work with various civil  organizations to attain alliances in terms of our government  plan and to find solutions to specific problems. Dialogue,  sincere communication, and the fulfilling of commitments are  basic requirements for generating confidence, progressing with  determination, and governing in a way that reflects the hope of  the people.    I would like to speak of an institution that, as an  integral part of society, has already begun a process of  renovation to accommodate itself within the new peace process:  our Armed Forces. [applause] Our Armed Forces have a clear  mission and full knowledge of the role they must play within the  Republic's renovated institutional picture. It is with great  pleasure that its commander greets the military institution, in  general, and wishes it a promising future [applause] while  fulfilling its patriotic duties within the Constitution's  framework.    We wish to reiterate to all Salvadorans and the  international  community that is amply represented on this occasion our  decision to comply properly with the peace accords, because they  represent the commitment [applause] not of a government or a  sector, but of the whole nation. We cannot ignore that this is  a necessary condition on the path of no return that will lead us  to constructing social peace. [applause]    Concerning justice, deep changes are necessary as well as a  determination to carry them out. The Presidency is ready to do  what it must do, and it will cooperate with the other state  organizations in doing what they must do to ensure that our  judicial system meets the requirements of a modern and  democratic society. In doing so, we must strengthen judicial  order. We must see to it that everyone abides by the law and  that no one is above the law. [applause]    We cannot speak of justice if we do not have public order,  and we cannot speak of public order if we do not have a police  corps that is properly trained, equipped, and deployed  throughout the country. Our commitment is to make the National  Civilian Police [PNC] an institution that will give true and  ample protection to the people, a PNC that will strictly abide  by the law, a PNC that will make us proud. [applause]    I must state that we will encourage a full respect for human  rights and absolute freedom for Salvadorans. In schools and  through the media we will encourage the teaching of peace and a  respect for these fundamental rights so that these principles  will become part of our most cherished beliefs. We believe it  is a state's duty to create conditions that will foster equal  opportunities to all so that everyone can achieve better  standards of living. We will tackle poverty by promoting plans  of human development and by giving productive work to those who  have nothing, thus giving them the opportunity to attain a true  wellbeing.    Ours is not, however, a short term vision. The real  solutions aimed at eradicating poverty from its root are long  term. It will take much more than one presidential term to do  this; therefore, we commit ourselves to work, from day one, to  create the basis for an overall permanent development. We will  stress sectorial policies and investment in the people to  undertake the path that will lead to human development.  Education and health are the two main factors to increase human  potential; education and health are also the best tool for man's  advancement, for the advancement of his families, and for the  advancement of the country.    The coverage and quality of education are major factors. We  must encourage research and technological development in order  to compete in the world, which is increasingly becoming more  globalized each day. We cannot stand on the sidelines of  progress. We are going to promote a profound reform in  education by earmarking greater resources, improving educational  programs, and training teachers, to whom we convey our respect  and admiration. Our goal as a country must be to reduce  illiteracy to a minimum and bring quality education to the most  remote area of our territory.    The men and women of this nation are our greatest resource,  and educating them is to invest in the future. [applause]  Higher education and technical institutions are facing a major  challenge; that is, to grow in step with the demands of the new  El Salvador we are building. If these institutions would truly  like to contribute effectively to the country's overall  development, they must compete for excellence, upgrade their  programs and the quality of their education, expand their  potential for research, and explore new ideas to reaffirm  individuals' liberty and creative capability.    Health services also directly increase human potential and  encourage the development of individuals. Although we have made  progress in past years, the health system is still inadequate to  meet the demand, thus creating frustration among the people. In  this field we will also implement a profound reform by promoting  methods that demonstrate they can solve health problems. As the  government, we will work to solve these problems by emphasizing  preventive care, seeking ways to decentralize services, and  achieving greater participation by the private sector and the  communities.    When we talk of overall health, we are also talking of the  environment, because most illnesses afflicting our country's  neediest are caused by the pollution of the earth, riverbeds,  and the air, as well as by the deterioration of the environment.  If we do not protect our resources, we are betraying future  generations, dooming them to a world of desolation due to our  indifference and ineptness. Our government will play an active  role, because the state has to ensure, as part of its  (?complementary) duties, the protection of the environment by  legislating, educating, and encouraging the implementation of  adequate projects; therefore, we are going to generate policies  that succeed in making growth and the environment complementary,  because there can be no sustainable development if that is  achieved at the expense of the environment and the extinction of  our natural resources. [applause]    There can be no overall social progress either if we do not  meet the demand for decent housing, a large-scale problem the  solving of which requires unbelievable amounts of resources and  time. In past years, we have had encouraging progress in this  field. We must be more daring, however, and find new ways to  solve housing problems so that El Salvador can become a country  of homeowners.    Reforming the social security system, which is inefficient  and does not provide sufficient coverage, is fundamental. We  must improve the current system, which excludes almost 80  percent of the economically active population from protection.    We will promote new options to expand coverage of Social  Security, encouraging the participation of the private sector.  We want to prevent the anguish with which most of our workers  view their elderly years, because they are condemned to be a  burden for their families after having spent their lives working  for the country's progress. [applause]    Special attention must be given to youths and sports,  because  our low-income youths are exposed to high-risk social  situations, and only by giving them spiritual guidance, moral  education, training, and healthy recreation will we have  sports-minded and studious youths. Along with cultural  programs, these things will bring about the overall education of  the young people of El Salvador. [applause]    Our social agenda is directed in one way or another at  protecting the Salvadoran family, because that is where the most  beautiful lessons in life are learned. Those lessons are a love  of God, country, and fellow man. [applause]    Many women today are responsible for their homes. They play  the double role of mother and father, and their families live  under difficult circumstances. For them, we will create  programs that will enable them to improve their standard of  living. We will also provide special protection to women,  children, and the elderly. [applause]    During the administration which has just concluded, great  economic reforms were carried out, and noticeable progress was  achieved, permitting significant growth in recent years. Our  challenge now is to maintain high rates of growth and to turn  them into economic growth with equality. To this end, our  policy will seek to maintain conditions that will ensure  stability to consolidate the confidence of the private  productive sector, which is the generator of wealth, the primary  agent of modernization, and the promoter of progress. [applause]    Concurrently, we are going to strengthen free market  competition, in which the state must act as a mediator to  prevent abuses. In this field, the elimination of the  imbalances that still exist will be necessary in order to  provide protection to both producers and consumers. We clearly  speak of freedom, not of free license, much less of any kind of  privileges. [applause]    Economic progress must be based on the efficiency of  competition, but without losing sight of the fact the economy  must play a social function, because the reason for its  existence is not the accumulation of wealth but, rather, the  generation of wealth to improve the quality of life and the  standard of living of all citizens. [applause] In other words,  it must be the vehicle to achieve the common good.    Within the social market system, we are going to stimulate  domestic savings and encourage private investment, both national  and foreign; in this way, we want to expand the productive  borders and the sources that generate resources and permanent  jobs, because that is where the opportunities for individual and  national progress are found.    One cannot speak of greater private investment, however, if  the public sector does not contribute to progress; that is why a  thorough reform must urgently be undertaken to achieve  efficiency in this sector and, as much as possible, to eliminate  the fiscal deficit, the primary source of inflation.    We must be aware that the telecommunications, electricity,  water, and state infrastructure services are inefficient. They  represent a financial burden for the public sector, and they  restrict growth. As a result, we must urgently establish the  conditions for the private sector to play a more prominent role.  Therefore, we will begin a privatization process in many public  services. [applause]    Workers must actively participate in this process and be  shareholders of these enterprises. They face the challenge of  becoming workers and investors where their capability and  experience contribute to progress, allowing them to directly  benefit. If we talk of development with equity, with programs  to reduce poverty, we must then regard economic growth and  private investment as the primary source in generating jobs.  This is fundamental, because employment gives dignity to  individuals, allowing them to advance by the fruit of their own  effort.    This is not sufficient, however. We must also seek a true  increase in workers' income, something that cannot be done by  decree. We must train them and seek the technologies to raise  labor productivity. Only in this way will we avoid inflationary  pressures that diminish the value of wage increases. We  understand that a harmonious relationship between workers and  businessmen is necessary, because they comprise an inseparable  nucleus that generates benefits for the country.    The informal sector of the economy and small-scale  businesses  generate most jobs. Under our government, training programs  aimed at these sectors will be especially important, as will be  the funneling of loans in market conditions. We will promote a  joint effort aimed at upgrading the capability to produce and  the efficiency of these sectors so that their goods and services  will improve the quality of their products, and, therefore,  their revenues.    Likewise, all sectors of the economy face the challenge of  modernization and constant technological changes if they want to  stay in the market. Though meeting internal demands must be an  important objective, conquering new international markets must  become the goal of every Salvadoran businessman, given it is  there where the opportunities to expand our commercial borders  as a country lie.    Agriculture is one sector that demands attention. We are  committed to encouraging productive changes, stimulating  technological progress and training, as well as guaranteeing the  right to property and personal security in the countryside.  [applause]    We shall create special programs to encourage personal and  family progress for peasants within the agrarian reform program  [sector reformado]. We are going to jointly establish  conditions that free them from any sort of political  manipulation so that they can play an active role in their own  development and ensure that they can acquire property when they  wish.    During El Salvador's new era, tourism will play an important  role, because it generates resources and jobs. We must prepare  ourselves to offer the best of our natural resources as well as  the personal warmth that characterizes us. We believe we speak  for all Salvadorans when we say our goal as a society is to  attain social and economic development; nevertheless, it must be  realized this demands great amounts of resources, investments in  both human resources and the infrastructure. These resources  should be supplied mainly by us, Salvadorans, meaning we must  all contribute to the country by paying our taxes. [applause]  We are going to fight decidedly against the culture of tax  evasion and fraud until one day we can say with satisfaction: I  can demand, because I pay my taxes. I can demand, because I am  a tax contributor. [applause] I can demand, because I  contribute to making my country big and prosperous.    As this new government takes office, we reaffirm we have  only one commitment with El Salvador and its people: to build a  better future. We do not want to create false hopes, because  there are no miracles along the road to progress. There is  serious and coordinated work, however, that must be carried out  with dedication and as a team trying to interpret the people's  true feelings and aspirations.    Our objective is to execute our government plan and fulfill  the promises we made during the campaign. We will do so with  everyone's support and by joining our efforts and volition. Our  challenge is to build a better country for all, with equal  opportunity for each of us to progress according to our effort  and will to succeed. With every action we must bear in mind  that the solution to our problems must arise from our own  efforts as a community and as a nation, overcoming any  temptation of state paternalism and ensuring respect from the  international community.    My fellow countrymen, our country is beginning today a new  phase in the transition toward a consolidated democracy, for  which our country has been working since 1982. We realize the  new government, being the first presidential inauguration of the  postwar era, brings high hopes and opens new horizons for  national development. We must say we are fully aware we are not  here just to do a job but to accomplish a mission. It is a  moral job, a job with political content and historical  responsibility. This job, in essence, calls for hard work and  requires a degree of effectiveness that will allow the people to  see the benefits of democracy in their day to day life, not only  on the political level but on social, economic, and cultural  levels as well. [applause]    We promise the nation and the world we will not fail in this  vital task, as the future depends on our success. Our  administration will be the last historic step toward the new  century; thus, it symbolizes the challenge we now face in favor  of peace, democracy, and development. We have come to the  Presidency to continue the promotion of an ongoing process, but  we are well aware our true task will be to demand a large dose  of creativity and imagination, capability, and sensibility. We  will not shy away from this challenge, because we are sure we  will have the people's understanding and support. They will be  the comptroller and judge of our actions.    In order to succeed in this truly patriotic endeavor, we  invoke the grace and inspiration of our Lord, the Savior of the  world, that He might enlighten our decisions and provide the  strength and wisdom to bring them to life for the good of our  nation and each and every Salvadoran. May the Lord guide us to  work together to make a new El Salvador, as that is the only way  we will live a better life.</p>

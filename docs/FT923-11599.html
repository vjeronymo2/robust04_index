			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Madrid seeks private cash for public works: The list of projects is long, but the money is short THE chief planning executive at Spain's Public Works ministry, Mr Carlos Alberto Zaragoza, says international financiers queue outside his office. 'From BNP to NatWest, from Goldman Sachs to Indo Suez, they all want to see me.' Mr Zaragoza has only himself to blame if his appointment book is full. In a series of recent presentations to investment banks he has outlined domestic infrastructure investment of Pta15,000bn (Dollars 159.5bn) through to the year 2007 and explained that only some Pta8,000bn-Pta9,000bn of the total will be provided by the central budget. The presentations deliver a very simple message: the government has an enormous public works shopping list, it has very little money to spend on it, and it wants the private sector to provide the balance. The bottom line is that the Public Works Ministry is putting the final touches to the creation of an autonomous agency which will channel project finance into the nation's infrastructure. 'The ministry seems to be quite clear about the need for such an agency,' says Mr Carlos de la Serna, head of research at Iberagentes, a Madrid broking house owned by Credit Suisse. 'It also has increasingly clear ideas about the options it has to guarantee the finance.' The shopping list would make even a government with a budget surplus blanch. Mr Zaragoza's priorities are: A second national road plan which will add 4,000km of motorways in the course of the 1990s to the existing 6,000km high quality road network. A 10-year programme to bring water treatment in Spain up to European Community standards - 60 per cent of the population receives either deficiently treated or wholly untreated water. Large railway investment involving an upgraded commuter line network to serve Madrid and high-speed track linking Madrid with Barcelona and the French high-speed railway system. A Pta120bn-Pta150bn enlargement of Madrid's Barajas airport. Mr Zaragoza is especially concerned about the road plan. The water treatment plants will be paid for by end users and the cost of railway networks and airports is likewise to be passed on to those who make use of such facilities. Building the motorways, however, requires the government to abandon a key tenet in its approach to road transport. 'The government had always said that the public sector had sole responsibility for building the road network and that there would be no toll motorways,' says Ms Mar Turrado, an analyst at Madrid brokers FG. Neither principle can now be maintained because 'the government has not got the money.' Mr Guillermo de la Dehesa, a former senior Finance Ministry official and now chairman of Banco Pastor, says the government's refusal to have motorists pay for roads while airport passengers paid for airports is 'illogical'. The author of a recent pamphlet on extra-budgetary infrastructure financing, Mr de la Dehesa says the government is facing up to 'a radical departure from its previous policy.' The prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, has already warned that the 1993 state budget will be extremely restrictive. Furthermore, under the Finance Ministry's policy paper on the convergence of Spain's economy with those of the country's richer EC partners, the deficit should be reduced as a percentage of gross domestic product from a current level of close to 5 per cent to 1 per cent over the next 5-7 years. The convergence programme sets aside 5 per cent of GDP every year for investment in infrastructure but this chapter includes items such as the health service, education and professional retraining. Analysts say it is not clear how much the road network can expect from the state, and suspect Mr Zaragoza will have to tap the markets even more than he is willing to admit. The likelihood is that as early as September the expected project finance agency will be preparing to issue its first infrastructure bond. The first issue, raising Pta50bn-Pta70bn, is expected to finance a 108km motorway linking the Basque industrial centre of Bilbao and the city of Santander, further west along the Cantabrian coast. The issue could be guaranteed by a toll or, more probably, by a new annual infrastructure tax. The latter would either be levied on Spanish car owners and on foreign motorists entering Spain, or would be added on to petrol prices. Analysts expect that such a bond will incorporate generous tax rebates and that it will prove popular. The financiers calling on Mr Zaragoza appear to have similar ideas. Building the new motorways requires the government to abandon a key tenet in its approach to road transport.</p>

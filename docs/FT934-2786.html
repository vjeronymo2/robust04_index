			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Markets: French franc rises - At a Glance The French franc climbed back above its old exchange rate mechanism floor against the D-Mark this week, for the first time since pressures within the ERM forced a widening of the ERM bands in August. The franc's rise was part of a more general strengthening of ERM currencies against the D-Mark. However, on Friday afternoon the franc slipped back below its pre-August floor, to trade at 3.426 against the D-Mark, after hitting a high of 3.4202. A week earlier, the franc was trading at 3.355 against the D-Mark. The Belgian franc pulled back above its pre-August ERM floor last week, and the Danish krone has also been pushing towards its old band.</p>

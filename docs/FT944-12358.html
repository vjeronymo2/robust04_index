			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Hong Kong stamps on Japan's postal pride An increasing number of Japanese subscribers of mail order catalogues from companies in Japan are finding their brochures mailed from Hong Kong. The detour, prompted by Japan's expensive postal rates, means companies save 20 to 30 per cent on postage costs by sending bulk mail to other countries where the items are remailed back to Japan. Such schemes have hit the country's Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, which has a monopoly on postal delivery. It has suffered losses of Y100bn (Pounds 630m) from its postal operations in the past three years, with the figure set to grow following a 24 per cent postal rate rise earlier this year. The remailing business has ballooned, and mail sent from Hong Kong to Japan currently equals five times that sent from Japan to Hong Kong. Mailing a postcard within Japan costs Y50 (31 pence), while it costs only Y27 (17 pence) to send a postcard from Hong Kong to Japan. Other countries with low postage rates, including Singapore, Denmark and the Netherlands, have also become favourite remailing centres. 'Remailing is fairly widespread with heavy mailers including Japanese companies,' says Mr Marc Fuoti, an official at Japan Marketing Data Systems, a marketing research company. Domestic and foreign newspapers, magazines and direct mailing companies are among the many which use remailing. The posts ministry estimates that more than 1m items were remailed in the year to March. The posts ministry has tried to clamp down on remailed letters by refusing to deliver them, charging sender companies domestic postage rates, or by returning the letters to the sending post office. In the latest year ministry officials charged domestic postage rates on more than 180,000 cards and letters which had been remailed. In another attempt to counter remailing, the Universal Postal Union, an international regulatory body of postal trade, stipulated in September that when a country judges a letter or card to have been remailed, it can claim delivery costs from the postal administration of the country where the mail was posted. But this week, taking a different tack, Mr Toyotaro Kato, chief of the postal bureau, said the ministry planned to increase the discount rate for bulk mail. Next spring it will ease restrictions which limit the discount on postage to 30 per cent, he said. The postal bureau also plans to reduce costs by cutting personnel and capital spending and hopes to eliminate losses by the end of 1996.</p>

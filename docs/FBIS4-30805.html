			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 30 (AFP) -- The UN-controlled Tuzla  airport came under heavy shellfire Monday as the UN reported  Serb forces counter-attacking in north-central Bosnia in a bid  to halt a push westwards by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian army. A  spokesman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) contacted by  telephone said the airport was hit twice by large calibre  shells, though there were no reports of casualties or damage.  "We're being shelled, we're on red alert and everyone is in the  shelters," the duty officer at the airport, some 20 kilometres  (12 miles) southeast of Tuzla, in northeastern Bosnia, told AFP  by telephone.    Although UNPROFOR did not say which side was responsible for  the attack, a military source told AFP: "The Serbs said Monday  [30 May] morning that they could not guarantee safety at the  airport today." Meanwhile, in a statement issued in Zagreb, UN  special envoy Yasushi Akashi condemned the "raising of military  tension" in the area of the Posavina corridor, a strip of  Serb-controlled territory running across northern Bosnia.    Exchanges of fire at the end of last week appeared to have  originated from Serb-controlled areas south and southeast of the  Orasje pocket, UNPROFOR said. Bosnian Croat and Bosnian  government forces then replied by shelling Brcko, which was  already the target of shelling between 10 and 23 May, it went  on. The targetting of civilian sectors is "a crime under  international law and must cease," Akashi warned.    Some 30 kilometres (20 miles) east of Tuzla, the Serbs have  launched a major offensive, Colonel Ekrem Avdic, spokesman for  the Bosnian Army Second Corps, said. In the north-central region  around Tesanj and Teslic, Serb forces are trying to regain  ground lost during a Bosnian army offensive south-west of  Tesanj, UNPROFOR's Sarajevo spokesman Major Rob Annink said.  Over the past week, the Bosnian army captured all the heights  overlooking the Serb-controlled town of Teslic, Annink said.  The Serbs began "retaliating with artillery on civilian areas"  on Sunday [29 May], he added. Annink said government commanders  had concentrated troops in the region over the past weeks in  preparation for an offensive. Their objective appeared to be to  take over the Vlasic plateau which dominates Travnik in order  "to control the road to Donji Vakuf and probably move downwards"  to the south, he said. Serb forces were also counter-attacking  about 80 kilometres (50 miles) south of the region, around Turbe  and Travnik, Annink said.    General Rasim Delic, commander in chief of Bosnian armed  forces, told a local daily recently that he thought conditions  were ripe for liberating seven towns, including Teslic and Donji  Vakuf. In north-eastern Bosnia, the Serbs are "using artillery  and tanks," with the probable objective of cutting the road to  Teocak, said Avdic, who was speaking in Tuzla. Teocak, a village  devasted by the fighting, is at the extreme north of the "Sapna  finger," a sector controlled by the Bosnians which commands  access to the Posavina corridor.    Control of the Posavina corridor, barely three kilometres  wide at its narrowest point, allows the Serbs, via the town of  Brcko, to link the territories they have won in Croatia and  northwestern Bosnia with their conquests in eastern Bosnia right  up to Serbia. "The enemy is concentrating troops in the region  of Posavina. We think they are going to try something because  they don't want a political agreement," Avdic said. Akashi last  week called the Bosnian government and Serb sides to peace talks  Thursday and Friday in Geneva.</p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / BIS may have Brazil debt role The steering committee of creditor banks in Brazil's planned Dollars 52bn (Pounds 35bn) debt restructuring may ask the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements to act as collateral agent for the deal. This follows the decision last week of the International Monetary Fund not to grant Brazil a stand-by accord. The US Federal Reserve, which was due to act as collateral agent if the IMF accord had been in place, is no longer willing to do so. The steering committee is talking to the BIS about the details of the operation. Sixty-six per cent of creditor banks also need to waive the requirement for the Federal Reserve's involvement in the deal, due to be completed on April 15. The involvement of an institution other than the Fed would not be unprecedented. The Bank of England was collateral agent in Argentina's debt restructuring rather than the Federal Reserve. Banks are also being asked to waive the requirement that a stand-by agreement with the IMF should precede the deal. The lack of an IMF accord further complicates the bank agreement since it means the US Treasury will be unwilling to issue special zero-coupon bonds to act as collateral in the restructuring. But Brazil has said it has executed arrangements that will ensure the collateral is in place in time.</p>

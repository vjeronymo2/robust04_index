In an article published today, the paper calls it a  qualitative shift and positive step indicative of a growing  sober, understanding, and fair approach uninfluenced by an  antagonistic United States out to manipulate the commission's  work and steer it away from its declared goals.    The progress the commission will report will be a virtual  certificate that the international community is increasingly  showing an understanding of Iraq's cooperation vis-a-vis  Resolutions 686 and 715.    The paper applauds the constructive and fair stands of  France, Russia, the PRC, and Brazil during the council's debate  at which the the four countries departed from the U.S. position  calling for dragging the sanctions out.    This positive development at the Security Council would not  have been possible had it not been for Saddam Husayn's letter of  facts, carried to the council by the Iraqi delegation. Credit  must also go to Iraq's proven capacity for steadfastness and  tenacity.    This appreciable change at the council clearly shows a  conflict of interests between these states and Washington, which  tries to commandeer and monopolize decision making for its own  ends. It is also the result of Iraq standing up for its  legitimate rights and its valiant resistance to all pressure and  blackmail, AL-THAWRAH concludes.</p>

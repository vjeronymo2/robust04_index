			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Miami correspondent Marcos </F> Castello by Maria Helena Alonso and Roberto Cavada on the "Doing  Radio" program -- live]    [Text] [Alonso] Good morning, Marcos.    [Castello] Good morning to all the workers of the "Doing  Radio" program in Havana, particularly Cavada.    [Cavada] Good morning.    [Alonso] Today, Marcos is in high spirits because in a few  hours he will be here in Havana. He has been invited to the  conference "The Nation and the Emigre Community" scheduled to  begin Friday at the Convention Center. What do you have to tell  us?    [Castello] I will tell you about the forthcoming conference  in Havana. Here, the media coverage continues to spiral faster  and faster. Every television newscast and radio program is  highlighting the conference "The Nation and the Emigre  Community." As a matter of fact, there is an increasing number  of features carrying the opinions of certain people adamantly  opposed to the conference, people who get to delirious excesses,  and describe the conference participants as a small group of  unconditional, resentful, greedy, and privileged people who are  trying, all of a sudden, to boost their standing to top class.    In order words, they are trying by every means to mar the  legitimacy and importance to the process beginning this weekend  in Havana.    Another interesting bit of news on the media today -- also  an  evident symptom of the situation: The front page of THE NUEVO  HERALD trumpets that this dialogue is creating discord in Havana  and attributes to an unidentified source reports that there are  even conflicts between the Cuban Foreign Ministry and the  Ideological Department of the Communist Party of Cuba regarding  the purpose of the conference, what ought to be goals, and how  it ought to be carried out.    The climate reached an apex last night. There was a report  --  to call it something, perhaps more than it deserves -- that  there was an alleged problem with Cuban President Fidel Castro.  It is being said that a hospital has been taken over. In other  words, there is all manner of this sort of development common to  any important event.    This situation is typical. There are many people here  invited  to the conference, and since Monday they have been departing for  Havana in accordance with their means. The bulk of the  delegation will travel tomorrow, at least those who reside in  the United States, including me. Therefore, I will have a chance  to greet you.    [Alonso] What can I say; we are accustomed to these issues  being manipulated by the media abroad every time there is a  meeting of this kind or any new event. We are very used to this.  However, we are also aware that there are different opinions in  this regard within the United States, and particularly Florida.  It is very typical that this comes from the powerful people who  have the means to manipulate the media and close to politicians.  However, there are many others who want a rapprochement, family  reunification, and all those issues to be discussed at the  conference, and are very happy this event is taking place.    [Castello] I could add that the people committed to this  type  of attack -- because there is a difference between expressing an  opinion freely, everyone has the right to oppose or support the  Havana conference, that is undebatable. However, the manner and  attitude of this type of attack is precisely one of the things  that moved the members of the Rio Group -- Brazil, Venezuela,  Colombia, Mexico, and Argentina -- to express to U.S. Vice  President Al Gore, the fear of holding in Miami, later this  year, the hemispheric summit called for by President Bill  Clinton. Precisely, in fear of the Cuban exiles and the way in  which they express themselves, they are worried that that  meeting which is to focus on continental economic and  environmental problems, economic cooperation, etc., will be  taken off track by the Cuban issue, once again, due to the  actions of these Miami far right sectors.</p>

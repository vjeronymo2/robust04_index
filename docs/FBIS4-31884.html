			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 14 June (MTI) -- Chairman of the  Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) Gyula Horn briefed Hungarian  President Arpad Goncz on the progress of coalition talks with  the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ). Goncz received Horn as  part of his ongoing meetings with leaders of parties that won  seats in the new Hungarian Parliament.    Following the meeting, Horn told reporters the president had  welcomed the briefing. He said both the MSZP and the SZDSZ have  excellent relations with President Goncz, and they have held  regular consultations with him in the past. The two politicians  agreed to strive for direct, protocol-free contacts in the  future as well, with the intention that the new government will  continuously inform the president.    If the coalition agreement is concluded, the new government  can be formed by mid-July, Horn said. Horn also said he is  looking forward to receiving the information on the state of the  country which Prime Minister Peter Boross is to provide to the  six parliamentary parties on Wednesday [15 June]. He said he  expects to receive documents regarding the government's  international and domestic payments obligations, and ongoing  privatization transactions. He also expects to be informed  about the country's actual financial situation, particularly,  how the ministries managed their finances in the last months.</p>

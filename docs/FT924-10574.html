			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Arts: A 'Comedy of Errors' after Mozart - Wexford Festival Wexford Festival's chamber opera this year is a fascinating rarity of 1786. Gli equivoci by the Italo-English composer Stephen Storace, who was born in London in 1762 and died there, after a short and not very happy life, in 1796. Son of an Italian musician and his English wife, Storace was the younger brother of a gifted soprano, Nancy Storace, who has earned a place in operatic history as the creator of Mozart's Susanna. It was probably Nancy, much admired also by the Emperor Joseph II, who procured for her brother a commission to compose a comic opera for Vienna's Burgtheatre, to be written on a libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte. Da Ponte decided upon Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors and produced an agile, spirited text, rich in comic situations and in varied musical opportunities. Da Ponte wrote it in Italian and the opera was presented in 1786 as Gli equivoci (The Misunderstandings). The young composer's sister naturally played a leading role. Storace scored a considerable success, and while remaining for some time in the Vienna repertory, Gli equivoci was given also in Leipzig, Prague, Dresden and Pressburg. Virtually forgotten during the last century and for most of this, Storace's opera needed a thoughtful, lively revival, and Wexford has provided the perfect occasion. The Theatre Royal is just the right size, allowing the singers to present their music without forcing and, at the same time, allowing the audience to grasp the words. The opera was given in English, with its Shakespearean title The Comedy of Errors, while the translation - by Arthur Jacobs - restored, insofar as the music permitted, the Shakespearean words. Inevitably, Storace's score reflects the influence of Mozart. But the London-born composer, young as he was, had a mind and a talent of his own; the arias are stylishly shaped, the orchestra is inventively used, the voices are tellingly combined (the work is rich in ensembles, and the eight leading singers are employed in numerous different combinations and all together in the two extended, scintillating finales). The four leading male parts belong to the two pairs of separated twins (tenors, the masters; and baritones, or basses, the buffo servants). There are three female roles: a wife each for one Eufemio and one Dromio, and a future wife for the other Eufemio. The master and servant couples from Syracuse are perhaps a bit more important musically, and the roles were generally well-handed by the tenor Kip Wilborn (who lost timbre, however, when he attempted to sing softly) and the bass Kurt Link (whose relentless mugging became tedious in the second of the two acts). As their Ephesian counterparts, the tenor Gary Harger and the baritone Christopher Trakas seemed, at the outset, a little less imposing, but as the evening progressed proved pleasing in their measured approach and their confident musically. As Adriana, the bewildered wife of Eufemio of Ephesus, Korliss Uecker, a bright and pretty American soprano, was charming, crystalline of voice and sparkling as actress. Her rendering of the 'Scottish' air that Storace adapted and inserted for his sister (based on a familiar tune, 'The Yellow-hair'd Laddie') was one of the most affecting moments of an always-enjoyable evening. Her sister, Luciana, was played by the young British soprano Sarah Pring, also full of vitality and sensibility. In the third, lesser, but not insignificant female role, the Irish mezzosoprano Kate McCarney carried out her not always grateful assignment (Lesbia, her character, is something of a nag) with flair and conviction. The brisk conducting of Mark Shanahan kept singers and orchestra together admirably, but at a price: there was little suppleness or variety; fast and loud were the watchwords. Only now and then were the tender, even wistful moods of Storace's music given time and space to assert themselves. The set designed by Russell Craig was in a now surely outdated buffo style: tilted houses, many stairs, Mediterranean pinks and whites; and the staging of Giles Havergal, though it kept everyone on the move, was fairly predictable. But the signers did work together admirably. The staging may not have been great, but like the musical presentation, it had a welcome convincing coherence. Among the non-operatic events of this year's Wexford festival, one was particularly exciting: Elgar's Dream of Gerontius in the massive Church of the Immaculate Conception. John Lubbock conducted the visiting Ulster Orchestra and the combined choruses of the Belfast Philharmonic Society and the Wexford Singers, supporting a trio of fine soloists: Yvonne Howard, mezzosoprano; Justin Lavender, tenor; and Anthony Michaels-Moore, bass, in a performance that glowed. Lavender sang with unhistrionic intensity, conveying the impace of Newman's soul-bared text. The other soloists equalled it and Lubbock brought out the grand architecture of the music with the profound participation of his players and the joined choirs. That musicians from both parts of divided Ireland were performing, in unity, an English masterpiece, inevitably enhanced the emotion of the event.</p>

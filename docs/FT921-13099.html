			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Chemical Banking Corp pushes on with Dollars 1.36bn offer CHEMICAL Banking Corporation, the US bank resulting from the merger of Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust, pushed ahead with its Dollars 1.36bn share offering yesterday, the largest international equity deal to emerge so far this year. The share issue was priced at Dollars 27.25 per share, representing a discount of 2.2 per cent on Tuesday's closing price of Dollars 27.875. The issue was for 50m shares, including 5m shares available for international investors, and there is a 15 per cent over-allotment option. Goldman Sachs, lead manager to the deal, said demand for the shares had been 'significant', but added it was too early to say whether the over-allotment option would be taken up. However, demand for the international tranche of Chemical Banking shares was strong, particularly from Europe, with more than 5m shares placed with international inves-tors.</p>

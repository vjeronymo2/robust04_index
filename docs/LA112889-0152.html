			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ASK DR. RUTH: SEX ADDICTION MAY SIGNAL DEEPER EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS  </P> <P> Question: I know you say it is a false concept, but the fact is that I am a sex  addict. I am preoccupied with pornography, and I am totally obsessed with  women. It is adversely affecting my work and school, and my everyday life is a  mess. I just don't know what to do. What can I do to get rid of this illness?  </P> <P> Answer: I can't tell you something to do to overcome this obsession or to  understand your own perplexity or find out what it is that is really troubling  you. Because it could be that something is wrong and you respond to it by  thinking only about sex and women.  </P> <P> I can't say join the Y and work out every day or try a camping trip or anything  simple like that. The fact is your problem seems to me to be completely outside  my field of work.  </P> <P> You are troubled and must find a psychotherapist -- a specialist in helping  people with deep emotional problems.  </P> <P> Q. I was born with cerebral palsy and have never had any kind of relationship  with men, outside of my fantasy life. I have an elaborate technique for  pleasuring myself that lasts for hours. I can't be sure that the intense  sensations I achieve are orgasms, but I can go on for an hour or two producing  them every few minutes. At the same time I feel that I would like to quit doing  this, if there is a safe way. Please help.  </P> <P> A. Again, I would like you to get help from a psychotherapist because the most  important problem you seem to have is a terrible burden of guilt for having  sexual desire and a solitary way of seeking release. The sensations you  describe are orgasmic; different women have different kinds of orgasms, and the  kind you describe may simply be your kind.  </P> <P> In your letter you describe your routine pretty fully, and it seems you have  enough privacy to pleasure yourself and learn additional ways to do it.  </P> <P> A vibrator might give you stronger orgasms and longer-lasting release from  sexual tension, but in any case you need to discuss your problem with a  psychotherapist.  </P></p>

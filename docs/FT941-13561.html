			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Excalibur returns to black following restructuring A return to profits and an increase in the interim dividend boosted shares of Excalibur, the precision engineering, giftware and jewellery group, by 6 1/2 p to 42p. Mr Michael Griffiths, chairman, said he looked forward to 'a satisfactory outcome for the full year'. Mr Arthur Church, who joined as chief executive last summer, said the group had been restructured into two divisions, precision engineering and consumer products, with chief executives appointed to run each one. Profits before tax for the six months to end-October were Pounds 1.03m (losses of Pounds 183,000) and followed a deficit of Pounds 6.2m in the year to April 1993 after provisions of Pounds 5.8m against the jewellery side. Group turnover fell from Pounds 30.3m to Pounds 27.4m, as the jewellery business was reduced in size and the engineering side was affected by customers reducing stocks and moving to shorter lead times. Mr Griffiths said that order books were now picking up. Engineering turnover fell from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 11m with operating profits down from Pounds 1.18m to Pounds 937,000. Sales of giftware rose from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 10.7m, with profits up from Pounds 582,000 to Pounds 702,000. Mr Griffiths said that Pic-A-Tape, which provides retailers with audio and video tapes and CDs, had won Littlewoods and Little Chef as customers. Jewellery sales were down from Pounds 6.4m to Pounds 5.7m, with losses of Pounds 1.11m turned to an almost break even position. These activities are now described as 'non-core' with unprofitable business turned away and sales concentrated on fewer important customers. Interest charges fell from Pounds 837,000 to Pounds 608,000 while the tax rate remained low at 12 per cent thanks to tax losses, which are expected to keep the rate low for the full year. Earnings per share were 1.5p (loss 0.6p) and the interim dividend is raised by a quarter to 0.25p. The total dividend in 1992-93 was halved. COMMENT Institutional shareholders who lost patience with Excalibur and sold out at prices either side of 10p must be kicking themselves now. The jewellery side has at last been brought under control, and if rumour is to be believed, could even disappear. That leaves a good engineering business, a designated supplier to Rolls-Royce, for example, and an interesting giftware activity. Profit forecasts for the year of about Pounds 2m suggest a p/e of about 14 with the tax rate staying low. That still leaves something to go for.</p>

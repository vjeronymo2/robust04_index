			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Government retreats in row with teachers: Patten agrees to streamline tests from next year but union boycott will go ahead THE GOVERNMENT last night staged a retreat in its long-running battle with teachers by announcing that mandatory tests in schools would be simplified and streamlined from next year. Its decision, rushed out in a House of Commons statement after a morning of Downing Street crisis management, appeared to calm the rising discontent among Tory MPs about the handling of the dispute by Mr John Patten, the education secretary. But it failed to persuade the teachers to lift their boycott on this summer's tests. Mr Patten told MPs that in 1994 the tests for seven and 14-year-olds would be restricted to the 'core' subjects of English, mathematics and science (and in Wales, the Welsh language). The government will decide later whether to add technology for 14-year-olds. The row, which had set the government against most of the educational establishment and prompted growing unease among parents, contributed to the government's disastrous performance in last week's county council elections. Earlier Mr Patten was said to have been 'incandescent' at press reports that the prime minister's office had 'bounced' him into a climbdown. A Downing Street official denied he had been the source of the reports. But senior ministers confirmed that Mr Patten had been under intense pressure from Mr John Major and cabinet colleagues to produce a formula to defuse the row. Some colleagues believe Mr Patten remains vulnerable in the expected July cabinet reshuffle, but yesterday, at least, Mr Major offered his public backing. From 1994 the content of the tests will be simplified and the government will consider easing the burden on teachers by using outside examiners to mark them. The number of subjects for which teachers have to compile assessments of classroom work will also be cut. Mr Patten, saying next year's tests would 'focus on the basics', delayed until 1995 the nationwide introduction of testing of 11-year-olds. But he refused to bow to teachers' demands that the far more complicated tests due this year be scrapped. That left the teaching unions welcoming the planned 1994 changes but refusing to lift this summer's boycott. The unions, whose case has won unprecedented backing across all sections of the teaching profession, are unwilling to conduct the tests before the outcome of the full-scale review of the national curriculum by Sir Ron Dearing. By contrast, Mr Patten said this year's tests were essential to inform Sir Ron's review. He appealed to the unions to respond by ending their boycott. Privately, ministers were admitting the government's position owed much more to Mr Patten's determination to avoid capitulating to the unions than to any real hope the tests will go ahead. Mr Eamonn O'Kane, National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers' deputy general secretary, said: 'What he's proposed for 1994 doesn't go the whole way but certainly tries to open up the issues we would want addressed.' But he criticised the decision to press on with tests this year as a 'completely illogical and pointless exercise'. The government was further embarrassed last night by a revolt of five Tory MPs over its plans to restrict fishermen's time at sea and by defeats in the House of Lords on rights of leaseholders to buyfreeholds.

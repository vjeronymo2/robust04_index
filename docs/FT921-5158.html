			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Nigeria ponders devaluation in bid to renew IMF links NIGERIA'S military government was last night considering a devaluation of the naira as part of efforts to put the country's economic reform programme back on course and renew a lapsed agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF agreement is a condition to further rescheduling of the country's Dollars 34bn (Pounds 19.3bn) external debt, of which Dollars 17bn to Dollars 18bn is owed to Paris Club creditors. Nigeria hopes to hold talks with the club later this year. The ground for the devaluation was prepared earlier this week. Bankers in Lagos said they expected the central bank to announce today that the official rate of the naira had fallen from 10.56 to between 13 and 14 to the US dollar. The new rate will have been determined at yesterday's weekly auction of foreign currency by the central bank. A bank official said he expected today's announcement to disclose a devaluation of around 30 per cent. Such a substantial drop would not take place without the endorsement of President Ibrahim Babangida, thought to be consulting senior advisers before giving the final go-ahead. Although the weekly opportunity for banks to bid for foreign exchange is called an auction, the rate is in effect decided in advance by informal discussions within the banking sector. Discussions earlier this week paved the way for higher bids. Lagos bankers say there may be further falls in the coming weeks in an attempt to close the gap between the auction rate and local currency bureaux. The gap has been widening over the past few months, and before yesterday's measure the bureaux were offering between 18 and 19 naira to the dollar. The rate was unchanged as dealers awaited an announcement. The proposed devaluation, likely to be accompanied by a liquidity squeeze on the banks, was welcomed by some western creditors as an essential, but belated, effort to revive a faltering structural adjustment programme. Government officials have said that a devaluation would show creditors that Gen Babangida has not lost the political will to pursue the reform programme he launched in mid-1986. Critics, however, point out that the president has presided over a surge in public spending over the past 18 months, much of it on uneconomic projects, and often by-passing normal budgetary procedures. There is concern that a drift in economic management could leave the civilian administration, due next January, with an unmanageable economic inheritance. Yesterday's move coincides with the visit to Lagos by a team from the IMF. In a mid-term review last year, the Fund criticised government's failure to fulfil the terms of a SDR319m 18-month standby agreement which expires on April 8. One of the main conditions to a new standby agreement is that the government reforms Nigeria's complex exchange rate system which allows scores of recently formed small banks to benefit from the wide margin between the official rate and market demand. The World Bank has calculated that in 1990, when the spread between official and parallel rates averaged 20 per cent, the effective subsidy was some Dollars 500m. The World Bank has argued that genuine foreign exchange auction would remove much of the spread and increase government revenue. But many of the 80 or more banks that have entered the market since 1986 would not survive the squeeze. Hence this group of banks, many of which have close links with government, has a vested interest in the status quo.</p>

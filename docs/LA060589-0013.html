			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PORTER RANCH GRADING PLAN BIGGEST EVER;  </P> <P> DEVELOPER WANTS TO MOVE 40 MILLION CUBIC YARDS  </P> <P> A plan to develop 1,300 hilly acres in Porter Ranch calls for moving enough  earth to fill the Rose Bowl about 50 times.  </P> <P> The developer of the $2-billion residential and commercial project estimates  that 40 million cubic yards of earth must be graded during a 20-year  construction period.  </P> <P> Los Angeles city officials say they have not kept a running total of grading  approved in recent history, but they cannot remember a single project in the  city with more grading than proposed in Porter Ranch.  </P> <P> "Nobody remembers anything in terms of grading on that scale," said Frank  Orbin, assistant chief of the city Department of Building and Safety's grading  division. "Not even close to that size."  </P> <P> "We're certainly up there," Paul Clarke, spokesman for Porter Ranch Development  Co., said about the huge amount of grading proposed.  </P> <P> Some critics of the development proposal say the grading and reshaping of the  hills north of the Simi Valley Freeway are excessive. But Clarke noted that  existing Los Angeles zoning law allows home construction that would result in  substantial grading anyway.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Least Controversial Segment  </P> <P> The least controversial part of the Porter Ranch proposal is development of  single-family houses, and that portion of the plan alone accounts for about 80%  of the project's estimated grading, according to the developer's environmental  impact report.  </P> <P> The development firm, run by Beverly Hills builder Nathan Shapell, wants to  build 2,195 single-family houses, 800 multifamily housing units and 7.5 million  square feet of commercial space in the hilly Porter Ranch area of Chatsworth.  City Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the area, has recommended reducing  the commercial area to about 6 million square feet and adding 400 multifamily  housing units.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Planning Commission is scheduled to consider the plan Thursday,  although the panel is awaiting a decision from the city attorney's office on  whether two members have a conflict of interest that would bar the commission  from hearing the matter.  </P> <P> If the commission cannot hear the application, the Board of Referred Powers,  which is made up of City Council members, would have to make recommendations on  the plan to the full council.  </P> <P> To comprehend the amount of grading proposed for the Porter Ranch project,  consider how much soil it would take to fill the Rose Bowl. Since the facility  has a volume of about 814,000 cubic yards, according to the city of Pasadena,  the amount of earth to be graded at Porter Ranch would fill the stadium about  50 times.  </P> <P> Or consider the amount of concrete used to build Hoover Dam in Nevada -- 3.25  million cubic yards. The amount of earth to be graded in Porter Ranch would be  about 12 times that amount.  </P> <P> The 40 million cubic yards to be graded, if massed into a giant cube, would be  1,026 feet high. By comparison, City Hall is about 450 feet high.  </P> <P> Workers operating 100 bulldozers eight hours a day, five days a week would need  at least two years to grade 40 million cubic yards, said Frank Byron, an  engineer with McCoy Construction Co., a Calabasas firm that specializes in  grading.  </P> <P> Clarke has described the project as the largest in the city's history by one  landowner on one piece of land. The elevation of the hilly site ranges from  1,150 to 1,850 feet above sea level.  </P> <P> The grading is described in the project's environmental impact report as "cut  and fill." "Cut" refers to the taking of land off hilltops, and "fill" refers  to the movement of that earth into valleys. In other words, little or no earth  is removed from the site, which becomes more level.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hillside Development  </P> <P> The grading proposed for Porter Ranch would take place over the life of the  project, development company officials said. And the environmental impact  report points out that far smaller hillside developments in Los Angeles have  resulted in moving more earth per acre or per home than is proposed in Porter  Ranch.  </P> <P> For example, in the Santa Monica Mountains, the 117-acre Bel-Air Crest Estates  project resulted in 6.7 million cubic yards of grading, or about 57,000 per  acre. The grading proposed for Porter Ranch is about 30,000 cubic yards per  acre.  </P> <P> With any project, heavy grading can become necessary because housing demand and  the high cost of land prompt developers to make projects as dense as possible,  said Brian Heller, an Agoura Hills builder.  </P> <P> Building more homes means doing more grading, Heller said. "If the land prices  hadn't escalated so much and demand hadn't been so high, they could have built  five-acre lots" in Porter Ranch, he said.  </P> <P> In Orange County, McCoy Construction recently completed grading 56 million  cubic yards for a 3,500-home project in the San Clemente area, Byron said. The  original estimate was 30 million cubic yards, but buttressing the project to  prevent landslides resulted in nearly twice as much grading, he said.  </P> <P> Clarke, the Porter Ranch spokesman, noted that the total amount of grading in  the past 20 years for the 5,000 existing homes in the Porter Ranch area of  Northridge probably exceeds 40 million cubic yards, although the homes were not  approved as a single project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sheer Amount  </P> <P> Still, the sheer amount of grading has drawn criticism from some opponents of  the project.  </P> <P> "There won't be anything left of nature when they get through," said Jan  Hinkston, founder of the Santa Susana Mountain Park Assn. "It's too much of an  impact."  </P> <P> "Obviously 40 million cubic yards is egregiously too much," said Robert Birch,  a spokesman for the PRIDE residents group, which opposes the project.  </P> <P> The developer's environmental impact report said the grading effects would be  minimal because of various measures to control erosion and prevent landslides.  But the report also addresses how the project's reshaping of hills would affect  the visual appearance of the area.  </P> <P> "Development of the specific plan area would permanently alter the visual  character of the site from surrounding areas," the report said. "Views of  existing undeveloped rolling hills would be changed to views of residential and  commercial development and landscaping with some open space remaining."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Big Dig  </P> <P> City Hall gives some perspective to the amount of soil that would be moved at  Porter Ranch. The development calls for an estimated 40 million cubic yard (a  cube 1,026 ft. on all sides of grading during the 20-year construction period.  It is the largest total amount for any Los Angeles project in recent memory,  although builders of smaller hillside projects in the city have graded more per  acre or per housing unit. The total amount of earth that would be moved in  Porter Ranch is about 50 times the volume of the Rose Bowl and 12 times the  volume of concrete in the Hoover Dam. A fleet of 100 bulldozers would take at  least two years to complete the job.  </P></p>

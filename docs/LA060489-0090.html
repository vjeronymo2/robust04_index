			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CELEBRATING ITS 100TH YEAR;  </P> <P> A FRONTIER DREAM COMES OF AGE FOR ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> One hundred years ago today, a bearded, one-eyed Civil War hero, erstwhile free  love advocate and "Bible communist" by the name of James William Towner  presided over the creation of Orange County, now a national symbol of American  conservatism.  </P> <P> Towner had been a utopian visionary and socialist opponent of private property  back East, where he had lived until his move to California seven years earlier.  But in his new home, Santa Ana, he had become a landowner, an innovative farmer  and the city attorney. And soon, elected Orange County's first Superior Court  judge, he would prove to be tough on crime as well.  </P> <P> His selection by the governor of California to organize the June 4 election, in  which the southeastern corner of Los Angeles County seceded, was a  perspicacious beginning for a county that would be torn for the next century by  a twin impulse to provincial conformity and constant change.  </P> <P> What is now the premier theme park of the American dream, the largest base of  conservative votes in the nation, the world's 27th-strongest economy and one of  its most important high-tech centers, was then a sleepy, cattle-grazing desert.  But over ensuing decades it would shudder periodically in the throes of social  revolution brought on by massive economic growth and counter-revolution fueled  by the dislocation of entrenched classes and values.  </P> <P> In the process, the county would often be at war with itself as it attempted to  define the frontier dream.  </P> <P> </P> <P> County's Contradictions  </P> <P> Was that dream represented by a cosmopolitan import like Towner and his  "Townerite" followers or by the lynch mob that dragged a prisoner from his  jail?  </P> <P> In the 1920s, was the county best represented by the energetic merchants of  Anaheim, who sought to build a metropolitan center of commerce, or by the  virulent Ku Klux Klan?  </P> <P> In the '50s, was its theme Disneyland, suggesting an America without conflict,  or the John Birch Society, trumpeting the call to political Armageddon?  </P> <P> And now, is Orange County most clearly the new international headquarters of  multinational corporations, or the last bastion of America First provincialism?  </P> <P> The journey from Towner's Orange County with its 13,000 rural residents to the  exploding 2-million-strong exurbanite center of today has not been a simple  one, but there are some continuous, if quirky, lines to be followed. One is  that the continual and massive change in the county's population base has  resulted in a constant reinvention of myth and place. The result has been a  political leadership fitfully connected to the passions of the moment rather  than to local history.  </P> <P> From its first days, the county has constantly redefined its history and  standards in a way that no New England town, for example, would tolerate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First in a Trend  </P> <P> And, in the spirit of the frontier, there is the easy assurance of each new  generation of civic activists that the revision is the only one consistent with  the traditions of the place.  </P> <P> In that sense, Towner, the displaced social visionary who presided over the  county's first election, was merely the first in a trend.  </P> <P> Historian Spencer Olin of the University of California at Irvine, who has  documented the activities of Towner and other former "Bible communists" in  Orange County, is not sure whether California Gov. Robert W. Waterman knew of  Towner's leading role in the Berlin Heights Free Love Community of Ohio or in  New York State's radical socialist community, Oneida, when he appointed Towner  to the commission to organize the county. Or if Waterman knew that the  Townerites, about 40 followers of this charismatic visionary, had collectively  purchased major holdings in Santa Ana, including the land on which the Orange  County Courthouse would later stand.  </P> <P> In the early 1880s, the local Santa Ana Weekly Standard had warned that the  Townerites might be about creating a new Oneida, Mormon, or free love community  and that "it will be a good idea for parents to keep their eyes on their  daughters and husbands on their weak wives." But that concern soon blew over.  </P> <P> The Townerites paid their taxes, farmed their land, developed new strains of  citrus and designed Santa Ana's sewer and water system. They might be a bit  off, but they were white, Protestant, prosperous -- and they belonged.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Elected Chairman  </P> <P> Most likely, Towner was simply taken by the governor for what he, by then, was  -- a respectable citizen, a pillar of a young, growing economy and a war hero  who had lost his eye in the battle of Pea Ridge, Ark.  </P> <P> In any event, Towner was elected by his colleagues as chairman of the  commission organizing the vote on a new county, and succeeded in uniting the  politicians of the towns of Orange, Anaheim and Santa Ana -- who had been  squabbling over which community would become the county seat -- long enough to  stage Orange County's first election. (Anaheim residents feared losing power to  Santa Ana, with its three times larger population of 3,600.)  </P> <P> In the end, fewer than 3,000 citizens voted, but they approved the creation of  the county by a 5-1 margin, and picked its first leaders, including Towner as  Superior Court judge.  </P> <P> And so it came to pass that on June 4, 1889, the inhabitants of the  southeastern end of Los Angeles County, mostly grouped around the excitable  hamlet of Santa Ana, voted to secede, fulfilling the requirements of a bill  that had cleared the state Legislature some three months earlier, largely as a  result of bribes paid by resourceful Santa Ana merchants and farmers.  </P> <P> The best source on just how much the Legislature's vote cost is still a  50-year-old University of Southern California master's thesis by William W.  Wieman, who was told by Santa Ana grocery store owner George Edger: "Hell, yes,  we bought this county from the state Legislature for $10,000, and I went out  and raised the money myself in two hours and it was a rainy morning at that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Estimate May Be Low  </P> <P> The Edger quote is now part of unquestioned Orange County folklore, but Wieman  notes that Edger's remark was made in an interview 35 years after the event and  the old man's estimate was probably low.  </P> <P> Later generations might not approve bribing the Legislature, but hustling  government authorities has always been a favorite pastime in a county dependent  upon real estate lawyering from the earliest subdivision of the Spanish land  grants to the current pleading for zoning variances. In fact, the main argument  for separating the County of Orange from Los Angeles County was that citizens  could gain local control of the law.  </P> <P> Whatever the price, the Santa Ana lobbyists accomplished just that, creating a  new Board of Supervisors and new courts while presenting their L.A. rivals with  a fait accompli. The Los Angeles papers, including this one, opposed the  secession, but in the end they bade farewell to what the Herald called "our  wayward sister."  </P> <P> There was some grumbling, but Orange County is by Western standards small --  785 square miles -- and most people in Los Angeles did not seem to notice their  southern neighbors' secession. What would one day be one of the hottest real  estate markets in the world slipped out of their hands without much of a fight.  </P> <P> For the secessionists, the reasons for parting were clear and have a  contemporary resonance. They were being taxed to help solve L.A's problems,  which they felt were not their own. And they hated the commute required to go  complain about it. A trip on the once-a-day train to the Civic Center was  costly ($2), lengthy and uncertain, and the more hectic life of the emerging  metropolis had little they wanted as compensation.  </P> <P> In their southern colonies and small agricultural plots, they had ample work  and commerce. And, as is still true today, when their hamlets grew too large,  they moved further away from Los Angeles to even more rural residences.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Hicks  </P> <P> Nevertheless, they were not hicks. From its first days, Orange County provided  a model of modernization without urbanization. During most of its 100 years,  the county has been plugged into the latest in scientific agriculture and  transportation, even if artistic amenities were for a long time considerably  less in evidence.  </P> <P> For excitement and escape, then as now, even relative sophisticates like Towner  seemed drawn in their leisure hours to the wooden beach houses of Newport  rather than to the attractions of teeming downtown Los Angeles. One of the few  surviving photos of Towner depicts him, thin and serene in a proper two-piece  bathing suit, in front of one such beach house, gazing out at the Pacific  Ocean.  </P> <P> The first act of government, as described by county historian Jim Sleeper, was  the sound of a deputy sheriff's voice bellowing out in Towner's law office,  "Hear ye! Hear ye! The Superior Court of Orange County is now in session for  the transaction of business."  </P> <P> In his lively book on this period, Sleeper provides evidence that Towner,  whatever his libertine social theories, and although a Democrat in "the  sovereign Republican County of Orange," was a tough law-and-order man.  </P> <P> The first felony conviction in the county was leveled by Judge Towner against  the hapless Modesta Avila, "whose livelihood," Sleeper wrote, "depended more on  her charms than her wits." Other historians regard Avila as a more heroic  figure, who challenged the right of the Santa Fe railroad to run near her  house. For the crime of spreading her laundry on the tracks and delaying a  train, Towner sent Avila to San Quentin on a three-year stretch, where she died  two years into her sentence.  </P> <P> But the judge was evidently not tough enough for the vigilantes who performed  California's last lynching, in 1892, rather than wait for him to return from a  trip and try the murder case of one Francisco Torres.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lynching Condoned  </P> <P> In a portrait of the county's leading newspaper editor of the time, Sleeper  quotes his editorial, which essentially condoned the lynching, replete with the  prevailing racism of the time:  </P> <P> "Torres was a low type of the Mexican race, and was evidently more Indian than  white. True to his savage nature, he had no more regard for human life than for  the merest trifle. The sooner such savages are exterminated the better for  decent civilization."  </P> <P> This example of an impulse for tough law and order to end in racism was not  uncommon in the county's history, which has been marked by a pugnacious  provincialism, and by a desire to avoid the turbulence of the larger American  culture by excluding the nation's "problems" and "problem groups."  </P> <P> The reign of the Anaheim klan is one example. In 1924, candidates sponsored by  the Ku Klux Klan swept the municipal elections in Anaheim. The klan presence  would extend throughout Orange County for the next decade, but the immediate  effect in Anaheim was to send this growing citrus-trade town into an economic  tailspin for a quarter of a century.  </P> <P> And it is still recalled as a major event. In a recent interview, Raymond  Watson, Irvine Co. vice chairman, mentioned the klan legacy as a reason that  blacks were not attracted to Orange County at the time he helped create the  city of Irvine in the early 1970s. And Richard O'Neill, one of the county's  largest landowners and a leader of the Democratic Party, cited "the klan years"  as a source of Orange County's rightist image.  </P> <P> As often afterward in the county's history, provincial preoccupation collided  with modernizing forces to leave the area torn between its images as a  reactionary backwater and a more cosmopolitan business center.  </P> <P> </P> <P> UC Irvine Report  </P> <P> This tension was outlined in a massive UC Irvine report by Leonard Moffitt in  1967. The campus was then in its infancy and its first chancellor, Daniel  Aldrich, commissioned the study, circulated internally, to assess the temper of  the community in which the school would operate. What emerged was a history of  a society that moves inevitably toward urbanization while just as continuously  resisting it.  </P> <P> Moffitt cited the Anaheim klan experience as an important manifestation of that  contradiction: "In this milieu of growth expectations, Anaheim's population  doubled between 1919 and 1924. Businessmen had reason for optimism. BUT! Just  when they had their first industrial concern lined up to come to Anaheim,  something happened to make it locate elsewhere. Something happened which sent  Anaheim into a quarter-century of stagnation."  </P> <P> That something was the klan takeover. Although the klan was certainly white  supremacist and restricted its membership to Protestants, it did not base its  appeal on overt racism. The black and Jewish populations of the county were  infinitesimal, and most of the Catholics were of Mexican origin and already  living culturally apart from the mainstream. The klan, nationally, thrived on  fighting against a presumed conspiracy of the powerful. It was difficult to  make a case that anyone other than white Protestants had power in Orange  County.  </P> <P> Instead, the klan turned to puritanism for its sense of moral rage and began by  making a call for strict enforcement of Prohibition laws the heart of its  program. It looked for Catholic conspiracies behind drunkenness and lawlessness  and had a field day ballyhooing a rise in crime, despite evidence to the  contrary, in cities like Fullerton, where some Catholics were in the elite.  </P> <P> In Anaheim, Prohibition pitted the original, often German, settlers, who were  fond of their beer and wine, against newer arrivals from the Midwest who were  more likely to heed the call of abstinence. The klan campaigned on this issue  all over the county, but it was in Anaheim that it had its greatest success,  sweeping all four council seats.  </P> <P> Virtually all the members of the Anaheim police force, including the chief,  were klansmen. During that summer of 1924, between 10,000 and 20,000 klansmen  descended on Anaheim (pop. 11,000) for the biggest klan rally ever held in the  state.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Right-Wing Image  </P> <P> "I remember hearing about how they had marched through the streets of Anaheim,"  said O'Neill, the Democratic leader. "They were marching down the street and  carrying rifles and guns." If many of the marchers were from elsewhere --  including the klan marching band of Santa Monica -- the image of Orange County  as rightist and paranoid had been cast.  </P> <P> The war on decadence and crime are recurring themes in Orange County life, but  in the final analysis, the klan could go nowhere because it was at odds with  modernization, indeed with capitalism. Prohibition could not withstand the  onslaught of consumer sovereignty and it proved no more possible to police the  speak-easies of Anaheim than the brothels of Seal Beach's "joy zone."  </P> <P> In a detailed dissertation for UCLA on the Orange County klan, Christopher  Cocoltchos argues that klan members, like religious fundamentalists, were  responding to the rapid social change in the area with a call for social  rigidity. "The klan in northern Orange County sought to balance economic growth  with a concern for a moral, character-developing, civic culture," he writes,  but it failed to understand that "growth, boosterism, and the drive toward a  corporate economy were as much a part of the white Protestant cultural heritage  as Prohibition."  </P> <P> After 1924, a coalition of Anaheim's elite and two major newspapers defeated  klan candidates in election after election, but the town remained deeply  divided and economically stagnant.  </P> <P> In the end, it was not elections but highways that changed Anaheim and Orange  County. The new Santa Ana Freeway from Los Angeles was extended to Anaheim by  1951 and with it the start of a massive population and economic boom. The  revival was certified in 1955 by the opening of Disneyland and was capped 11  years later by the move from Los Angeles of the California Angels, who outdrew  the other American league teams in attendance during their first year.  </P> <P> That was when Anaheim finally realized the dream of its early boosters and  surpassed Santa Ana as the county's largest town. It was no wonder, given its  history with the klan, that here, as in the rest of the county, most of the  newcomers continued to be white and Protestant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> White Flight  </P> <P> This tendency was reinforced in ensuing years as the wrenching fight over  school busing in Los Angeles turned Orange County into a haven of white flight  and shored up the conservative electoral base.  </P> <P> The conservative impulse in Orange County came early to be identified with  Republicanism and in the 1920s, the GOP was getting more than three-quarters of  the vote.  </P> <P> The Depression, which saw 15% welfare rates in the county, gave Franklin D.  Roosevelt slim majorities in 1936 and '40. But the vote has gone back to the  Republicans ever since, except for Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s first gubernatorial  campaign in 1975, when he was thought of as a fiscal conservative. The  Democrats briefly enjoyed a majority in voter registration, but lost it when  Brown appointed Edison Miller, a controversial anti-war former Vietnam POW, to  the county Board of Supervisors in 1979.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, a number of serious academic studies have demonstrated that the  county's historic conservative electoral reputation is too simple a  formulation. Liberal Republicans often did better than conservative ones. For  example, Earl Warren in 1950 received three-quarters of the vote for governor  and Dwight D. Eisenhower got nearly 70% in 1952, but Barry Goldwater, leader of  the conservative movement, took only 55.8% in the 1964 presidential election.  And in the 1950s, Orange County had a fairly moderate delegation to Sacramento.  </P> <P> Ideological contradictions, however, run deeper than is indicated in election  results. The county has been "conservative" on taxation and on government  spending for everything but freeways, but it is also often "libertarian" in its  opposition to the public regulation of private morality.  </P> <P> These contradictory tendencies were summarized in the 1967 study commissioned  by former UC Irvine President Aldrich, with particular reference to the Santa  Ana Register (now the Orange County Register), which strongly espoused  libertarian ideas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Libertarian Editorials  </P> <P> "While some conservatives demand an escalated war in Vietnam, the Register  prints editorials critical of the draft. While some conservatives carry  'Support Your Local Police' bumper stickers, the Register objects to government  police supported by taxes. While some conservatives demand vigorous public  support of morality, the Register recoils in horror at the thought of morality  via legislation or administrative decree. While some conservatives want to  preserve a small-town environment through city planning, the Register denounces  zoning as outright socialism."  </P> <P> The Register has since mellowed in its objection to virtually all government  activity and now refers in its news stories to "public schools" instead of "the  taxpayer-supported schools" as it once did. But last year its editorial page  editor could still shock an Orange County Young Republican gathering by  advocating the legalization of drugs at a time when the Republican  Administration had made the war on drugs one of its key programs.  </P> <P> Conservatism, in the sense of preservation of rural, small-town values and  certainties along with resistance to government intrusion, particularly from  the federal government, has always struck a sympathetic chord in Orange County.  But from the example of Towner and the Townerites on through the editorial  policies of the Register it has also exhibited a libertarian preoccupation with  individuality.  </P> <P> During most of the county's history, these two tendencies seemed to coexist  harmoniously enough. But, as the study for Aldrich documents, there were  periodic breakdowns. The Ku Klux Klan experience, in the 1920s and '30s, was  one example. In the '50s and '60s, the John Birch Society proved to be another.  And as with the klan, the Birch Society developed in resistance to the prospect  of rapid economic and social change.  </P> <P> The dominant fact of life in the county since 1951, when the Santa Ana Freeway  from Los Angeles came through, has been rampant growth -- the growth of  population, roads, factories, churches -- you name it. And, once again, the  tension between a desire to ride in the fast lane and the perceived need for a  sturdy moral safety belt asserted itself in the form of another far-right  political movement.  </P> <P> This time it was the Birch Society, which at its peak elected a congressman and  had at least 6,000 members locally.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conservatives Bolstered  </P> <P> During that period, massive migration into the county -- largely Midwestern  Republicans, Southern Democrats and white-flight refugees from Los Angeles --  reinforced the conservative trend. It was a time in which the county's  still-dominant agricultural base was being overwhelmed by suburban sprawl and  during which housing tracts replaced lima bean fields and citrus groves. But  prosperity, a largely homogeneous middle-class white population and relative  security seemed to once again provide fertile ground for extremist movements.  </P> <P> The first target of the John Birch Society was a little-known school trustee in  the Magnolia School District who was host to a meeting of the American Civil  Liberties Union in 1955. As a result, three recall elections took place, and  The Times reported that "soon the entire school district wobbled at the mere  mention of the words 'liberal' or 'moderate."  </P> <P> This was the time of John G. Schmitz and Robert Peterson, who developed  national reputations for being tough on communism, though the hunt for "reds"  in Orange County was limited by a lack of game.  </P> <P> Peterson won the 1966 election for county superintendent of schools -- a  position he still holds -- by capitalizing on a reputation developed through  his tough-sounding courses on communism at Santa Ana College.  </P> <P> Schmitz was a Marine Corps captain at the El Toro base who parlayed lecture  circuit appearances on the red menace into a political career as a state  senator and later became a one-term U.S. congressman.  </P> <P> But with the erosion of the Cold War as an emotional organizing point for the  right, once again external events overwhelmed local provincialism. This began  in earnest with Richard M. Nixon's visit to, and subsequent recognition of,  Communist China in 1972. Nixon, who came from nearby Whittier, had impeccable  conservative credentials, but his actions threw the John Birch Society, which  was named after an early victim of Red China, into a tizzy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nixon Denounced  </P> <P> Schmitz denounced Nixon's trip to China as a betrayal and suggested that he  stay there. Nixon returned the favor by finding a successful opponent for  Schmitz's congressional seat.  </P> <P> Eventually, as in the past, the extremists seemed to self-destruct. Schmitz,  who had returned to the state Senate, became embroiled in enormously untidy  domestic disputes and is once again a community college teacher, out of office  and power.  </P> <P> In the post-Birch years, conservatism came to be identified almost exclusively  with the much more centrist and solid figure of Ronald Reagan, who launched  both of his successful presidential campaigns from Orange County. Nor did  Reagan's moderating of his domesticand foreign policy agenda, including his  opening to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, in any way mitigate his popularity  here. The county seems periodically willing to cock an ear and even a  respectful glance towards extremism, but quite easily settles back into  moderation.  </P> <P> The distance between a Schmitz and a Reagan is comparable to that between the  klan and the Anaheim business elite in an earlier period. And the question  persists as to which represents the true conservative impulse that so heavily  marks the Orange County experience.  </P> <P> Recently a group of scholars at UC Irvine and other California universities  prepared a detailed study on the social transformation of Orange County since  World War II, to be published next year, which, in part, attempts to answer  that question. They emphasize that a persistent modernizing tendency has always  been at odds with the traditional conservative impulse.  </P> <P> But now the modernizing tendency has become a full-blown embrace of a new  economic syndrome; the information economy, dominated by multinational  corporations with few regional ties, in which Orange County is a national  leader. The UC Irvine School of Management boasts that Orange County "has the  highest concentration of high-tech companies in the nation."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Values Defined  </P> <P> A hundred years ago, when Towner arrived in Santa Ana from the far more  cosmopolitan East, it was relatively easy to forget all of the wild new ideas  he had encountered there. Settling into a secure and cohesive agricultural  village, he could quickly absorb its prevalent values, which were then clearly  defined.  </P> <P> Nowadays, however, the center of life in Orange County is represented by John  Wayne Airport, which is undergoing a massive expansion, and the new office  buildings and hotels that surround it make up the ever-changing village.  </P> <P> The county has become what UC Irvine historian Olin, in his chapter of the  forthcoming campus study, calls "an epicenter for global capitalism," in which  the "small-scale farmers, local merchants, and manufacturers who previously  wielded economic and political power" have been displaced.  </P> <P> This information economy attracts an increasingly sophisticated and often  foreign-born work force. Its members owe their allegiance to a company that can  whisk them and their families off on short notice to another branch thousands  of miles away. This new milieu is not one that easily sustains provincial,  conservative values and, as a result, contradictions continue to tug at Orange  County's political soul.  </P> <P> Times researcher Nina Green contributed to this report.  </P></p>

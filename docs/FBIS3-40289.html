			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Stelio Papathemelis, minister of public </F> order of Greece, by Filip Cakuli; place and date not given]    [Text] [Cakuli] Mr. Minister, as a member of the new Greek  Government, how do you evaluate relations with neighboring  Albania?    [Papathemelis] Greece's relations with Albania certainly  should develop in the framework of good-neighborliness,  especially after the decision of the former PASOK [Panhellenic  Socialist Movement] government to remove the state of war.  Good-neighborliness means, first of all, good faith, mutual  confidence, and friendly cooperation. Also it means the  recognition of the rights of existing minorities, which are a  result of international conventions. The new Greek Government is  fully predisposed to develop relations with Albania, on the  foundation of good-neighborliness. However, it considers the  following as basic conditions: not only the legal and formal  recognition of the rights of the Greek minority in Albania but,  first of all, their actual implementation in all spheres of  life: religion, language, education, local government, and so  forth. It is also important to avoid actions and statements that  might have negative effects on and consequences for relations  among states. Greece steadfastly desires normal relations with  Albania but, at the same time, it will determinedly and  unrelentingly defend the rights of the Greek minority in  Albania.    [Cakuli] You recently visited Albania with a group of  deputies from the Greek parliament. What are your impressions  from this visit?    [Papathemelis] My impressions of Albania are of a country  which is trying, with great difficulties, to rise above some  very great economic and social problems inherited from the past.  I am hoping for the victory of those political and social forces  which are seeking a peaceful and democratic future for Albania,  those forces which are predisposed to respect the political and  personal rights of all the residents of Albania, regardless of  their origin, Albanians, Greeks, or people of any other origin.  Of course, I am disturbed when I see some forces which are  trying to penetrate even into the official political opinion of  a friendly country, seeking to cultivate disagreements with one  of the countries with which Albania has a border -- Greece.    [Cakuli] One of the greatest concerns for our two countries  is the problem of the Albanian refugees in Greece. As a result  of a deterioration in relations between the two countries, there  was a massive return of Albanian refugees by your side. The  support and employment of these refugees, who were forced to  emigrate because of difficulties, constitute valuable assistance  which Greece and its people gave and are giving to Albania. Our  high officials, especially the president of the Republic, have  expressed gratitude for this publicly, both inside and outside  the country. The previous government talked about legalizing  their status and the two sides have talked but the issue has not  yet been resolved. What do you think about this matter and what  do you think could be done to resolve it?    [Papathemelis] I would say that it is not quite like that  and  perhaps it is just the opposite. Thus, it is not a matter of a  mass return of illegal refugees as a result of tension in  relations between the two sides but just the opposite: Every  time that Greece is forced to send back to Albanian territory  those criminal elements which penetrate into the ranks of  illegal refugees, Albania causes tension in bilateral relations,  with accusations and threats which, fortunately, Greece does not  regard seriously. Instead of accepting the emigration to Greece  of thousands of its desperate residents, Albania would be better  off to cooperate with the Greek Government, which is ready to  grant economic and technical assistance to Albania, assistance  that would contribute to the resolution of the social problem in  your country. The gratitude of the Albanian side, which you  mentioned, for the real reception which Greece has given to all,  should not be accompanied by measures, for example in education,  in regard to the church, and so forth, which do not show the  respect required by international norms of law. Nevertheless,  the Greek Government is ready to resolve this issue in the best  way possible, in accordance with democratic views on human  rights and (it goes without saying) the protection of the mutual  interests of the two countries.    Note: The editorial board of RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE has  its objections to this interview. It expresses its thanks to Mr.  Stelio Papathemelis for his readiness and it is open to the  expression of opinions regarding this interview, while wishing  for the constructive development of Albanian-Greek  relations.</p>

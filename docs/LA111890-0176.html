			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CHICAGO, ST. LOUIS KEEP ON ROLLING  </P> <P> As recently as last season, the Norris Division was considered the weakest  division in the NHL.  </P> <P> It is no longer true. In fact, two of the teams, Chicago and St. Louis,  apparently are as good as any. Both are on winning streaks.  </P> <P> Steve Thomas had a hat trick in the second period at Quebec Saturday night and  the Blackhawks, leading the division, handed the Nordiques their 13th  consecutive defeat, 7-2.  </P> <P> Chicago is on a 5-0-2 surge and leads the Blues, who have won six in a row, by  three points.  </P> <P> The Blackhawks had a 1-0 lead before Thomas broke the game open with his three  goals.  </P> <P> St. Louis 3, Minnesota 2 -- A brilliant performance by goalie Curtis Joseph at  Bloomington, Minn., compensated for the failure of Brett Hull to get a point.  </P> <P> Hull, who has 19 goals, had an 11-game scoring streak snapped.  </P> <P> Joseph stopped 34 shots and the Blues had goals from Paul Cavallini and Bob  Bassen less than two minutes apart in the first period.  </P> <P> Hartford 4, Washington 2 -- Doug Crossman and Kevin Dineen scored 25 seconds  apart in the first period at Hartford, Conn., to lead the Whalers to their  fourth consecutive victory.  </P> <P> Ten days ago, the Capitals were flying high, but now they have lost five in a  row.  </P> <P> Boston 1, Montreal 1 -- After being blanked by Andy Moog for 105 minutes this  season, the Canadiens finally solved him and earned a tie at Boston.  </P> <P> Mark Pederson's goal got Montreal even at 5:27 of the third period after John  Carter scored for the Bruins in the first period.  </P> <P> New Jersey 3, Philadelphia 2 -- Although Flyer goalie Pete Peeters protested,  referee Kerry Fraser ruled that Bruce Driver's shot on a power play crossed the  goal line for the winning score in the third period at East Rutherford, N.J.  </P> <P> Detroit 8, Toronto 4 -- Steve Yzerman had a hat trick in the first 12 minutes  at Toronto, then assisted on two other goals to lead the Red Wings' romp.  </P> <P> Buffalo 3, Calgary 3 -- Mikko Makela scored with a little more than five  minutes left in regulation at Calgary to get the Sabres the tie.

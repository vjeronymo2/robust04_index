			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: SOUTH GATE;  </P> <P> AFTER-SCHOOL CHILD-CARE PROGRAM HAS 60 ENROLLED  </P> <P> Montara Avenue Elementary School is offering an after-school child-care program  through the South Gate Parks and Recreation Department.  </P> <P> About 60 children in kindergarten through sixth grade are enrolled in the  program, and an average of 20 participate each week, Principal Dan Basalone  said.  </P> <P> Activities for the children include physical education, library, arts, crafts  and snack time.  </P> <P> The program runs from 2:43 to 6 p.m. weekdays and serves mainly students from  Montara Elementary School, plus children from other nearby schools.  </P> <P> The effect on the children has been noticeable, Basalone said. "Children are  completing homework assignments because they have an hour to do it in the  library and someone to help them."  </P> <P> Parents also have been favorable toward the program, Basalone said. "For $15 a  week, they get 17 1/2 hours of child care, which breaks down to less than $1 an  hour," he said.  </P> <P> The enrollment fee is $5 per child. Weekly rates are $15 for the first child in  a family, $12 for the second child, and $10 for each additional child.  </P></p>

They have  been positively linked to the Heidelberg Tavern killings, Mr  Kriel said in a statement. "These arrests brings to four the  number of suspects being held in connection with this attack.  Further arrests are not excluded," the statement said.    Both suspects, aged 24 and 22, were arrested earlier this  week in Elliot in South African territory whilst travelling  between two destinations in the Trankskei.    The arrest of the two members of the Pan Africanist  Congress'  [PAC] armed wing, coupled with investigations, had verified the  finding by the Goldstone Commission that the Transkei was indeed  a "safe haven for killers exporting terrorism to South Africa",  Mr Kriel said.    The South African Police [SAP] was investigating whether all  four suspects were linked to other terror atrocities in the  western Cape. This "major breakthrough" further emphasised the  urgent necessity for the Transkei to co-operate in establishing  a joint SAP/Transkei police investigation team to further probe  the matter, said Mr Kriel.</p>

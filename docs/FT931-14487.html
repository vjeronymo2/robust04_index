			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Economics: Good timing for Clinton as US recovery gathers pace MR Bill Clinton takes over as US president on Wednesday amid signs that the US recovery is gathering pace. This week brings few economic figures to upset the new President although housing starts data on Friday are forecast to be relatively subdued. In November housing starts rose 1.5 per cent. Many economists now believe that the boost to housing from record low mortgage rates has passed and any increases in housing from now are likely to be more modest. In the UK there are a number of important figures on the real economy. Hopes are high that December's retail sales figures tomorrow will reflect anecdotal evidence of a boost to sales over Christmas and reverse November's 0.1 per cent drop. Later on in the week there are figures for unemployment, and industrial output as well as two economic surveys. The British Chambers of Commerce produces its quarterly economic survey and there is the monthly distributive trades survey from the Confederation of British Industry. Today: Belgium, EC finance ministers meeting in Brussels; France, November industrial production (down 0.4 per cent); Canada, December advanced departmental store sales (up 4 per cent on year); US, Martin Luther King Day, some markets closed.

Wednesday: US, Bill Clinton's inauguration as president, Federal Reserve releases Tan-book for February Federal Open Markets Committee Meeting; Canada, November unfilled orders (down 0.6 per cent); UK, December retail sales; Japan, November industrial production; Australia, November housing finance. Thursday: UK, December unemployment (up 35,000), November average earnings (up 5.25 per cent), November unit wage costs (up 0.6 per cent in 3 months to end November), November industrial production (up 0.1 per cent), November manufacturing output (flat on month, up 0.5 per cent on year), British Chambers of Commerce quarterly economic survey; Germany, regular Bundesbank council meeting in Frankfurt, first round of banking sector wage negotiations; Sweden, December CPI (up 0.2 per cent on month, up 1.7 per cent on year); Canada, December CPI (up 0.1 per cent on month); US, money supply data for week ended January 11, senate confirmation hearing for Laura Tyson, nominee for CEA chair; Japan, wholesale price index January 1-10, December money supply, December broad liquidity.

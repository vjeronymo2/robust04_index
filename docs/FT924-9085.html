			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Copyright plans spark concern BRITAIN'S broadcasters are to complain to the European Commission over a planned change to a draft EC directive that they believe would discourage film and television production. The legal affairs committee of the European parliament this week accepted an amendment that would mean that the 'authors' of an audio-visual work should be its creators. UK broadcasters believe that the decision means the main copyright owners in a film or television programme would be people such as the director and scriptwriter rather than, as at present, the producer and broadcasting company. Mr Mike Chattin, industrial relations adviser of the ITV Association, said yesterday: 'This reduces the status of producers and broadcasters and profoundly changes how copyright is exercised. 'It will discourage investment in programmes and co-productions and lead to more programmes being acquired from outside the European Community.' The BBC and Channel 4 as well as ITV are concerned. ITV believes that the amendment would change the UK concept of broadcasting copyright - under which producers and broadcasters are deemed to be the authors and to have first copyright - to the French definition of authorship. This definition includes people such as directors, scriptwriters, adaptors and music composers involved in the creation of the programme. The amendment to the draft directive on harmonising the term of protection of copyright was proposed by Mr Leon Schwartzenberg, a French Socialist MEP, who suggested that the 'Anglo-Saxon' law which identified the producer as author was 'unjust'.</p>

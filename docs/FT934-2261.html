			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Deal seen as triumph for multilateral rules The deal finally struck yesterday by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade negotiator, was greeted as, above all, a triumph for the multilateral trading system. There was disappointment that in the three key services areas - audio-visual, financial services and maritime transport - the degree of trade liberalisation was minimal. But the fact that all three sectors were squarely within the services agreement of the Uruguay Round was met with relief. This means all three areas fall under multilateral rules and disputes settlement procedures and will be subject to future negotiations to bargain away present restrictions. The US and EU have also agreed to continue talks on a revised Gatt code governing subsidies to civil aircraft in hope of concluding a deal by the end of next year, before the round comes into effect. Moreover, the US has finally agreed to support the creation of a Multilateral Trade Organisation with strengthened powers to settle disputes. Under the MTO accord, governments must use multilateral procedures wherever they apply, which will include, for the first time, disputes over services and intellectual property. This implies tight constraints on the future use of unilateral action by the US, a primary goal of the European Union and other trading partners from the beginning of the Uruguay Round in 1986. 'Use of Section 301 won't be possible where there are multilateral rules,' Mr Hugo Paemen, chief EU negotiator, said yesterday, referring to the US law authorising unilateral reprisals. On financial services, the US has staged a tactical retreat on its controversial two-tier plan for access to its banking, securities and insurance market. The solution reached between the US and EU, brokered by Gatt mediators, preserves the overriding Gatt principle of non-discrimination between trading partners through most-favoured-nation treatment. The US will offer a basic level of access to its domestic financial services market to all Gatt members, irrespective of what they have agreed to do in return. Access beyond the basic level will be subject to an MFN exemption and so will depend on whether countries offer reciprocity. However, when the Uruguay Round package comes into force, in January or July 1995, the US will suspend this MFN exemption for six months. If, at the end of that time, it is satisfied with the offers other nations have made to open their financial services markets, the suspension will be made permanent. This gives negotiators a breathing space of 18 months to two years to conclude better market-opening deals on financial services which would enable the US to extend MFN treatment to the whole of its domestic financial market. The US has Japan most closely in its sights, along with some East Asian and Latin American nations. On maritime services, the EU has withdrawn its liberalisation offer in response to Washington's refusal to put more than 3 per cent of its deep-sea shipping business on the table. Thus, there will be no liberalisation of maritime transport by the US and EU, and other nations such as Japan are likely to follow suit. Though US objections finally scuppered an attempt to 'multilateralise' the bilateral US/EU pact limiting state supports for Airbus, the two sides have agreed to try to reach accord on a revised Gatt civil aircraft code within the next 12 months. Meanwhile, the bilateral pact remains in place and, after securing certain detailed changes, the EU has accepted that civil aircraft should be covered by the new Gatt subsidies agreement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 3 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Nicaraguan Foreign  Minister Ernesto Leal today ruled out the possibility that the  visit by two U.S. legislators is aimed at pressuring the  Nicaraguan Government into returning the properties confiscated  from U.S. citizens during the last decade. "We do not regard  this visit as a form of pressure. We like people to come and see  what happens in Nicaragua," Leal said in reference to the  five-day visit of U.S. Representatives Robert Torricelli and  Cass Ballenger.    According to a Foreign Ministry note, Torricelli and  Ballenger arrived in Nicaragua "to learn about progress on  property ownership, human rights, security of the people, and  the economic and political situation in general."    Torricelli, the Democratic representative for New Jersey,  said upon arriving in Managua the return to U.S. citizens of  properties confiscated in the last decade "is a necessary factor  for the continuance of aid for Nicaragua."    The U.S. Congress approved an amendment on 29 April imposing  restrictions on U.S. financial aid for countries where  properties of U.S. citizens have been confiscated, if the  necessary steps for the resolution of this situation are not  taken within a 90-day deadline.    Leal said these restrictions do not apply to Nicaragua,  because, he said, the amendment applies only to countries that  lack mechanisms to settle the claims of U.S. citizens.  According to Leal, Nicaragua has started to return or make  compensation for the real estate confiscated from both  Nicaraguans and foreigners since 1991.    According to the U.S. Embassy in Managua, 600 U.S. citizens  demand the return of more than 1,000 properties. The government  of President Violeta Chamorro argues, however, that most of  these individuals had adopted Nicaraguan citizenship prior to  the time their properties were seized.    The Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry has reported that 125 U.S.  citizens are demanding the return of 412 properties and that the  difference between these figures and those provided by the U.S.  Embassy consists of Nicaraguans who had assumed U.S. citizenship.</p>

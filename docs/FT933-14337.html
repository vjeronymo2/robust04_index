			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Clinton to seek Dollars 2.5bn aid for flooded states PRESIDENT Bill Clinton will propose Dollars 2.48bn (Pounds 1.7bn) of aid for the six states in the Mississippi and Missouri basins devastated by record floods, White House officials said yesterday. The money is expected to be included in an emergency bill to go to Congress shortly. Mr Clinton cut short his holiday in Hawaii to fly back for his second visit to the flooded area yesterday, inspecting relief efforts in Des Moines, Iowa, where the swollen Raccoon River has knocked out the city's water purification plant and cut off clean water supplies to 250,000 people. The tide of grandees visiting the region - Vice-President Al Gore visited on Monday and Mr Clinton may return this weekend to St Louis - places its own logistical burden on emergency workers already stretched thin. However, the White House appears desperately keen to signal its close involvement with the disaster. Some political commentators have gone as far as to suggest that Mr Clinton, by attending the Group of Seven industrial nation's summit in Tokyo last week, was allowing himself to be turned into a foreign policy president no different from his predecessor, Mr George Bush. Others had noted the contrast between pictures of Mr Clinton frolicking in the surf during his holiday and the Iowans and Missourians up to their necks in floodwater. However, there is little evidence that the US public at large begrudges Mr Clinton his few days of holiday, but political pundits recall the difficulties that Mr Bush's holiday habits brought on him. Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House press secretary, said the relief aid request would cover the rest of fiscal 1993, to September 30, and would be part of an emergency supplemental spending request. Democratic congressional leaders have said they would try to speed action on any proposed flood relief. Mr Clinton was expected to discuss the matter with bipartisan members of Congress during a visit to Capitol Hill today. Damage estimates from Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin put the flood's cost so far at around Dollars 3bn - Dollars 2bn for destruction of crops and Dollars 1bn in other property damage. Even before Mr Clinton arrived, Iowa Governor Terry Branstad said he doubted that the federal aid would be enough. The US budget director, Mr Leon Panetta said yesterday he would not be surprised if aid eventually reached Dollars 5bn.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Eleco warns on full year Eleco Holdings, the building products and construction group which returned to the black at its December interim after restructuring, has announced further disposals and warned that its full year results will be adversely affected by a poor performance at Davis Group, its cable management subsidiary. Davis' second half results were hit by difficult market conditions in Germany and the UK, and are expected to have a significant impact on group results as a whole for the year ended June 30. The company is now up for sale and preliminary negotiations are in progress. Eleco's subsidiary Webster Homes has completed the sale of parts of its Orsett site, valued at Pounds 2.35m in the group accounts at June 30 1993, for Pounds 772,500 and Pounds 1.67m respectively, both for cash.</p>

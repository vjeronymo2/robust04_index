			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 04, BNS -- The Latvian Saeima  (parliament) Presidium decided Monday [4 April] to convene an  extraordinary session on April 15 to discuss security policy and  the initialed Latvian-Russian agreements on troop withdrawal.    The initiative came from President Guntis Ulmanis and Prime  Minister Valdis Birkavs in compliance with the 20th article of  the Latvian Constitution.    Under the agreement, Russia operates its radar facility at  Skrunda in Latvia for four years and has 18 months to dismantle  it. Latvia also guarantees the social protection of retired and  serving military personnel on its soil. In return, Russia  pledges to get all its troops out of the Baltic country by  September.    So far, the deal has met with fierce protest by Latvia's  opposition parties and political organizations claiming that the  signature and ratification of the agreement would mean  legalization of Latvia's occupation by the Soviet Union in 1940.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: France The sharp fall in European bonds and equities will have left the French monetary authorities shifting particularly uneasily in their seats. Not only will the government have to pay more for the money it raises at today's FFr18bn-20bn bond auction to finance its budget deficit, it must also be growing anxious about its privatisation programme, given the 9 per cent fall in the CAC 40 from last month's peak. The shares of recently-privatised stocks, such as Rhone-Poulenc and Elf Aquitaine, are hovering close to their offer prices. That suggests future issues may have to be priced much more cheaply. The bigger fear, though, is that France's precarious economy may be tipped back into recession if the trend in long bond yields persists. The Bank of France attaches great importance to long-term interest rates as a determinant of economic activity. It must be disconcerted that benchmark bond yields have risen almost 1 point to 6.4 per cent this year - especially given that the burden has been magnified by a corresponding fall in inflation. Such worries must reinforce the impulse to cut short-term interest rates further. Yet given how deeply the franc fort policy is ingrained in French thinking, the monetary authorities' hands will continue to be tied by the Bundesbank's actions. Mr Edouard Balladur's latest stimulus package may buy the French economy time before the monetary constraints can be eased. But the risks appear to be escalating just when the French government could have expected them to fall.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Viag sees increase in profits and acquisitions VIAG, the acquisitive German conglomerate, yesterday forecast a further rise in profits this year and its ninth consecutive dividend increase. The company will continue its vigorous expansion, with plans to spend about DM2bn a year on investment in growth, according to an interim report published yesterday. Viag's latest acquisitions in packaging and motor components contributed to a 26 per cent rise in group sales to DM6.15bn (Dollars 3.8bn) in the first quarter and a 'modest' but unspecified rise in operating profits. Confirming net earnings for 1991 of DM405m, the company proposed a DM9 dividend, compared with the previous year's DM336m profits and pay-out of DM8.50. Improved results this year would allow this dividend policy to continue, it added. Viag, which draws about 50 per cent of its earnings from stakes in German electricity and gas companies, and 40 per cent from aluminium and packaging, said it was negotiating to buy a majority stake in Debrunner-Koenig, Switzerland's biggest steel trader. Last month it concluded a deal to take a majority in another steel concern, Metalpo of Italy. Mr Alfred Pfeiffer, chairman, told shareholders yesterday that the group's expansion strategy, based on taking 51 per cent holdings in compatible groups, had so far proved very successful. It spent DM115m on such moves in the first quarter of this year, compared with DM3m in the first quarter of 1991. Acquisitions last year accounted for about half the investment budget of DM4bn. Future core business areas highlighted yesterday include packaging, chemicals, motor components and health foods. Last year's acquisition of Continental Can Europe has made Viag, which already owned Gerresheimer Glas, one of Germany's leading packaging groups.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / People: Neil Richardson joins Ian Martin's Glenisla Neil Richardson, 37, (right) has been appointed as the first investment director of Glenisla Group, the privately held London-based investment firm set up last month by Ian Martin with financial backing from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street leveraged buy-out specialist. His appointment marks the first step by Martin, chairman and joint founder of Glenisla and formerly deputy chairman of Grand Metropolitan, towards putting together his team of financial experts. Glenisla has been set up to seek out undervalued investment opportunities in the UK and western Europe in a wide range of consumer and non-consumer industries. According to Martin, Richardson will be responsible for 'identifying and developing acquisition opportunities, assessing potential targets and overseeing transactions through to completion'. Richardson moves from CS First Boston where he has been director of UK mergers and acquisitions and instrumental in building up CS First Boston's European merger and acquisition business which now employs 45 professionals in London. At CS First Boston Richardson was responsible for creating and overseeing transactions such as STC's sale of an 80 per cent stake in ICL to Fujitsu, Burton Group's sale of its financial services operations to GE Capital and House of Fraser's sale of its credit operations and recent overall restructuring. Over the past decade, Richardson has been involved in transactions with an aggregate value of over Dollars 10bn. Before joining CS First Boston in New York in 1986, he spent six years with Bain &amp; Company, the strategy consultants. Richardson was educated at Ashington Grammar School in Northumberland where he was one of the first pupils to gain admission to Oxbridge. He read chemistry at New College, Oxford, and spent his final year researching the photochemistry of the ozone layer.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another reason not to adopt the NWI proposal is that it is a product formula price based on cheese, yet the principal use of surplus milk in the Pacific Northwest order is nonfat dry milk. The record simply contains no explanation as to why a proposal for multiple component pricing in this market situation should have the component values based on a price derived from the cheese market only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, on the basis of the record in this proceeding there should be no adjustments to prices under Order 135 based on the level of somatic cells present in the market's raw milk supply. While the record evidence indicates that somatic cell levels are important, the record lacks sufficient evidence to develop appropriate provisions to implement a price adjustment based on somatic cell levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In should also be noted that the brief filed on behalf of Darigold, NWI, and Farmers Cooperative Creamery also concluded that ``there is insufficient evidence to warrant adopting an `SCC Adjuster' in either Order 124 or Order 135.'' Finally, we would point out that some proponents expressed a desire to keep the MCP provisions in Order 135 compatible with those in the Great Basin order. Since the Great Basin MCP provisions do not include a somatic cell adjustor, it would be contrary to compatibility to include such an adjustor in Order 135.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Incorporation of component pricing in Orders 124 and 135 will necessitate amending provisions of the orders dealing with handler reports, class (and component) prices, the computation of handler's obligations and payments to the producer-settlement fund, and the determination of payments to producers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of allocating nonfat milk solids and protein, it is assumed that both components remain evenly distributed within the skim milk portion of milk receipts. This assumption will allow the proration of nonfat solids and protein to skim milk for purposes of determining shrinkage and allocating receipts to utilization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the information that is already reported each month to the Market Administrator, each handler under Order 124 will be required to report the average nonfat solids content of milk received from each producer during the month, the amount of nonfat solids in the handler's other receipts, except receipts of other source milk, and the nonfat solids contained in bulk transfers of milk and cream to other handlers. Partially regulated distributing plant operators will not be required to report information regarding the nonfat solids of their milk receipts unless they elect to have their obligations calculated under the provision that would determine obligations on the same basis as those of fully regulated handlers. Handlers under Order 135 will have to report the protein content of their milk receipts in a similar fashion as that described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The two countries have decided to set  up a joint committee early next month to examine the possibility  and feasibility of importing gas from Egypt.    Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that  following  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' and Energy Minister Moshe  Shahal's meetings with Qatari representatives in London, it has  transpired that Qatar is interested in implementing the deal  with Israel, but its economic viability is still being examined.</p>

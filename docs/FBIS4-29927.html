			<p>BFN     [Text] The two biggest opposition parties, Chat Thai and  Chat Phatthana, have expressed guarded interest in joining a new  Democrat-led coalition government in the event the current  crisis facing the Chuan administration leads to a Cabinet  shake-up.    Chat Thai Secretary-General Sano Thianthong said yesterday  the Chat Thai Party and its opposition allies are "ready to  serve" and prepared to discuss the possibility of joining the  government.    Chat Phatthana Deputy Leader Kon Thappharangsi insisted  yesterday that Chat Phatthana would not "go it alone" in joining  the Democrat-led coalition but said his party would consider  becoming part of a future government only if Prime Minister  Chuan Likhpai resigned as prime minister to pave the way for the  formation of a new government.    Sano said although opposition parties had not anticipated  becoming part of a coalition government led by Chuan, "anything  is possible" under present circumstances.    "We are prepared to serve the country. Politicians,  regardless of their political affiliation, have the  responsibility to serve," Sano said.    However, he said Chat Thai and other opposition parties had  not been approached by the core of the present coalition  government regarding a possible Cabinet shake-up to replace any  existing coalition parties with opposition parties.    "Anything is possible. We only need to talk," Sano said.    It was still not clear whether Sano was speaking on behalf  of  the Chat Thai Party alone or was voicing a common stance of the  opposition bloc which includes other major parties like Chat  Phatthana and Social Action.    Chat Thai, which controls 77 seats in the House of  Representatives, is the biggest party in the opposition bloc and  is second only to the Democrat Party.    Senior members of Chat Phatthana which commands 60 seats in  the House, have in recent weeks also expressed interest in  joining the Democrat-led coalition government.    Asked about the possibility of the Democrat Party replacing  its foul current coalition partners with members of the  opposition bloc, Sano said the opposition parties had not been  waiting to join the Chuan government.    "In fact, opposition parties have agreed not to join the  coalition government under any circumstance," he said.    But asked whether the opposition parties would insist on a  total Cabinet shake-up as precondition for joining the  coalition, Sano said they would not make known their position  until they were approached by the coalition government.    "The opposition is prepared for discussions with the  coalition government. We are politicians and we don't  discriminate against our colleagues because of their political  affiliation," Sano said.    Asked to comment on the likelihood of a new alliance of  Democrat, Chat Thai and New Aspiration in a coalition  government, Sano said: "Whether such an arrangement would work  out depends very much on whether the (future) coalition  government could forge unity among its partners."    "I am in no position to boast about our (Chat Thai's)  capability in administering the country. We have been in the  government several times before. The public is the judge," Sano  said.</p>

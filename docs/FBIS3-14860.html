On </F> the Arrest of Russian Agents in the United States"]    [Text] The incident over the arrest in the United States  of two Russian foreign intelligence agents, Aldrich Ames and his  wife Maria Casas, has alarmed the public in that country. No  wonder. The 52-year old Ames worked in the most sensitive posts  in the CIA for over 30 years and has vast experience of overseas  work. In 1983-1985 he was head of the CIA's Soviet  Counterintelligence Section and was one of the most trusted men  in the state. His attractive 40-year-old wife, who was born in  Colombia, had the most brilliant career prospects at Georgetown  University.    They could be called a model family unit of a healthy U.S.  society but suddenly, overnight, they have become Russian spies.  Yet they had good incomes. Ames was paid around $100,000 a year  (around $9,000 a month). This is enough to make the ordinary  patriotic American's head spin. And when it became known that  Russian intelligence had paid this married couple around $1.5  million since 1985, the sense of outrage became universal: What  kind of Russian treachery is this? We give them aid and they  spend millions on espionage activity in our country!    It seems that the U.S. President was also in some confusion:  Ames was placed under surveillance [blokirovan] last October but  it was not until Monday, 21 February 1994, that Bill Clinton  allowed the case to be made public.    There is no limit to the U.S. press' indignation these days.  However, let us leave emotions aside and try to delve a little  deeper.    The Ames case has been given the kind of political overtones  which automatically bring to mind a story dating back almost 33  years.    In 1960 the United States and the USSR took the first real  steps toward ending the cold war, thanks to the efforts of  President Dwight Eisenhower and Prime Minister Nikita  Khrushchev, general secretary of the CPSU Central Committee.  Agreement was reached to hold a summit meeting of the four  great powers in Paris after which Eisenhower was to pay a visit  to Moscow. However, the hawks in the military-industrial  complexes and the CIA and the KGB put the most powerful pressure  on their top leaders and wrecked what could have been an  historic agreement.    On 1 May 1960 the CIA sent a U-2 spy plane into Soviet air  space, it was shot down near Sverdlovsk, and its pilot, Frances  Garry Powers, was taken prisoner. Khrushchev kept the fact of  this arrest secret and, according to the classical laws of  political intrigue, lured Eisenhower into a trap by forcing him  to deny that this flight had taken place. At the Paris summit  he demanded public apologies from the U.S. President and this,  of course, was a humiliation for Eisenhower. And without even  waiting for a reply from his colleague he exclaimed in great  emotion: "Eisenhower is no longer a welcome guest in the Soviet  Union!" The U.S. President was about to explain that he had  come to Paris for serious talks and wanted the conference to  move on to the discussion of relevant questions but the summit  was already wrecked by then. Khrushchev ostentatiously walked  out of the hall.    That was, of course, a political mistake. The Soviet premier  had given way to the hawks in his own country, people who in  general were more interested in their own position in the  hierarchy of power, a position falsely concealed by a concern  for the country's security and well being, rather than in  peaceful living conditions for the USSR.    Relations between the United States and the USSR  deteriorated sharply. Soon after that there was the Caribbean  crisis, which almost plunged us all into World War III.    It seems to me that something similar is going on right now.  Except that this time certain forces in the United States would  like to give Khrushchev's role to Bill Clinton. And Powers'  role to Aldrich Ames.    The U.S. mass media have been trying to meticulously  calculate what damage the Russian spy's activity has caused the  States. What can you say here? Probably the damage is  considerable. But intelligence is a two-day business. In  recent years the world press and the Russian press have written  quite a lot about the fact that U.S. intelligence agents are  virtually wandering freely around Russia's vast open spaces.  And what escape is there these days from the reports in the  Moscow press that the exposure of Ames was not a consequence of  the couple's extravagant spending, as the ordinary American is  persistently reminded by his press, but resulted from a leak of  information from the highest levels of the Russian Foreign  Intelligence Service (in normal parlance that means that a U.S.  intelligence operative of Ames' stature is operating in Moscow,  too).    But what about the damage that has been done to our  country's  economy by our native traitors, as it were? For example, the  activity of Oleg Penkovskiy, who was recruited by the Western  special services, really rocked the USSR's defense system in the  past. And how can you assess the damage inflicted on our  country by Oleg Gordiyevskiy and Arkadiy Shevchenko, who were  recruited by those same special services and who held very high  posts in the Soviet hierarchy? And what about Vladimir Rezun  (Viktor Suvorov) or General Lyalin? The list could go on.    No, the matter is of course not one of economic damage and  Russia's treachery.    In the U.S. media, clearly, there are circles which could  theoretically be categorized as hawks (we have them in our  country, too) and which were merely seeking an appropriate  pretext to exaggerate this affair. But the real reasons are  clear to see. Not everyone liked Viktor Chernomyrdin's new  government. The question was: To support him or not?    The second reason was clearly Moscow's position on the  Sarajevo crisis. Essentially the Russian president's initiative  in this conflict thwarted the hawks' attempt to resolve the  "Serbian question" with the help of air strikes. Russia's  political weight in the international arena rose suddenly and  very sharply. It proved very difficult to endure this and  assess it not as one would like but as it really is. So they  decided to use the Ames' affair to try to stop this process of  Moscow's return to the great powers' club if it seemed likely  that the process would succeed.    I think, however, that no good will come of these attempts.  The U.S. President, like his Russian counterpart, is showing  quite a well balanced approach here.    There is a striking difference between how the Ames affair  is  being covered in the U.S. press and in official statements.    For example, it is reported that the note handed to Russian  Charge d'Affaires V. Chkhikvishvili in Washington contains  nothing which would indicate the likelihood of a complication of  relations between the United States and Russia and there are no  calls for any specific actions. Furthermore, it has emerged  that yesterday President Clinton turned down the calls by some  U.S. legislators for an immediate reduction of U.S. aid to  Russia in connection with the Ames affair. Pointing to the  gravity of "the espionage affair," he stressed that cooperation  with Russia in restricting the proliferation of nuclear weapons  and support for democracy and reforms in Russia are important  U.S. strategic interests.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev yesterday urged that  the "Ames problem" should not be politicized.    All this inspires the hope that political relations between  Russia and the United States will not be aggravated this time  and that a new Caribbean crisis will not loom on the horizon.</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: WEEKEND TREKS UP DISNEYLAND'S MATTERHORN KEEP HIS  LIFE IN BALANCE  </P> <P> Frank Nosalek needs a break from his two jobs, from the freeway traffic crush  and from the pace of his everyday life. So every weekend, he climbs a mountain.  </P> <P> In fact, he has climbed the 147-foot Matterhorn at Disneyland every weekend for  the last 3 1/2 years. The climb takes just 30 minutes, so he does it four times  each day.  </P> <P> "Technically, the Matterhorn at Disneyland is similar to other mountains and in  some cases can be more slippery and more difficult than real mountains," he  said. "There are some areas of the Matterhorn I haven't climbed yet."  </P> <P> Before he began his weekend job at Disneyland, Nosalek had scaled the  14,512-foot backside of Mount Whitney and once climbed part of the real  14,690-foot Matterhorn when he lived in Europe.  </P> <P> Nosalek was born and raised in West Germany, and his mother was a guide in the  Austrian Alps.  </P> <P> "You go through different feelings when you climb real mountains and the one at  Disneyland," said Nosalek, 27, of Huntington Beach. "The scenery is  breathtaking, and you can't help but realize how small your are.  </P> <P> "It's an unbelieveable feeling when you reach the top of the peak of a real  mountain. It's hard work, but it's well worth it and it's plain fun."  </P> <P> But Nosalek said the Disneyland Matterhorn continues to thrill him and the  other seven climbers who regularly scale the man-made peak on weekends to  entertain the crowds below.  </P> <P> "On the clearest day you can see Catalina, the Hollywood sign and the  skyscrapers in Los Angeles," he said. "And we can hear all the sounds from the  crowd below."  </P> <P> Nosalek said climbing real mountains "taught me how to push myself, and I found  I have a lot more energy and perseverance than I thought I had. It's like an  avalanche. You have strength inside that you didn't know you had."  </P> <P> He also found "climbing relaxes my mind and allows for a lot of reflecting  during rest times."  </P> <P> During the week, Nosalek is an account executive for an advertising agency and  operates his own computer consulting service.  </P> <P> "It's hard work to juggle everything, and time management is important," he  said. "I have many goals and financial independence is one of them."  </P> <P> Another is a college education, which was put on hold. "Schooling was  interfering with my career," said Nosalek, who once attended Fullerton College.  "I was blessed with some incredible opportunities and couldn't pass them up."  </P> <P> Phil Miller, 58, believes in body language and said it helped when he joined  the Marine Corps 40 years ago as an enlisted man and realized he would be  better off as an officer.  </P> <P> "I went to the library and read a book on body language, and it said one way to  get a position was to act, look and use language of the position you wanted,"  recalled the Brea resident. He was later commissioned as an officer.  </P> <P> Now he's giving talks on body language to various Orange County groups. He  often throws in a little humor during his talks such as the one he gave  recently to the Brea Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> For instance, he said there's a good chance people are lying if they touch  their face below the bridge of their nose and above the lip. But he points out,  "Of course they could just have a cold."  </P> <P> Along with his human interaction talks, as he calls them, Miller sometimes  works as a stand-up comedian in area comedy clubs.  </P> <P> "It's a real challenge to get up in front of people and make them laugh,  especially when you're double and triple the age of most of the audience," he  said. "But it does sharpen me up for my other talks."  </P> <P> Acknowledgments -- Cathy Lee, 33, of Huntington Beach, who was born deaf, later  this month will have a new companion in Rosie, a certified hearing ear dog. The  $3,500 to train and place the 18-month-old German shorthair pointer was donated  by the White Rose Rebekah Lodge in Solvang. The dog was given to Dogs for the  Deaf in Central Point, Ore., by an anonymous donor.  </P></p>

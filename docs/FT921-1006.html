			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Portuguese insurer sale expected to raise Es33bn THE subscription for shares in Mundial Confianca, one of Portugal's leading insurance companies which is being privatised, will start on Monday. The government expects to raise around Es33bn (Dollars 230m) from the sale, which will last until the end of next week. The results will be made public on April 14 during a special session of the Lisbon Stock Exchange. Shares are being sold in four tranches, including a single indivisible bloc of 4m shares representing 40 per cent of the company's share capital. Bidding for this bloc will be in two rounds. The starting price for shares in this tranche is Es3,500. Another tranche of 3.5m shares will be sold to general investors at a starting price of Es3,250. Employees are reserved up to 2.5m shares at the fixed price of Es2,925, and small investors and emigrants up to 2.5m shares at a fixed price of Es3,100. Unsold shares will be offered to general investors. Foreign investors can only buy up to 25 per cent of the shares with voting rights, but they can bid in alliance with Portuguese groups for the single bloc as well as for shares offered to general investors. Mundial has grown rapidly in recent years, almost doubling its assets from Es46.9bn in 1988 to Es88.7bn in 1991.</p>

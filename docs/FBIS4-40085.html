			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Manki Ponomarev report: "NATO Council Session Ended"] </F>   [Text] The latest NATO Council session, held in Istanbul,  has concluded its work. The session participants -- foreign  ministers of the countries of the alliance -- focused attention  on relations with Russia.    The lively debate resulted in agreement that closer ties  must  be established with the Russian Federation. The session  participants confirmed the expediency of Moscow's joining the  partnership program. At the same time they acknowledged  readiness to hold special consultations with the Russian  leadership outside the framework of this program, if necessary,  on questions such as the Bosnian crisis, the actions of  peacemaking forces in Europe, and nuclear arms control.    The NATO countries' ministers unanimously rejected the  possibility of granting Russia the right to veto decisions of  the North Atlantic Alliance. As is known, however, Russia does  not aspire to such a right. But nor does it want to be  presented with "surprises" in the future, as was the case  recently with the Atlanticists' unilateral ultimatum in Bosnia.    Other questions were also discussed at the Istanbul session  in addition to the problems of relations with Russia. Its  participants reinforced with their authority the recent attempt  to impose a solution of the territorial problem on the opposing  sides in Bosnia and once again stated their readiness to send a  peacekeeping force to Bosnia as soon as the opposing sides sign  a final agreement.</p>

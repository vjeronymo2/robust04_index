			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: No opposition to French store's bid for competitor THE takeover bid by Galeries Lafayette, the French department store group, for its competitor, Nouvelles Galeries, will receive no opposition from Nouvelles Galeries' main shareholder. Devanlay, the family-controlled textiles group, which holds 47.5 per cent of Nouvelles Galeries' voting rights, announced it will not contest Galeries Lafayette's offer, valuing the group at FFr5.4bn (Dollars 9.15m). Ironically, Galeries Lafayette did not at first intend to make a bid for Nouvelles Galeries. But, it was forced to do so by the French stock exchange council after it bought a block of Nouvelles Galeries shares from another investor. This lifted Galeries Lafayette's stake to 39 per cent, well above the 33 per cent threshold at which French takeover law normally obliges a buyer to make an offer for two-thirds of the company.</p>

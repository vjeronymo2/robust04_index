			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Foreign Affairs: The real face of Sudan - Hassan Turabi, the Islamic leader, presents a picture of his country unfamiliar to the west 'That one may smile and smile, and be a villain . . .' The line from Hamlet came into my head on Monday after an hour and a half's conversation with Mr Hassan Turabi, the Sudanese Islamic leader. Mr Turabi certainly has a villainous reputation. He is generally seen as the brains behind the military regime in Sudan, which gets about as bad a press as any except that of President Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Since seizing power in 1989, General Omar Hassan Bashir has vigorously pursued the civil war against mainly Christian rebels in the south of the country. He has quarrelled with the international aid agencies, both official and unofficial, which are trying to bring relief to millions of starving Sudanese. He has been accused by human rights organisations of systematically detaining and torturing his opponents, and by the US and Egyptian governments of harbouring international terrorists. And he has cultivated close relations with Iran and Libya, allegedly accepting Iranian military advisers, while backing Iraq in the Gulf war. Mr Turabi's Islamic Front (NIF) has been named in the Egyptian press as training and financing 'terrorist elements' which allegedly planned to assassinate Egyptian officials. President Hosni Mubarak himself has publicly blamed Mr Turabi for the problems in Egyptian-Sudanese relations, saying that 'Turabi believes he can spread his destructive principles to every part of the world'. Sudanese opposition parties blame 'the government of Bashir and Turabi' for sabotaging efforts to end the civil war. It is, according to the Sudan People's Liberation Movement - the political wing of the rebellion in the south - 'well known in the Sudan and elsewhere that Dr Turabi is the man behind the current problems of forceful Islamisation, amputation of limbs for petty theft, flogging for drinks and decapitation for adultery'. Western experts and diplomats agree that Mr Turabi is a significant power in the country. 'The real power lies with the NIF,' wrote the magazine Africa Confidential last year, describing Gen Bashir as only 'a convenient figurehead with a nationalist image'. It therefore comes as a slight surprise that Mr Turabi is spending a week in London, where he lectured on Monday night at the Royal Society of Arts, and yesterday at the Royal Institute of International Affairs. According to the Democratic Unionist Party (the main left-wing opposition in northern Sudan), Sudanese exiles 'are bewildered to note country where many of the victims of Turabi's regime are seeking asylum'. In fact the two institutions were doing their job in enabling Mr Turabi to present his ideas, and the exiles to challenge him. The exiles were outside the RSA on Monday with slogans such as 'stop the use of food as a weapon of genocide', 'foreign troops out of Sudan' and 'Turabi, the butcher of Khartoum'. Mr Turabi took all this with remarkable equanimity. He presents himself as a modern and enlightened Islamic 'scholar', with no official position - although his programme in London was arranged by the information counsellor of the Sudanese embassy, who sat in on our conversation. Mr Turabi, who studied law in London and went on to obtain a doctorate at the Sorbonne, speaks excellent English and gives no hint of feeling rattled by western criticism - unless it be a tendency to interrupt his own discourse with a nervous giggle. He also resists any temptation to respond in kind by demonising the west. Asked by an obviously friendly questioner at the RSA to comment on the west's sincerity in urging democracy on the Third World, he said it was 'very difficult to lump the whole west together', and that there were many people in the west who would be willing to see Islamic parties come to power by democratic means. 'Anyway, the west will evolve.' Mr Turabi points out that he himself was 'detained for a short while' at the time of Gen Bashir's coup, along with other political leaders, and that the NIF, like other political parties, remains officially banned. He admits, though, that 'most party members supported the new regime', partly because 'we were the only party in opposition when it took over' but mainly because it soon showed 'pro-Islamic tendencies'. Certainly he is ready enough to defend the regime against its critics, going so far as to assert that people in Sudan 'have never had it so good'. Prices of agricultural products have quadrupled, he told me, and as a result 'a farmer now earns more than a civil servant'. It was, he claimed, 'mainly the elites' who were suffering because 'government service is not paying so well', whereas 'farmers and herdsmen, who make up 80 per cent of the population' were benefiting from the government's focus on agriculture. The government, Mr Turabi explained, 'didn't so much interfere' with relief work as seek to replace it with development aid, so as to make the people more independent. Sudan, he added, was now an exporter of food. 'It is absolutely not true that people are dying of hunger.' There were, he admitted, problems of access and distribution in some parts of the country, but reports of famine had been exaggerated by the aid agencies to justify their own activities and help them raise more money. Thus he brushed aside, for instance, a UN report according to which 7.6m people in Sudan are victims of drought and war, and 7.2m will need emergency food aid this year at a cost of Dollars 471m. Mr Turabi was equally dismissive of criticism of the regime's human rights record - 'most of it misinformation' - pointing out that other countries such as Britain and the US had resorted to administrative detention in wartime. Sudan's record compared favourably, he said, with that of neighbouring pro-western countries such as Egypt. It might be true that the police 'mishandle' people at the time of their arrest, but the conditions of detention were exemplary, as he could testify from his own experience: 'we had refrigerators, newspapers, visits'. He denied reports of 'ghost houses' and claimed there was no evidence of torture. 'Did anyone come with a broken limb?' he asked. As it happened, a member of the audience at his RSA lecture removed his artificial leg and brandished it, claiming that he had had to be amputated as a result of torture. He asked whether this accorded with the teachings of Islam. Two weeks ago Amnesty International reported that 'prisoners have been shackled and suspended from their cell walls, sometimes upside down, others have had their testicles crushed with pliers'. This week a new report from Africa Watch included a long first-person account of various tortures by a released victim, and concluded that 'torture by members of the Sudanese security forces appears to be becoming more sophisticated'. The country described in such reports hardly sounds like the one Mr Turabi talks about - maligned, according to him, because of western prejudice against Islam. One would like to go see for oneself which version is right. But the last time an FT correspondent did so, in February 1990, his attempts to investigate human rights violations led to his being detained for nine days, and then released on condition he left the country within 24 hours. It is not very encouraging.</p>

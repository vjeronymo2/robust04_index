			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Observer: Sour grapes Mogens Lykketoft, Denmark's Social Democratic finance minister, is proving a dab hand at creative accounting. At the stroke of a pen, he has just wiped about DKr200bn off his country's national debt. At nearly DKr553bn, or 60 per cent of GDP in 1994, according to the draft 1994 budget, the overall figure was edging dangerously close to the maximum debt-to-GDP ratio permitted for countries aiming to sign up for monetary union. Lykketoft had a brain wave. Why not treat as assets the tax revenue which will be collected when savers retire and start tapping their private pension schemes? Precisely why the finance minister should be so worried is a bit of a puzzle, given that under the special terms on which Denmark ratified the Maastricht treaty, in the May referendum, the country won an exemption from Emu. Certainly the opposition's economics spokesman, Anders Fogh-Rasmussen, a former minister of taxation, was unimpressed. 'Hokus pokus' was his verdict on the wheeze he no doubt wished he had thought up himself before he lost his job last year.</p>

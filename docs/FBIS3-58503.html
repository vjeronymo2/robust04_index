			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, Jan 14 (AFP) -- The UN High Commissioner  for Refugees has called on European governments to accept  asylum-seekers from Kosovo because of harsh winter conditions in  the majority-Albanian Serbian province.    UNHCR spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume said Thursday [13  January] that some areas in Kosovo were without heat or  electricity and that the human rights situation was also causing  concern.    The organisation has asked governments not to send  ayslum-seekers back at least until spring -- even if they do not  fulfil the conditions for refugee status.    Switzerland gave temporary shelter to about 1,800 Albanians  from Kosovo in 1993, but only accorded 100 of them refugee  status.    Several political and religious groups recently tried to  intervene with Bern authorities in a bid to prevent the  expulsion of Kosovo Albanians.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Fletcher Challenge beats expectations at NZDollars 381m FLETCHER Challenge, the New Zealand forestry and energy group, said a significant boost in log prices helped it post an annual result ahead of expectations and the group is well-positioned for the future, Reuter reports from Wellington. FCL reported a bottom line profit of NZDollars 381.8m (USDollars 210.88m) in the year to June 30, against a loss of NZDollars 157.5m a year ago. The result included a pre-tax abnormal gain of NZDollars 15.5m from a loss of NZDollars 472.8m a year ago. Mr Ron Trotter, chairman, said the result was significantly ahead of expectations. 'We received a significant boost from the sharp rise in international log and lumber prices during the second half of the year,' he said. The result was also boosted by a NZDollars 178.69m tax credit compared with a NZDollars 141.72m credit a year ago. Net earnings excluding abnormals were steady at NZDollars 302.8m, compared with NZDollars 305.1m last year. Abnormal items gave a net after-tax gain of NZDollars 79m in the period. Gains included NZDollars 234m on the sale of Fletcher Challenge Methanol, NZDollars 85m on the sale of 49 per cent in newsprint and forestry operations in Chile, NZDollars 74m from transactions with the Natural Gas Corporation Ltd and NZDollars 24m from the sale of Rural Bank. Losses included NZDollars 227m on the write-down of the carrying values of UK Paper and NZDollars 80m of restructuring costs.</p>

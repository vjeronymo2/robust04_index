			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Break-up signals overhaul of corporate South Africa GENCOR's announcement that it plans to unbundle came as no surprise, but this does not diminish the significance of an event whose political and business ramifications are likely to be widespread. It almost certainly heralds the beginning of a gradual, but far-reaching, overhaul of corporate South Africa. Over the next 10 years and beyond, groups such as Anglo American-De Beers, South African Breweries, Rembrandt, Anglovaal, Old Mutual and Sanlam, which dominate South African corporate life, are likely to be significantly restructured. Two factors will determine the pace and extent of this restructuring: the vigour with which a future government might pursue anti-trust policies, and the extent to which corporate South Africa voluntarily restructures, for reasons either of self-preservation or economic self-interest. The African National Congress, likely to be the largest partner in any future government, is committed to introduce anti-monopoly, anti-trust and mergers policies weaken the influence of the country's largest groups, and promote private sector efficiency. There is also considerable support for unbundling in the investment community where many hold the view that the economy has become too concentrated, stifling initiative in the process. With the exception of Gencor, however, corporate South Africa has shown little enthusiasm for unbundling. Most captains of industry are not convinced unbundling has economic merit. Anglo American, in particular, has defended its size with vigour, sophistication and some success. Ultimately, however, these arguments, couched mostly in economic terms, are unlikely to sway the ANC, which objects to the degree of corporate influence exercised by a few whites. Yesterday's announcement is only the first salvo in a long debate. And practical barriers to unbundling have to be addressed - most obviously, who, other than the existing large groups, will buy the assets of companies that unbundle. Gencor's announcement will certainly force some of the other large groups to take a harder look at unbundling, if only because the onus of proof has shifted towards those favouring the status quo.</p>

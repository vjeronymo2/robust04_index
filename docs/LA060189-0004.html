			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EXTRA $2 MILLION OKD FOR COURTS COMPUTER  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has approved a $2.1-million  contract for additional design work on a computer system being developed for  use in the county courts.  </P> <P> The contract with Systemhouse Inc. was approved on a 3-1 vote, with Pete  Schabarum dissenting.  </P> <P> Schabarum expressed concern with the escalating cost of the contract for the  County Justice Information System, which was budgeted for $12 million in 1986  and has since received a $864,000 "design enhancement" allocation.  </P> <P> Frank Zolin, county clerk and executive officer for the Superior Court, said he  could not estimate how much the system will cost, but he told Schabarum that it  will pay for itself in "five to six years" by eliminating court personnel.  </P> <P> Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who strongly supported the additional funds for the  system, told Schabarum the extra costs were a result of new specifications  requested by court officials.  </P> <P> The new money will give the courts automated investigation statistics, pretrial  information and probation and mental health reports.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [By Chit Estella]    [Excerpts] Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon yesterday urged  the government to start considering the possibility of opening  talks with rebel groups opposed to Jose Ma. Sison.    Drilon made this suggestion amid the continued failure of  the  government and the National Democratic Front [NDF] panels to  make any headway in the peace efforts.    "The government has bent over backwards for too long," he  said. [passage omitted]    Drilon said the NDF, or the group identified with Sison, be  given until the end of January to conduct exploratory talks with  the government. After that, the government should start talking  with locally-based rebels opposed to Sison, he said.    Drilon said it does not matter if the anti-Sison faction  does  not completely control the New People's Army [NPA]. Making  peace with one faction is better than having no agreement with  anyone at all, he said.    "We should prepare to talk with at least a faction," he  said.  [passage omitted]    Drilon, who was a member of the National Unification  Commission, recalled that when the agency was still existing, it  received word that local rebels opposed to Sison wanted to have  separate representation.    "We got very clear signals that it is alright for the  government to hold exploratory talks with Sison et al, but when  it comes to formal negotiations, they would want to be  represented," the justice secretary said.    He added that even some members of the CPP hierarchy want to  conduct talks with the government. "There was a report that a  certain point, certain NDF leaders in the Philippines were  disappointed because of the perception that we are talking only  with Joma [Jose Ma. Sison]," he said. [sentence as published]    The government is currently communicating officially with  NDF  Vice Chairman Luis Jalandoni who heads the NDF panel.</p>

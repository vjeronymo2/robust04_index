			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Sheffield plays the games and counts the cost: The world student tournament proved a managerial and financial disaster THE WORLD Student Games in Sheffield last summer were a triumph for sport but a political and financial disaster for the city that staged them. The idea was to demonstrate vision, Yorkshire grit and Sheffield's ability to pull itself up by its bootstraps after the collapse of much of its industry in the early 1980s. Instead, the city was shown to have been incompetent at management and financial control. The council budgeted for a Pounds 5m loss to be on the safe side, but things went so wrong losses were Pounds 10.4m. Last week the council's policy committee drew up plans to sack about 700 people to finance Pounds 7.5m of overspending on its current budget. Mr Mike Bower, the council's Labour leader, says that cannot be linked to the extra losses on the games but is just as easily attributable to spending on education, housing or cleaning. However, Mr Gordon Sutton, district auditor for the area and the government's watchdog on public spending, says the games compounded Sheffield's already serious financial difficulties, making cuts in jobs and services inevitable. The catalogue of managerial errors and chaos surrounding the games is recounted this week in reports by Mr Sutton and Mrs Pamela Gordon, the council's chief executive. Mr Sutton says optimistic income projections by Mr Ray Gridley, Sheffield's director of housing, who was seconded in June 1990 to run the games, misled councillors. The council will go into camera on Friday to debate whether he should be disciplined. Mrs Gordon's position will also be scrutinised. Nevertheless, the reports also make clear that other officials and councillors were not assertive enough in satisfying themselves of the risks involved. Powers had been delegated to Mr Gridley and Mrs Gordon to get on with the job, but Mr Sutton says too many people assumed things were under tighter control than they were, and there was no proper internal audit. It was only when accounts were finalised four months after the games that the scale of the loss became apparent. Neither Mr Bower nor Mrs Gordon's report considers the period before June 1990, when the council took over the games, but both believe the council started at a disadvantage. Britain was in recession - a sharp contrast to 1987, when the games were awarded. The basic handicap was that Sheffield embarked on a high-risk, Pounds 20m-plus venture with poor prospects of selling television rights and, hence, consumer-product sponsorship. The unmarketability of the games as a worldwide TV spectacle dogged Universiade GB, a company set up the council and Sheffield's private sector, to manage them. There were clashes between Mr Peter Burns, a former Reed International director brought in as chief executive, and Labour councillors over his 'capitalistic' management style. He left at the end of 1989 in a blaze of bad publicity. When Universiade GB eventually became irredeemably insolvent because it could not even raise enough sponsorship to keep itself going, the council took over, believing it could do better. It failed.</p>

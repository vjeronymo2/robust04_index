			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / City watchdogs plan list of suspected fraudsters A CENTRAL directory of suspected fraudsters and other wrongdoers in the financial and corporate worlds is being planned by City and government officials. The directory would be used to link intelligence collected by the City's investment watchdogs, the Bank of England, the Building Societies Commission, the Stock Exchange and the companies investigation division of the Department of Trade and Industry. It could be extended to embrace the Serious Fraud Office. The creation of a central directory would make it possible for investigators inquiring into an individual or company to find out whether any other body had information which could help. Sharing information in this way could lead to better communication between the many bodies in the UK charged with investigating suspected fraud or other financial misdemeanours. Regulatory bodies already share information and claim that the current arrangements work well. However, it is impossible at for a watchdog to tell whether any other body has information that might be of use it in a particular case. The initiative to create the central file has come from the Securities and Investments Board, the chief investment watchdog. It is understood the SIB is close to reaching agreement with other City regulators on the directory. The Department of Trade and Industry has yet to agree to the idea, which is modelled on a proposal for a central database on fraudsters put forward by the House of Commons' trade and industry select committee in a report on the handling of company investigations. The SIB's proposal would not lead to information being pooled centrally. Instead, the central file would be an index of individuals and companies and would list which agencies had information on them. The investigator would then seek the information directly from the agency concerned. Regulators hope this would overcome the resistance of some bodies which are concerned about pooling sensitive information in a central system which would be widely available. Mr Kenneth Warren, chairman of the select committee, welcomed the plan. 'It's a major step forward,' he said. 'Those on the 'shop floor' have known for a long time that it was needed - people in the legal profession, and international crimed prevention.' A link between the planned file and similar systems maintained by regulators overseas was also needed, he said. The DTI said of the plan: 'It is something we are aware of and we are in discussion with SIB.'</p>

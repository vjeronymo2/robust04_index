"If the situation when  vital issues of regional and nationality policies are solved  without participation of the government member responsible for  these issues remains, I will not be able to work in the  cabinet," he told INTERFAX today.    According to well-informed sources in the staff, Shakhray is  virtually debarred from solving regional issues. For instance,  the president transferred the responsibility for monitoring  talks with Tatarstan on concluding a bilateral treaty on  power-sharing from Shakhray to Vice Prime Minister Yuriy Yarov.    It was Yarov and the head of the presidential staff, Sergey  Filatov, who held a conference with the regional leaders without  asking Shakhray to join them. Without his participation and  despite his recommendations, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  held consultations with a representative of the Chechen  president, M. Mugadayev, on Friday.    INTERFAX learned that Shakhray did not participate in the  first meeting of the reshuffled government. Prior to this, he  put forward two conditions for his joining the government, i.e.  his ministry's direct subordination to the head of the  government and membership in the government presidium. However,  he has never received an answer to the demands.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Challengers set pace in City telecoms war: Andrew Adonis examines a hothouse for phone-line competition If the City of London is a foretaste of things to come in telecoms, British Telecommunications should be worried. One of the stronger rivals threatening the huge organisation in the Square Mile has been operating for only a few months and has fewer than 50 employees. Tomorrow another rival enters the lists. MFS, a US carrier providing services in 23 US cities, will launch the City's fourth telecoms network; and about a dozen other operators are offering competing services over leased lines. In the UK as a whole BT still carries nearly 90 per cent of telecoms traffic, in spite of the abolition of its monopoly in 1984. In the US, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the long-distance carrier which had its stranglehold on the US market broken in the same year, has had its share pushed well below 70 per cent. Yet in the City it is the competitors to BT that boast about 70 per cent of the total market for telecoms services. Mr Michael Hepher, managing director of BT, concedes that the company has lost 'more than half' of City business; most analysts put the figure far higher. Nearly all of that business has gone to Mercury. A strict contrast with the US is problematic, since local telephony in the US is mostly in the hands of the 'Baby Bells' - the seven regional Bell companies created by the 1984 break-up of AT&amp;T. In some cities - including New York, where MFS is a significant force - the Baby Bells are on the defensive, but in few if any have they received the battering BT has experienced in the Square Mile. Competitive pressures are weaker still in continental Europe. The monopolies of state operators are still largely intact in the rest of the European Union; nowhere are rivals allowed to provide public infrastructure as in the UK. The attraction of the City is obvious: its concentration of large corporate users, with multi-million pound telecoms bills and telecoms managers eager for new opportunities. Mercury, established 10 years ago, has built up its business by undercutting BT tariffs by 10 per cent or more, and offering special discounts for volume customers. Ironically, Mercury may be the victim of its own success. 'For us the first move was the most difficult to contemplate,' said the telecoms manager of one of the City's leading banks. 'But Mercury taught us two lessons: first, to keep to short contracts; and second, that you can cope with more than one carrier fairly easily, providing they are competent.' The bank in question now has four suppliers: BT, Mercury, Colt - a US company serving only the City, which has its own 37km fibre network which is being expanded fast - and Worldcom, another US company, which re-sells time on national and international lines leased from other operators. Worldcom and Colt have developed strong City reputations - over two years in the first case and in a matter of months in the case of Colt. Both are products of the liberalisation of telecommunications carried through by the government three years ago, when the post-privatisation duopoly of BT and Mercury was broken. Both also give the lie to the idea that a modern telecoms company needs a cast of thousands to be plausible. Colt has fewer than 50 staff, mostly in marketing and account management. It has contracted out the laying of its fibre network. 'We may seem small,' said Mr Paul Chisholm, Colt's managing director. 'But because we are focused on the City market, we can give more individual attention to customers than they get from BT and Mercury.' The new competitors claim to be cheaper than BT and Mercury, although general comparisons are difficult because companies quote for specific requirements. They are also focusing on differentiated services, such as dedicated corporate networks. Mr Michael Storey, MFS managing director, said: 'The ability to mobilise new services with the right back-up support is going to be the key.' Not all the new operators are competing against each other. Colt, for instance, is concerned only with carrying local traffic and its capacity is being leased by long-distance and international re-sellers such as Worldcom and Esprit. These want a local network to connect to their customers and say they get a quicker and cheaper service from Colt than from BT. Colt is also in talks with Energis - a new long-distance carrier that is erecting its own local network on National Grid pylons - about providing 'last-mile' connections. BT and Mercury are fighting hard to retain and increase their City business. Most of BT's traffic from the City now goes through one of the company's five discount schemes for large users, offering savings of up to 16 per cent on standard tariffs. BT has also set up teams to recapture lost corporate clients. It claims to have recouped about Pounds 200m of business from Mercury, with Citibank, the Prudential and National Power among them.</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Output fall sparks fears for recovery A disappointing decline in manufacturing output in December yesterday raised fears about the strength of the UK recovery. Manufacturing output dropped 0.5 per cent between November and December while industrial production as a whole fell 0.6 per cent, according to the Central Statistical Office. Both figures were much lower than analysts' forecasts. The CSO reduced its estimate of the trend of annual growth in manufacturing output from 1.5 per cent to 1 per cent. However, the Treasury pointed out that the quarterly figures showed a continuing upward trend. Manufacturing output in the fourth quarter of last year was 0.5 per cent higher than in the third quarter and 2.2 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier. Industrial production was stronger than manufacturing output largely due to the oil and gas industry. UK oil and gas output reached a record level in December, and was 23.5 per cent higher in the fourth quarter than in the last three months of 1992. In the fourth quarter, industrial production was 1.3 per cent higher than in the previous three months and 3.5 per cent higher than in the same period in 1992. Over 1993 as a whole, industrial production was 2.7 per cent higher than in 1992, while manufacturing output rose 1.9 per cent. A clearer picture of the strength of the recovery should be available today, with the publication of statistics on unemployment, average earnings, retail sales and the retail prices index. Economists, however, also spotted some disturbing trends in the industrial production figures. 'The breakdown of the data is unhelpful for the government' said Mr Simon Briscoe of SG Warburg Securities. 'In the last quarter, consumer goods production was up 1.6 per cent, while the output of investment goods fell 1.5 per cent.' The CSO blamed a number of factors for the December decline. Tobacco production fell back after a one-off jump in November ahead of the Budget; the iron and steel industries were affected by more holidays than normal; computer production dropped back from higher levels earlier in the year; and aerospace production continued to decline. Electricity, gas and water output also fell back in December. This was because the weather was slightly milder than normal but cold conditions in October and November meant that, for the fourth quarter as a whole, the sector's output rose by 1.7 per cent. Mr David Coleman of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said: 'The list of excuses is suspiciously long and seasonal distortions should be adjusted for. It is worrying that the latest fall in output was spread among several industries.'</p>

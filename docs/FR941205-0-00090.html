			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 29. We continue to believe that our definition of substantial duplication is appropriate for determining signal carriage obligations. We note that it is consistent with the legislative history that indicates that this term refers to the ``simultaneous transmission of identical programming on two stations'' and which ``constitutes a majority of the programming on each station.'' While we agree with NCTA that Congress gave the Commission discretion to define substantial duplication, we continue to believe that the most appropriate approach here is to act consistently with the legislative history. Congress did not intend for a single duplicative program, whether subject to blackout or not, to be the determining factor. Finally, we observe that our rules often use different definitions for similar terms based on the purpose of the policy involved. The Commission's exclusivity rules are intended to protect the rights that a broadcaster has bargained for with the supplier of a particular program. The must-carry rules, however, are intended to ensure that local stations are available to cable subscribers. Thus, we reject the proposed modification to our definition of substantial duplication. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Low Power Television Stations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30. Qualified Low Power Television Station. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 614(h)(2) contains the statutory requirements a low power television station (LPTV) must meet before it will be considered ``qualified'' for must-carry purposes. Section 614(h)(2) provides that an LPTV station must broadcast for at least the minimum number of hours the Commission requires of commercial broadcast stations. The station must adhere to certain Commission requirements regarding non-entertainment programming and employment. The station must address local news and informational needs that full power stations are not adequately serving because the full power stations are distant from the LPTV station's community of license. The station must comply with the Commission's LPTV interference regulations. The station must be within 35 miles of the cable headend and deliver a good quality over-the-air signal to the headend. The station's community of license and the cable system's franchise area both must have been located outside of the largest 160 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA's) on June 30, 1990, and the population of the LPTV station's community of license must not have exceeded 35,000 on that date. Lastly, there cannot be any full power television station licensed to any community within the county or other political subdivision served by the cable system. As we stated in the Report and Order, a low power television station must meet all of the statutory requirements to be ``qualified'' for must-carry status. Cable systems are required to carry a qualified LPTV station only if there are not sufficient full power local commercial television stations to fulfill the cable operator's must-carry obligations under Section 614(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 31. Moran Communications (``Moran'') and the Community Broadcaster Association (``CBA'') request a revision to the requirement in Section 614(h)(2)(F) that, in order for an LPTV station to be qualified, there cannot be any full power station licensed to any community within the county or political subdivision served by the cable system. Under this exception, Moran and CBA explain, an LPTV station would qualify for must-carry rights if it meets all the requirements of subsections 614(h)(2), except for subsection F, and if none of the full power stations in the county or political subdivision served by the cable system offers local news or informational programming. They contend that when a satellite station is repeating another station's signal and not broadcasting any local news or informational programming to meet the needs of the local community, the satellite station should not be considered a full power station for the purposes of Section 614(h)(2)(F). CBA also argues that a satellite station is a ``passive repeater,'' and because Section 614(h)(1)(b)(1) specifically excludes passive repeaters from the definition of a local commercial television station, it follows that Congress intentionally gave less to repeaters than to originating stations in terms of must-carry rights. Therefore, argues CBA, ``[t]he Congressional recognition of the lesser value of the repeaters must be incorporated into the must-carry rule *&blank;*&blank;*.'' In opposition, NCTA argues that the Commission cannot rewrite the statute, which defines qualified LPTV stations and governs the must-carry rights of LPTV stations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

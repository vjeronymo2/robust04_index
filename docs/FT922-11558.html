			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Police break up Taiwanese demonstration ANTI-RIOT police dispersed about 1,000 demonstrators in central Taipei at dawn today, ending a five-day street protest mounted to demand democratic reform, Reuter reports from Taipei. Thousands of helmeted police, wielding clubs and firing water cannon, dragged the protesters out of a makeshift camp built by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) outside the capital's main railway station. Police punched and kicked the demonstrators, some of whom resisted and were injured, witnesses said. The protesters were released several blocks away. The DPP had occupied the street outside the station since Monday in a demonstration to demand direct presidential elections.</p>

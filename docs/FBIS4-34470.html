			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] On 24 May, the Attorney General's Office  and the Colombian Banking Association (Asobancaria) concluded an  agreement intended to strengthen the government's hand in  detecting and fighting official corruption. The agreement will  facilitate the examination of bank records by authorities  looking for evidence of money obtained through illegal means.  Specifically, the agreement provides for a smoother exchange of  banking information between the Office of Special Investigations  (OIE) -- the department of the Attorney General's Office  responsible for much of the preliminary investigative work in  cases of administrative corruption -- and Asobancaria, and will  improve the latter's technical support to the OIE. (EL TIEMPO 25  May; EL ESPECTADOR 26 May) President Cesar Gaviria, who  attended the signing ceremony at the presidential palace,  hailed the agreement as an "extremely important step forward" in  coordinating efforts by the state and civil society to fight  administrative corruption. He added that the accord is part of a  larger strategy to prevent use of the country's financial system  "to conceal investments or make use of resources obtained by  means of illicit activities." Attorney General Carlos Gustavo  Arrieta described the agreement as "a veritable revolution" in  the struggle to fight illicit enrichment, and said it would  "greatly reduce" investigation time. (EL TIEMPO 25 May)    Although financial institutions were already required to  provide the Attorney General's Office with information upon  request, the process whereby OIE investigators collected the  data was time-consuming, subject to leaks, and did not always  receive the full cooperation of bank officials, according to EL  ESPECTADOR (26 May). By greatly streamlining procedures for  gathering information and relaying it to the appropriate  authorities, the new agreement could reduce OIE investigative  work by as much as 75 percent, according to EL TIEMPO (25 May).    In a commentary in EL ESPECTADOR (29 May), Arrieta explained  that the agreement eliminates the need for investigators to go  from bank to bank, including individual branch offices,  throughout the country searching for a suspect's accounts as  well as those of family members or others which may have been  used to conceal the illicit activity. Now, an investigator can  simply report a suspect's name to Asobancaria's Center for  Financial Sector Information (Cifin), which will be required  quickly to provide all relevant information from its data bank  of current information on accounts and transactions made at the  country's financial institutions. (EL ESPECTADOR 29 May; EL  TIEMPO 25 May)    In addition, the new procedures will help to ensure the  confidentiality of investigations. Arrieta notes that, under the  previous system, numerous bank officials were involved in  responding to an OIE inquiry, increasing the risk that a suspect  would be alerted to the investigation. Under the new system,  however, each institution will appoint a representative to the  Cifin working group who will be responsible for handling all  requests for information from that institution. (EL TIEMPO 25  May)    Addressing reports that bank officials had sometimes failed  to cooperate fully with OIE investigators in the past, Arrieta  said that in signing the agreement the financial system has  "given its full commitment to the fight against corruption." (EL  TIEMPO 25 May)    The agreement also calls for Asobancaria to provide  investigators with training and ongoing assistance in  understanding the more technical details of banking operations.  Arrieta noted that such cooperation is especially important  because criminals have refined their methods of concealing the  illegal origin of their money. (EL ESPECTADOR 29 May)    Asobancaria and the Prosecutor General's Office are  reportedly working out a similar agreement. (EL ESPECTADOR 26  May)</p>

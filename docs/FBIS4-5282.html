			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's sudden  announcement of his intention to resign has aroused extensive  concerns over a possible political vacuum connected with  security and diplomatic issues. In particular, concerns about  the government's handling of the DPRK (North Korea) nuclear  inspection issue are all the more serious because this issue, in  a sense, involves the cabinet's crisis management capabilities.  Here, we would like to bring up a few measures that Japan may  be expected to take in case the UN Security Council should  decide on imposing economic sanctions. They are: suspension of  remittances, trade control, control of exchanges, and actions  taken to prevent maritime activities.  <H5>  The Remittance Issue </H5>   The United States has severely criticized remittances from  Japan to North Korea, maintaining the money "has been used to  develop nuclear weapons." Reportedly, a total of 60-80 billion  yen is remitted every year, but the actual details are unknown.  It is stipulated in the Act on Control of Foreign Exchange and  Foreign Trade [ACFEFT] that payment can be prohibited "when it  is deemed necessary to faithfully perform international treaties  signed by our country or other international commitments." In  practice, the act is implemented through the Ministry of Finance  [MOF] issuing notifications on the basis of regulations on  controlling foreign exchange.    Moreover, even if these regulations are enforced, it will be  very difficult to control remittance through third countries  such as China. Regarding keitai-sokin [remittance by asking  visitors to carry money into the country], it is said that  "control cannot be effectively enforced unless visits are also  prohibited" (stated by a senior MOF official). If the  government should enforce stricter checking of Korean residents  in Japan, there is a danger the issue may develop into a serious  human rights issue.    It has been firmly stated that enforcement of such  regulations should be based on the "UN resolution." It has also  been pointed out that if China should exercise its veto right,  and if Japan, the United States, and the ROK should decide on  imposing their own sanctions, "control would hardly be  effective" (stated by a senior MOF official).  <H5>  Trade Control </H5>   It is stipulated in the ACFEFT that "if it should be deemed  that maintenance of international peace and security is  hampered," the government can control foreign trade by  authorizing the minister of the Ministry of International Trade  and Industry [MITI] to issue permits. MITI takes the position  that "there are no legal impediments at all to imposing  sanctions connected with trade." Should the United Nations  decide on commodities on which sanctions will be imposed, the  government will deal with the issue by enforcing the ordinance  on controlling export and import trade.    In 1993, Japan exported to the DPRK such commodities as  textile products, vehicles, and household appliances, amounting  to approximately $220 million, and imported from the DPRK such  commodities as men's suits, mushrooms, and fish amounting to  approximately $250 million. "Since both exports and imports  amounted to a relatively small sum, it will not decisively  damage the DPRK even if its contacts with Japan were cut off"  (stated by a MITI source).    Total DPRK exports reached $1.29 billion while imports  reached $1.52 billion (according to an estimate of the Japan  External Trade Organization [JETRO] in 1992). Major trade  partners are China, Japan, and the former Soviet Union. Its  trade with the former Soviet Union, including crude oil, has  dropped sharply since 1991. It has been noted that "since North  Korea is suffering from a serious shortage of energy and  foodstuffs, it would be a serious blow if sanctions were to be  imposed on such commodities as oil and grains" (according to a  Foreign Ministry source). Since most of these commodities are  imported through China, it is expected that the "efficiency of  the sanctions will depend largely on how China deals with the  issue."    Control of Exchanges    In 1992, 15,129 Korean residents in Japan reentered Japan  after visiting North Korea, and 4,287 Japanese visited North  Korea. Meanwhile, a total of 756 Koreans from North Korea  visited Japan.    Due to the Rangoon incident in 1983, as well as the Korean  Airlines aircraft explosion accident in 1991, the government has  taken the following measures: prohibition of contacts with North  Korean diplomats, and of government officials' visits to North  Korea; stricter examination of applications by North Korean  civilians for entry into Japan; and prohibition of exchanges of  flights by chartered planes between the two countries.    The government is also studying the possibility of rejecting  reentry to Japan of those Korean residents of Japan who are  currently visiting their home towns in North Korea. However, it  has been pointed out that "it will be against humanity to reject  reentry to those Koreans who have resided in Japan as members of  Japanese society." Therefore, "it will be impossible to  prohibit Korean residents from visiting their home towns."  <H5>  Actions To Prevent Maritime Activities </H5>   If the United Nations adopts a resolution that, for the  purpose of ensuring economic sanctions, moves should be made to  prevent maritime activities, it can be expected that the U.S.  fleet and other units will request Japan's logistic support such  as refueling. In this case, however, it is pointed out that "the  Self-Defense Forces [SDF] Law should be revised so as to clearly  state the SDF's authority" (according to a Defense Agency [DA]  source). It is also anticipated that Japan and the United  States may sign an "acquisition and cross-servicing agreement  (ACAS)."    Moreover, since no existing laws have any regulations on  conducting maritime inspections, such as boarding  investigations, it will be impossible to carry out such  inspections "unless there should be legislation of new laws  similar to the UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) Cooperation  Bill" (according to the same DA source). Nevertheless, in that  case, it is feared the new law may be contrary to the  Constitution, which prohibits acts of collective self-defense.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Be ready for questions My wife has recently transferred some shares to my name. Although there was no financial consideration involved, am I correct in assuming that, for CGT or other purposes, the cost of acquisition would be taken as the share price at the date of transfer? Ever since CGT was introduced in 1965, the basic rule for transfers between spouses (living together) has been that the asset is deemed to go across at cost, regardless of what price (if any) is actually paid or its value at the time. Ask your tax office for the free leaflet CGT15 (Capital gains tax: a guide for married couples), but bear in mind that it is not up to date. We are, however, a little concerned at your use of the phrase 'transferred . . . to my name' rather than 'given me'. A mere transfer into your name is not in itself sufficient to effect a change of beneficial ownership. In the absence of evidence of an intention to confer beneficial ownership upon her husband, English law assumes that a married woman who transfers shares etc into her husband's name does so with the intention that he should hold them as her nominee, beneficial ownership remaining with the wife (no consideration for the transfer having passed from husband to wife). The Revenue looks closely at transfers between spouses, so you should be prepared for questions in due course. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Geest shares dive on banana price war SHARES IN Geest yesterday fell almost a third and analysts said interim profits could drop as low as break-even after the company said a banana price war had slashed prices in northern Europe. In the first half of 1992 the fresh produce and prepared foods company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 15.4m. The shares fell 106p to 328p but later rallied to 366p. However, Mr Leonard van Geest, chairman, told the annual meeting yesterday that the board intended to at least maintain the interim dividend at 3.7p. He said the combination of the drop in prices and 'start-up difficulties' at its new banana plantation in Costa Rica would affect first half profits. Mr van Geest declined to quantify the impact but one analyst said: 'We were expecting profits to be between Pounds 15m and Pounds 16m, but now we are expecting between nought and Pounds 2m.' The chairman told shareholders that 'while the first quarter of the year began satisfactorily, during April it became apparent that the supply of dollar bananas into the European Community, ahead of the new import regime scheduled for July 1, exceeded demand.' Geest had cut its own prices by 39 per cent owing to the unexpected and rapid fall in banana prices throughout the EC. Prices were significantly below those achieved in the equivalent periods over the previous two years, he said. Analysts confirmed the roots of the decline in prices lay in the EC's new import regime, from which Geest is set to gain market share. Some banana traders, who are likely to lose market share, had reduced their orders from farmers. Some banana growers, mainly from Ecuador, had responded by shipping excess fruit to the European continent at discounted prices. Geest's sensitivity to price fluctuations had been heightened because it is now both a banana grower and trader. The company's new Costa Rican plantation began exporting in January . The UK market had been relatively stable until France last week announced that it would be limiting imports from certain Afro-Carribean-Pacific states, including the Ivory Coast and Cameroon. Mr van Geest said: 'This fruit has already started to come on to the UK market and is having an adverse affect on prices.'</p>

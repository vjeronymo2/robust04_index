We  acknowledge the domestic and foreign negative effects of these  events. We appreciate the noble stands of the leader of the  Kurdish people, Mas'ud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan  Democratic Party [KDP], to prevent an armed clash and later to  stop and contain it in order to avoid bloodshed. This stand  indicates his concern for the wellbeing of his people and his  devotion and sincerity. Appreciating these noble stands by the  KDP and its leader, Barzani, and following the approval of the  guide of the Islamic Movement, Shaykh (?'Ali) al-'Uthman in  accordance with his cable dated 30 December 1993, we declare  that the Fifth Branch of the Islamic Movement, the (Badinan)  region, will join the KDP. On this occasion, we extend our  thanks and appreciation for all the good efforts that have been  exerted and prevented the occurrence of problems and an armed  clash in the (Badinan) area. We thank God Almighty that He  enabled us to control the situation throughout the past period  during which Kurdistan, with the exception of the (Badinan)  region, witnessed such regrettable incidents. We thank God and  the good sons of our proud Kurdish people.    [Signed] The Fifth Branch of the Islamic Movement of  Kurdistan    [Dated] 31 December 1993</p>

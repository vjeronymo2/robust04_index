			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Roche cautions on sluggish sales Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, yesterday warned that sales growth during the second half of 1994 would be slower than in recent years. The caution came as growth at its pharmaceuticals division slowed from 16 per cent, year-on-year, during the first quarter, to 2 per cent in the second. However, barring unforeseen circumstances, group profits for 1994 as a whole would show an increase, Roche said. In 1993, net income rose 29.3 per cent to SFr2.48bn (Dollars 1.9bn), while sales were 10.5 per cent higher at SFr14.3bn. Turnover for the six months ended June was up 7 per cent in local currencies. In Swiss francs, which have appreciated over the last year, sales rose 2 per cent to SFr7.33bn. Half-year profits figures were not disclosed. The pharmaceuticals division posted sales up 9 per cent in local currencies (4 per cent in Swiss francs), to SFr4.04bn from SFr3.9bn. Roche said it had been unable to avoid the effects of an increasingly competitive environment. During the second quarter, it was hit by extraordinary factors. The vitamins and fine chemicals division rose 7 per cent in local currencies (2 per cent in Swiss francs), to SFr1.63bn from SFr1.6bn. Turnover at the diagnostics division slipped 2 per cent in local currencies (4 per cent in Swiss francs), to SFr815m from SFr867m. The group said if last year's sales from the disposed microbiology business were excluded, sales in local currencies would have been little changed. The static result at the diagnostics division was partly blamed on changes in reimbursement policy in the US, which led to the closure of some local laboratories. The fragrances and flavours division posted sales up 13 per cent in local currencies (8 per cent in Swiss francs), to SFr812m from SFr750m. Roche certificates fell 5 per cent to SFr5,700 yesterday.

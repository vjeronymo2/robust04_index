			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Letter: Blunderland before breakfast Sir, Oh dear. If one had to believe one impossible thing before breakfast, it would be that a Leader in your newspaper would have three misstatements in the first four lines. Yet, sadly, it is not impossible, as your Leader ('Banking on the impossible', August 18) indicates. It was the White Queen, not the Red Queen. She did not make it a rule to believe, but rather in her youth believed, not six, but as many as six, impossible things before breakfast. Oh dear. Joseph Chubb 110 Riverside Drive, New York, NY 10024, US</p>

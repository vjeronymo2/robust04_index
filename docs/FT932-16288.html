			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses see activity in automotive stocks FOR GOOD or ill, automotive industry stocks attracted their fair share of atttention in senior bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was mixed in quiet, pre-holiday trade, the DAX index ending 3.06 lower at 1,658.69 as German equity turnover rose from DM4.6bn to DM4.7bn. Automotive stocks saw much of the action. Daimler-Benz and Mercedes reflected Friday's afternoon quotations, heading the active stocks list in turnover of DM1bn, and DM550m respectively. Daimler fell DM15.50 to DM595 over the official session and Mercedes, which owns 25.2 per cent of Daimler, rose DM84 to DM574 on Friday's news that Mercedes shares will be swapped into Daimler on a one-for-one basis. Porsche lost nearly 3 per cent after its recent gains, falling DM15 to DM518 on a combination of profit-taking and weekend comment. Meanwhile, there was another burst of afternoon news at Continental, the tyremaker, where Deutsche Bank and Mediobanca are leading the placing of the Pirelli holding, and where Pirelli claimed a price of DM250 a share. Conti responded in the after-hours, Ibis market with a price of DM213 compared with its official close of DM204.20, down DM3.30. It came back a little later, but only to DM210. MILAN was lifted by a firm performance by telecommunications shares but otherwise, investors remained hesitant amid the political uncertainty in the run-up to the electoral reform referendum on April 18. The Comit index rose 3.22 to 478.66. Sip ordinary shares added L60 or 4 per cent to L1,541 in volume of 8.29m shares after ministers agreed a plan to merge it, with the country's other telephone companies, into a single group. Italcable, the intercontinental operator, gained L20 to L5,230. Pirelli, L18 ahead at one stage, finished L11 lower at L1,339 ahead of the announcement of the sale of its holdings in Continental, the German type maker. 'We view this development as being very positive for Pirelli since it will produce L140bn in capital gains which can be counted into the 1993 results,' said Mr John Stewart of Pastorino and Partners in Milan. 'It is also a sign that Pirelli is going ahead with its debt reduction programme. This deal will produce much welcomed cash.' PARIS combined caution, ahead of any major policy statements by the new centre-right government, with worries about results due this week from a number of major companies. This left the CAC-40 index down 16.14 at 1,974.68 in turnover of about FFr1.9bn against Friday's FFr3bn. Automotive stocks were weak. Michelin fell FFr5.30 to FFr165.70 ahead of tomorrow's results, following a sell recommendation from a domestic broker. Peugeot lost FFr16 at FFr548 in the wake of last Friday's disappointing French new car sales for March. Credit Lyonnais certificates , meanwhile, were FFr16 lower at FFr617 on a report indicating problems with the purchase of a profitable bond portfolio; Pechiney certificates fell FFr4.90 to FFr297.10 ahead of results due today. AMSTERDAM edged lower in quiet trading and the CBS Tendency index finished 0.10 lower at 106.70. Aegon, down Fl 2.30 at Fl 83.60, continued to be hurt by last week's news that shareholders have to choose between a cash or stock dividend before the latter is detailed. Bols gained 90 cents to Fl 49.90 and Wessanen Fl 1.30 to Fl 105.50 on news that the way to their planned link-up is clear after 95 per cent of Bols shares were tendered for a swap in Wessanen shares. ZURICH was in a quiet, pre-Easter holiday mood and while Wall Street's firm opening helped prices to recoup some of their earlier losses, the SMI index closed 6.4 lower at 2,183.9. ISTANBUL rose 3.8 per cent on top of last week's 11.5 per cent cumulative gains, taking the market index 237.1 higher to a second consecutive all-time-high of 6,544.11. Buying was heaviest in some motor and cement companies on expectations of strong first quarter profit figures. STOCKHOLM recouped some early losses as US investors began buying but a pre-holiday mood kept trading mostly thin and dull. The Affarsvarlden index shed 6.6 to 1001.9 Ericsson's B share fell SKr4 to SKr270 after trading as low as SKr265 after Lehman Brothers downgraded its rating of the telecommunications group to neutral from outperform. OSLO was little changed and the all-share index eased 0.07 at 441.06. However, Aker, the engineering group, rose sharply in a display of renewed investor confidence after a series of setbacks. Aker B shares rose NKr4.5 to SKr55.5 while the A shares gained NKr1.5 to NKr50. HELSINKI was easier although the slide was partially stemmed by the firmer performances of Nokia and Cultor. The Hex index shed 0.5 per cent to 1,029.1. Nokia which announced a big contract early in the day saw its preferred share rise FM7 to FM134 while the ordinary shares added FM5 to FM142.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- April 5                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1137.61    1136.98    1137.95    1137.91 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1205.54    1204.59    1205.77    1203.61  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1137.21    1136.71    1137.07    1136.15 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1204.43    1203.48    1204.91    1202.24  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Apr 2     Apr 1    Mar 31    Mar 30    Mar 29  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1140.36   1144.81   1149.13   1152.62   1148.76 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1215.52   1219.86   1220.16   1219.87   1213.37  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1138.55; 200 - 1206.67 Low/day: 100 - 1135.79 200 - 1202.24.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

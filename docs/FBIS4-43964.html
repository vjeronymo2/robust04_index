			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Baran Dural: "A Turkish-Israeli-Egyptian </F> Alliance!"]    [Text] As was the case before the concept of the new world  order was launched, the Middle East continues to be a region  where the superpowers struggle to establish their own areas of  influence. During the Cold War years, the United States and the  Soviet Union struggled for hegemony over that region. Now, the  Middle East has started to gain a new status. In line with the  concept of the new world order launched by the United States  after the Gulf war, new balances are taking shape in the region.  Israel, too, is doing all it can for the success of the  autonomous Palestinian administration which has been  established, in the first stage, in Gaza and Jericho. When the  White House pushed for a solution in line with the new world  order, Israel and the Palestinians, who had been enemies for  many years, sat at the negotiating table, and the smell of  gunfire which had seeped into the region began to disperse.    The thing is, however, that these countries that are  interested in the Middle East with its rich oil reserves and  important geographical position, have not stopped playing to  their own hands as well. One wing of the U.S. Administration  posits the green belt project against Tehran, which wants to  export the Islamic revolution and which seems to have had  relative success as we can see in Lebanon, Egypt, and the  occupied territories in Israel. This wing calls for a "moderate  Islam" in certain Middle East countries, including Turkey,  against the fundamentalism of Iran.    Germany, which emerged as the strongest power in Europe  after  it united with its "communist half," is trying to join with Iran  and Iraq against its rival, the United States. Japan comes up  with attractive offers to expand its existing markets. Starting  to act in line with the nationalists headed by Zhirinovskiy, who  was victorious in the elections, and also in line with the  "imperial" demands of the former Red Army, Russia aims at  returning to the Middle East which it had left for the United  States.    As for Israel, which has military and economic advantages,  it  wants to assume a role as an independent force in the regional  balance and to find new allies to suit the conditions.    The developments taking place in the Middle East are so  interesting that the strategists thinking about the area get  lost among the large number of possible combinations every new  rapprochement brings.    With the establishment of the Israeli-Palestinian peace, a  Palestine waiting to be built and several giant projects  emerged. The fight to take a bigger share of the Middle Eastern  market now makes it necessary to set up new power unions and  this turns into a multipolar struggle for balances. The  formulas posited to change the economic and political balances  in the Middle East are based in particular on the premise that  Iran and Iraq each take a smaller share of the cake. You can  expect a struggle among the Western allies who will share the  cake, and you can also expect the struggle to eliminate some of  the allies and replace them with others. Consequently, it should  not be surprising if the first internal confrontation among the  Western allies of the new world order era takes place in the  Middle East.    Actually, the forces inside and outside the region realize  that reconstruction is essential. Israel remains alone among  its neighboring Arab states with its advanced technology in the  industrial and agricultural fields, with its qualified cadres,  great foreign trade volume, sound economy, and superior military  power. Aware of its position, Israel prefers to be an active  factor in the Middle East market, and not an important pawn of  the many allies -- headed by the United States and Germany -- in  the continuing struggle to share the cake. Israel plans to set  on its path with "powerful allies" so that it can succeed in its  strategy that is bound to disturb the United States in the long  run.  <H5>  New Horizons </H5>   Israel has carefully selected the countries wooed for  partnership. Now that it has brought the Palestinian issue up  to a certain point, Israel wants to explore new horizons. These  new horizons include Turkey and Egypt. Israel has practically  secured Turkey's cooperation. Agreement was reached between the  two countries to cooperate in several fields months before the  colorful Israeli-PLO autonomy agreement was reached in Cairo on  4 May, during Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin's visit to Israel as  well as during the successive visits to Turkey of Israeli  President 'Ezer Weizman and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres.    The Israeli media is also speculating on the possible  targets  and nature of future cooperation. The LINK magazine, which is  known for its close contacts with intelligence sources,  allocated 10 pages to Turkey in its May 1994 issue. In its  articles entitled "New Administrations in the Eastern  Mediterranean," "Risk Versus Reward," "Turkey: Its Potential  and Problems," and "Natural Partner," the magazine studies the  current and possible future state of bilateral economic,  commercial, and political relations. The introduction to the  study notes: "Geopolitical considerations establish a direct  link between Turkey and Israel, the key allies of the West  located on the edge of the Mediterranean. Turkey has the heavy  industry to build the body of F-16's, and Israel can supply high  technology in aeronautics. The two economies complement one  another. Turkey, with its Euphrates and Tigris Rivers, holds  the key to the water resources in the Middle East. Israel,  which utilizes water most effectively, on the other hand, also  has high agricultural technology. There are obstacles to the  south and north (Syria) of the two countries. However, the two  countries must enter the global market and act in accordance  with the new conditions created in the eastern Mediterranean in  the wake of the Cold War."  <H5>  The Common Enemy </H5>   The studies appear to have been carefully written by Michael  Eilan and Jonathan Fedler. In his article, Eilan frequently  refers to Weizman's views on Turkey and proposes an alliance  against a common enemy: "We have entered a process of  realignment in the Middle East. This process forces certain  sides to strengthen their relations and undertake joint action.  The contacts conducted with Turkey so far have demonstrated  that both sides favor closer cooperation in the economic as well  as political fields. The fact that Turkey and Israel failed to  establish closer ties until now on the basis of political  reservations undermines the interests of the two countries.  Given the possibility that the confusion in the Middle East  could lead to new threats of war at any moment, it is becoming  clear that forces whose interests converge should leave old  prejudices aside."    Against what and whom will this alliance be formed, an  alliance which Israeli officials dwell upon at every  opportunity? Later on in his article, Eilan discusses this  issue. He charges that radical Islamic forces are gradually  beginning to take control of the balances in the Middle East and  that Iran-backed movements such as Hezbollah, Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement], Islamic Jihad, and Hezb-e Eslami are  continuously gaining strength. Eilan claims that Turkey and  Israel should form an alliance against radical Islam and assume  a decisive role in the region. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin, in a statement to the 28 May issue of HURRIYET, also  remarked that a stability triangle to be established by Turkey,  Israel, and Egypt is necessary. Referring to this trio, Rabin  noted that "it can act against all kinds of nationalist,  religious, Islamic, or other terrorist organizations attempting  to overthrow legitimate governments or to change borders."    On the basic principles of the proposed tripartite alliance,  Eilan expounds as follows: "The officials of the two countries  concede that their countries are not established in a peaceful  oasis. Syria, Iran, and Iraq are daily increasing the dose of  political pressure and commercial obstacles. Our adversaries  have a military mentality and it is necessary to establish a  deterrent unity of force against them. In this context, Turkey  and Israel seem to have discovered the importance of deterrence.  The Turkish and Israeli Armed Forces must undertake a union  against forces that support radical Islam."  <H5>  Common Goal: Fundamentalism </H5>   After positing the above proposal, LINK cannot but proceed  to  underline an extremely sensitive point. Pointing out that  Israeli and Turkish officials fear the reaction of their own  radical groups if they put their thoughts into practice, the  magazine notes that the two countries can receive a satisfactory  share of the Middle East cake only if they act together. The  practical cooperation between the two countries is not  sufficient to achieve the necessary plan, the magazine remarks,  adding that Egypt must constitute the third flank of the  alliance.    The theory proposed by Eilan with regard to the outcome of  the Turkish-Israeli alliance is quite interesting: "Turkey is  currently in the process of settling accounts with the  separatist Kurds. The state is engaged in a ruthless struggle  against the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Israel, in turn,  is waging the same struggle against the Hizballah. Providing  logistics support to both organizations is Syria. It is  certainly not a coincidence that Turkish leaders briefed Weizman  on the Southeast Anatolia Project [GAP] and took him to visit  the region. Syria is concerned about GAP's success. Turkey, if  willing to undertake the risk, can block a significant part of  the water flowing to Iraq via Syria. This would ruin Syria.  Military cooperation between Turkey and Israel would dispel  Turkey's fear of taking a risk." Claiming that Syria should  definitely be disciplined, Eilan believes that a  Turkish-Israeli-Egyptian alliance would certainly eliminate the  "Syrian threat."    Is the rise of Islamic fundamentalism the only factor that  forces Israel to form an alliance with Turkey? Or, does Israel  -- a U.S. ally -- want to take some steps outside the Green Belt  project imposed by the Pentagon? While it is known that Israel  differs from the United States on certain issues, it is also  clear that Israeli leaders will not suddenly attempt to take  radical steps. Israeli bureaucrats believe that Ankara, which  is cooperating with Tel Aviv, will secure a rapprochement  between Israel and some Arab countries. Israeli officials, who  stress that countries other than Turkey, Israel, and Egypt  should also receive their fair share of the Middle East cake,  believe that Turkey will build the bridge which will extend to  the Central Asian Turkic republics.  <H5>  The Plan To Restrain Iran </H5>   No doubt, Israel attaches great importance to the newly  independent Turkic republics. Israel, which is unable to reach  out to these republics because of Iran's influence over the  region, is hoping to overcome the Tehran obstacle through the  alliance it wants to establish. Israeli businessmen, who until  now managed to carry supplies to the Caucasus using Turkish  firms as brokers, faced difficulties when Iran, becoming aware  of the situation, imposed new quotas on Turkey. In addition to  the new quotas, Tehran increased the transit fee from Turkey  through Iran from $400 to $810 and also imposed an additional  $250 service charge. Israel, which realizes that it cannot get  through to Iran by itself, wants to create pressure on the  Tehran administration through the new alliance.    Israel's alliance proposal will also act as "a young and  lively regional pact" in the Middle East. This new possible  alliance, which some strategists describe as "the common market  of the Middle East," will also turn into a principled economic  power in due course. LINK outlines the basic guidelines of the  Turkish-Israeli economic cooperation project using the words of  Turkish businessman Uzeyir Garih: "Skilled and unskilled work  force. This is the most important factor bringing Turkey and  Israel together. There are many skilled workers in Israel.  Turkey, in turn, is the paradise of unskilled manpower.  Joining these two work forces will serve the interests of both  countries."    In actual fact, Israel did not merely prepare the manifesto  of the alliance it plans to establish. In a statement he issued  recently, Weizman also revealed the economic base of the  Turkish-Israeli-Egyptian alliance. Emphasizing that PLO leader  Yasir 'Arafat realized that he must sit at the negotiating table  with Israel if Palestine's interests are to be protected,  Weizman declared that the newly autonomous Palestinian  territories will act as the economic center of he alliance and  that Palestinian leaders have acknowledged this idea on  principle.    Given the fact that Turkey and Egypt will maintain close  relations with Islamic countries and that the alliance of these  three countries will force Iran, Iraq, and Syria, which  constantly create problems in the Middle East, to reassess their  current policies, it is understood that U.S. leaders will not  oppose this alliance -- at least not at the beginning.  Furthermore, it is suggested that the United States, which  knows that Israel has its own independent plan, will want to  "supervise" the Israeli Administration by means of Turkey and  Egypt.  <H5>  The Attitude of the United States </H5>   The picture presented so far is very rosy, but Israel  harbors  serious concerns with regard to Turkey. Like the West, Israel  also wants Turkey, at the very least, to resolve its Kurdish  problem and implement the democratization measures promised by  the government. In his statement to HURRIYET, Rabin said: "We  are granting autonomy to the Palestinians. We support other  countries' (including northern Iraq) autonomy plans as well."  Rabin was indirectly conveying the message that the Kurdish  problem must be solved.    Apart from political problems, Israeli businessmen who trade  with Turkey repeatedly stress that Turkey is a great economic  risk. According to Israeli businessmen, who note that Turkey,  Israel, and Egypt have not yet reached a level where they can  finance one another, the Turkish Government should find a  solution to the problem of inflation. If Turkey restores order  in its economy and utilizes its water resources in a rational  manner, and if the Egyptian Administration does not ignore  Israel's appeal, then a very strong and promising union can  emerge in the Middle East.    One does not have to be a prophet to guess that this union  will be faced with a fierce diplomatic offensive particularly  during its initial stages. This new alliance, which will  disturb especially Russia and Armenia, will be forced to  struggle against the schemes of these two countries on the one  hand, and against the United States and the Germany-Iran-Iraq  bloc, on the other.</p>

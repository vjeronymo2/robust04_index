Security Council retreated from a resolution to a statement by  the council president in its first-step action on North Korea's  nuclear issue due to China's opposition, officials here said  Saturday.    "Chances are six to four that the action by the Security  Council will be in a form of president's statement," said an  official at the South Korean mission to the United Nations,  "this change, after the council went as far as distributing the  draft of the resolution, is intended to secure China's  participation."    Chinese representative Chen Jian had spoken against adoption  of the resolution at a closed-door council meeting on Friday and  insisted on a president's statement instead with more weight on  positiveness and objectivity, according to the officials.    The United States is somewhat neutral on whether it should  be  a resolution or a statement, but England and France are  demanding a resolution. A heated debate is predicted at another  closed-door session to convene on Monday.    But the contents, be it resolution or statement, will not  differ significantly since the resolution from the beginning did  not contain any sanction measures.    "Even if the council decides to issue a statement, the  contents will not be much different from a resolution if it  specifies the deadline on by when North Korea has to allow  nuclear inspections, " the official said.    The five permanent members of the council moved quickly  after  Pyongyang denied access to a team of International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) inspectors to core sites of its suspected nuclear  development earlier this month.    It was initially thought that the council would pass the  resolution within this week giving North Korea one month to  reallow IAEA inspection on the sites.    "China has indicated it is willing to participate if it's a  council president statement," said the South Korean official,  "it's important to include China in the council's action since  sanctions are impossible without Beijing's cooperation."    "It's Seoul's position that it wouldn't mind whether it's a  statement if it means China's participation," he said.    The situation is a repeat of April last year when the  council  opted for a statement instead of a resolution at China's  opposition.    The president's statement is likely to come out this week,  and the council will move up to a resolution if North Korea does  not accept IAEA resolution by a set time, officials said.</p>

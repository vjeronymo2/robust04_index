			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Talisman raises offer for Encor shares TALISMAN Energy, formerly BP Canada, has raised its offer for the common shares of Encor, an oil and gas development company, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Talisman is offering one common share, worth around CDollars 20 (USDollars 15.80) in the market, for 45 Encor common shares, instead of 60 Encor previously. This values Encor common stock at 44 cents a share, or just below current market levels. BCE will receive about 11m Talisman shares for its 29.9m Encor convertible preferred shares now held. BCE, Canada's biggest telecommunications group, has now completely divested its energy interests.</p>

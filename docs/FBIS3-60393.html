Analysts at Manchester University's chemistry department  have  detected highly radioactive soil around two manholes from a  hazardous waste disposal pipeline leading from Aldermaston to  the Thames.    At the first site, opposite a row of houses between the  villages of Tadley and Padworth -- and within 500 yards of the  plant -- they detected plutonium levels 20 times above the  Government's radioactive waste threshold of 400 becquerels per  kilogram. At the second roadside site, next to an equestrian  centre and a few hundred yards from Padworth, plutonium levels  were 12 times the minimum.    The monitoring, commissioned by Greenpeace, undermines  previous claims by the Ministry of Defence-owned plant that  `low-level' leaks from sections of the pipeline had only  released radioactivity `slightly above the regulatory  threshold.' Tomorrow Chris Smith, Labour's environment  spokesman, will demand that the MoD reveal all the contaminated  sections of pipeline in the interests of public safety.    Aldermaston has previously refused to reveal the sites, all  of which are on land with public access, claiming they pose `no  danger to landowners or to the public.' By contrast, the plant's  neighbour, Blue Circle Cement, which is suing the MoD over the  separate contamination of its property, has fenced off the  polluted area and put up public warning signs.    The Greenpeace report, to be published tomorrow, is the  latest in a series of safety scares to plague the ageing  Aldermaston plant, which makes the warheads for Britain's  Trident missiles.    Earlier this year The Observer revealed how nearly  100 employees had been killed, badly injured or contaminated in  the course of more than a thousand accidents and at least 252  separate fires.    Two more serious incidents have occurred in the last few  weeks. On 3 September, the Health and Safety Executive ordered  the plant to shut down equipment in the A45 facility, where the  warheads are manufactured, after radiation leaked into waste  receptacles. The HSE enforcement stated that `all necessary  steps to restrict ... exposure of employees to ionising  radiation have not been taken.'    Then, on 11 November, the plant's liquid water treatment  plant was temporarily closed after high levels of radiation were  recorded in a sludge tank.    An MoD spokesman stated that official monitoring of the  pipeline was `comprehensive' and only very low levels of  radioactivity had been detected.</p>

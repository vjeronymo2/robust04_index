			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tomlinson faces opposition LABOUR and Liberal Democrats yesterday called for the channelling of extra resources into healthcare in London, signalling opposition to any early move by the government to implement the Tomlinson report on streamlining the capital's hospitals. As Downing Street confirmed the Cabinet will not discuss Sir Bernard Tomlinson's conclusions this week, the two opposition parties rejected his claim that there are too many beds in London. Labour said that up to Pounds 1bn would be needed to implement the changes proposed by Tomlinson - even before any extra spending on primary healthcare. The Liberal Democrats said that unless adequate funding to improve community and primary services was available before hospitals are closed, Londoners would be worse off than before. The response of Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, should indicate how she will act. But ministers are anxious to ensure there is sufficient consultation before decisions are implemented. Mr David Blunkett, Labour's health spokesman, said the government may avoid a 'direct approach' because of the cost and the political upheaval involved and instead try, 'to achieve bed reductions and hospital closures by stealth rather than by an honest and open frontal attack'. He added: 'There is a desperate need for a fuller assessment of the needs of London and how to face the challenges ahead'. He suggested suspending the internal market and investing in a 'dramatic improvement' in primary and community services. Londoners should be involved 'in a consensus approach to developing a more sensitive and appropriate service for the years ahead', Mr Blunkett said.</p>

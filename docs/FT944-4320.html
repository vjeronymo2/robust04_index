			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / GEC Alsthom beats ABB in Tube deal The Anglo-French company GEC Alsthom has beaten the Swedish-Swiss-owned ABB Transportation to win an Pounds 800m-Pounds 900m order to provide new trains for London Underground. The deal, to supply and maintain just over 100 new trains for the Underground's ageing Northern Line, is the first significant contract under the government's private finance initiative. The decision means work for GEC Alsthom's Metro Cammell factory in Birmingham but is a bitter blow to ABB. It said up to 600 employees at its Derby rolling stock works now faced redundancy. 'We are extremely disappointed,' Mr Bo Sodersten, managing director, said yesterday. 'A major retrenchment of the Derby factory (employing 2,500 people) is now inevitable.' In March the company said it was axing nearly 700 jobs at Derby. This was followed in September with 289 redundancies at its York plant. Yesterday's deal provides for payment for the trains and their maintenance to be spread over 20 years. This was what ABB had proposed to London Underground in 1993. The Treasury blocked the deal for several months on the grounds that it did not transfer sufficient risk to the private sector. Pressure from Conservative backbenchers, London businesses and the private finance panel finally persuaded it to give way but the government insisted in March on opening the contract to competition. ABB was completing the delivery of similar trains for the Underground's Central Line and was thought to be well placed to make a competitive bid. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, reaffirmed in last week's Budget the government's commitment to encouraging the private sector to finance projects traditionally carried out in the public sector. He expects contracts worth Pounds 5bn to be signed over the next 12 months. The order puts a value of about Pounds 400m on the new trains with the 20-year maintenance contract worth an additional Pounds 400-Pounds 500m. London Underground will pay GEC Alsthom an annual fee of Pounds 40m-Pounds 45m. The contract can be extended by a further 16 years. The deal breaks new ground because, under the recently formulated rules of the private finance initiative, it transfers the expense and risk of maintaining the new trains to the manufacturer. If GEC Alsthom fails to provide the expected level of service, London Underground can reduce its annual payments.</p>

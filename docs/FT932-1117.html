			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Oxfam condemns sealing of Gaza PALESTINIANS in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip face a mounting economic 'disaster likely to spiral out of control. . . resulting in the total disruption of people's lives', according to a British charity, writes Julian Ozanne in Gaza. In a draft report Oxfam, one of the largest UK aid agencies, says the decision by Israel to seal off the occupied territories in late March stripped tens of thousands of Gazans of their livelihood. 'The population faces the prospect of hunger and total immiseration if no action is taken,' Oxfam says. Israel has slightly eased the closure recently by granting temporary travel permits to 14,000-19,000 Gazan migrant workers to resume their jobs in Israel. When Israel closed the territories, about 45,000 migrant workers were put out of work.</p>

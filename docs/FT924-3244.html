			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Scots blockade French trawlers FISHERMEN yesterday continued their blockade of Lochinver, Sutherland, against French trawlers. Fifteen boats were lashed together across the entrance to the harbour. A large French vessel with engine trouble lay inside the blockade and eight 60-metre French boats were outside the harbour. None tried to beat the blockade. The Scottish fishermen are angry about EC rules which allow foreign boats to land haddock and cod at Lochinver when local vessels cannot because they have filled their EC fishery quotas.</p>

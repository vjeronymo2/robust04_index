Section 404(c) Procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> prohibits the discharge of pollutants, including dredged or fill material, into the waters of the United States, including wetlands, except in compliance with, among other requirements, section 404. Section 404 establishes a federal permit program to regulate the discharge of dredged or fill material subject to environmental regulations, known as the 404(b)(1) Guidelines, developed by EPA in conjunction with the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). Except for section 404(c) actions, the Corps may issue permits authorizing dredged and fill material discharges into waters and wetlands if they comply with, among other requirements, EPA's 404(b)(1) Guidelines. Section 404(c) authorizes EPA, after providing notice and opportunity for hearing, to prohibit or restrict filling waters of the United States where it determines that such use would have an unacceptable adverse effect on wildlife or other specified environmental interests. EPA can exercise 404(c) to ``veto'' a permit the Corps has decided to issue or to protect valuable aquatic areas in the absence of any specific permit decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations published in 40 CFR Part 231 establish the procedures to be followed by EPA in exercising its section 404(c) authority. Whenever the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that use of a site may have an unacceptable adverse effect on one or more of the pertinent resources, he may begin the process by notifying the Corps of Engineers, the applicant, and the landowners of the aquatic sites (if different from the applicant), that he intends to issue a proposed determination under section 404(c). Unless one of these parties persuades the Regional Administrator within 15 days that no unacceptable adverse effects will occur, the Regional Administrator publishes a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of his proposed determination, soliciting public comment and offering an opportunity for a public hearing. Today's notice represents this step in the process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following the public hearing and the close of the comment period, the Regional Administrator may either withdraw the proposed determination or prepare a recommended determination. (A decision to withdraw may be reviewed at the discretion of the Assistant Administrator for Water at EPA Headquarters.) If the Regional Administrator prepares a recommended determination, he then forwards it and the complete administrative record compiled in the Region to the Assistant Administrator for Water at EPA Headquarters. The Assistant Administrator makes the final decision affirming, modifying, or rescinding the recommended determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Project Description and History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The New Hampshire Department of Transportation (DOT) proposes to construct the Nashua-Hudson Circumferential Highway, a 13 mile limited access toll road in the City of Nashua and the Towns of Hudson, Litchfield and Merrimack in New Hampshire. A bypass highway, similar to the NHCH, has been proposed for many years. For the past decade EPA has raised environmental concerns regarding the highway. In its review of an earlier 1984 EIS, EPA recommended permit denial due to concerns about drinking water impacts at the Pennichuck Reservoir and wetland losses. In 1990 the Army Corps of Engineers required a revised EIS to focus on these issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the past three years, EPA reviewed several draft EIS documents, attended numerous meetings with DOT and the Corps, and conducted many site visits. EPA consistently advised the Corps and NHDOT that potential impacts to the Pennichuck Reservoir area, wetlands, and other water resources must be avoided and reduced. In 1992, EPA sent several letters to the Corps stating concerns regarding severity of the aquatic impacts, the need to examine other alternatives, and the potential adverse drinking water impacts. EPA alerted the Corps that these impacts could cause the highway to violate the Guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corps released the revised draft EIS in October 1992. EPA commented to the Corps in March 1993 that the proposed project violated the 404(b)(1) Guidelines and should be denied a permit and that the project was a candidate for prohibition under EPA's section 404(c) authority. The Corps issued the final EIS in October 1993. EPA restated its concerns in a November 1993 comment letter on the final EIS and identified the highway as a likely candidate for action under section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At several points in February and March 1994, the Corps indicated its intent to issue a 404 permit for the NHCH, notwithstanding EPA's objections. On March 31, 1994, EPA began the first step in the 404(c) process by notifying DOT and the Corps that it believed the filling of the wetlands and other waters may have an unacceptable adverse effect on wildlife habitat and drinking water resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA subsequently sent the notification letter to the numerous landowners in the right-of-way. The Corps, DOT and some landowners submitted letters in response to the notice that EPA was commencing the 404(c) process. EPA also met with DOT and the Corps on May 13 and 26, 1994, and with approximately 20 landowners on June 23, 1994 in Hudson, NH. Because these consultations did not convince the Regional Administrator that the highway would not cause an unacceptable impact, he is proceeding to this next step in the process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

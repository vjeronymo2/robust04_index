			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of Mobile Communications (12): No bonanza - yet / Eastern Europe IN SPITE of the huge demand for telecommunications capacity central and eastern Europe, experts do not anticipate that this will translate immediately into a mobile communications bonanza for western hardware vendors and service operators. Motorola's reading of the situation is not untypical. 'Personally I don't see that there are going to be large networks in the short term. The economies are not strong enough to carry them,' says Mr David Hughes, vice-president and general manager of the company's European cellular infrastructure division. Foreign-led mobile expansion will be constrained not only by weak economies, by also by a shortage of available radio frequencies in the region, the difficulty of repatriating profits and local unfamiliarity with western business culture. There are also hazards attached to mapping out unknown commercial terrain. 'There often isn't a body of information about the marketplace. You can't turn to multi-client studies because there aren't any,' says Mr John Carrington, Cable and Wireless director for mobile and new business. Nevertheless, the regional mobile market is perceived as having potential in the longer term and many equipment and service providers stress the importance of establishing a position on the ground floor. Motorola has already opened offices in Moscow, Budapest, Prague, Warsaw, Sofia and Bucharest. In addition to staffing these with local nationals, for two years the company has been hiring personnel throughout the region for secondment to its western European operations prior to posting them back east. 'It's more business practices we're schooling them in than engineering,' says Mr Don Burns, vice-president and general manager of Motorola's cellular subscriber division. 'We feel we'll be much more efficiently equipped then.' So far, the Scandinavian NMT 450 analogue system has made the greatest impact on eastern Europe's embryonic mobile markets. Systems of this type have been switched on or are being constructed in Croatia, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovenia, Russia and the Ukraine. NMT 450 is an older, entry-level, analogue cellular system due to be progressively phased out in some western European countries. In the east, NMT 450 network operators report that the average monthly airtime clocked up by each subscriber is around five times that in the west. This is a clear indication, says Mr Burns, that cell phones are being used in place of the inadequate wireline network rather than for their specifically mobile attributes. Since comprehensive expansion of wireline networks is a lengthy process, the NMT 450 system is projected to have a longer shelf life inside eastern Europe than in some locations outside. Moreover, the Hungarian NMT 450 operator Westel reckons that subsequent demand for mobility will take up any slack as new wireline facilities are installed. Measures are being taken to enhance the technical performance of the old cellular system. Earlier this year at an industry meeting in Helsinki, it was proposed to improve NMT 450 speech quality, lengthen the battery life of its terminals, and introduce a greater range of hand-portable telephones. Attention also focused on the need for new security measures, since individual subscriber information from one NMT 450 terminal can be 'cloned' on to another relatively easily, allowing fraudulent calls to be made at a genuine subscriber's expense. Although analogue systems are still a novelty in most eastern European countries, operators already contemplate the introduction of follow-on digital networks, the next rung on the cellular ladder. Leading the field is Hungary, which is set to invite a tender for western Europe's digital GSM after national authorities have completed their overall telecommunications reforms. Speaking in February at an IBC conference on digital cellular technology, Ms Christina Callmer, market development manager at Ericsson Radio Systems, predicted that 'there is a good chance that Hungary will be the first central European country to operate a GSM system.' Russia has also expressed an interest in licensing up to five GSM systems in major metropolitan areas, and Czechoslovakia and Poland are also potential candidates to switch on the system. GSM could be the technology which drives the region's mobile business into the big time. According to Motorola's Mr Burns, if obstacles to the export of digital cellular can be surmounted, eastern European sales of all types of cellular telephones could quickly rise to as much as 200,000 units. Industry sources value a market of this size at around Dollars 200m. The biggest stumbling blocks to the development of a large eastern European GSM market are Cocom export limitations on digital radio systems in general and restrictions on GSM's powerful message encryption capability in particular. The UK government is understood to be concerned about where this technology - dubbed A5 - ends up. One solution being investigated by a GSM committee is to produce a version of the system which has no encryption capability in its infrastructure hardware. At the same time, thought is being given to the use of a watered-down encryption technology. 'We are looking into a 'milder' algorithm fit for export,' says Mr Arne Foxman, a senior executive with Telecom Denmark and the previous chairman of the GSM committee. As this initiative continues, radio paging and private mobile radio sales are picking up in eastern Europe and a number of operators are investigating the viability of cordless and personal communication services. Tremendous local interest has been shown in new wireless solutions to the chronic shortage of conventional loop wireline connections. Some part of this stems from the fact that, while they are able to plug gaps, normal mobile cellular systems are not ideal substitutes for the fixed network. 'You can use cellular types of service but you soon run out of capacity,' says Mr Rodney Stewart, director of the UK's Quotient Communications consultancy. 'But other radio techniques can provide the capacity.' One such technique features in the Drahtlose Anschlussleitung (DAL) project under way in the provinces which made up the former East Germany. DAL uses 'immobilised' NMT 450 analogue cellular systems to provide fixed radio access into the telephone network. Instead of the laborious business of digging up streets or planting telephone poles to wire-in connections, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom gives subscriber access to the network through permanently installed radio boxes mounted on the walls of homes or business premises. DAL allows subscribers to plug in and use normal telephones or facsimile machines via a standard wall socket. A decision on whether installation of the DAL system will be extended to additional areas in Germany is expected later this month. Motorola believes that the NMT 450 technology in DAL does not make the best use of scarce radio spectrum. The company is about to mount a trial of its own analogue wireless local loop system in St Petersburg. Dubbed Will, for Wireless Local Loop, the new system can use any of the analogue cellular systems currently produced by Motorola, and can readily accommodate up to 50,000 subscribers using 5MHz of the radio spectrum. The advantages claimed for Will are that, unlike wireline, its connection cost per subscriber is independent of the distance separating the telephone in question from the nearest local exchange, and it is much quicker to implement. 'With a wireless system you can be on air earning revenue much sooner,' says Mr Hughes. 'You could easily load up a city the size of St Petersburg very quickly.' Quotient Communications' Mr Stewart was the lead author of European Commission-sponsored report on the use of digital, as opposed to analogue, wireless local loop technology in eastern Europe. He concluded that a system such as the forthcoming Digital European Cordless Telecommunications system (DECT) would often be viable with modest numbers of subscribers sharing a connection. Motorola's Mr Hughes acknowledges that digital technology has an important role to play in eastern Europe, but believes that this solution lies in the future: 'Those countries want communications now, they don't want it in three-to-five years' time.'</p>

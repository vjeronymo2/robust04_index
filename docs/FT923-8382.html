			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Penney follows Pimlott to the Takeover Panel The last time that law firm Lovell White Durrant seconded one of its partners to the City Takeover Panel, it sent Graham Pimlott. Young Pimlott returned after the statutory two year term, but he was soon on the move again, first to Kleinwort Benson and then BZW where he now runs the corporate finance team. Who knows, if Charles Penney, who has been seconded to the Panel as a secretary from September 21, plays his cards right he too might emerge as a leading player on the corporate finance stage. Penney is the same age (32) as Pimlott was when he was seconded to the Panel in 1981, and he is one of a number of bright young lawyers of roughly the same age who have worked in New York as legal assistants. Penney worked there between 1986 and 1988, overlapping with David Graham of Freshfields, whom he replaces, and Allen &amp; Overy's Mark Gearing, the other seconded secretary. As one of the Panel's eight senior executives, Penney will help referee the City code on takeovers and mergers which is designed to ensure equality of treatment and opportunity for all shareholders in takeover bids. Penney used to work under Pimlott, when the latter returned to White Durrant in October 1983, but plays down the similarities between them. 'For a start I can't thump the table as hard as he can,' jokes Penney. ***** Jeremy Pudney has been appointed a director of De Beers Consolidated Mines. He joined the company from the SH Benson advertising agency in 1962; he was appointed a director of the Diamond Trading Company in 1973 and a member of the executive committee of the central selling organisation in 1987. Now 54, and based in London, he has worked in various areas of the company and on secondment to South Africa. Having initially set up the department to handle De Beers' advertising, he is now responsible for marketing campaigns for diamond jewellery in 29 countries.</p>

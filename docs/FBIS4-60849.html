			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow 30 April TASS -- One of the topics of the  Moscow press on Saturday is celebration of the May Day in  Moscow. "By all indications, organisers of oppositional  manifestations are well aware that something more formidable  than water hose can be used against demonstrators, and without  any delay and hesitation," NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes. Although  the mayor of Moscow talks about "contact-free" methods of  dispersing manifestations, Deputy Chief of Agency of Moscow  Militia Gennadiy Feklichev says that public order in Moscow on  the May Day will be maintained by militia. A few days ago,  soldiers of interior troops were trained in methods of  dispersing demonstrations. Armoured equipment was present  during the training.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries a statement by Moscow Mayor Yuriy  Luzhkov who warns: "We are ready to cope with any changes of the  situation in the capital. Sufficient measures will be taken and  force used against those who want to clowd our holyday and  violate law."    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Patriarch  Alexey the Second of Moscow and all Russia. He said,  specifically: "I believe that those who call us to the  barricades, to separate tanks and the parliament house think in  their mundane ways."    NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA frontpages an item in which it  is  alleged that "the Interior Ministry recommended, after  conversations with personnel, to select no less than 250 men to  be sent, plain-clothed, to the site of mass actions in the  Kaluzhskaya square. The newspaper notes that the Interior  Ministry's directive suggests that these persons be inculcated  among demonstrators to provoke disturbances. The newspaper  asserts that sergeants will be paid for these services $250 and  more, and officers even as much as $500.    A number of newspapers carry interviews with Mikhail  Shmakov,  chairman of the Russian Federation of Independent Trade Unions.  In an interview granted to TRUD he said that "the problem of  peace in society equally concerns all the population of the  country. Our state pays too dearly for strife on the political  Olympus. Therefore, trade unions support the president's idea to  press for overcoming the crisis in all areas in Russia on a  basis of civic accord." In an interview with RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA  Shmakov touched upon the socioeconomic situation in work  collectives. He stressed that "the situation is desperate".  Plants are stopped. Even such giants as the Likhachev auto  works, the Volga auto works and the Gorkiy car factory may face  this calamity." In an interview to PRAVDA Shmakov stated that  trade unions at present are not rigidly oriented at any one  party. "There is no party as yet that would fully correspond to  trade union tasks. But we support parties and movements whose  programmes contain ideas similar to ours."    Regarding the meeting of the Latvian and Russian presidents  planned for today, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes that  "coordinations are being made in the hours that remain to go  before the presidential meeting. `Telephone diplomacy' on which  Russia and Latvia have been heavily relying in the recent days  is a way to resolve matters of principle but not particulars  which, in the long run, determine the climate of bilateral  relations."    The same newspaper carries an interview with Anatoliy  Kuntsevich, former chairman of the committee on conventional  problems of chemical and biological weapons at the Russian  president. He said "it is unrealistic to expect that any  subject of the Federation would voluntarily accept chemical  ammunition for destruction in their territory. Hardly any  subject of the Federation will so much as permit the  transportation of chemical ammunition over their territory.  Therefore a system for weapons elimination in areas of their  storage should be created. National unity is essential. All  other subjects of the Federation should not remain indifferent  observers as the timeframe for safe storage of chemical weapons  is running out."    The newspaper SEGODNYA touches upon the case of U.S. spy  Ames. In this connection the newspaper writes that the  possibility of the exchange of arrested agents of the U.S. and  Russia should not be ruled out. Some experts say that potential  candidatures for bargaining are former Colonel of the main  intelligence agency Baranov and former Major of the first main  agency of the KGB, now the External Intelligence Service,  Motorin.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with chief of the  Russian Armed Services Colonel-General Anatoliy Sitnov. He  notes that if the defence budget is endorsed in its present form  the Defence Ministry, repaying the debt for 1993 and for  deliveries in 1994, will have to spend whatever funds are left  on the ensurance of nuclear safety, preservation of ships and  vessels of the navy now being built or repared and to finance  work for maintenance of armements and military equipment. The  agreements on the supply of all other armaments and military  equipment commissioned by the state (over 80 per cent) will have  to be disolved, with catastrophic consequences.    The newspaper NEVSKOYE VREMYA reports that the unfavourable  ecological situation in the Gulf of Finland will be the main  cause of the spread of algae in the gulf in summer. The  situation is aggravated by the unusually large influx to the  Baltic Sea of saline waters from the north Atlantic and the lack  of oxygen in benthic layers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Incriminating Kahanism"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, on the basis of the Antiterror Act, the  government declared Kakh and Kahana Hay, two organizations that  promote Me'ir Kahana's ideology, terrorist organizations. In  lay terms, this decree "puts them outside the law;" in legal  terms, it means the government has made membership in any of  these organizations a criminal act; from the public and  political point of view, it puts them on a par with Palestinian  terrorist organizations.    No democratic state hastens to outlaw a collective entity.  Each and every article of the penal code treats people as  individuals and not as members of an organized body; liberals  have qualms about acting as oppressors. Kahanists may now argue  that the Israeli Government has betrayed its own principles.  After all, existing legislation does not prevent bringing  members of these outlawed organizations to trial and their being  treated with utmost severity if the prosecution can prove that  they broke the law.    The penal code does not punish views, but there are  situations in which even a democratic state must outlaw  organizations. In 1948, the Provisional Council of State [PCS]  issued the Antiterror Act in response to the assassination of UN  mediator Folke Bernadotte. Based on the Law and Administrative  Ordinance, laws enacted by the PCS were called "acts" to  highlight the fact that the legislative body was a provisional  entity created in the aftermath of a revolutionary feat (the  declaration of the state upon the conclusion of the British  mandate). The PCS decided to create the legal tools with which  it hoped to get rid of the Stern Gang, from whose ranks the  assassin came, because it was feared that the group would  generate more assassins whose crimes might have seriously harmed  the state.    The government's actions yesterday followed the line of the  1948 events. Barukh Goldstein was a Kahanist. So, who is to  tell that other assassins will not emerge from the same  environment? Hence, qualms notwithstanding, preventing any type  of organized activities by people who might infer practical  conclusions from their political views (similar to the  conclusion reached by the assassin at the Cave of the  Patriarchs) is right.    One of these people, Barukh Marzel, has already announced  that he and his friends will go underground and continue doing  as they please. There is no certainty that the security forces  will succeed in preventing other manifestations of anti-Arab  violence, which could be perpetrated by people who have never  been members of any Kahanist organization.    Even if the effectiveness of outlawing Kakh and Kahana Hay  is  doubtful, one cannot dismiss the value of the warning issued by  the government yesterday. In his address to the Knesset,  Yitzhaq Rabin drew a distinction between Barukh Goldstein and  his supporters and the Jewish public at large. The outlawing of  these organizations is meant to warn people against joining or  supporting them, as the government trusts the psychological  impact of its decision.    Nevertheless, it would be wrong for Rabin and other cabinet  ministers to think that they completed their job with this  anti-Kahanist move. In addition, they must remove the Jews from  Hebron, and they cannot make do with relocating them to Qiryat  Arba'. The massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs also tainted  Gush Emunim and the entire settler community. Ostracizing Kakh  and Kahana Hay and getting rid of the Jewish presence in Hebron  are not enough to restart the peace process.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by PAD: "`S' on Strikes"] </F>   [Text] On Thursday [24 February] "Solidarity" will  organize at least two-hour-long strikes in the area of the Lower  Silesian, Western, and Eastern District Directorate of State  Railroads. Strike readiness has been reported by 18 regions and  branches of the trade union. Similar action in [Upper] Silesia  and in the energy-fuel industry is to be expected after 1 March.    Strikes of railroads workers, most probably between 0500  [0400 GMT] and 0700 [0600 GMT], will be coordinated by the  Protest Action Headquarters. "The railroads workers have their  own demands; however, this is also the protest of the entire  trade union due to the fact that the government has not  responded to our demands," said "Solidarity" Spokesman Piotr  Zak. "The Presidium of the National Committee [KK] has given  the government until 1 March to guarantee the implementation of  the demands. Following this date, escalation of strikes should  be expected," said Zak. On Tuesday [22 February], after many  hours of discussions, the KK Presidium decided not to reveal the  strike scenario. Zak merely said that preparations are under  way for a major action. "I will not call this a nationwide  strike; however, the readiness to stage a strike very quickly  has been reported by seven branches and 11 regions," revealed  the union's spokesman. KK Secretary Stanislaw Alot believes  that the problem is not whether to strike, but when to strike.  "Our protest is supposed to force a change in the 1994 budget  bill," recalls Alot. Other demands of the union are: curbing  the energy price increase, giving property to citizens, passing  a law on collective agreements by the Sejm, respecting the  principle of representativeness of the organizations of  employees and employers, changing the fiscal policy to a policy  favoring families, abandoning the concept of "a different tax on  excessive wage increases" [popiwek]. "Solidarity" also demands  that all the negotiated decisions in the "Pact on Enterprise" be  implemented.    "The statements of some representatives of the government  coalition suggest that the Sejm may adopt the budget of the  state before 7 March. If this should happen, we will organize  firm action earlier," stated Alot.    Despite earlier statements, "Solidarity" authorities did not  set the date of the strike in Silesia and in the fuel-energy  industry. The representatives of the latter reported strike  readiness on 7 March. Relevant decisions will have been made by  the end of February.    Observers emphasize that the 24 February strikes of the  railroads workers will be a test for rank-and-file unionists and  only after the strikes will the "Solidarity" authorities be able  to evaluate the force that they can count on.    According to unofficial sources, in recent days "Solidarity"  has received several informal offers of talks with high-ranking  representatives of the Belveder.</p>

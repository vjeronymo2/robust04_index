			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ejaz Hussain] </F>   [Text] If you want peace, prepare for war. Generations  after generations in nations after nations, leaders have  faithfully followed the ancient Roman maxim. Over the  centuries, society's ability to wage war has become an  institutionalized permanent integer with large resources devoted  to armies. Today scores of countries are engaged in building  the nuclear missile empires. Their lust for acquiring weapons of  mutual assured destruction is rapidly increasing and despite  incessant calls for shrinkage in lethal weapons, they are as  diehard as they were ever. In this deadly arms race, not only  the developed and advanced first world countries are contenders,  but some poor countries from third world [word indistinct] are  equally active participants.    India, for example, with a population of 900 million people,  of whom over 50 percent are homeless, jobless and foodless, is  spending more than four percent of its GNP [Gross National  Product] on defense. This time for the year 1994-95, India  raised its defense budget from rupees 192 billion to rupees 230  billion. It means straightaway 20 percent increase, which is  unprecedented for any country in peace time. When this budget  was being announced by the Indian finance minister, Mr. Manmohan  Singh, the pressmen, who were attending the budget session, were  whispering about the Indian nuclear program and missile  technology.    As a proof to that India has accelerated its efforts to  build  yet another intercontinental ballistic missile named Surya  [Sun], which is nearing its final test at Orissa. According to  the latest information, Indian defense scientists are busy day  and night to perform an early testing of Surya. The lethal  missile will have a range of 12,000 km, but later on, the  scientists say that its range will be enhanced to 20,000 km.  The new Indian missile will not only be a constant threat to  the Asian region, but it would have even Washington well within  the total devastation precision limit of New Delhi, which means  that it will be much more formidable than the Agni-3, which was  tested in February this year despite mounting apprehensive  feelings of the defense analysts of Pentagon and Pall Mall. It  will be five times heavier than Prithvi and 10 times powerful in  destructiveness. According to reports, India will spend over  200 million rupees on Surya's first test which will be performed  in the mid of 1995.    With Trishul, Indira, Agni, Prithvi and now Surya, India has  emerged as an aggressor in the world. It neither accepts words  of advice from the International Atomic Energy Agency, nor peace  instructions of Carnegie Endowment For International Peace. It  has no other peaceful pursuits either. It has its own pros and  cons if it makes economic blockade of Nepal or bullies Maldives,  interferes with internal affairs of Sri Lanka or intimidates  Bangladesh, or kills tens of thousands of innocent Kashmiris, or  for that matter holds Pakistan responsible for heat wave in  Bombay. All it considers are very just and appropriate actions.  How cynical it is to visualize that Russia and the United  States, the two inveterate super rivals, are destroying their  stockpiles of dangerous weapons as a service to international  peace, but India still is building up its military empire beyond  limits. Aggression against whom? Military build up against  whom? Lethal weapons and deadly arsenals against whom? India  still has not learned a lesson from Russia. It is a matter of  great concern for the United States and the United Nations who  are devoted to make the entire world nuclear free. So, such an  extraordinary increase in stockpiles of deadly weapons is the  blatant violation of the principles of global peace.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ernst Uhrlau, president of the Hamburg Land </F> Office for the Protection of the Constitution, by Thomas Lillig;  place and date not given: "Neo-Nazis as `Watchdogs' of the  `Capitalist-Imperialist' System"]    [Text] [Lillig] Mr. Uhrlau, from which side in the  left-wing extremist scene does the greatest danger emanate at  the moment?    [Uhrlau] It depends on how you define danger. If you ask  about a danger to the liberal democratic basic system, then none  of the wide-branching groups are a danger because they are so  negligible. If you look at the matter from the viewpoint of  militant behavior -- that is, you include public security and  order to a great extent -- then the autonomous groups naturally  continue to be important for the FRG's security system. The  respective activities of the autonomous groups are related to  issues and related to specific occasions, however, with all the  difficulties that are linked with these statements. If there  are no issues, activities decline. This also weakens the  structure. This means that the readiness for action always  depends on specific issues.    [Lillig] Such a topic is "antifascism." How do you assess  the struggle of "left against right?"    [Uhrlau] First, you have to proceed from the premise that  the so-called militant antifascist struggle of the 1970's and  1980's has an ideological foundation in the fact that "fascism"  is inseparably linked with "capitalism" and that neo-Nazis and  right-wing extremist parties that are not neo-Nazi parties are  "henchmen" and "watchdogs" of the capitalist-imperialist system.  And thus, for left-wing extremists, an attack on right-wing  extremists is also a contribution to fighting against the system.    This conflict took place by means of publications, publicly,  and also through militant actions. And within the framework of  this so-called antifascist militant struggle there were arson  attacks, bomb attacks, bodily injury, and material damage in the  1980's -- a lot of material damage to cars --they were  "flattened," as the scene said -- or material damage to the  apartments of known right-wing extremists. The basis was the  statement: "Hit the fascists where you meet them!" -- including  fliers that were like wanted posters. And this was the situation  in particular in the 1980's, a time when right-wing extremism  did not play such a great role as in the 1990's.    This model has been taken over by the right-wing extremists  as of 1992. The conflict of "right against left" has, however,  not been able to develop this systematic action of the left-wing  extremists or at least not fully develop it. One can see an  east-west difference in the conflict between "right/left" and  "left/right." In the west, there is a stronger conflict of "left  against right" and in the east a stronger conflict of "right  against left," which can be explained against the background of  the different regional distribution of the militant left-wing  extremist and right-wing extremist scene.    [Lillig] Well, one could assume that as long as they are  busy with each other, they are not a danger to democracy.    [Uhrlau] These acts of violence are an expression of a basic  rejection of the system. For left-wing extremism, neo-Nazis or  right-wing extremist parties and their members are something  that must be attacked within the framework of the struggle  against the system in order to weaken the system, to restrict  fascism, which is growing stronger from their point of view:  active participation, since the state cannot be expected to  purposefully contain the right-wing extremists because of its  nature as an "accomplice."    For the right-wing extremists, including the skinheads, it  also has something to do with the changed self-confidence, with  the changed strength of these groups. This is then partly  headed by the slogan "against antinational forces" to find  broader space for their own activities and also space for their  claim about themselves. All this has a very elementary effect  on the self-understanding of our democracy, namely that no one  must use violent means to enforce his political positions. In  this respect, the conflict between the two groups is, at the  same time, also an attack on essential elements of our  democratic system.    [Lillig] Let us return to the "mobilization" in the  extremist struggle against each other: One could read In a news  magazine that "leftist" and "rightists" are even shooting at  each other. Is it to be expected that the militant "left/right  struggle" will continue to amplify itself?    [Uhrlau] These conflicts have never been distinguished by  particular peacefulness. In justifying the militant "antifascist  struggle," individual persons have certainly explained why, in a  conflict with neo-Nazis, one has to condone the fact that one  may have "to cross the Wupper" [get killed]. This is not the  goal, but it if happens the left-wing extremists do not grieve,  either. It is not an intention, but it is a result that is  condoned.    In the actions of "right against left," "left" need not  necessarily mean "left-wing extremist." From the viewpoint of  the "rightists," anyone who is not a supporter of national  concepts and policy can be a "tick." This can be someone who  refuses to say that Adolf Hitler is the greatest statesman of  all times. And as a result of this initially verbal conflict,  he will then be beaten and may be killed.    This very brutal act, which is not controlled by a relation  between the goal and the means used to achieve it, certainly  influences the discussion among autonomous groups in relatiom to  the rightists. They say that the rightists are contemptuous of  people and hurt them. And then, in their view, one does not  need a political argument, but "antifascist resistance" is  "violent resistance."    [Lillig] A completely different question: What do you say  to the accusation that the state protects the "rightists" while  acting against the "leftists" with excessive toughness? The  accusation is, for instance, raised during "leftist"  demonstrations against "rightist" party events, when the police  protects the party followers against those who protest.    [Uhrlau] The state protect the law. A party that holds a  party congress -- which it is obligated to do, by party law -- a  party congress that includes the naming of candidates or an  election rally of a right-wing extremist party that runs for  elections -- these events must be held, because if the state  cannot enforce the right to the freedom of association, this  would mean that any claim to a right would be arbitrary.    This does not mean that the state accepts and must accept  everything regarding the activities of rightist organizations  and parties. For instance: In the election campaign in  Hamburg, the "National List" tried with the most varied excuses  to hold demonstrations, which were rejected by the  administrative courts in both first and second instances. Thus,  there were no demonstrations. It was assumed that such  demonstrations would lead to crimes or would make it impossible  to guarantee security and order. There were comprehensive bans  on demonstrations all over the country.    Quite another question is whether and where the right-wing  extremists managed to get around extensive police barriers, also  by using state-of-the-art communications technology, to turn up  briefly but spectacularly in a completely different place and  only with a fraction of those who were wiling to demonstrate.  This was the case in Fulda and in Rudolstadt in 1992. This  does not mean that the state let the "rightists" do what they  want and those who oppose right-wing extremism are pushed away  by the police. The available instruments are used very  consistently against right-wing extremism.    [Lillig] Why does the state then permit organizations that  are hostile to the constitution to act at all? Why does it give  them -- event though unintentionally and unplanned -- a forum  instead of banning them?    [Uhrlau] In a democracy, bans are always the last resort of  state action because the instrument that is appropriate for a  democracy is political argument. And only when certain  developments and phenomena are no longer acceptable, when the  advantages of a ban are greater for the community than the  disadvantages and the restrictions on political activities, only  then do bans make any sense. Regarding the neo-Nazi  organizations -- and this also applies to two parties, for which  an application for a ban has been made -- the point was to show  that the acceptable threshold had been crossed, also in view of  the very young people who were interested.    [Lillig] What is the strategy of left-wing extremist forces  to affect society? How do they exert their influence, what are  their topics, how do they communicate with each other?    [Uhrlau] In contrast to the 1970's, the topics are no longer  large global issues. The issues are more regional and local,  relating more directly to experiences so that more people get  involved in the issues -- issues such as antifascism, the  improvement of city districts, or the struggle for peace.    The spreading of one's own position takes place via  publications of the scene. They are very varied, very colorful,  have rather small print runs, and for the authors these  publications are their entire world. Then there is also the  possibility to call attention to a certain topic by  demonstrative actions, for instance by carrying out attacks or  staging demonstrations. This is how the issues get into the  press. When you think of Berlin, for instance, this setting  fire to luxury cars, this destruction of shops for so-called  prosperous people.    [Lillig] Is there an international network in left-wing  extremism?    [Uhrlau] Given the left-wing extremism's own claim, it must  be internationalist. What existed in the past within the  framework of bipolarity, with a firm ideological center in  Moscow, a minor center in Beijing, and perhaps another one in  Tirana, and then a revolutionary center some place in Latin  America for other groups -- this is largely a thing of the past.  However, a real network, while preserving independence and a  uniting for actions, did not exist in this form. If there is  dependence, you do not have a network.    In many demonstrations -- also of the autonomous science,  which also has its internationalist struggle -- we have  repeatedly had representatives of other countries, also as  speakers, but these have been ties that were always very much  related to a specific project, a specific object, and specific  persons. When the people from Hamburg had contacts with  Copenhagen, these were contacts at the level of squatters. For  that there was solidarity, togetherness, perhaps also joint  action at international economic summits or EC summits, or  whatever. But we cannot see this as an expression of a common  strategy, of common action.    [Lillig] In conclusion, one question about Constitutional  Protection: Is it sufficient what Constitutional Protection is  doing to combat extremism?    [Uhrlau] Clearly yes. Our instruments, both in terms of  laws and personnel, are basically sufficient.    [Lillig] Constitutional Protection has been variously  criticized and its efficiently in combating extremism has been  called into question. It has been said that the activists of  the authorities are too restricted to collecting and evaluating  information -- but they are prohibited from acting.    [Uhrlau] Our assignment -- and you described that correctly  -- is to collect and evaluate information. We are, therefore,  an instrument of analysis. We are not an executive authority.  And our activities are largely related to the nonmilitant area.  As an instrument of analysis we are not the ones who make  arrests; we are not permitted to do that; there is the clear  command of separation of powers. However, with the information  we gather and the analysis we make, we can enable others to act  -- to prevent acts of violent and riots.    We are not an instrument to prohibit thinking. It is the  assignment of the Constitutional Protection authorities -- in  particular as a part of a democracy that can defend itself -- to  provide the governments with information and impressions about  forces that operate against the liberal democratic basic system.  Trying to link that to issues of criminal prosecution bypasses  the actual task of Constitutional Protection.</p>

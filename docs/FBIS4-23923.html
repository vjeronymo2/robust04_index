			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By David Breier] </F>   [Text] Cape Town -- The ANC wants to increase the number of  parliamentary select committees amid accusations that it is  creating the illusion that hundreds of bored backbenchers are  gainfully occupied. Parliamentary sources confirm the ANC wants  to set up 26 select committees in the National Assembly -- one  for each portfolio in the Cabinet.    But National Party [NP] chief whip Fanus Schoeman says the  NP  believes 19 select committees will be sufficient as various  portfolios can be grouped -- such as water affairs, forestry and  agriculture.    He says experience has shown that some portfolios produce  only one or two Bills a year and do not justify a select  committee of their own. Parliamentary officials confirm that  the number of select committees has not yet been finalised.    Some MPs say the ANC's move to increase the number of select  committees is to ensure that all the members of its massive  caucus belong to a committee to give them some work to do. The  ANC has 252 National Assembly members and 60 senators.    By comparison the NP, which has the next biggest caucus, has  far fewer MPs -- meaning that they will be relatively busier  with committee work. The NP has 82 MPs and 17 senators.    The smaller parties will have their work cut out keeping up  with committee work, with MPs having to sit on several  committees.    The Inkatha Freedom Party has 43 Assembly seats and five  senators, the Democracy Party has seven Assembly members and  three senators while the Pan Africanist Congress has just five  Assembly MPs and the African Christian Democratic Party two MPs.    Taking into account the growing backlash against the huge  salaries being paid to politicians -- backbenchers are to earn  R193,000 [rand] a year -- any sign that MPs are idle is bound to  increase public anger.    Since the abolition of the constituency system in favour of  proportional representation, MPs are no longer directly  responsible for a specific seat. This has created concern that  many ANC backbenchers in particular are going to be grossly  overpaid and underworked.    However, both the Nats and the ANC are setting up structures  to make MPs responsible for specific areas to increase their  workload.    Schoeman says Nat MPs will be even busier than in the past  as  the party structure will keep a watch on the amount of work they  do, whereas in the past MPs could "bury themselves" in their  constituencies without anyone really knowing how much work they  did.    There have been calls on Cabinet Ministers to use  under-employed MPs more constructively instead of employing  outsiders at taxpayers' expense. In one case, former CAPE TIMES  editor Tony Heard is to be appointed senior adviser to Water  Affairs and Forestry Minister Kader Asmal. An MP could to the  job without further pay. DP Natal Senator Errol Moorcroft  predicts that many backbenchers from the biggest parties will be  "bored with life" as they will have little to do. On the other  hand, MPs from smaller parties such as the DP will be inundated  with work, he says.    MPs now have to pay for their own expenses -- even stamps --  which will cut the effective pay of the busier MPs from the  smaller parties, while those from the bigger parties with a  smaller workload will increase their "profit" margins.    Up-country MPs complain that their salaries are justified by  the expense of running a second household in Cape Town. As long  as Parliament remains in Cape Town, the best-off MPs will be the  Cape ones who have no need for a second home. Should Parliament  move to Pretoria, it will be the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging] MPs who will coin it.</p>

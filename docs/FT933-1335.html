			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: No cheer at Guinness Since whisky drinkers tend to be older people, it starts to look as though they will all be dead before they get round to trading up again. Yesterday's interim figures from Guinness were another case of hope deferred, this time till 1995. First half spirits profits fell 10 per cent at constant exchange rates, and, while whisky sales rose 2 per cent by volume, luxury brands showed a fall of 5 per cent. The longer Guinness continues to produce such disappointing results, the more insistent is the question of whether a strategy based on pushing customers towards ever more expensive brands is fundamentally flawed. It is not much consolation that all the volume fall in luxury brands was due to specific problems in Thailand, Mexico and Brazil. These are just the sort of emerging markets tailor-made for trading up. Having set so much store by brand enhancement, though, Guinness cannot afford to admit to doubt. It may be right that economic recovery will eventually revive demand for high-priced spirits, but the faint flicker of a revival in the US is hardly yet conclusive evidence. One problem is that high stocks will keep the base price for standard whiskies depressed. That will limit Guinness' ability to raise prices on its premium products. At best, it will be years before the Guinness promise feeds through to profits growth. At worst, the company faces the tricky task of shifting from high margin exclusive brands to a more volume-driven approach. Guinness already seems to be hedging its bets by stepping up its marketing effort on neglected cheaper brands. Its strong cash flow and dividend cover provide some reassurance, but, even at last night's close of 427p, a yield of 3.5 per cent is hardly attractive.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Divide grows on France's right Several senior members of France's Gaullist RPR party are set to boycott today's special party meeting called to endorse the candidacy of Mr Jacques Chirac for next spring's presidential election. The move highlights the widening divisions within France's political right, splitting support between Mr Chirac and his Gaullist rival Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, who is an an undeclared presidential candidate. Mr Philippe Seguin, the president of the National Assembly, and Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, have written to Mr Chirac criticising his decision to seek endorsement of his candidacy following last week's announcement that he would run for the French presidency. 'We want to guarantee the unity of our movement. The meeting and the endorsement is incompatible with the spirit of our institutions,' they said. Mr Seguin said he would not attend the meeting, while Mr Pasqua is in Saudi Arabia on an official visit. Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, government spokesman and an ally of Mr Balladur, has also said he will not be present. The prime minister, who is expected to announce his candidacy for the presidential elections at the beginning of next year, is spending the weekend at his holiday home in Chamonix. The deepening divisions on the political right have played into the hands of Mr Jacques Delors, the Socialist President of the European Commission, who is weighing a bid for the French presidency. A poll published yesterday in the daily Le Parisien has Mr Delors moving ahead of Mr Balladur with an approval rating of 50 per cent. Mr Balladur's approval rating fell by 6 points to 45 per cent, ahead of Mr Chirac, who stands at 35 per cent. The poll is the latest to show a weakening of support for Mr Balladur, whose government has been shaken by a series of corruption scandals prompting the resignation of two ministers since July. Mr Michel Roussin, the co-operation minister, who is responsible for overseas aid, has also been linked to a corruption investigation. French press reports claim that he may step down within the next few days in response to allegations that he was connected to a scheme to raise illicit funds for the RPR party. Mr Roussin has denied any wrongdoing. Mr Sarkozy said last week that Mr Roussin was 'still a minister', but added that any minister involved in a corruption investigation would have to resign.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / IMF criticism jolts Stockholm SWEDEN'S centre-right government was jolted yesterday by a leaked report from the International Monetary Fund which said its programme to cut the country's huge budget deficit was inadequate. Publication of the report in a daily newspaper provoked a slide in the value of the Swedish krona and a rise in interest rates. The IMF report said it would prefer to see savings of SKr20bn (Pounds 1.65bn) a year, double the government's current plan to trim SKr10bn in spending. The budget deficit stands at 16.5 per cent of gross national product, a level which the report said 'dwarfs those in other industrial countries and provokes doubts about Sweden's commitment to low inflation'. The fund said its proposals would bring the budget deficit down to zero in 1998, compared with the government's target of 4.3 per cent. Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, defended her policies, saying they provided 'the best balance' for Sweden, given the need for a return to growth next year after a three-year period of recession. She pointed out that most domestic political pressure was for fewer cuts, not more. Nevertheless, markets reacted badly to the report of the IMF comments. The krona slipped sharply despite intervention by the central bank. On the foreign exchange market the D-Mark rose to Skr4.88, up eight ore since late Wednesday, then eased to Skr4.8680/30.</p>

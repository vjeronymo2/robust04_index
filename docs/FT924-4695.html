			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Few mourn as USM heads for scrapyard - Benefits of a full market listing outweigh doubts for smaller companies There will be few mourners for the Unlisted Securities Market, assuming the Stock Exchange decides to dismantle it following the consultative paper due out at the end of this year. 'The body has been around for a while,' says Mr John Houlihan, of Hoare Govett's small companies team. 'Today's news is just a recognition that we have to go to the burial service.' Mr Houlihan's views appear to be shared by many small company observers and executives. 'Any company worth its salt has tended to go for a full listing as soon as possible,' says Mr Lawrence Marsh, an analyst at the small company specialists, Winterflood. However, there might be a few reasons to think twice about merely thrusting smaller companies from the USM onto the main market. 'The USM provided a universe where people could easily look to invest in smaller companies,' says Mr Marsh. 'The Stock Exchange could address that issue better.' Some companies also fear being swamped in their individual sectors. 'On the USM, although small, we were able to stand out as a company going forward,' says Mr Ashley Martin, group financial controller of the media buying group, CIA. 'There is a danger that we could get lost in the bigger crowd,' he adds. For those who have made the transition recently, there is no doubt that a full listing has offered greater benefits. For example, Metal Bulletin, one of the first to join the USM in the early 1980s, has not looked back since moving to the main market in July. 'Going round the City one always had the feeling that being USM you were second class,' says Mr Tom Hempenstall, Metal Bulletin's chief executive. 'You were not taken as seriously as you were in the 1980s.' That has all changed since leaving the USM. In fact, Metal Bulletin's market value has gone up by 10 per cent since joining the main market - its share price rising from 214p to 238p in that period - although Mr Hempenstall is reluctant to attribute that increase merely to the move. The transition from the USM to the main market is expected to be almost painless, with most of the older USM companies already meeting many of the requirements for a full listing. Nor is cost expected to be a barrier. In recent years, the cost differential between coming to the USM as opposed to the main market has virtually disappeared. Metal Bulletin paid Pounds 50,000 to make its move. Furthermore, adoption of a European Community directive in the autumn will mean those companies moving from a junior to a main market will only have to file abridged listing particulars. This will cut the costs even more. The Stock Exchange is also likely to give between one and two years to make the transition. This will allow a company to make the move when financial details will already have been prepared anyway - for example, when proposing an acquisition or publishing annual results. It is unlikely that many USM-quoted companies will choose not to move to a full stock market listing. If anything, some have put off the transition out of a vague loyalty to the market which gave them their start. 'We are very happy with the move,' says Mr Hempenstall. 'We are just sorry we did not do it earlier.'</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRANSTON TO SEEK RELIEF FOR LINCOLN BONDHOLDERS  </P> <P> Sen. Alan Cranston said Monday he will introduce legislation, perhaps as early  as today, to allow bondholders hurt by the collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp;  Loan and its parent firm to sue the federal government for negligence in  approving the sale of the bonds.  </P> <P> The California Democrat, whose political career has been jeopardized by the  Lincoln Savings scandal, also released a copy of a letter he sent to the  Justice Department last week asking for help in letting bondholders seek relief  from the government.  </P> <P> Cranston's proposed bill is aimed at helping some 22,000 small investors  recover nearly $200 million in debt securities in Lincoln's parent, American  Continental Corp. The investors are mostly elderly people who bought their  bonds at Lincoln's 29 Southern California branches. Many mistakenly thought the  bonds were insured by the federal government.  </P> <P> "What has happened to these bondholders is one of the most tragic events that  have occurred during the time that I have been in the Senate," Cranston said.  "Many of them are now bereft of all their resources. They can't pay their rent.  They can't pay for decent food. They can't even heat their homes."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in a separate development in Washington, House Banking Committee  Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said Monday that the committee will decide  today whether to subpoena junk bond financier Michael Milken as part of the  continuing investigation of Lincoln and other failed thrifts.  </P> <P> Cranston's efforts to aid the bondholders comes at a time when polls show that  his popularity is at an all-time low because of his involvement in the Lincoln  debacle. Bondholders in particular have blamed Cranston and four other senators  for intervening with regulators in 1987 during a long audit of the Irvine-based  S&amp;L's financial condition.  </P> <P> Had regulators taken action against Lincoln then, they maintain, most of them  would not now be holding worthless bonds. Instead, regulators seized Lincoln  last April 14, a day after American Continental filed for bankruptcy  protection. The S&amp;L failure may become the costliest ever, with a  $2-billion bill for taxpayers.  </P> <P> In announcing his proposal Monday, Cranston said that documents he received  from the General Accounting Office provide "clear evidence" of negligence on  the part of federal thrift regulators and the Securities and Exchange  Commission in approving the bonds for sale and in monitoring how the company  sold the bonds. He earlier had asked the GAO to determine if taxpayers were  liable for the bondholder's losses.  </P> <P> Cranston's bill would waive sovereign immunity, which precludes most suits  against the federal government. In the Lincoln case, it would allow bondholders  to look to the government for any losses they don't recover in pending  litigation against American Continental executives, including its controversial  chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr., and the lawyers and accountants who advised  them.  </P> <P> In his letter to Atty. Gen. Richard Thornburgh, Cranston asked the Justice  Department to waive the immunity provision, which would allow bondholder suits  to be filed more quickly. He also asked Thornburgh to apply whatever funds the  government recovers in civil judgments or possible criminal action to  bondholders first.  </P> <P> Cranston's office said Congress or the attorney general grants waivers in a  dozen or more egregious cases every year.  </P> <P> Bondholders and their lawyers, who have been highly critical of Cranston in the  past, were generally appreciative of his help.  </P> <P> "I believe Sen. Cranston is sincere," said Shirley Lampel, who met with the  senator for more than an hour in her home last Thursday. "The idea may be a  good one and I'm happy to hear it, but I just don't know if it's possible to  get done," she said.  </P> <P> Lawyers for bondholders also welcomed Cranston's proposal, Bondholder lawyer  Ronald Rus of Orange called it a "backstop" proposal that would cover whatever  losses remain after pending litigation is completed.  </P> <P> "There are professionals as well as the Keating group who all bear legal  responsibility for losses," said William Lerach, a San Diego bondholders'  lawyer. "Many of them have significant insurance, and it's in everybody's  interest to go after that and exhaust that before we ask the taxpayers to pay."  </P> <P> Another lawyer, Richard Greenfield of Philadelphia, said Cranston's suggestion  was "very constructive and will receive serious consideration in the Senate."  But, he said, "a number of people are going to look at Sen. Cranston's  suggestion as self-protective."  </P> <P> Cranston, the Senate majority whip, is one of five senators under investigation  by the Senate Ethics Committee over their 1987 intervention with regulators on  behalf of Lincoln and American Continental. Keating had raised more than $1.3  million for the senators' campaigns and their causes. Cranston got the biggest  share, with more than $39,000 in campaign contributions and $850,000 in  donations to three nonpartisan voter registration groups he supported.  </P> <P> Cranston cited testimony before the House Banking Committee, which has been  looking into Lincoln's collapse, to show that federal regulators themselves  believe they hold "primary responsibility" for approving American Continental's  debt securities, excluding approvals from any other agencies under securities  laws.  </P> <P> In Washington, Gonzalez said that the committee would meet today to conduct  hearings on the operation of the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency formed last  August to oversee the restructuring of the thrift industry.  </P> <P> He also said the committee would consider whether to subpoena Milken and two  other individuals connected to Lincoln. Milken, who made a fortune selling junk  bonds for corporate takeovers, is under indictment for securities fraud and  insider trading.  </P> <P> Gonzalez said the appearance of Milken would signal a new phase in the  investigation of thrift failures and "will concentrate on the extent to which  trading in junk bonds and subordinated debt contributed to the collapse of  Lincoln.  </P></p>

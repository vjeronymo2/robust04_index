			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'OUR MICHAEL' FEINSTEIN SERENADES JEWISH HOME RESIDENTS  </P> <P> Cabaret-singer Michael Feinstein was at the piano Wednesday night crooning the  romantic Irving Berlin melody "Always." The lights were dim. The audience  huddled around tables, holding drinks, some wistfully humming along.  </P> <P> It seemed like a typical scene for Feinstein, the cabaret star who has  performed at San Francisco's Plush Room and the Algonquin in New York, in  addition to the Hollywood Bowl, the White House and Buckingham Palace.  </P> <P> But this was no regular nightclub. The white-haired members of the 200-plus  audience -- average age 75 -- sat at big round tables on a linoleum floor  drinking water out of Styrofoam cups. This was the dining hall at the Jewish  Home for the Aging's Victory Village residence in Reseda, decorated with  streamers and signs saying "Welcome Back Michael."  </P> <P> It was here that Feinstein got his start 13 years ago, performing weekly as a  20-year-old volunteer. He last played there more than eight years ago.  </P> <P> "It's good to be back," he said with emotion in an interview after the hourlong  performance. "It's a life-affirming experience for me, to come back here and  see these older people so alive and vital."  </P> <P> Feinstein admitted that the feeling in the room was different from a cabaret or  nightclub. "It's rare to get a feeling of unconditional love at a nightclub,"  he said.  </P> <P> The residents of the private retirement home love "their Michael," especially  those who remember the skinny kid in sneakers who used to played for them.  </P> <P> Feinstein's core fan club, three women sitting together during the show, ogled  him. "You're my Michael," Rose Tammer, 86, called out. "He belongs to all of  us. We're all his grandmothers," corrected Rae Cohen, also 86. Cohen, who takes  18 pills a day for a heart condition, said, "It's amazing what Michael can do  for a person like me."  </P> <P> "Did you see? He kissed me," Tammer said. "I tell people he's my boyfriend. I  wish he would sing to me as his sweetheart."  </P> <P> Her wish was granted. While Feinstein sang "Makin' Whoopee," he glanced over at  the three with an impish grin. They blushed and giggled like schoolgirls.  </P> <P> Ruth Shapiro, 82, the third of the die-hard Feinstein fans, glowed. "It's a  blessing he's able to come back to us," she says.  </P> <P> Feinstein said it was unique to play to a crowd so familiar with his repertoire  of tunes from the '20s, '30s and '40s. "They can appreciate the songs more.  This music sparks strong memories for them; something special and different  happens when I play it here.  </P> <P> "And I better not make a mistake, because they know all the words," he added.  </P> <P> Feinstein said that his music is the best way for him to communicate with the  elderly. "It helps me to feel a strong connection with these people."  </P> <P> Feinstein started playing at the home when his family moved to Canoga Park from  Columbus, Ohio. In Ohio, Feinstein had played at the home where his grandmother  lived. "Playing in a nursing home became a habit for me," he added. "It was  great to see people, who were often quiet and withdrawn, come back to life."  </P> <P> When he played at the Jewish Home for the Aging regularly, he would perform for  not just for the ambulatory patients but for the seriously ill as well. "That  was the most gratifying for me. People who could barely talk would open their  mouths and start singing."  </P> <P> Walter Schnell, 85, president of the Victory Village residents, determined to  have Feinstein return for a concert. Schnell called Feinstein's office at least  twice a week for almost two years. "When his secretary called to say he could  play here again, I was overjoyed," said Schnell.  </P> <P> Feinstein said he won't wait another eight years for his next visit: "I've been  away for too long."  </P></p>

Repchinskiy, deputy chairman of the </F> Ukrainian Culture Society and chief editor of the newspaper  PROSVITA, by Marina Bazhutina; place and date not given:  "'People Can Decide for Themselves'"]    [Text] Ukrainians are second in our republic in terms  of size of population. Questions of the coming elections cannot,  naturally, avoid them and they disturb them no less than others.    It was in this connection that a correspondent of  NEZAVISIMAYA MOLDOVA met with Mikhail Nikolayevich Repchinskiy,  deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Culture Society, chief editor  of the newspaper PROSVITA and, naturally, citizen of the  Republic of Moldova.    [Bazhutina] Mr. Repchinskiy, Moldova is preparing to elect a  new parliament. Ukrainians, who constitute approximately 15  percent of the republic's electorate, are thus of considerable  interest to the parties laying claim to power. But you will  agree that the rich palette of political programs, with at times  barely discernible differences between them, creates a certain  difficulty for the ordinary voter: for whom to show preference.  So for whom will Ukrainians vote?    [Repchinskiy] The society, as a small part of the body of  Ukrainians of Moldova, has never claimed to reflect the common  opinion of all its fellow countrymen. At the same time, on the  other hand, we are citizens, and each of us has personal  political predilections and reference points, which in  individual instances are focused ideologically: some cleave to  communist, some to democratic convictions. I am citing  polar-opposite views, let us say, here.    Imposing on Ukrainians in advance some one political scheme  common to all is simply unintelligent, therefore, for there is a  considerable danger here that one could lapse into the sin of  provoking a split in the community. And there are already  sufficient splits in Moldova. We operate differently. We are  familiarizing ourselves with the political programs of the  various parties and conferring with their leaders, particularly  on problems concerning a guarantee of economic and political  liberties and the rights of the national minorities. In a word,  conclusions and some advice for Ukrainians will be drawn only on  the basis of a thorough study of all the "contestants" for  parliamentary seats.    At the same time meetings with representatives of Ukrainians  of individual enterprises and organizations show that preference  in this milieu is being shown to the forces that are not in  power. And this is explicable: The parties that are represented  in parliament today are wittingly or unwittingly evoking  people's dissatisfaction on account of the policy that led to  last year's fratricidal war and the ineffective solution of the  economic, language, and a multitude of other questions.    [Bazhutina] So what do Ukrainians expect of the future  members of parliament?    [Repchinskiy] The answer needs to be sought in the range of  problems which affect people's vital interests. Language, as a  means of communication, cannot, for example, be allowed to  become a means of pressure, even less political blackmail. A  person cannot be afraid of losing his job merely because of  ignorance of the language. Not to mention the enormous  intellectual losses that could occur if we fail to find an  intelligent solution that does not impinge on Ukrainians. These  losses, as deplorable practice has shown, are of a moral and  political nature which is hard to restore....    There is the ancient oriental saying: If you fall out, do so  in such a way that you can make up tomorrow. How far our  politicians have abided by this rule I leave you to judge.  Different, fresh forces which sensitively catch the demands of  the people and respond to them accordingly are needed today.    I shall use the following fact to illustrate this. There  are,  if I am not mistaken, approximately 40 Ukrainians in the present  parliament. But with the very rare exception, Ukrainians  themselves and their national and cultural problems have been of  no interest to this group. Why is this? Because many of these  deputies represented the interests not of Ukrainians but of  yesterday's party-nomenklatura elite, which fed them and which  they served faithful and true. It is not fortuitous that it is  from there that charges against us of nationalism and  "Bandera-ism" have most often been heard whenever we have raised  the question of the development of Ukrainian culture in Moldova  and the opening of our own national schools--a question,  fortunately, their wishes notwithstanding, which has been  supported by the president and the government.    As far as the political structures are concerned, only one  party--the social democrats--has in recent years regularly  maintained contacts with the Ukrainian Culture Society and  adopted an understanding attitude toward Ukrainians' specific  interests. All the others would like to see us either as a  blindly credulous driven mass or some conglomerate blend of the  non-Moldovan, so-called Russian-speaking population.    With regard for the current situation in the republic the  social democrats, incidentally, were the first to speak about  the need for guaranteed national representation in parliament. I  agree that this is not the ideal solution either. Power should  represent experience, knowledge, and intellectual potential  multiplied by professionalism, regardless of the ethnic  affiliation of its exponents. And someday, I believe, it will.  But today's state of our democracy and the whole of society  demands just such an approach. Disregarding this means  disregarding the demands of reality itself. And it puts on the  agenda such a question as Ukrainians being granted within the  framework of national and cultural autonomy the rights of local  government. This right should, incidentally, be guaranteed all.    Let the state deal with questions of defense and foreign  policy and formulate the strategy of economic policy, but not  distribute fuel by the liter and not indicate from Chisinau what  to sow and when to harvest. People can decide for themselves not  only these but also other problems which are beyond the capacity  of the state. I, as one of millions of taxpayers, say, would  like to know on what these funds are being spent and to  administer some of them--at self-government level.    [Bazhutina] And the final question. How do you view the  attempts to form an association of the "Russian-speaking"  electorate?    [Repchinskiy] In the same way as I view any actual  anti-Moldovan coalition. We have experience--and bitter, at  that--of this. I believe that the fate of the state and its  future need to be decided not by a counterpoise of the interests  of different groups of the population but by comparing them and  making them commensurate and, where possible, combining them.  Ukrainians, like the Russians and Bulgarians, have their own,  characteristic interests, and they can be resolved perfectly  well without the creation of various "fronts," which would only  cause doubts as to the sincerity of their creators' intentions.</p>

He  said: For a long time, we have failed to conscientiously handle  the relationship between reform, development, and stability as  reiterated in the government work report. We have always  attached more importance to the total amount of fixed assets and  shown more interest in developing new projects and increasing  investment. However, we have not given sufficient attention to  the available fixed assets and the equipment replacement and  renovation of old enterprises. As a result, the economy has  grown rapidly on the one hand, but, on the other, old  enterprises have experienced difficulties in every step they  take. Likewise, Heilongjiang has reaped bumper grain harvests  every year, but peasants' income and local revenue have not  increased rapidly as grain output has.    Governor Shao Qihui analyzed the reasons for such contrast.  He said: It has resulted both from the problems in our work  and the oversights and omissions in policies. The basic problem  lies in our failure in handling well the relationship between  reform, development, and stability. He continued: To better  implement major state policies in our specific economic  activities, we, as the local government, should measure our  specific work against the government work report and find out  where we lag behind. We should note both the increase in the  growth rate of economic development and the increase in the  number of loss-making large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises; and both the substantial improvement in living  standard with some people becoming well-off ahead of others and  the great difficulties in the life of some localities and some  staff members and workers. To successfully address these  problems, we should refrain from empty sloganeering.    Speaking on Heilongjiang's agricultural economy, Governor  Shao Qihui said: We should not regard the peasant economy as  the agricultural economy. While attaching importance to the  interests of peasants, we should also step up efforts to build  up local and township and village finance; and while speeding up  the increase in grain output, we should also accelerate the  development of the nonagricultural economy so that Heilongjiang  Province will become a large province in agricultural economy at  an early date instead of a large province in agriculture.</p>

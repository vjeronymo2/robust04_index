			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Japan's vice minister of  defense said Monday [4 April] Tokyo has no evidence that North  Korea possesses nuclear weapons as suggested by Washington. "We  cannot confirm this," Shigeru Hatakeyama told a news conference  referring to U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's remarks in a  Sunday NBC program that North Korea has already built two  nuclear weapons.    Asked whether he believes that Pyongyang's new mid-range  missile capable of reaching most of Japan can be used with  nuclear warheads, Hatakeyama said he would not rule out such a  possibility "in the future."    "At the present stage, however, all we can say is that this  would be rather difficult," the vice minister said.</p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Tide turns against Cubans: James Harding in Key West on the plight of those who flee Castro Adrift in the middle of the Straits of Florida on a polystyrene raft, oars washed overboard by the 10-foot waves, you pray. First you pray to Our Lady of Regla, the patron saint of the sea. Then you pray to Our Lady of Caridad, patron saint of Cuba. And then you paddle. It worked for Miriam Villegas, 42, a hospital statistician from eastern Cuba who was picked up by the US Coastguard after two days at sea - along with her husband and two other refugees. But Mrs Villegas, who has since been processed by immigration, washed and clothed by the Transit Centre for Cuban Refugees in new sneakers, slacks and a T-shirt reading 'Love you for loving the blues', was one of the last Cuban refugees to get a warm welcome from the US. President Bill Clinton yesterday confirmed a reversal in US policy, which since the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 has almost automatically admitted Cuban refugees and made them eligible to apply for permanent resident status after living in the US for a year. Mr Clinton said all Cuban refugees picked up at sea would be prevented from entering and instead would be taken to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where Haitian refugees have been processed by US immigration. He accused the Cuban government of Fidel Castro of attempting to 'export' its 'political and economic problems'. The last bus load of 65 Cubans to sneak in under the old regulations reached the transit centre from the immigration services at the Key West coastguard base at 2.30 yesterday morning. Oblivious to the change in policy, oblivious to almost everything, men wrapped in blankets filed through a corridor of clapping, and cheering compatriots. Callow faces and tired eyes affirm the writer Ernest Hemingway's observation on the journey across the Straits of Florida. 'Brother, don't let anybody tell you there isn't plenty of water between Havana and Key West,' Hemingway wrote. The centre estimates that only four out of 10 make the crossing successfully. Luis, who left his whole family behind, knows he was lucky. He and two friends came across on a couple of inner tubes lashed together with rope. They told of an escape with paddles made of corrugated-iron nailed to broom handles. The Florida coastguard picked up another 538 people on Thursday, bringing the total this week to 2,077 - not far short of the 3,565 in the whole of last year. Most of the refugees are brought to the coastguard base at Trumbo Point in Key West. Until yesterday they were handed over to immigration, who having checked they were Cuban and not Haitian, passed them on to the transit centre. Florida's state officials were struggling yesterday to come to terms with the practical consequences of the new policy. Mr Tom Herndon, chief of staff to the Florida governor, said federal officials had yet to instruct state officers on changes in operations. He understood the White House was 'trying to refine a specific policy'. The change in policy will not be welcomed by many Cuban Americans in Florida, least of all Mr Arturo Cobo, who presides over the transit centre. Mr Cobo, who left Cuba in 1960 and was part of the 1961 ill-fated Bay of Pigs expedition, sits in his office surrounded by commendations and certificates of thanks from Cuban American organisations. In a corner hang the army uniforms of Cuban military officials, 'Castro's men', who rafted across the strait and ended up in Mr Cobo's centre. Above the uniforms, a glass case houses three border patrol bullets dug out of Cuban refugees, who eventually landed safely in Florida. Mr Cobo does not want to see those who flee 'a Communist dictator' sent to detention camp. 'Freedom. People looking for freedom are dying all along this stretch of Florida,' he says. 'We don't make immigration policy, but we don't want to see Cubans treated like Haitians.' At the centre, news of the policy reversal was greeted angrily. One Cuban American who left in the great Mariel exodus in 1980 says they are 'fleeing their native country to be free, instead of making their lives worse'. By six o'clock yesterday morning, the centre was empty. The last of the refugees had been taken up to Miami on chartered tourist buses advertising pleasure cruises to the Bahamas. Miriam Villegas is today free in Miami. She said the address and telephone number of her brother, Joel Alvarez Bello, was washed away during the crossing. What is the best thing about America? She looks towards her husband. He says nothing. A transit centre volunteer prompts them: 'Libertad' (Freedom). 'Yes, Libertad,' they say. Short-term bid to solve old problem, Page 3</p>

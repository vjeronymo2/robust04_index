			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: William Cook drops 60% and cuts dividend WILLIAM COOK, the Sheffield-based steel castings group, yesterday cut its dividend after reporting a 60 per cent fall in profits as recession continued to hit sales. Mr Andrew Cook, chairman and chief executive, blamed changes in accounting treatment for part of the sharp fall and said 'shareholders should not be disappointed at the results'. William Cook shares, nevertheless fell 47p to 283p, a sign of the City's displeasure with the dividend cut. Pre-tax profits in the year to March 28 fell from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 4.76m on sales down 16 per cent at Pounds 111.2m. These figures included Pounds 3.3m of exceptional costs covering rationalisation and plant closures during the last and current years. In the past William Cook generally treated such plant closures and rationalisation costs below the line as extraordinary items or wrote them off against acquisition provisions. Earnings per share under the new treatment fell from 46.29p to 15.03p. Under the old treatment the fall would have only been to 25.27p. The company has cut the final dividend to 5p (9p), giving a total of 10p (14p). The recession had necessitated further job cuts and other cost cuts. The current year had brought no relief from recession although orders had picked up in some group companies. COMMENT William Cook will not be the only company to bemoan accounting changes. But the plain fact is that when a company is closed or trimmed it costs real cash. To allow that cost to be written off below the line flies in the face of common sense - if one accepts accounts are supposed to reflect the true state of a business - and is a practice that is well buried. As for William Cook's prospects, shareholders can do little but wait for a turnround in the economy before this low technology metal basher does anything exciting. Granted William Cook has almost single handedly rationalised the steel foundry industry in the UK, becoming the most profitable producer in Europe in the process. But few rationalisation opportunities remain as it already dominates the domestic market and many potential continental European targets remain in unholy alliance with their respective governments. As it travels this somewhat dull route, William Cook's profits are likely to recover to Pounds 7m this year, or earnings of 22p, followed by Pounds 10m and 31.8p of earnings.</p>

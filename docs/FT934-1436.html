			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Markets: The Bank flexes its muscles - London It is the season of hopefulness. A time to believe in fairy godmothers, Father Christmas and a brighter future. If there be cynics among us, let them wait until the new year to mutter 'humbug'. So let us suspend our disbelief and look to a golden future, when Tiny Tim does not die and the Footsie index reaches 3,500 by the end of January. It has been an extraordinary week. The chance of peace in Northern Ireland, a Gatt agreement which offers the prospect of growing, harmonious world trade - unless you happen to be a South Korean rice farmer - and economic numbers appearing to promise that disinflationary growth can be a reality. And the Footsie rose 75.8 points over the week to close at another record, 3,337.1. Inflation for the year to November is steady at 1.4 per cent with the underlying rate at 2.5 per cent, the lowest for 25 years. Unemployment has fallen again, to its lowest level for 15 months. The Confederation of British Industry asserts that order books are improving. On top of all this, there are hopes of a base rate cut in everyone's Christmas stocking, with the prospect of more to come in the new year. No wonder then that the Footsie index has reached new highs, breaching the 3,300 mark and promising to carry on upwards. Many strategists are looking for the index to reach 3,500 by the summer. If that becomes the consensus view, the market will get there much sooner. But, wait. What is this grim spectre rattling his chains, padlocks and money boxes. Not Jacob Marley, but Rupert Pennant-Rea, deputy governor of the Bank of England. Pennant-Rea raised the spirit of Christmas Past - our old enemy, stagflation. That ugly combination of a stagnant economy and high inflation. If the spirit of Christmas Future is to be disinflationary growth - and some economist needs to think up a catchier name for this cheerful idea - then, Pennant-Rea warned industry this week, it should not raise prices but go for volume growth instead. The penalty of not doing as he asks could be a rise in base rates. Pennant-Rea was flexing the Bank's semi-independent muscles. Perhaps he was observing the 1.8 per cent drop in manufacturing input prices in the year to November and the 3.6 per cent rise in output prices over the same period. The gap might suggest a little margin rebuilding has been going on. But with demand in the economy weak, price increases in the UK will be hard to achieve - even if exporters do appear to have taken advantage of sterling's weakness to raise prices. In the longer term, though, industry will refrain from increasing prices only if there is a huge cultural change after such a long spell of inflation. After years of recession companies want or need to widen margins. And after years of cost-cutting, price increases are the attractive option. If cost-cutting and investment to improve efficiency are to be the means of raising margins, then unemployment could remain high. If the economy truly is entering a new, golden era of low inflation and growth, perhaps margins do not need to be as wide as they have been in the past. But the market will need some convincing. One sector which has embraced the Pennant-Rea philosophy already is food retailing. Prices have been cut to try to increase volume, although there is little evidence that the trick has worked. Profits are under pressure - as Asda admitted yesterday - and, as the chart shows, the sector is one of the worst performers of the year. So much, says the market, for going for volume and not price. By contrast, the merchant banks are one of the best-performing sectors. They have managed to increase volumes without cutting prices. And a look at the Trafalgar House rights issue this week - that unhappy company's third in two years - shows just how lucrative the business is. Of Pounds 425m raised, Pounds 404m went to the company itself. The other Pounds 21m was swallowed by 'expenses.' While merchant banks prosper, so do investment managers. Results from M &amp; G for the year to September showed funds under management rose by 45 per cent. Shareholders benefited, too, with a 36 per cent rise in the final dividend planned. Net assets at Electra, the venture capitalists, rose by 23 per cent over the year. Shareholders in regional electricity companies have also seen a continuation of the trend to big rises in interim dividends, although many companies have warned investors that at least part of the rise was to re-balance the two half-yearly payments. Elsewhere, the trend of corporate news has been bad. As well as Trafalgar House's miseries - a loss of Pounds 347m after property write-downs and exceptional costs totalling Pounds 397m, and a cut dividend - Fisons, the pharmaceutical group has been in the wars again. There have been a number of boardroom departures. Chief executive Cedric Scroggs was sacked this week after refusing to resign. Patrick Egan, chairman, said instead of profits forecast at Pounds 100m the company would only break even. Dorling Kindersley, the publisher which floated last year, issued its second profit warning in a fortnight and waved goodbye to its managing director. Pentos, the Dillons bookshop group which last month replaced Terry Maher as chairman with Sir Kit McMahon, former deputy governor of the Bank of England, warned of 'substantial losses.' But corporate gloom need not dominate. The real world takes a while to catch up with what the market anticipates. And the market clearly believes in a golden future.</p>

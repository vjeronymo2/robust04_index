			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former President of South Yemen 'Ali Nasir </F> Muhammad, in Damascus, by Shihatah Abu-al-Majd, in Cairo; date  not given; from the "Dialogue from Afar" program--recorded]    [Text] [Abu-al-Majd] Do you have a new initiative to  resolve the Yemeni crisis now that the situation has become  dangerously complicated?    [Muhammad] I am against the dialogue of rifles, tanks,  aircraft, guns, and rockets. I support the fraternal and  peaceful dialogue that could lead to a solution and possibly to  a relaxation in the Yemeni situation. I made some proposals and  stated some ideas to contain the crisis in Yemen last year and  this year. I made my latest proposals one month ago.  Regrettably, this initiative and these sincere and honest  efforts collided with some irresponsible stances.    [Abu-al-Majd] Who do you mean?    [Muhammad] I cannot say now who is responsible. But it was  not only my initiative that was rejected, but also other Arab  and international initiatives that could have contained the  crisis in Yemen had there been a positive response to them.  Battles are raging today and everyone will be harmed by these  battles in which every weapon of destruction -- naval, land, air  weapons, and Scud missiles -- is used. The winner in these  battles is a loser. This is why I say that returning to  understanding and dialogue in Yemen is the only way to solve the  country's crisis.    [Abu-al-Majd] Who is responsible for making the situation in  Yemen so grave?    [Muhammad] Everyone is responsible for the eruption of the  fighting and for the Yemeni people's tragedy. We are not  discussing who fired the first bullet or who caused the crisis  to erupt. We are discussing the consequences of this mad and  destructive war that could damage the Yemeni people's gains,  security, stability, and also the stability of the region.    [Abu-al-Majd] Now that the situation has erupted in this  way,  what, in your view, as a son of Yemen and as an observer who is  remote from events, is the means of stopping this bloodshed?  Can you specify?    [Muhammad] I first call for halting the bloodshed in Yemen  and urge caring about Yemen's unity. I reject secession and the  fighting in Yemen and advocate a return to the dialogue that  could contain the crisis. Some people might ask with whom can  we have a dialogue today. I tell them that we can search for  the parties that might reach an understanding and solve the  crisis.    [Abu-al-Majd] Who are these parties?    [Muhammad] I do not want to name names but it is known that  there are three parties in the ruling coalition. There is also  the dialogue committee that comprises the political forces in  Yemen.    [Abu-al-Majd] But this committee has achieved nothing. It  was the one that drew up the Pledge and Accord Document but  failed to achieve the required result. How can it achieve  anything now when battles are raging?    [Muhammad] I agree with you that the committee achieved the  Pledge and Accord Document. But the committee has played no  role in implementing this document.    [Abu-al-Majd] Was this the fault of the committee or of the  parties to the current conflict?    [Muhammad] I believe the coalition committee is not  responsible for the nonimplementation, because the three ruling  parties are the decisionmakers in Yemen.    [Abu-al-Majd] Are you prepared to visit Yemen and work out  a new solution?    [Muhammad] I am quite prepared to visit Yemen and help the  leadership find a solution if this would serve the public  interest and the supreme interest of the Yemeni people. I am  also prepared to offer sacrifices for the sake of the Yemeni  people.    [Abu-al-Majd] Do you think the current situation in Yemen  dictates that you should visit Yemen now?    [Muhammad] The situation dictates that all the good people,  whether Yemenis, Arab brothers, or friends, should be there now.  I believe that every concerted effort must be made to enable  Yemen to ride out its crisis and ordeal and end the bloodshed  and destruction.    [Abu-al-Majd] Are you prepared to coordinate positions with  some Arab sides, like Egypt and the United Arab Emirates [UAE]  or others, to take a new initiative to end the situation?    [Muhammad] Personally, I am ready to carry out any effort,  whether with my brothers in Egypt or the UAE, any effort that is  bound to contain the crisis and solve the problem in Yemen. I  am also ready to coordinate efforts on the Arab and  international levels to resolve the crisis in Yemen. But what  matters is that the political leadership there should respond to  such initiatives, because many initiatives taken by our brothers  and friends did not succeed in view of the various stances.    [Abu-al-Majd] Some people say that Arab forces should be  sent  there to disengage the two warring sides. But the political  leadership in Sanaa said that this is an internal dispute and  does not necessitate this.    [Muhammad] This proposal has [words indistinct] the views of  the political leadership in Yemen. I previously stressed the  need for Arab efforts and welcomed the initiative taken by Egypt  and the UAE. I also welcomed the initiative carried out by the  Arab League secretary general to send a committee to Yemen to  follow up the developments there and help work out a solution.    [Abu-al-Majd] Do you think that unity could survive amid  such  circumstances?    [Muhammad] The current events in Yemen will cause a deep  wound in the body of Yemeni unity and in the heart of the Yemeni  people, even the Arab people. This is because the unity does  not only concern the Yemeni people; it concerns the entire Arab  nation as well.    [Abu-al-Majd] Some people say the unity was founded on the  wrong basis, because the military, economic, and political  institutions did not unite. Do you concur?    [Muhammad] I would like to say that the unity [word  indistinct] for the Yemeni people. But Yemen experienced  difficulties, problems, and crises in the absence of unity.  That is why the Yemeni leadership sought unity to avoid all  these crises. But various attempts were carried out to avoid  unity. I support every effort made to solve the problems that  cropped up in the absence of unity. You cannot solve problems  by avoiding unity. The [words indistinct] and accord summed up  the crisis in Yemen and defined the solutions to the crisis.    [Abu-al-Majd] Thank you, 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, former  president of south Yemen.    [Muhammad] Many thanks to the Voice of the Arabs, the voice  of the Arab nation.</p>

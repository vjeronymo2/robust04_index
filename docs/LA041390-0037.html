			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-ABORTIONIST STIRS STRONG REACTIONS  </P> <P> That this aging co-ed, with her big hair, big Rolex, big diamonds and big  Mercedes wants to dictate her version of morality would be comical if it  weren't so frightening.  </P> <P> Here we have a woman who wants for nothing (including first-class air travel to  Europe to peddle her self-righteousness) and it is totally disconnected from  reality.  </P> <P> I am puzzled by the very term pro-life. She isn't pro-life. She is pro-birth.  McMillan doesn't consider life an ongoing experience. Once you have the baby,  you're on your own, ladies. The unfortunate mothers then have to contend with a  vicious circle of poverty and despair, presumably while Susan is having her  roots retouched.  </P> <P> JEFFREY G. GENTILE, Torrance  </P></p>

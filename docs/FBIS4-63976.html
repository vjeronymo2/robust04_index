			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Galina Sapozhnikova: "Kozyrev Believes in Commissars"] </F>   [Text] Tallinn -- The third Baltic Council conference,  which took place Wednesday [25 May], was attended by foreign  ministers from 10 large and small sea powers including Russia  and Sweden. The council was established two years ago in  Copenhagen and authorized to jointly resolve problems of  economic cooperation, the environment, illegal immigration, and  organized crime.    But the main event for the country was the arrival in  Tallinn  of Andrey Kozyrev. Russian-Estonian talks had become  stalemated, the last meeting between politicians at this level  having taken place back in December 1992. So everyone was  eagerly expecting Kozyrev in Tallinn.    In an exclusive interview with KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, the  minister said: "We have nevertheless managed to create the post  of supreme commissar for national minorities' affairs. He works  mainly in the [former Soviet] Baltic countries. We have  prevailed on the Council of Europe, which was quick to grant  Estonia membership, to send a mission to Estonia; this mission  now works there practically full time, and is also making fairly  serious demands that the regime relating to our compatriots  should be adjusted. And finally, this forum sees the  appointment of a new commissar whose task includes strengthening  democratic principles. But what kind of democracy are we talking  about if almost one-third of the population are considered  foreigners? You know, in order to secure ratification of this  mandate, I was even obliged to issue a threat that I would not  come to this meeting."</p>

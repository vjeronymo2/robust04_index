However, shares with a value of up to Dollars 1.5bn are likely to be on offer, the precise amount depending on how many of its existing shareholders wish to sell. The flotation, aimed primarily at investment institutions, will be one of the most ambitious attempts to market shares in the big share markets of the world. Air Canada and Aer Lingus own substantial blocks of shares, each worth about Dollars 200m, and are expected to sell part of their holdings. Air Canada said the company would sell its holding if the price was right believed to be about Dollars 20 a share. Advisers to the group, are understood to have recommended prices ranging from Dollars 17 to Dollars 23.</p>

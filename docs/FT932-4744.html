			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): In search of funding - FT writers look at local finance schemes providing small amounts of money A long-standing wish of many small business lobbyists is the creation of a government-backed fund to provide low-cost, long-term loans to small businesses, writes Charles Batchelor. But cheap-rate finance may not be in such short supply in the UK as is often supposed, according to a survey* by Kingston University's Small Business Research Centre. It has identified no fewer than 63 loan schemes in England, some national but most of them operating locally or regionally. These schemes offer as little as Pounds 500 rising to Pounds 1m, though most cater for businesses seeking up to Pounds 10,000 to finance start-up or further growth. Most have repayment 'holidays', often of six months, and many offer training and other support alongside hard cash. The most common characteristic of these schemes is that they usually back businesses which would have difficulties obtaining finance from conventional sources. Many owners do not have track records or cannot offer security. The schemes often have a social purpose as well, helping unemployed people in inner cities or businesses in areas of industrial decline. Most involve a public sector or non-profit organisation linking up with a private sector source. Backers include the banks, notably Midland, large private sector businesses such as Shell, local authorities, enterprise agencies, City livery companies such as the Mercers and organisations such as the Royal British Legion, which helps ex-service people. Some organisations run a number of schemes for different target companies, such as Northern Enterprise in Newcastle upon Tyne which has two, London Enterprise Agency which has four and Enterprise Lewisham, in south-east London, which has two. What the directory does not show is how effective soft loans are as a way of helping small firms start or expand, though the researchers have identified weaknesses in the marketing of the loan schemes. Nor, in cases where there are several sponsors for a fund, do they always work smoothly together. These and other issues are to be the subject of further research. If this demonstrates that soft loan funds are a way of promoting small enterprise then the government may have to rethink its policies, the researchers say. *A Directory of Soft Loan Schemes for Small Businesses in England.

Innovative approach Spider Systems, an Edinburgh company which manufactures computer networking equipment, is using an unusual type of grant to develop a new telecommunications product range, writes James Buxton. It is receiving Pounds 250,000 from Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd (LEEL), the local enterprise company, and will repay it over three years through royalties on products sold. LEEL says the funding instrument, which it calls a participatory grant, is innovative but does not claim it is unique. It is disbursing a total of Pounds 750,000 in participatory grants this year, mainly to high-tech companies for product development. 'We believe product development is crucial to the future of the area,' says Geoff Strachan of LEEL, 'but companies usually fund it out of profits which have been hit by recession.' He says that LEEL has to have close links with the companies to which it provides participatory grants. LEEL expects to make a rate of return on the grants which is midway between that on a loan (10-15 per cent) and an equity stake (40 per cent). A cap applies on the value of products sold, above which Spider will not have to make royalty payments. In the event that Spider does not sell any of the products to which the participatory grant applies, it will not have to repay LEEL. Spider will enter the funding in its books as grant, not a loan, Spider, a 10-year-old company, now has sales of almost Pounds 20m and is using the participatory grant to help fund a Pounds 1m programme to develop a new range of telecommunications products. It says it is the only European company of its kind in a market dominated by US concerns. Spider, which employs 250 people in Scotland, Berkshire and abroad, is also receiving a Pounds 150,000 grant from the Department of Trade and Industry and will fund the rest of the Pounds 1m project from its resources. Alternative loans The range of local financing initiatives for small businesses is set to grow if activity in the West Midlands is any guide to a national pattern. Across the region, plans for funds, trusts and banks proliferate, writes Paul Cheeseright. The emphasis is the provision of loan finance for the business which cannot obtain funds from either its bank or a venture capital company. This is an area where Pounds 5,000, not Pounds 50,000, may be the bridge between success and failure. In the Black Country, Walsall Enterprise Agency is close to finalising the details of a Pounds 400,000 revolving loan fund, while in central Birmingham, the Aston Commission has produced a business plan for an investment trust based on two companies. One would lend, while the other would guarantee the loans; the longer term hope is the development of a community bank. In Coventry, the city council is examining the feasibility of an investment trust. In Worcester, David Hallmark, a solicitor and Philip Paxton, divisional manager of Midlands Electricity and a director of the local training and enterprise council, hope to create a local funding partnership to finance a city project. The aim of these initiatives is to foster local economic development rather than to provide handsome returns to shareholders. There is little desire to vie with established financial institutions. 'Our particular initiative,' says Pat Conaty, development director of Aston Commission, 'is not to compete with the banks but to cope with a funding gap where bank branches have closed.' Indeed, the new funds look to the institutions for financial backing. The Aston Commission devised its proposals in co-operation with Co-operative Bank. The Walsall Enterprise Agency's basic funding will come from an unnamed finance house. The ability to offer loans to companies which do not have the security which the clearing banks demand as a matter of course, is only possible if the scheme organisers have a backing which goes beyond the initial capital funding. Aston Commission studies show that the risk of a small business loan failure is 40 per cent against a six per cent chance of failure on housing loans. Thus the Aston plan depends in part on winning large company support for loan guarantees. And the Walsall scheme, which aims to offer loans at two percentage points under the base rate, hopes to win the backing of City Challenge funds, aimed at urban regeneration.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- How UK companies raise finance  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mean % share by source of finance Banks                                           60.6% Other sources                                    5.4% Other private individuals                        1.7% Partners/working shareholders                    7.6% Customers/suppliers                              2.2% Factoring                                        3.5% Hire purchase/leasing                             16% Venture capital                                  2.9%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: The State of British Enterprise, Cambridge University Small Business Research Centre  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

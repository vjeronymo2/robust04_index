			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Customs reports 12% rise in revenue to Pounds 62bn REVENUE from taxes and duties collected by the Customs &amp; Excise department increased by 12 per cent to Pounds 62bn, in spite of the effects of the recession, the organisation's annual report showed yesterday. Accounts for the year to March 31 show that Pounds 36bn - or more than 57 per cent of total revenues - came from value added tax, with a further Pounds 11bn from hydrocarbon oils. Only two areas of revenue declined. Car tax fell 15 per cent to Pounds 1.2bn, and duties on matches and mechanical lighters fell 13 per cent to Pounds 15m. Costs of collection rose 12 per cent to Pounds 643m, leaving costs as a proportion of revenues unchanged on last year at 1.03 per cent. The figures exclude costs of anti-smuggling work, which rose 9 per cent to Pounds 154m, while drug seizures by value rose 49 per cent to Pounds 896m. The 1991-92 annual report shows for the first time the performance of Customs against targets set down in its published management plan. VAT arrears increased to 4.4 per cent with 12 months' liability during the period, against a target reduction to 3.8 per cent. The aim of providing basic training within four weeks of recruitment to 1,100 executive officers was also not met, with only 80 per cent trained in that period. Most other stated objectives were achieved. They included a 15 per cent improvement of productivity on Customs import work against a target of 8 per cent, and a higher rate of examination of exports under the European Community's common agricultural policy. Customs achieved a 4.3 per cent improvement in value for money from new purchasing initiatives and a 2.5 per cent reduction in unit running costs of accommodation. Also for the first time, the report provides the running costs and limited information on each of the 30 executive units created in April last year which gained greater management freedom in exchange for more accountability. Among the collection units, running costs were greatest at London's airports  -with a total of Pounds 43m - and at Dover, where they were Pounds 30m. The bulk of costs among the 10 operational and support units were consumed by investigations division, at Pounds 30m, and information technology divisions, at Pounds 20m.

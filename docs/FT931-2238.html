			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Books: Bring on Wimsey and Vane DOROTHY L. SAYERS: HER LIFE AND SOUL by Barbara Reynolds Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 25, 398 pages THIS IS the centenary year of Dorothy Sayers' birth. To mark the occasion, eight of her Lord Peter Wimsey novels are being reissued in paperback simultaneously with publication of this new biography by the head of the Dorothy L. Sayers Society. Sayers was born in Oxford but raised primarily in a remote vicarage in the fenland of East Anglia. She enjoyed what she insisted on calling an Edwardian childhood, solitary but happy, within an indulgent, civilised family. Everyone - from her parents, cousins and aunts to her governess and the gardener - was mobilised as dramatic foils for her starring roles. Sayers went up to Somerville in 1912; Oxford was later to serve as fodder for one of her most accomplished stories, Gaudy Night, where Harriet Vane returns for a visit to her old college. Except for the odd belltower captain who honours the accuracy of her Kent Treble Bob Majors in The Nine Tailors, Oxford itself remains ambivalent toward Sayers. Her wickedly observed (and reportedly all too accurate) portraits of contemporary Somerville personalities in Gaudy Night are echoed in her descriptions of 'Spooner looking as mad as usual' and 'Dr Dixey looking like a walrus' at Encaenia in 1913. But one may forgive Sayers a great deal for the words she borrowed from the degree ceremony to create that most elegant of all fictional marriage proposals: 'Placetne, magistra?' After graduating and a spell at teaching and reading manuscripts at Blackwell's, Sayers moved to London where she encountered a series of unsatisfactory men. One of them, John Cournos, was a Russian journalist and writer on the fringe of London's literary scene. Cournos ultimately failed to return Sayers' passionate love, and from her later chiding remarks it seems just as well: 'You were a rotten companion for a poor girl. You wouldn't go to the theatre and you wouldn't talk nonsense.' Although Cournos had wished them to become lovers and use contraceptives, Sayers insisted that no 'taint of the rubber-shop' should interfere with the creation of their child. Then, with consummate irony, she became pregnant while on the rebound. While it has been known that Sayers bore a son out of wedlock, the identification of the father was never made clear, apparently in deference to the wishes of their child, John Anthony. With his death in 1984, it must have been decided that all could now be revealed. In something of an anti-climax, the father turns out to have been one Bill White, a motorcycling man of action whom Sayers did not love, and who fled 'in rage and misery' upon learning she was pregnant. In addition to the centenary, this revelation appears to have been the catalyst for this latest biography - which, alas, it does not justify. The book often seems more absent-minded pastiche than biography, as if intended to be read with previous writings about Sayers in mind. It is often necessary to refer back to James Brabazon's 1981 biography to find out what is actually going on, and indeed the author herself often relies on Brabazon for interpretations (and quotations). Reynolds, an Italian scholar, may be more at home with a text than a person. Her lack of empathy often causes her to cling obstinately to the sunny persona of Sayers' letters when a more complex analysis is required, and even when contradicted by Sayers herself. Worse still, and unforgivably for a Sayers biographer, Reynolds' lack of any sense of dramatic occasion allows major events in Sayers' life to occur off-stage; among other omissions, readers are deprived of witnessing her growing success as a novelist, the deterioration of her marriage, and finally even her obituary tributes. When Reynolds comes to the period to which she was an eye-witness, she becomes incomprehensibly coy. For the last 14 years of Sayers' life, Reynolds collaborated with her on translating Dante's Divine Comedy, yet she polishes off their time together in just 12 pages, referring readers to an earlier work for a full account. I long ago decided that people could be divided into Peters and Harriets: the one mercurial, elusive, and fey; the other straight-browed, steadfast, literal. Reynolds claims that Harriet is 'in many ways a projection of the author'. A similar case can be made for Peter, as Sayers confesses: 'When I was dissatisfied with my single unfurnished room I took a luxurious flat for him in Piccadilly. When my cheap rug got a hole in it, I ordered him an Aubusson carpet.' Sayers managed to be both quixotic and sound - the whole somehow much more than the sum of her reported parts. Despite the manifest sincerity of this latest tribute, Sayers is still seeking her biographer.</p>

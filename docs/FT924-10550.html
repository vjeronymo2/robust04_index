			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Bank talks behind Pounds 14m loss says Lep LEP GROUP, the freight forwarding group and security concern, blamed heavy interim losses on uncertainty caused by its rescue talks and the continuing impact of recession. The group was recently restructured by its banks. In the six months to June 30 pre-tax losses were Pounds 14.2m, compared with profits of Pounds 1.9m, on turnover down from Pounds 749.1m to Pounds 644.9m. About Pounds 97m of the Pounds 104m sales decrease related to discontinued activities. Lep was brought to the brink of bankruptcy by borrowings of more than Pounds 500m but reached agreement in August with about 25 banks to convert Pounds 180m of debt into equity. The losses were struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 5.57m, of which Pounds 3.37m related to restructuring costs and provisions and the rest being the costs of the debt restructuring. Interest charges increased to Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 17.1m), however future charges will be reduced by the debt-for-equity swap. There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.64m, most of it attributable to the cost of withdrawing from certain property interests in the UK. Mr David James, the company doctor brought in to advise Lep in March, said the board was involved in a review of activities. This was likely to result in further exceptional and extraordinary charges in the full-year results. The attributable loss was Pounds 18.7m, (profit of Pounds 391,000). Losses per share were 11.6p (earnings of 0.4p). Because of the accumulated losses, the board said it did not expect to pay any dividend for some years. Mr James, who became chairman and chief executive in August, said that despite the significant losses, the underlying continuing operations remained profitable overall. This was reflected by operating income from continuing businesses, before exceptionals, of Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 16.4m). No provision has been made in these accounts regarding a claim against the company launched in October by ADT, the security group which has written off Pounds 65m of its 27 per cent stake in Lep. ADT claims it relied on misleading public statements by Lep when it bought the shares in 1990. LEP has booked a profit of Pounds 1.89m on a deal with its own pension fund trustees which caused a shortfall in the fund. In June last year Lep sold its fund a property for Pounds 12.5m, which was subsequently valued at Pounds 8.5m. Lep now pays the fund Pounds 1m a year in rent for the London office development. The deal represented a high proportion of the fund's Pounds 28m assets at a time when self-investment had been criticised in the pensions industry. In June this year the trustees said the fund had a shortfall of Pounds 900,000 and suspended transfers out of the fund by former employees. Lep has agreed to increase its pension contributions significantly in order to eliminate the shortfall within two to three years. Lep said yesterday that the Pounds 1.89m profit on the sale had not been recorded in the 1991 accounts. The figure has now been included in restated UK property profits of Pounds 5.24m for the half-year to June last year.</p>

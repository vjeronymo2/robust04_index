			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / France rediscovers Indochina: Nostalgia is part of it, but so is business Perhaps that's what youth is, to believe that the world is made of inseparable things: men and women, mountains and plains, humans and gods, Indochina and France So said Eliane Devries, the French plantation owner in Vietnam played by Catherine Deneuve in the film Indochine. Such films set in the colonial era - another is L'Amant, in which a French schoolgirl has a passionate affair with a wealthy businessman from Saigon - have encouraged thousands of sentimental tourists to visit France's former colonies in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. But the attachment to Indochina goes beyond mere nostalgia. Like the rest of Europe, France has yielded to Japan the greater share of trade and investment in Asia's other emerging economies; it hopes that in Indochina it can recover lost ground and use its cultural, linguistic and historical ties to build a solid base for French companies in the heart of Asia. Little effort has been spared in this quest, especially in Vietnam, the most important and populous of the three countries. France's President Francois Mitterrand last year became the first western head of state to visit a united Vietnam, and several French ministers have followed. Mr Mitterrand openly criticised the US economic embargo of Vietnam (which has since been lifted) and his government helped Hanoi with a bridging loan to pay its arrears to the International Monetary Fund. Both gestures were much appreciated by Vietnam's communist rulers, who began economic reforms in the late 1980s and are now presiding over a fast developing but still poor nation of 70m people. The French embassy in Hanoi - which is being enlarged to cope with its increased responsibilities - says France's aid to Vietnam doubled in each of the last five years to reach nearly FFr500m (Pounds 60m) in 1993. France has spent freely on promoting French language and culture. Evidence of France's extensive commercial involvement in Vietnam is also easy to find, from the oil exploration industry to the banking sector, from the aircraft and crew leased to Vietnam Airlines by Air France to the restored Sofitel-Metropole, the first luxury hotel in Hanoi. France, with Dollars 436m worth of projects approved by Vietnam, is the biggest European investor in the country - albeit behind Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and other Asian investors - and its products account for a tenth of Vietnam's imports. About 50 French companies have established offices in Vietnam. 'All things being equal, if you put two companies side by side, the Vietnamese would choose the French over the other, because they know the French,' says Mr Joel Claude Grillot of Credit Lyonnais in Hanoi. Few Vietnamese are nostalgic about the French colonial era which ended with the communist victory at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, but the cultural ties between the two countries are not merely a product of the French imagination. Apart from berets and baguettes, the Vietnamese inherited a love of classical music from the French, and most residents of Hanoi are as appreciative as the tourists of the city's broad boulevards and 19th century French architecture. The Vietnamese language has absorbed numerous French words; ga (gare) is the station, and xi mang (ciment) is cement. 'The French bathed us in blood and fire, they pillaged our country,' says Mr Hoang Xuan Dien, a 70-year-old war veteran who speaks fluent French and has relatives in France. 'But the true France brought us a very humanist culture and we respect the true French - like Pasteur, for example.' The Vietnamese government not only welcomes France's commercial involvement and the dollars spent by French tourists, but also regards Paris as an important international ally. Facing an unfriendly China (an old enemy which invaded northern Vietnam briefly in 1979) and a still-suspicious US (defeated in the mid-1970s), Vietnam is anxious to make friends in Europe and around the world. France, say Vietnamese diplomats, can provide the link not only to Europe but also to the community of French-speaking nations - La Francophonie. Vietnam is now bidding to host the 1997 francophone summit. France's 'return to the Indochina stage' - the phrase used by Mr Mitterrand's spokesman - has moved faster in Vietnam than in Laos or Cambodia. In Laos, Australian and Thai investors are particularly active. In Cambodia, France overreached itself by insisting that medical and other students financed by French aid should be taught in the French language, prompting demonstrations by students demanding to be taught in English, the lingua franca of business in south-east Asia. Cambodian officials, some of them brought up in France, also accused France of making empty promises of substantial military aid for the fight against Khmer Rouge guerrillas and then delivering only military advisers. In both Cambodia and Vietnam, France has now softened its stand on the language issue. French diplomats and aid officials in Hanoi and Phnom Penh readily accept that English is the second language of choice after the local language, while French can be a useful and enjoyable bonus. Young Vietnamese will learn French if someone else is subsidising their lessons and if they see a chance of a job in Europe or with a European company, but the reality is that most French speakers in Vietnam learned the language before 1954; about 700 students study French at the Alliance Francaise in Hanoi, but most of its 6,000 members are elderly. Even the supposed commercial benefits for France of its historical ties to Indochina are a matter of debate. 'I don't think we're necessarily treated favourably,' says Ms Fabienne Couty of the French embassy in Hanoi. 'The Vietnamese are very pragmatic.' That view is repeated at the Vietnamese foreign ministry by Mr Trinh Duc Du, head of the western and northern Europe department. 'Business is business,' he says. In Indochine, Eliane's adopted Vietnamese daughter Camille, a communist leader by the end of the film, puts it much more brutally: 'Your Indochina,' she tells Eliane, 'no longer exists.'</p>

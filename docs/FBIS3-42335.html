			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Pretoria Feb 7 SAPA -- The SA [South African]  Police on Monday and over the weekend swooped against suspected  extremist terrorists of both the far left and far right, Law and  Order Minister Hernus Kriel said. In Pretoria, he said the  arrests were made after more than six weeks of intensive  investigations into a series of far-rightwing terror attacks in  the [Orange] Free State and the Western Transvaal.    On Monday, police arrested five suspects linked to  far-rightwing organisations. Some were detained in Orkney and  others in Welkom.    Over the weekend, the SA Police arrested seven people,  including five suspected Azanian Peoples Liberation Army  members, in connection with the rifle and hand-grenade attack on  a swimming pool in Richard's Bay, Northern Naal, Mr Kriel said.  Three R5 rifles and two M26 hand-grenades were seized when the  arrests were made in Stanger, Empangeni, and near the scene of  the crime in Richard's Bay.    Five right-wing extremists were detained in the Transvaal  and  the Free State and explosives and firearms were seized by the  police.    Follow-up operations by the SA Police were still in progress  and further arrests could be expected, Mr Kriel said.    During the swoop in Orkney, a suspect fired with a shotgun  at  members of the police through a closed door. A policeman,  Sergeant Johan Jonker, was hit in the chest, but escaped death  because he wore a bullet-proof jacket. Police returned fire, Mr  Kriel said, and the suspect was wounded in the arm. He was  under police guard in hospital. [passage omitted]</p>

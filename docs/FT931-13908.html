			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Business rates may rise by 20 per cent BUSINESS rates may rise by 20 per cent in April and such an increase could be the last straw for thousands of small businesses, ministers will be warned today, Richard Evans writes. The Federation of Small Businesses says that, unlike the new council tax, which for some people will be softened by rebates, the uniform business rate will have no cushioning factor. Federation members assume the government will still refuse to extend the suspension of the transitional increases in business rate introduced in last year's Budget. Mr John Harris, federation chairman, said: 'Businesses were given a lifebelt by the chancellor last year with caps on the increases in their rate bills. The recession is still biting hard and businesses are not out of the danger zone. It is imperative that the government continues to provide help for hard-hit business rate payers in the same way as it will be doing for householders.' The federation repeats its call for councils to be sympathetic to small businesses.</p>

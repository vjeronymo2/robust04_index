			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Management: The good and the bad of bigness Bigness used to be considered a virtue in business. But it has had a decidely bad press of late. For more than a decade, pundit after pundit, from Tom Peters to Harvard economist Michael Jensen, has sounded the death knell for large companies. The real world has appeared to bear them out: action by governments, shareholders and managements themselves has broken up all sorts of established dynasties, both sensible but unwieldy business monoliths such as AT&amp;T, and illogical conglomerates such as ITT. Other big companies have reacted by stripping themselves 'back to basics': concentrating on their core businesses, and divesting or 'outsourcing' the remainder. A fashion has even developed for voluntary demerger. In the marketplace, lumbering giants, from IBM, Sears Roebuck and General Motors to the American TV networks, have been overtaken by more sprightly upstarts - Microsoft, WalMart, Toyota, CNN - and been attacked by hordes of smaller innovators. Small is now beautiful it seems - at least until, like Microsoft, you become big enough to join the ranks of the bad and ugly. In his new book, Global Paradox, John Naisbitt, the futurologist who made his name with Megatrends, declares that 'the bigger the world economy, the more powerful its smallest players'. He claims that 'we have moved . . . from bigger is better to bigger is inefficient, costly, wastefully bureaucratic, inflexible and, now, disastrous'. As the events of the past few weeks have shown, this blanket judgment is at best misleading and at worst dangerous. If big is bad, why is Lou Gerstner, the new chairman of IBM, reversing his predecessor's strategy of breaking up the company, and instead focusing on 'leveraging our economies of scale across research, development, manufacturing, distribution and services,' as he put it a fortnight ago? If big is bad, why is Alex Trotman, Ford's new boss, accelerating the integration of the motor company's design, engineering and manufacturing operations across the globe? Why has BMW bought Rover? Why is Sir Colin Marshall of British Airways pressing its American affiliate, US Air, to clean up its act so that the two companies can move on to their next stage of integration? The answer is not that any of these people is blind to the frequent virtues of smallness. It is that bigness is a much misunderstood and overabused concept. In the words of Dawn French, a sizeable and hugely popular British comedienne who has assumed the role of chief advocate for large ladies in Britain - much more happily than Roseanne Barr in the US - bigness brings 'something extra, and it's not just flesh'. In the wrong form, bigness can mean a business is fat, lumbering and ineffective. But in the right form, it can mean it is vibrant, powerful and agile. One of the reasons why bigness has fallen into such disrepute is that its more technical definition - scale - has been confused by many people with scope and diversity. What was wrong with ITT and most other companies in the 1970s and 1980s was not that they were too large as such, but that their scope was too broad - they were too diverse to be managed effectively. In each of their various businesses, however, they were often too small. This was certainly true of ITT's telecommunications interests, which had inadequate scale to be competitive in the 1970s, and failed utterly to meet the changed circumstances of the 1980s. Hence their sale. Equally, AT&amp;T was too broadly spread within the US market - where it was both a manufacturer and a monopoly service operation - but too small from a global point of view. In the US it suffered from diseconomies of scope - and also of scale - but in global terms it was of sub-optimal size. So, today, is BA, and possibly still BMW. In other words, big is both relative and - with all respect to French and Barr - not necessarily broad. Nor is big necessarily fat. Anyone who still equates the two should look at Percy Barnevik's ABB, Lew Platt's Hewlett-Packard or Livio DeSimone's 3M. Each is big in its chosen markets but exceedingly lean in the way it is managed. The same applies to a growing number of large multinationals, especially in the US but also in Europe. Stripped of their superfluous businesses and activities, they are managed increasingly like a collection of small businesses - but with the difference that they also exploit scale economies in selected parts of their 'value chain'. For many, this means sharing various degrees of research, design, development and purchasing across their businesses, and also aspects of distribution and service. For others - rather fewer, since the critics are right that large factories can be a handicap - it means harnessing economies of scale in production. For almost all of them it means sharing managerial skills, in particular through the common development of people. In each case, bigness brings benefits. The trick in this process is twofold. First, to recognise that the required level of bigness varies not only between industries, but also between the various businesses and value-adding activities within each industry. The second, far harder, challenge is to achieve the requisite degree of co-ordination or integration without falling foul of what management professors call 'the cost of complexity' - what economists prefer to term 'unacceptably high transaction costs'. That trick is what Ford claims to be performing in its gradual process of global integration. It is what IBM must achieve if it is to justify Gerstner's retention of so many businesses. Only then will 'Big Blue' cease to be seen as bad and ugly, and instead join the ranks of the lean and beautiful.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "MCA [Malaysian Chinese </F> Association] Carves New Image"]    [Text] The MCA [Malaysian Chinese Association], which this  year celebrates its 46th anniversary, has presented a new  concept by opening the door of membership more widely to include  anyone with blood connections or ties with those of Chinese  ancestry. This step changes the scope of the MCA struggle from  an entirely Chinese "gallery" to a more liberal position for the  sake of people who have ties with the Chinese. MCA members have  accepted the motto "One heart, one outlook," as embodied in a  resolution passed by the party's 40th general assembly last  year. It also demonstrates the MCA effort to rebuild its image  after facing a number of crises.    In truth, this step by the MCA is consistent with the way in  which the people of this country solve problems through  compromise and tolerance. It is also the principle used by the  National Front (BN) leadership, which has proved itself  successful in creating communal harmony in this country through  the unity of parties in the Peninsula, Sabah, and Sarawak. The  BN not only emphasizes political stability but also ensures  economic development for every citizen in an equitable way.    Groups with Chinese ancestral blood ties, who previously  found it difficult to select a party, are given opportunity to  join the MCA, now that differences of names, ethnic group, and  religion have been eliminated from the party's policy. We  believe that in the past many such groups asked for membership  in the party but were blocked by the party's strict policy. They  chose the MCA or other BN component parties because they did not  want to join opposition parties, which are clever at talking but  are bereft of any implementation of concepts for advancement of  the people. The statement of BN Chairman Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir  Mohamad that component parties were free to open their  memberships to anyone as long as they promised to adhere to the  principles of the BN's struggle further encouraged MCA leaders  to carry out their plan.    We believe that the MCA's action to increase the party's  membership, which is now 620,000, is for the sake of political  stability and communal harmony. We believe that other parties in  the BN support the MCA's efforts. This is the second phase in  the MCA's campaign to add members from people of the same  communal group. Of the 6 million people of Chinese descent in  this country, many faced problems in joining the party because  of this identity obstacle. Until now, the MCA has tried to find  more professionals or Chinese fluent in English to join the  party. The MCA realized that it could not keep such an expensive  requirement for membership, because social conditions in society  have greatly changed.    The people were thinking far ahead, while restrictive  policies had not yet been adapted to conditions. They could not  allow a large number of people with blood ties to drift without  protection. In our opinion, changes in the party's membership  requirements will not change the MCA's identity, although they  may include changes in the party's policies. This was proved to  UMNO [United Malays National Organization], which opened  membership to Bumiputra [Malays and other indigenous peoples] in  Sabah and in the Portuguese and Thai communities.    In the MCA's efforts to take a positive, progressive, and  constructive initiative, it had to open new dimensions for the  communal group of its own race that had no party representation.  Their presence can help the country make sociopolitical changes  by cooperation under a single outlook. The important thing is  that in the next 26 years prior to 2020, each citizen will be  able to enjoy the rapid economic growth for which we have been  striving together. Actually, this is the aspiration of every  individual in this country, regardless of communal status.    This, of course, differs from the attitude of the opposition  parties, which in practice have a negative attitude and take  destructive action. If there is a dissenting voice from the  opposition parties after this, it will be a voice of  disappointment over losing their opportunity to influence groups  without party representation and that now have a safer refuge.  The opposition parties are good only at empty rhetoric and do  not make any constructive contribution to the people as a whole.</p>

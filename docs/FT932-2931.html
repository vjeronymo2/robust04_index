			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Tory party to return Nadir funds if they were stolen THE CONSERVATIVE party pledged yesterday to return money donated to it by Mr Asil Nadir if the funds proved to be stolen as it emerged that the fugitive businessman is 'most unlikely' to return to Britain to face trial this September. In the first court hearing before Mr Justice Tucker since the former Polly Peck chairman jumped bail and fled to northern Cyprus, the Serious Fraud Office also ruled out any trial of Mr Nadir in his absence. However, the SFO announced it would continue criminal proceedings against Mr John Turner, the former Polly Peck group accountant facing false accounting charges. Conservative party officials promised that the Pounds 440,000 donated to party funds by companies associated with Mr Nadir would be repaid if it were proved that the money had been stolen. They also denied reports that Mr Nadir had made other secret donations to party funds. In an unusual statement released last night, the party said it received a total of Pounds 440,000 over five years, with the last contribution made in March 1990. 'These donations were not made by Mr Nadir personally but by Polly Peck International plc or Unipac Packaging Ltd,' it said. 'We know of no other donations from Mr Nadir personally or from his companies.' Asked about allegations that Mr Nadir might have hoped the donations would secure him a knighthood, party officials said no one had received an honour for donating to the Conservative party. The sale of honours would be a criminal offence, they said. Officials said the party did not accept donations from sources that were not clearly identified. But comments made last night by Sir Brian Wyldbore-Smith, former director of the party's treasury department, suggested this had not always been the case. Sir Brian said he was 'very often' not aware of donors' identities. In a crowded Old Bailey courtroom, Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, Mr Nadir's barrister, said he had taken instructions from his client at 4pm on Monday. 'It is most unlikely he will be here for trial in September. I do not propose to give reasons in open court,' he said. Accepting the position, Mr Robert Owen QC, for the SFO, ruled out any suggestion of putting Mr Nadir on trial in his absence. 'It would be entirely unprecedented. It would be entirely contrary to our justice system. We submit it would be unthinkable,' he said. Mr Justice Tucker agreed, saying such a move would not enhance the reputation of British justice. The judge also adjourned consideration of the possible forfeiting of Mr Nadir's Pounds 3.5m bail sureties. The ownership of the Pounds 2m security put up by Mr Nadir himself is currently the subject of an action in the Chancery division of the High Court.</p>

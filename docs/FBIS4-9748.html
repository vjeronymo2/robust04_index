			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Panama City Television Networks in  Spanish at 0100 GMT on 29 March broadcast a live two-hour debate  with six Panamanian presidential candidates. The debate,  sponsored by the Latin American Institute of Advanced Studies  (ILDEA) and the Media Committee for Presidential Debates, is  moderated by Fernando Berguido and features the following  presidential candidates: Ernesto Perez Balladares of the  Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD); Eduardo Vallarino Arjona  of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC); Ruben Dario Carles of  the Change '94 Alliance; Samuel Lewis Galindo of the Solidarity  Party (PS); Jose Salvador Munoz Correa of the Panamenist  Doctrinaire Party (PPD); and Ruben Blades of the Papa Egoro  Movement (MPE).    Following a brief statement by ILDEA President Rodrigo  Eisenmann, moderator Berguido explains the rules of the debate  and reads a short biography on each of the six candidates  present.    The debate gets under way with PRD Candidate Ernesto Perez  Balladares discussing his public expenditures program: "Clearly,  any attempt to try to refer to the 1970's and objectively  compare the decade to the 1990's would be dubious. During the  1970's, we had an international financial liquidity situation  because of an oversupply of crude oil revenues. In turn, this  situation prompted the financial institutions as well as banks  to implement easy credit policies. This gave us the opportunity  to carry out public investments and, at the same time, to create  more employment. In addition, not only did public investments  increase, but the state's payroll also increased.    "Obviously, the conditions of the 1970's are not the same as  those we are experiencing in 1994. Therefore, it would be  impossible to repeat that experience, and, even if we wanted to  -- which certainly is not the case -- we would not be able to  because the sources of financing simply are not as accessible as  in the past.    ``What we have to do in 1994 is domestically create a  competitive climate that will encourage private firms to invest  and create the jobs all Panamanians need. In this respect, we  have proposed a parallel public investment program that can be  financed jointly with the private sector and will result in  direct employment. For example, we have already outlined plans  for construction projects, such as highway construction --  particularly along the Panama-Colon highway -- as well as other  specific public investments projects. These activities are  urgently needed to ensure national development and also to  create new jobs.''    The debate continues with PDC candidate Eduardo Vallarino  contending that the country's infrastructure is in such a poor  state because of the restrictive spending programs of the past  25 years, and particularly of the past five years when the  Endara administration decided to curtail capital improvement  expenditures. Vallarino says that although he agrees there are  budget constraints because of external debt pressures, he also  believes there are other options available to overcome this  situation. With respect to road work, other Latin American  countries' experiences have demonstrated that highways can be  built through privatization efforts, which include transferring  highway management rights to the private sector.    In commenting on the current state of the Social Security  Fund (CSS), Change '94 candidate Ruben Dario Carles says he  believes that the CSS must be restructured if the institution is  going to survive.    PPD candidate Jose Salvador Munoz blames the nation's  unemployment problems on the ever-increasing external debt  pressure, which he says curtails investments; a United  States-led invasion that practically destroyed the country; and  policy issues that were never addressed by the previous  administration. He disagrees with the proposal that the  country's employment needs should be left entirely to the  private sector because the state is the only sector that can  create employment in the near term.    Meanwhile, PS candidate Samuel Lewis Galindo believes the  current administration has been quite insensitive to fulfilling  the lower income groups' most basic needs and that the  government has been more interested in repaying the foreign debt  than with improving the living conditions of the lower income  groups. Nevertheless, he agrees that the nation should not  forfeit on its foreign debt obligations.    In commenting on Panama's role in a world in which  globalization is the dominant trend, MPE candidate Ruben Blades  says: "First of all, I believe it is necessary for us to  pinpoint concrete objectives and strategies. As long as we fail  to do this, I believe that any decision related to our joining  agreements such as GATT or NAFTA cannot be taken seriously. We  must first determine what Panama's role is going to be once the  country has joined these treaties. Specifically, I believe that  joining GATT is going to have a negative impact on the country  if we do not first consult all sectors involved and if we do not  determine what the advantages to the country are going to be.  As a nation, we stand to lose certain comparative advantages  once services are standardized.    "In this respect we should look at the banking sector. We  still do not know exactly what we are getting into. It is not  only a matter of turning Panama into a market for other  products, but we must protect our products." Blades continues  by saying Panama must know "what we are getting into" before  agreeing to join GATT or NAFTA. He adds: "We are recommending  that Panama first determine which sectors can be developed as  export industries before joining any treaty that would lead to  the globalization of the economy."    With respect to CSS services, PRD candidate Ernesto Perez  Balladares believes CSS members should be given the option to  decide which social security program they wish to join. The  debate continues with PDC candidate Eduardo Vallarino expressing  his dissatisfaction with the "inefficiency" in which public  funds are being spent, because most are being funneled into  simply maintaining the bureaucracy.    In response to the question of whether Panama should become  a member of NAFTA, candidate Ruben Carles says: "We must first  consider our position with regard to GATT before we decide  whether or not to join NAFTA. Nevertheless, we still have to  settle certain issues with GATT. How can GATT attempt to  liberalize trade while imposing trade restrictions on the  bananas produced in Panama and the rest of Central America? Our  question is this: How can you gentlemen of GATT talk of  liberalizing trade while imposing restrictions on poor  banana-producing countries?"    Carles goes on to question GATT's desire to sell its  industrial products in Panama while placing import limits on the  region's agricultural products, and he adds that his government  would protect Panamanian workers, especially those who produce  foodstuffs such as meat, corn, rice, beans, onions, tomatoes,  and milk.    Candidate Jose Salvador Munoz is asked to explain his views  on development and the roles the state and private sector should  play in this development. Munoz says Panama's economy must  undergo a shake-up. He says: "The Panamanian state must, out of  necessity, make an initial investment in infrastructure --  namely schools, highways, and hospitals -- to generate the  confidence, jobs, and money that are needed to make the economy  function once again. Once this is done, the private sector can  address the rest of the problems."    When asked to outline his tax, spending, and investment  policies, candidate Lewis Galindo says the government is short  of funds and that the tax collection system must be improved.  Nevertheless, he says he does not favor an increase in taxes or  the creation of new taxes. Instead, he would perfect the tax  collection system. Galindo says: "The private sector and the  state must seek mechanisms with which to create a climate  favorable to investments, which will create better health  services, jobs, housing, and education for the Panamanian  people."    Candidate Ruben Blades is asked to comment on Panama's high  unemployment rate despite its economic growth and to outline the  specific steps he would take to provide permanent employment.  He says: "Panama has had an unemployment problem for many  decades, many years. It is the result of not having conducted  provincial-level studies to establish the natural and human  resources available in each province. Once these provincial  inventories -- which I advocate -- are conducted, we will truly  understand our country's potential and we will know which areas  to develop." Blades goes on to explain that unemployment comes  in various stages -- short-term, midterm, and long-term. He  agrees with Munoz that the government must invest in the  nation's infrastructure, and he adds that a job market should be  created for women.    Candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares follows by discussing the  solutions he would offer Panama Canal employees laid off when  the U.S. bases in Panama close. Perez says the military bases  are not an economic issue but a military one. He says that the  bases were once needed in Panama and elsewhere, but they are now  being closed because they are no longer necessary. "Numerous  former military installations that were going to be closed will  be reverted to Panama, the Torrijos-Carter treaties  notwithstanding. Of course the treaties mandate their closure  because they are no longer needed by the United States, which  established them here in the first place. I believe the  Panamanian people as a group must now face the challenge of  turning those sites into sources of national wealth through  investments and industry to generate skilled manpower for  well-paid permanent jobs and especially to produce industrial  and manufactured goods that can be exported."    Candidate Eduardo Vallarino is then asked what he would do  to  retain approximately 20 percent of the Panama Canal Commission's  employees, most of whom hold key positions and who will retire  on 31 December 1999 under the U.S. federal retirement system.  Vallarino says the answer is simple because the people in  question are Panamanians who will retire early, but who will  have the knowledge and experience their country needs. "I see  no reason why the Panamanian Government, through the Panama  Canal Authority, cannot extend their contracts."    Returning to Carles, moderator Berguido asks what solutions  his government would set forth to prevent the continued  deforestation of the Panama Canal Zone. Carles responds: "The  Panamanian people must understand that environmental protection  is a priority. I have already announced in various parts of the  country that my government platform includes a reforestation  program that will be duly financed." Carles gives assurances  that the reforestation sector will not be left without resources  to conduct its work. He says: "Reforestation is necessary to  conserve our waterways, all human life, farming, cattlebreeding,  and canal operations. Without water there can be no Canal."    Jose Munoz is asked what steps his government would adopt  to take greater advantage of the Canal. Munoz replies by saying  that current Canal policy must undergo a shake-up, just as the  economy must be shaken up. "Gentlemen," he says, "the Panama  Canal is ours, but unfortunately we have not trained any  employees for administrative positions. I believe that nearly  7,000 Panamanians are employed by the Canal Commission, but the  administrative positions are only filled by North Americans and  third-country nationals. This must change."    Candidate Lewis Galindo is asked to express his views  concerning the Canal's efficiency, cost effectiveness, and  transit rates in light of the competition that exists worldwide  in the field of transportation. Lewis Galindo says that almost  90 percent of the Canal workforce is Panamanian, adding that  when Panamanians take over all of the administrative positions,  efficiency will increase because they will be working for their  country. "The Canal will make the transition from being the  political institution that it is for the United States to an  entirely commercial undertaking for Panama," Lewis said.    Candidate Ruben Blades is quick to point out that the  reversion of the Panama Canal is a very serious problem. He  says the Endara government, as well as previous governments,  should have started the transition process "as soon as the ink  on the treaties dried." Blades explains that since 1978, Panama  has failed to do the things it should have. "On the other  hand," he adds, "the United States, through Law 90-76, greatly  distorted the initial purpose of the treaties. This law was  presented by Messrs. John Murphy and Robert Bowman, two  Republican congressmen, because the signing of a treaty does not  authorize its execution; a law is required. The two gentlemen  disagreed with the treaty negotiations and they presented the  law, which has completely hindered the transition." My  government, Blades adds, "will stand up to the United States.  We will deal with Law 90-76, which is hindering the return of  our Canal."    Candidate Perez Balladares is then asked a question on how  to  overcome the problems of a sluggish government bureaucracy and  red tape. He says that the efficiency of state bureaucracy  depends on the person at the helm. "I believe our efficiency  can be enhanced by some form of protection; a law that makes  government employees feel that their work is acknowledged, that  ensures they will be well paid and that they will not be pawns  in the country's political ups and downs." Regarding foreign  investment, Perez Balladares says that an office will be  established within the Presidency to handle government  contracts. This office, he says, also will deal with local  investors who want to procure government contracts.    Candidate Eduardo Vallarino is asked if his government is  contemplating the construction of a Panama-Chiriqui highway,  and, if so, how it would be financed. Vallarino says a  transisthmian highway in western Chiriqui would be much better  because Panama is an interoceanic country. His government, he  explained, would take advantage of this geographic fact.  Vallarino also endorses a Colon-Penonome highway, which would  give all of the central provinces direct access to European and  U.S. markets. As for the financing of these highways, he says  this can be resolved by granting concessions to private  companies to manage the highways. Vallarino blames Panama's  unemployment on "a lack of investments prompted by poor economic  policies, not only by the previous PRD government but by the  current government, which has not invested sufficiently."    Candidate Ruben Carles is asked to respond to the  authorities' neglect of Panama's historical sites and to explain  his plans to deal with this situation. Carles answers by  discussing the efforts of former Mayor Mayin Correa, who he  hopes will return to City Hall, and Panama's potential for  tourism. Carles says: "I have already spoken with some of the  leading tourism firms, perhaps the top cruise lines, so that as  soon as I am in a position to negotiate with them they can make  specific proposals for intensive tourism development in Panama,  on both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts." Carles goes on to  explain that many shipping companies are willing to operate in  Panama if the government can guarantee security, efficiency, and  public services.    When asked how a PPD government would educate people to  help them deal with a global economy, candidate Jose Salvador  Munoz says his party will revolutionize education in Panama,  which has been "neglected for an entire generation."    The moderator then asks Samuel Lewis Galindo about his plans  to have the private sector invest in low-cost housing. The  candidate answers by saying the 1972 laws which placed ceilings  on rent must be revised and that existing housing must be  improved, particularly in very poor neighborhoods.    To improve the effectiveness of the Public Force and the  Technical Judicial Police, Ruben Blades says his party will give  priority to public security because improved security is an  essential requirement for investment. To do this, however, the  root of the problem -- "that is to say, the lack of opportunity,  overcrowding, and a criminal subculture" -- must be attacked.  The situation will not be resolved by building larger prisons,  he says. The police must be given adequate equipment, training,  and leadership, and their salaries must be raised.    In discussing the legislature, candidate Ernesto Perez  Balladares says: "We will explore the possibility of eliminating  the position of substitute legislators, as has been done in  other countries, because the position inflates the number of  Assembly members and creates too much political pressure." He  also says democracy entails many expenses, such as the salaries  of lawmakers. He pledges to introduce legislation to eliminate  substitute legislator positions and the privilege whereby  legislators are permitted to import luxury cars tax free.    Discussing the demarcation of Indian regions, candidate  Eduardo Vallarino says he has visited the Indians in the  interior and that he agrees completely with the demarcation of  these areas because Indians deserve the government's support.    Candidate Ruben Dario Carles says he will eliminate the  inefficiency prevailing in the Department of Metropolitan  Sanitation by assigning greater responsibility to municipalities  in garbage disposal. He adds that privatization of this service  could provide a better solution on a long-term basis.    Asked about his government's plans to resolve the problem of  sewage being dumped into the sea and rivers, Munoz says "a  drastic solution" is required, adding that the problem is not  limited to sewage in Panama City but includes other population  centers as well.    Regarding environmental pollution and the next generation's  right to clean air, candidate Lewis Galindo says his  administration would emphasize environmental education. He also  says the number of cars must be controlled and other measures  must be taken.    The moderator then asks Ruben Blades about the problem of  deforestation. Blades answers that it is necessary to teach the  people who cut down trees that they are doing great harm to the  nation. He adds that the problem is closely associated with the  slash-and-burn method used by peasants in Panama.    In the closing round of the debate, the candidates are given  an opportunity to comment on the other candidates' remarks or  give a final message. Perez Balladares speaks first,  summarizing the positions he outlined earlier in the debate. He  ends by saying he has no doubts that Panama will turn concern  for the future into new opportunities for the Panamanian people.    Vallarino gives his final message next, saying he has  observed that the Panamanian people are tired of traditional  politicians and the same old promises. He says he is no  traditional politician and that he will work hard to enable more  Panamanians to have jobs. He finally invites people to vote for  the best candidate in the 8 May elections.    In his final statement, Carles begins by saying this debate  is not a debate in the true sense of the word. He adds that his  party has outlined specific proposals designed to restore  credibility to the state's management of finances. He concludes  by saying: "I will continue to act honestly, responsibly, and  firmly, as I have done all my life, apart from government and  interventionist schemes that have failed, that have plunged the  country into indebtedness, that have increased joblessness and  corruption, and that have led the country into chaos. I will  stimulate private initiative to create jobs. The Pamananian  people's standard of living will be improved through more jobs  and better public services. This country, particularly the  young people, are entitled to a brighter future. This can be  done with willingness, capability, experience, energy, and the  determination to do things right. This is what my government  will offer."    Jose Salvador Munoz gives his closing message next:  "Tonight I have spoken about a shake-up; this is not a drastic  or an arbitrary measure. What we are trying to do is eliminate  unemployment, corruption, lack of security, and other monsters  that are always plotting against the Panamanian nation. I ask  for your vote so that you can help me kill these monsters and  create a shake-up to achieve a better country."    Candidate Samuel Lewis Galindo ends by saying: "I do not see  myself as a politician and I have not been a professional  politician. I have worked in private enterprise for 45 years,  developing and creating business enterprises, as well as  creating jobs for thousands of Panamanians. I want to offer  this experience to the Panamanian state because a change is  necessary."    The last to speak is Ruben Blades, who explains he comes  from  a family that never lost hope in the future and that he has  worked very hard to make a living. Blades adds, "Hopefully, we  are trying to create a common ground by way of the Papa Egoro  Movement. There are some who tell me that we do not have much  experience in politics. I tell them we do have experience, but  only as victims of the process." Blades then says: "We are  truly offering the opportunity to justify our right, as a  nation, to place our hope in the field of politics." He  concludes by saying, "I am a politician out of self-defense. I  hope that on 8 May you will not forget us."</p>

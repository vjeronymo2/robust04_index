			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Major ready to accept US Ulster envoy MR JOHN MAJOR will tell President Bill Clinton next week that he is ready to accept with good grace the despatch by the new US administration of a peace envoy to Northern Ireland. The prime minister's decision not to make an issue of President Clinton's pledge to adopt a higher profile in the affairs of the province follows assurances from Washington that the role of such a mission would be 'fact-finding'. Officials on both sides of the Atlantic anticipate that the understanding between the two leaders will avoid the risk of differences over human rights in Ulster souring the atmosphere of their first meeting in Washington next week. President Clinton's aides have also made it clear in advance of the talks that he has no intention of challenging Britain's permanent place on the United Nations Security Council. The administration has stressed that recent remarks by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, suggesting that the composition of the security council be brought 'up to date' were wrongly interpreted in Britain as a challenge to the UK seat. The two leaders' talks on Wednesday will focus on the broad range of international issues facing both the US and Europe, with the crisis in the former Yugoslavia and the stalled Gatt trade talks at the top of the agenda. But irritation among Conservative MPs at the new administration's interest in the position of the Roman Catholic minority in Northern Ireland had threatened to cloud their crucial first meeting. US diplomats confirmed yesterday that President Clinton intended to explore with Mr Major 'one or two' specific proposals for despatch of an emissary to talk to leaders of the political parties in Ulster. They stressed that President Clinton would not give such an envoy the 'mediation' role which was suggested during his election campaign against President George Bush. The emissary's contacts would be confined to the leaders of legitimate political parties and he or she would not make contact with any illegal paramilitary groups in the province. For his part Mr Major is expected to underline his concern that the Democratic administration should not encourage the enforcement in US states of the so-called MacBride principles. These principles encourage companies operating in the province to discriminate positively in favour of Catholics but the UK government argues that the measure deters inward investment into Northern Ireland. George Graham in Washington adds: Reports that Mr Tom Foley, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, might be named a special envoy to Northern Ireland were discounted last night by Mr Foley's office. 'It is not realistic,' his office said. 'Frankly, there just isn't time. We are looking at a big legislative programme and we have to be here.'</p>

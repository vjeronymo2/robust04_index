Reform heretofore can be roughly divided into two stages. In its  first stage, i.e., from 1978 to 1991, reform was carried out in  rural areas first, and afterward in urban areas; in the domain  of distribution, and then in that of production; in enterprise  management structure, and then in ownership structure; in  commodity price adjustment, and then in their relaxation; and in  consumer goods markets, and then in capital markets. This was a  progressive pattern of reform in order of priorities, which was  a path in keeping with China's actual conditions, and in  particular, with the structure and development background at the  initial stage of reform. Hence, the reform attained success,  made momentous advances, and gave impetus to the change of the  entire economic structure from a planned economy to a socialist  market economy.    Although reform at the first stage could not be referred to  simplistically as having forged ahead in single items and  penetrated in depth by isolated forces, yet reform indeed had  not been carried out in a comprehensive way. As a selected  strategy, reform was guided by the principle of decentralizing  power and granting benefits to lower levels so that it could  make steady advances. As the ultimate goal of transforming the  entire structure was not clear at the beginning, however, reform  could be carried out only one step after another, just like  "feeling the stones in order to wade across the river," so that  inevitably it was restricted in breadth, as well as in depth.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping's remarks during his south China tour  in early 1992, as well as the 14th National Party Congress,  oriented the transformation of the entire economic structure  toward the establishment of a socialist market economic  structure, which brought the reform theory as a policy guide to  a new height. With the distinct orientation of reform goal,  there came a juncture, at which we entered a new stage of  economic reform, and conditions are ripe for reform to select a  strategy of changing from gradual to accelerated progress, from  a partial to an overall scale, and from tentative experiments to  comprehensive planning. Accelerated and coordinated reform,  however, call for even more careful consideration and  preparations. Reform in 1993 was conducted against precisely  this background. Judging from the high plane of reform  strategy, 1993 was a year in which reform was pushed forward and  the move to a new stage was effected. It also was a year in  which theory was systemized and plans were worked out for the  upcoming comprehensive, coordinated reform. In the meantime,  some reform measures in conformity with market economy  development were introduced at a new level during the year.    As reform at this new stage has a higher degree of  comprehensiveness and continuity, we must not demand that  prominent results be scored in a certain single year, but must  base ourselves on an overall and long-term assessment. What is  more, the problems existing in the course of economic operation  at present stem primarily from the frictions of the double-track  system, which was the inevitable result of the deep-rooted  conflicts of the old structure in the transition from the  commodity economy to the market economy. Although the  "intensified macroeconomic regulation and control" measures  taken in the summer and fall of 1993, and the parameter  regulation mechanism [canshu tiaojie jizhi 0639 2422 6148 4634  2623 0455] introduced in parallel with them could not completely  break away from the regulative mode of the traditional planned  economy, yet the practice of flexibly applying "fine tuning" and  intensifying the pivotal macromanagement role of finance --  particularly banking -- definitely has seized hold of the basic  elements of macroeconomic regulative mechanism to converge with  the market economy. Certainly, in face of current problems, we  should analyze their prominent causes and discover ways to solve  them. To accelerate the pace of reform in the new stage, and  particularly in 1994, we should put forward pragmatic  countermeasures. These are the obligations and duties of all  economists, and are the basic starting points of this research  paper.  <H5>  Reform Achievements Attained During the Juncture </H5>   In 1993, the central authorities concentrated forces from  various quarters on the design of a blueprint for comprehensive  reform, and put forward coordinated reform plans starting from  five areas: Finance, taxation, investment, enterprises, and  social insurance. This was a tremendous achievement, as it  defined the action items for reform in the new stage, after  having summarized the economic reform experience over the past  15 years. Without doubt, since 1984, whenever a more broad scale  reform measure has been introduced, a program has been worked  out, but this program has been either a rough outline or the  sudden advance of a single item, and has not called for  comprehensive coordination in accordance with the market  economy. The reform program made in 1993, however, was a major  coordinated one, based on the market, which made proper  preparations for comprehensive structural reform in the second  stage.    In the sequence of the reform process, the substance and  intensity of reform cannot be even or with equal value, so they  may be large one year and small another. Generally speaking, in  a year when reform has less content, we will have our eyes on  the rectification of economic order and the solution of new  contradictions that have become conspicuous so as to create a  fine environment for reform in the next step. The 1989-91  campaign to "improve economic environment and rectify economic  order," and the "macroeconomic regulation and control" exercised  from July to October 1993 all belonged to this category. The  previous retrenchment of the economy, however, while a  comprehensive one, had an excessively large intensity and lasted  for an excessively long time. Moreover, it depended mainly on  administrative fiats to reduce projects, cut investments, and  control the growth of demand with targets set at a low pace in  order to achieve a man-made "equilibrium of demand and supply."  As a result, the market was sluggish for two and a half years,  which was an aftermath of the three-year economic improvement  and rectification. In addition, when a favorable environment  for reform emerged, we failed to seize the opportunity to  increase the content of reform, thus missing an excellent chance  to bring about the move from the first stage to the second at  the earliest possible date.    In contrast with the former economic retrenchment, the one  in  1993 was not comprehensive. It lasted for only some six months,  and its intensity was comparatively less. Moreover, traditional  target controls were replaced by parametric controls. On the  one hand, we regulated residents' and enterprises' action on  money by flexibly readjusting exchange rates so as to stabilize  them and ensure the renminbi's reputation and position. In  particular, the exchange-rate unification efforts have provided  experience and lessons for the monetary reform which certainly  will be carried out in the future. On the other hand, although  interest rates were readjusted by a narrower margin, the move  basically halted over-expanded investment, promoted residents'  inclination to save, curbed overly dynamic consumption,  stabilized the market, and acted to bring about a "soft  landing." Without doubt, this parametric control was achieved  through the government's direct intervention, which is still a  certain distance away from the parametric management of a  developed market economy. The problem is that under a structure  in which banks are not separate from the government,  "independence of banks" and "commercialization of specialized  banks" are only theories and not realities, the central bank  does not possess independent and stable economic functions and  power, and "bank presidents take orders from government  officials," nothing can be accomplished in macroeconomic  regulation and control without direct government intervention.  In the transition from the traditional planned economy to a  socialist market economy and from direct control to indirect  regulation and control, more often than not there are  circumstances in which people have no way of talking about the  new structure and cannot help but draw support from the old one.  Here, the self-innovation of the old structure is meaningful  because it provides suitable space for the gradual growth of the  new structure. The macroeconomic regulation and control during  the summer and fall of 1993 was an example. As for the cooling  down of the property market, its principal target was to  restrict the development of the "bubble economy" and to avoid  having already- tight funds flow into real estate in excessive  amounts, lest the bottleneck constraints in basic industries --  including transport, communications, and so on -- be aggravated.  Moreover, most of the funds presently used in stock and  property speculation are public funds, so if this a practice is  not controlled before the establishment of a new structure,  people can hardly bear to imagine the consequences of the total  explosion of accumulated contradictions. Meanwhile, it is very  difficult to maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic  development as well.    The operation of economic policies in 1993 can be summarized  as "grasping with two hands simultaneously." On one hand, we  grasped macroeconomic regulation and control so as to avoid  economic decline and maintain a high growth rate while reigning  in the excessively heated economy. On the other, we grasped  system innovation so as to accelerate the pace of national  economic operation and market regulative mechanisms, while  drawing up plans for comprehensive reform. Apart from these  achievements, remarkable advances made by reform in 1993 also  were manifested in the following aspects:  <H5>  1. Tackling the key points of price reform. </H5>   Tremendous achievements in price reform had been attained  during the first 13 years of reform in China. By 1992, the  proportions of prices fixed by the market in agricultural and  sideline products, in the total retail sales volume of social  commodities, and in means of production were 78.5, 79.6, and  64.2 percent, respectively. The shares of goods value regulated  by the market in agricultural and sideline products and consumer  goods were 77.8 and 83.4 percent, respectively, of which  industrial consumer goods were 78.1 percent, and means of  production were 61.8 percent. In 1993, the prices of grain and  other items regarded as having a bearing on the national economy  and people's livelihood were totally freed and were fixed  chiefly by the market. Grain coupons were abolished entirely,  and the original practice of rationing was replaced by free  purchases in markets. Although grain trading between peasants  and the state, and the fixing of commodity prices had to be  conducted with government participation, yet this participation  had to act according to the laws governing supply and demand.    Under conditions in which the grain supply was relatively  sufficient, a buyer's market emerged with regard to certain  commodities, the proportion of expenditure in grain consumption  dropped, and price rises caused by the lifting of price controls  did not exert a considerable pressure and impact on residents'  lives. So this move to cast away traditional concepts and lift  controls over grain distribution and prices was a timely and  successful one, thus adding new experience to the "endeavor to  win opportunities for reform."    The change from grain-rationing to market regulation and  the fixing of prices on the basis of supply and demand shows  that China has tackled the price-reform problem. This has  strengthened our confidence in pushing forward the reforms in  rent and commercialized residential housing.  <H5>  2. Placing the establishment of a modern enterprise system </H5> on the agenda.    The establishment of a modern enterprise system is a basic  item of the reform package program. It has broadened the field  of vision for enterprise reform, for it shows that in-depth  enterprise reform does not involve the mere delegation of  management rights to lower levels and the explicit definition of  property rights, but is a combination of the two. Therefore, we  must select and rebuild an operational mechanism for enterprises  in light of the requirements of fair competition and optimum  efficiency. There are two basic meanings in this: 1) In  speeding up the transformation of mechanisms in state-owned  enterprises, the questions of whether we should take the road of  practicing a company system in these enterprises, and of how  many such enterprises should be run by local people, how many  formed into joint-stock companies, and how many should remain  unitary state-owned and community-run enterprises, cannot be  decided artificially by prestipulated targets, but must be  determined in accordance with the requirements of market  development. 2) The operational mechanism should be applicable  to all sorts of enterprises -- including state-owned,  collective, and private enterprises -- and in order to provide  conditions for equal competition for all enterprises, it is  necessary to practice a unified tax system, and to allow funds  and labor to flow freely.  3. The initial progress in the establishment of production  factor markets.    Taking the establishment of a modern enterprise system as a  basic task of microscopic reform, people logically put forward  the issue of building factor markets. In 1993, the financing  channels in China tended to become diversified, the volume of  free trade in money markets increased to some extent, and in  foreign exchange swap markets, in particular, the government  reduced restrictions on quotas and widened the range for  automatic regulation of market supply and demand. Under the  dangerous situation of uncommon depreciation of the yuan,  instead of artificially restricting its exchange rate, we raised  interest rates on one hand, while on the other, we sold  government gold and foreign exchange reserves in large  quantities to narrow the supply-and-demand gap in foreign  exchange. In addition, we changed the methods by which  residents and enterprises anticipated currency value  fluctuations so as to stabilize money markets. By so doing, we  not only avoided posting obstacles for future in-depth monetary  reform, but demonstrated the possibility and feasibility of  establishing a unified exchange rate system in China.    In a country like China which has an almost unlimited supply  of labor, the growth of labor markets, and particularly the  formation of labor markets in the state-owned economic sphere,  will be a major reform project. In 1993, initial progress was  made in two aspects with regard to the growth of labor markets  in the state-owned economy: 1) Internal labor markets came into  being, and the practice of "one factory, two systems" regarding  arrangements for positions increased the flexibility of capital  and labor reorganization in enterprises; 2) Second-occupation  markets took shape which smashed the previous convention that  labor was not allowed to flow between state and nonstate  enterprises.  <H5>  4. The accelerated development of the private economy. </H5>   Another major reform achievement in 1993 was the accelerated  development of the private and individual economies with the  following characteristics: 1) The number of newly registered  units grew rapidly. Taking the first quarter of 1993 as an  example, on the basis of 15.53 million individual industrial and  commercial units having been registered across the country in  1992, a total of 153,000 units was newly added, representing an  increase of 10 percent or so. In Shanghai, the net increase in  the first half of last year reached 2,000 units, with an average  of 10 units going into operation each day, and in Dalian, the  registered units in the first half of 1993 came to 1,284, a  growth of 540 percent. 2) Private sectors held stocks in  state-owned enterprises, which was particularly conspicuous in  rural areas and the southeastern coastal region. In the city of  Huzhou, in Zhejiang Province, all the 34 state-owned or  town-and-township collectively owned silk industry enterprises  succeeded in operating as joint ventures, with individuals  holding 60 to 80 percent of the shares. At present, individual  and private owners are trying to gain access to large cities, as  well as to state-owned and collective economies with a promising  development momentum. Although this was not brought about by  the obvious introduction of reform measures, and although -- in  a certain sense -- they can be regarded as "spontaneous reform,"  yet they are closely related to the government's policy on the  relaxation of the ownership structure.  <H5>  5. Initial achievements in reform of the social insurance </H5> system.    Since the beginning of the 1990's, the nationwide reforms in  the areas of medical care, housing, retirement, and provision  for old age have been placed in an important position. However,  it was not until the publication of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  remarks during his south China tour that the reform process was  expedited, and 1993 was the year in which these reforms were  noticeably precipitated. Take the reform in publicly owned  residential premises as an example. The method of "walking on  two legs," which meant "raising rents while making allowances"  or selling at preferential prices, was employed in various  localities. In the practice of raising rents while making  allowances, the aim was achieved in either one or three steps.  Although rents and sales prices were generally on the low side  and a relatively great difference existed between them and  market prices, so that consideration of thoroughgoing reform  measures was necessary, yet it was very important to take the  first step. Similarly, it was unrealistic to reform the welfare  system at one go.    In addition to the efforts made in 1993, other reform  actions  also were taken in the areas of government administrative  bodies, security of tax distribution, enterprise external  environment, and so on. However, reforms in these areas  generally did not extricate themselves from the framework of the  traditional planned economy. Judging from the requirements for  the overall growth of a new economic structure, they obviously  lagged behind, which was precisely the essential root cause of  conflicts and problems existing in the current dual-track system.    The Background of the New Structure: Contradictions  and Difficulties    Reform has entered a new stage. Previously, it was advancing  on a superficial level, at a low speed, and by partial  coordination; now it is advancing on a profound level, with a  higher speed, and by overall coordination. Hence, reform cannot  be plain sailing, and will be confronted with a number of  contradictions and difficulties. If we say that what reform  faced in the 1980's was the unitary structure of the traditional  planned economy, under which all neglected things waited to be  done and people longed for change so that something could be  accomplished, even though reform was being conducted on a  superficial level, then in the 1990's, when reform is faced with  the frictions caused by the dual-track system, it is even more  difficult to carry out reform in an overall and coordinated way  and to make further advances on a profound level. Moreover,  reform in the areas of property right structure, reorganization  of employment, the transformation from welfare on ration to  welfare entirely on the basis of the market, a remolded  financial system of competitive banks, the rebuilding of  government functions in line with the requirements of a market  economy, and so on -- which are the primary tasks for reform at  the new stage -- may be confronted with challenges from vested  interests in various quarters, so that there probably will be  new contradictions and difficulties in the economic reality and  reform process.    First, although the transformation of operational mechanisms  in enterprises--particularly in state-owned enterprises -- was  proposed several years ago, and the establishment of a modern  enterprise system was put forward in 1993, it was very difficult  to effect a fundamental breakthrough in reality. A few years  ago, quite a few people were accustomed to attributing this to  our failing to emancipate our minds and to our outmoded  theoretical understanding, but in fact the issue is not as  simple as that. If we say that before the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee there really was a task of  breaking down traditional concepts on the reform of state-owned  property rights, then since the ideas of "explicitly defining  property rights" and accelerating property rights reform were  written in the plenum's "Decisions," people have acquired common  understanding now. So will the transformation of operational  mechanisms in state-owned enterprises and the establishment of a  modern enterprise system be achieved because of this? No, they  will not.    The transformation of operational mechanisms in state-owned  enterprises and the establishment of a modern enterprise system  mean accelerating the reorganization of employment, which  definitely calls for staff reductions, so that quite a number of  the existing staff and workers will face reductions in force.  Once the command [jun ling zhuang 6511 0109 3692] to develop a  market economy and foster fair competition is issued, it is  necessary to establish and promote a labor market without  hesitation. As a result of emphasizing efficiency and  competition, unemployment is inevitable. This was why we  proposed the tentative idea of "setting up job markets while  bringing unemployment into the open" when we were drawing up the  1987-88 reform program. It is inconceivable to practice a market  economy without unemployment and without labor markets. As far  as state-owned enterprises are concerned, the difficulty in  putting this idea into effect does not lie in the fact that  workers cannot adapt themselves to such a concept, but in the  lack of a suitable external environment. Under the present  circumstances in which publicly owned residences, pensions,  price allowances, various subsidies, and health insurance  premiums all are handled by work units, and in which the system  of government unemployment relief has not been set up, if large  numbers of staff are laid off and pushed into society, how can  they get along without wages, residences, and other material  benefits? Among the current 150 million staff and workers,  there are 110 million working in state-owned enterprises,  accounting for more than two-thirds of the total. Even if  one-tenth of them are laid off, these will number more than 10  million, and calculated with a dependency coefficient of 1.72,  this means that more than 27.2 million people may be  empty-handed and homeless. Moreover, there now are some 100  million surplus rural laborers in China who have to be  transferred to work in nonagricultural sectors. An average of  13 million among the population reach working age and join the  ranks of laborers every year, and there are 10 to 30 million  people who may be laid off from collective enterprises. These  people will constitute enormous competitive pressure on the  surplus laborers in state-owned units in their efforts toward  re-employment.    It is necessary to resolve the problem of personnel in  state-owned units who have job titles but actually have no work  to do, through the mechanisms of bankruptcy, the survival of the  strong and the elimination of the weak, while simultaneously  overcoming the difficulty of the surplus personnel available for  reemployment and ensuring the lives of their families. These  are the knotty problems of reform for the next two years, and  also the major contradictions and difficulties reform will face  throughout the second stage.    In addition, the 15 years of reform basically have smashed  the excessively concentrated centralization system of the past,  and by delegating power to enterprises and local governments,  some of the central government's controlling power has been  shifted to markets and local governments. However, the  phenomenon of local governments having excessive power also  exists. At present, there are three problems in the actions of  local governments: 1) Turning back regulation [ni xiang tiao  jie 6627 0686 6148 4634] by higher authorities; 2) directly  intervening in lower authorities; and 3) blockading neighboring  localities. The aim of all this is to safeguard their local  interests. Proceeding from the requirements for developing a  socialist market economy, China must establish a unified market  and maintain fair competition among various localities, so that  enterprises will be able to free themselves from the  administrative control of the central government, as well as  direct intervention by local governments, whereas governments at  all levels may act only as providers of services, and their  actions -- particularly those of local governments -- can be  regulated by markets, just like all microeconomic main bodies.  There is still a very long way to go, judging from the present  situation.    Local governments' turning away regulation by the higher  levels and their actions against control are manifested chiefly  in the economic readjustment period. Every time the central  policies regarding structure or total supply and demand were not  put into effect, the cause did not rest primarily with  enterprises, but with local governments because when the central  authorities intended to reduce speed appropriately and rein in  the heated economy, the localities where the economy was already  excessively heated would comply publicly, but oppose privately.  Even though the statistics in their reports showed that they  had slowed the pace, in fact they still persisted in resolving  the local employment problem at a high speed and in raising  their development level. In the area of readjusting structure,  despite the central authorities' repeated emphasis on  accelerating the development of transport, communications, and  other bottleneck industries by cooling down the growth of the  manufacturing industry, local governments usually defied central  instructions and put their manpower, material, and financial  resources into the manufacturing industry because of the high  added value and enormous profits in this industry and the long  cycle of basic industries. Consequently, structural  readjustment was always unsatisfactory, and the obstacles to  readjustment of the structure and of total supply and demand did  not rest with enterprises, but with local governments.    Local governments' direct intervention in the affairs of  lower levels is increasingly intense, along with the expansion  of the scope of reform through the delegation of power to lower  levels and permission for them to retain some profits. The main  objects of their invention are enterprises, banks, and peasants.  They all complain of the numerous kinds of apportionments for  manpower, money, articles, and charges, and of the "great  numbers of mothers- in-law." In fact, this was done mostly by  local government organs at various levels. Direct intervention  in the main bodies of the market -- banks, in particular --  seriously hindered the normal growth of a market economy.    Local protectionism or regional economic blockades not only  led to redundant construction and identical choices of products  and techniques among localities, but also hampered the formation  of a nationwide unified market.    The non-market behaviors of local governments toward the  higher, lower, and lateral authorities have become the principal  contradiction in economic operations and reform at present.  Owing to the considerable power and great economic strength in  the hands of local governments, the complicated circumstances of  uneven economic conditions and interests, and the lack of  appropriate regulations to restrain the conduct of local  governments following the reduction of central power, the  transformation of functions of local governments will become a  tough problem in the new stage. The pure revenue-sharing system  can only solve the tax distribution between the central and  local governments, but cannot achieve the aim of redefining the  functions of local governments in line with the requirements of  a market economy.    Second, there is the problem that reform of the banking  system has lagged behind. After 15 years of reform, China has  begun the diversified development of its financing channels.  Apart from the channels of taking deposits and extending  credits, there are other forms of fund-raising, such as  government or enterprise bonds, stocks, and so on. The  distribution of funds, however, is still considerably affected  by the supply system, and in a certain sense, funds have more  market factors in "external circulation" than in the "internal  circulation." The reason "internal circulation" has more  non-market factors can be attributed primarily to the  integration of banks with the government. The People's Bank of  China is not an independent and unified body with the right to  issue currency because it cannot make independent decisions  concerning money supply and price regulation, and is controlled  by the administrative officials of the central government.  Moreover, the placement of loans by various specialized banks,  particularly by their branches, is restrained by local  governments, so that they are subordinated to local  administrative officials rather than to the market. Meanwhile,  banks continue to maintain state monopoly, reject the mechanism  of eliminating the weak, and lack competition, so that internal  circulation funds are controlled too rigidly, the direction of  their utilization is unreasonable, and their efficiency is very  low.    Under market economy conditions, banking is the axis of  national economic activities, banks are regulating centers, and  interest rates are determined by market supply and demand. In  China, however, banking, banks, and interest rates currently  remain under the direct manipulation of the government.  Changing this pattern and molding a new, independent,  diversified, competitive, and effective banking system naturally  has become the third theme and tough problem in the new stage of  reform. The crux here also lies in the solution of  contradictions between governments and enterprises and between  the central and local governments in terms of interests and  power distribution.  <H5>  The Key Selections in the Process of Expediting Market Growth </H5>   In the past 15 years, an outstanding achievement attained by  China in transforming economic mechanisms is the establishment  of a competitive price system, which represents a change from  the previous practice of fixing prices in a planned, unitary way  to one of prices being fixed by the market under the guidance of  the government. The focal point of reform in 1994 and of the  entire new stage is the transformation of operational mechanisms  in state-owned enterprises. Focusing on this point, reform will  be carried out and breakthroughs made in the following aspects:  <H5>  1.The establishment of a modern enterprise system. </H5>   The main battlefield of economic reform in 1994 and the next  period is the state-owned enterprise, and the transformation  from the existing state-owned enterprise structure to a modern  enterprise system. To this end, it is necessary to achieve  system innovation both within state-owned enterprises and  without. The theme of internal reform remains the change of  property rights, while that of external reform includes the  following three basic aspects: The welfare structure,  government functions, and the banking structure.    In the transformation of the state-owned property rights  management mechanism, the loudest voice from theoretical circles  is the establishment of limited-liability companies and  joint-stock limited companies. It seems that this is an  inevitable move for the establishment of modern enterprise and  market systems. There is a wide range of choices for practicing  a joint-stock system. The numbers of shares can be great or  small, according to the size of the companies, and both  organizations representing state interests and residents are  free to join or to buy stocks. This organizational pattern for  property rights can go beyond a village, city, region, or  country, and so is conducive to the circulation, concentration,  and breakdown of funds. However, in light of the current huge  scale of state-owned assets and property rights, it may not be  practicable to set up purely joint-stock limited companies, so  we must consider a wider variety of choices. Apart from  developing joint-stock limited companies, we also should develop  other appropriate organizational patterns, such as partnerships  and sole proprietorships, and should carry out the change into  these types of companies through auctions, leases, contracts,  sales, and so on. In the course of reorganizing property  rights, without doubt, it is necessary to assimilate the  "company culture" of European and U.S. enterprises, while  preserving the "individual and family culture" retained by China  itself. The economic prosperity of the Chinese communities in  Taiwan, Singapore, and Southeast Asia has proven that the latter  also can be combined ingeniously with the modern market economy.  To develop these two types of property rights organizational  patterns, we can sell small state-owned enterprises to  individuals or families, or sell some factory branches to them  and allow them free choice of organizational pattern. While  reforming the enterprise system, no matter what methods we  adopt, we must strictly reappraise the properties, funds, and  assets of enterprises so as to avoid the loss of state-owned  assets.    Enterprise reform must be carried out both internally and  externally. A few years ago, no prominent results were achieved  in the transformation of enterprise mechanisms. This was due  primarily to the lack of a good external environment. Those  that should have gone bankrupt and been eliminated failed to do  so, and the surplus personnel who should have been reduced still  held onto their posts. This was due to the difficulties in  re-employment and the immobility of a welfare system based on  the work unit, so that the dismissal of staff and workers meant  the loss of various material benefits provided by the units,  including residential quarters, medical care, pensions, and  others. As the first step toward accelerating the  transformation of enterprise mechanisms in the next few years,  we must accelerate welfare distribution on a socialized and  market basis. The measures for this are as follows:    1. We should institute a socialized insurance system for  unemployment, old age, and medical care; establish a national  social insurance bureau; and allow people to set up various  kinds of insurance companies that assume sole responsibility for  their own profits and losses. These measures will serve to free  laborers and their families from worrying about their health,  medical treatment, retirement, old age, and unemployment, and  from relying on their work units.    2. We should change the current system of residential  quarters being provided by work units, and let companies  operating as enterprises attend to the management of all  publicly owned houses. In the housing reform a few years ago, we  focused our attention on raising property prices in order to  reduce the financial burdens on governments and enterprises  brought about by housing construction. To do so, we implemented  the method of readjusting prices and selling some housing on  favorable terms. Still we failed to commercialize housing.  Here, the difficulty did not rest with residents' insufficient  tolerance for the increased rents and prices, nor with the  complicated nature of operations, but in the fact that the  socialization of publicly owned housing must be achieved prior  to their commercialization, and that the distribution of housing  must be controlled by socialized companies rather than by  different units. It is only after houses are socialized that  laborers are able to flow freely among different enterprises.    3. With regard to enterprise reform, a good external  environment also contains a flexible capital-rebuilding [zi ben  chong jian 6327 2609 6850 1696] system. At present, China's  enterprise system is one under which "workers are always  workers, while managers are always managers." The  administrative restrictions on capital rebuilding are  multifarious, with excessively high "thresholds" and an  inordinate number of conventions for the registration of new  companies because their establishment must be subjected to  examination and approval by several departments, with many  public seals affixed to their applications. Once they are  registered, it is very difficult for them to go bankrupt. Under  a developed market economy, however, things are just the  opposite. The "threshold for registration is low, while the  maintenance of their operations is difficult." If the  above-mentioned abnormal phenomenon is not changed, it will have  a detrimental effect on the formation of bankruptcy and  unemployment mechanisms in enterprises. Under the new system,  when workers are out of jobs and cannot find work in other  units, they can either pool funds or borrow money to set up  firms or factories and become bosses themselves. As small  enterprises grow in multitude, more laborers will be absorbed,  and more outlets will be opened for surplus personnel in  state-owned units.  <H5>  2. The transformation of government functions at two levels. </H5>   The basic requirement for the establishment of a modern  enterprise system is to eliminate direct government  intervention. This calls for the thorough transformation of  government functions, those of the local governments in  particular. First, we should separate government functions from  those of enterprises, run "enterprises without mothers-in-law"  on a grand scale, and prohibit government administrative  departments from directly meddling in enterprise activities.  Governments will be responsible only for legislation, the  formulation of rules, and the collection of taxes, whereas the  adoption of stimulatory or retrenching economic policies and the  coordination of enterprise behavior should be effected entirely  by market parameters. As for direct government investment  projects, their development also should be entrusted to  enterprises operating as companies, rather than being undertaken  by government administrative organs.    Governments will take  charge of public undertakings only, including the formulation  and implementation of local tax regulations according to the  practice of the revenue-sharing system, the management of the  ecological environment, public investment in local  infrastructure facilities, and so on. The realization of  transforming government functions covers the following two  aspects: The functions of the central government (here, only  its economic functions are referred to), and those of the local  governments. In principle, the functions of the central  government can be defined as: 1) Exercising macroeconomic  regulation and control over the national economy, which means  managing and balancing macroscopic employment, inflation, money  supply, interest rate level, national tax level, and economic  growth; 2) making arrangements for social insurance at the state  level, which means providing relief for poor and jobless people,  arranging the lives of retired and senior citizens, granting  allowances to ex-servicemen, and so on; 3) undertaking  interprovincial capital construction projects; and 4) engaging  in research and development of monopolized natural resources,  extra large-sized scientific and high-technology projects, and  national education.    Local governments will administer public affairs only within  their own localities. The fundamental differences in  administrative functions between the central and local  governments are manifested chiefly in: 1) The scope of division  of work, that is, the central government administers overall  affairs, while local governments handle partial ones; and 2)  local governments have not the power of macroeconomic regulation  and control with regard to the issuance and operation of  currency. The direct relation of governments at these two  levels to all enterprises is through tax revenue only; other  regulatory actions must be performed with the aid of those two  intermediaries: The law and the market.  <H5>  3. The molding of an independent, diversified, and </H5> competitive banking system.    The establishment of a modern enterprise system calls for  the  coordination of a modern banking system. At present, in  addition to excessive government intervention with respect to  commodity supply, sales, and prices, as well as employment,  enterprises still have no freedom in the use of funds, as they  are still affected by the fund ration system. This is not  purely an issue concerning the management standards of banks  because it is due mainly to the intervention of government  officials in the banking business, the root cause of which lies  in the fact that specialized banks are not operating as  enterprises and have not severed their links with the  government. In developed countries that practice a market  economy, both the commercial banks -- which operate as  enterprises -- and the central bank -- which implements monetary  policy -- maintains the balance of money supply and demand, and  regulates and controls interest rates at a macro level, are  independent; direct intervention by any government  administrative body is against the law. This shows a high  degree of operational independence in their banking system  because the banks are held responsible for macroeconomic  equilibrium. The U.S. banking system is the most developed in  the world, with the highest degree of independence, whereas  Japanese and German banks have more intervention from the  governments. This is not direct intervention, however, and it  usually is exercised through the law. In designing and  establishing a new banking system, China can use the experience  of Japan and Germany as reference, and emulate the U.S. model.    Like enterprise reform, there is also an issue of  introducing  a mechanism of competition in banking structural reform. At  present, banks in China are run exclusively by the state, so  there is no competition among them. Can we not try to set up  joint-stock banks? People are more wary of this because it is  more difficult to control banking than it is to control such  tangible assets as land, properties, and enterprises. If there  is something wrong with the reform of material assets, it is  easier to put it right, but if the reform of banking assets goes  wrong, it will be very difficult to smooth things over.  Besides, a trade that deals with money easily can make  exorbitant profits. If the government has no distinct bank  management regulations, there will be a great disparity in their  policy-related income. It is necessary to handle appropriately  banks' tax payments for their profits earned from the spread  between interest paid on deposits and interest received from  loans, and the conduct of banks also should be standardized by a  set of corresponding legal provisions. All this should be  considered in a meticulous and strict manner. Therefore, we  should have a preparatory process of legislation and system  design before selecting a new banking system that takes state  ownership as a main body with the coexistence of multiple  ownership forms. When the conditions are not ripe, it is  inappropriate to set up joint-stock, private, or  exclusively-owned banks in a hasty manner. From a long-term  perspective, however, we should take them into consideration.  Molding an independent, diversified, and competitive banking  system is the only way to develop a socialist market economy.  <H5>  4. The institution of a public financial system, under which </H5> every citizen has the obligation to pay taxes.    Enterprises are the main bodies of the market, so the growth  of a market economy depends primarily on the formation of these  main bodies. However, the socialist market economy is not  laissez-faire; in addition to a greater extent and broader range  of government intervention than in the Western market economy,  there is another important characteristic, which is that  redistribution means should be employed to achieve a higher  degree of equality. Hence, this involves the issues of state  taxes and of distributive relations between the "state" and the  "people."    The major means to properly handle the distributive  relations  between the "state" and the "people" is taxation. When there  are more taxes, the state benefits, and when there are fewer  taxes, the people benefit. Before reform, China's tax system  was very simple, with few categories of taxes and low tariff  rates, which changed very little. The principal reasons for  this situation were: 1) There were no private enterprises, and  state-owned enterprises handed over their profits in lieu of  taxes; 2) the income of urban and rural residents was generally  low, so they did not have to pay income taxes; and 3) peasants  handed over grain to the state as taxes.    Some changes have  taken place since reform, which include: State-owned  enterprises pay taxes instead of profits; private and other  enterprises have become more and more important as taxpayers;  urban and rural residents pay personal income taxes because they  earn more money; and peasants' payment of taxes in kind has been  changed to payment of taxes in cash. Along with these changes  in the tax system, tax regulations should undergo reform, and  tax categories and rates also should be readjusted appropriately  through the enactment of powerful tax laws so as to prevent the  state treasury from being drained off. We failed to do this in  previous years, and there were some errors in our policies in  this area because the old tax system was increasingly out of  keeping with the new economic situation. Therefore, it is a  top-priority task to accelerate reform of the tax system.    Recently, reform of the tax system has been fixed as one of  the five major reforms. This shows that the central authorities  have taken the issue of the tax system very seriously. Judging  from the momentum of propaganda and policy implementation,  however, it seems that greater emphasis has been placed on  solving the issue of the revenue-sharing system with regard to  the financial-revenue relationship between the central and local  authorities. Without doubt, the implementation of the  revenue-sharing system is very important because it can bring  about the distribution of tax revenues among the central and  local authorities through distinct powers, responsibilities, and  interests, and thus lay a foundation for breaking with the  highly centralized financial structure. In the future,  wrangling between the central government and localities and  among various localities can be reduced, so that governments at  all levels can concentrate their efforts on day-to-day work and  enhance their efficiency. Of course, a new tax system suited to  the development of a socialist market economy is not simply  this, and the institution of a unified system under which all  the people are obliged to pay taxes is extremely urgent.    Nowadays, tax evasion has become almost a habit among  business firms, with those that earn more evading more, and  those that earn less evading less. If we do not speedily  intensify the building of a system of legal restraints, we  probably will go down the road of being a poor nation with rich  people. The basic starting point of the taxation structural  reform China is about to implement should be the levy of taxes  rather than tax increases or reductions. In other words, we  should collect all taxes that should be collected. We may  consider instituting a unified tax system under which all the  people assume the obligation to pay taxes from the following  three aspects: 1) Formulating meticulous and well-conceived tax  regulations, including the differentiation of national and local  taxes, categories of taxes, tariff rates, period, range,  penalties, and so on. With regard to tax laws, the more  concrete and detailed, the better. 2) Instituting a strict tax  report system with a legally defined time limit for reporting  taxes for a certain fiscal year, under which an individual or  business owner must file his taxes with the government revenue  department before a certain deadline every year. If tax evasion  is discovered, it should be traced using all the records of his  revenues and tax reports for the past few years, and severe  punishments should be meted out to tax evaders so that  individuals and business owners will form the habit of filing  their taxes honestly. 3) Establishing a tax structure under the  independent jurisdiction of state tax bureaus at the central and  provincial levels, and vesting tax personnel with full power to  enforce state tax laws. No government official is allowed to  place himself above tax personnel or to reduce or remit taxes to  any individual or business owner under any pretext. 4) Every  person --regardless of his capacity, nationality, age, and sex  -- should pay taxes according to the same law. Consideration  can be given to practicing a work certificate system, whereby a  job applicant must possess a work certificate and must show it  to his employer together with his tax payment receipts. This  way, the government maintains control over employers, while in  turn, employers keep control over employees. When a person  opens a savings account with a bank or an account with a  money-dealing institution, he also must produce his identity  card, together with his tax payment receipts.    The socialist market economy should operate on the basis of  an extremely strict legal system, and tax laws are fundamental  laws for the national economy. Therefore, accelerating  comprehensive reform of the tax system is an extremely urgent  component of accelerating economic structural reform as a whole.    As a matter of fact, taxation structural reform is reform of  the state's financial revenue structure. Once we initiate equal  competition, state-owned enterprises will implement the same tax  laws as other enterprises, so that state tax revenues may  decrease in size, and the government will have to cut its  spending accordingly. This will call for readjusting government  financial functions. At present, our government finance belongs  to the comprehensive finance type. Under the original  financial model of unified state control, the diminution of the  relative size of revenues is faster than that of expenditures  after delegating power to lower levels and letting them retain a  portion of profits, which has led to the increase of financial  deficits year after year. In 1989, we had financial surplus  amounting to 2.16 billion yuan, but in 1992, we had a deficit of  23.66 billion yuan. If we do not adjust the expenditure  pattern, the deficit will continue to grow, even if we squeeze  education funds. The fundamental outlet for surmounting the  present financial predicament is not to increase taxes in order  to broaden the sources of income, and still less to reduce  outlays for scientific research and education in order to  decrease expenditure, but to fundamentally reform the financial  spending structure. For this purpose, we should move over from  the present comprehensive finance to a public finance. Except  for investments in natural monopolies, exceptionally  large-sized, national defense projects, and some basic  industries -- all of which will continue to be paid for by the  government -- funds under government control should used mainly  for social insurance and other public undertakings. Therefore,  the institution of a public financial system will be one of the  basic tasks of reform from 1994 onward.</p>

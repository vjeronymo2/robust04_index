			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Increased offer turns off leaks - Christopher Price considers De La Rue's negotiations with Portals It was perhaps appropriate that the final stages of negotiations between De La Rue and Portals should be disrupted by a burst water pipe. The eight month courtship, involving two separate approaches, has sprung so many leaks that it has prompted at least one Stock Exchange inquiry, emergency statements to calm nervous investors and enormous volatility in the Portals' share price. Aside from its leaking pipe, last weekend's meeting at Schroders, De La Rue's advisers, marked the final attempt by the fiercely independent Portals board to dissuade De La Rue from making a formal offer for the specialist paper making group. Mr John Lloyd, Portals managing director, said the board had eventually been swayed by the amount of money on offer. 'We believed we had a great future as an independent company, but at the end if the day, we must look after the interests of our shareholders.' One adviser to Portals said that he was for rejecting the De La Rue offer of Pounds 10.50 a share in favour of prompting a hostile bid from the banknote printing group. 'I felt we would be looking at closer to Pounds 12 a share in a contested takeover.' Mr Lloyd said: 'The board, our bankers and advisers all felt the De La Rue offer was a good one. It's as simple as that.' He added that the company's renowned low corporate profile, reflecting the corresponding high profile of its international central bank customers, was a factor in not wishing to get involved in a protracted takeover battle. De La Rue has also emphasised the need to maintain its conservative and measured reputation in the security-conscious banknote industry. In both its approaches the group stated that it would not make a hostile bid, stressing it was seeking the agreement of the Portals board. Portals was first approached by De La Rue in the spring, with informal talks on co-operation, in particular in the area of new banknote and printing technology. 'It became evident fairly early on that pooling our R&amp;D resources was going to be difficult. That's when we started thinking about a full merger,' said Mr Jeremy Marshall, De La Rue chief executive. De La Rue was attracted by Portals' anti-counterfeiting technology which has enabled it to produce ever-more sophisticated watermarks and speciality threads in its banknotes. However, from the beginning the discussions were plagued by leaks, to both the stock market and the press. After the first approach in May, the two companies were forced into confirming the talks after the Portals share price jumped 20 per cent in four days. The Stock Exchange subsequently launched an inquiry. The shares tumbled a week later after talks were terminated. Sources close to the negotiations said De La Rue offered about 900p a share, which was rejected. 'We remained determined to convince them of the logic of the deal and we analysed the situation further over the summer and came back with an even stronger case second time around,' said Mr Marshall. Early this month there was a re-run of the spring. Portals shares shot forward, followed by emergency statements and talk of a Stock Exchange inquiry. However, this time De La Rue came back with a higher, and finally, acceptable offer. 'It's a very full price they are paying, but in the longer-term it should be a good deal,' said Mr Alastair Irvine at Smith New Court. He added that without any obvious costs being taken out by the merger, short-term benefits were few. 'Strategically De La Rue has done the deal to increase the durability of its banknote business. They believe security is more in the paper side than in the printing.' Mr Marshall said that the group would review Portals' non-core businesses, including tea bag production and the protection and control division. He said it was unlikely they would be sold if the sales were not earnings enhancing. One part of the business definitely being retained is Portals' mansion in Hampshire, home to Mr Julian Sheffield, the group's chairman. He is to join the De La Rue board and Mr Marshall said his agreement to stay in the house until August 1996 would be honoured.</p>

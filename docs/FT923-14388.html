Higher operating profits of Pounds 780,000 (Pounds 720,000) were offset by lower interest received of Pounds 412,000 (Pounds 479,000) resulting from lower interest rates.

Earnings per share were 11.1p (10.9p) after a lower tax charge of Pounds 415,000 (Pounds 439,000). A maintained single final dividend of 3p is proposed.</p>

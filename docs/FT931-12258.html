			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Deal on oil seeks to defuse trade tension BRAZIL intends to buy an annual Dollars 500m (Pounds 328.9m) of oil from Argentina, in an attempt to defuse tension surrounding a growing trade surplus with its neighbour, Brazilian officials indicated yesterday. The officials said a 'political decision' had been made for Petrobras, the state oil company, to buy the oil, but that negotiations were continuing on details of the purchase. Brazil's trade surplus with Argentina reached about Dollars 1.4bn last year, with Brazil's exports worth just over Dollars 3bn. Brazilian exports have been stimulated by the two countries' contrasted exchange rate policies. Argentina has fixed its exchange rate against the dollar, which has led to a real appreciation of its currency, while Brazil is devaluing the cruzeiro in line with its inflation rate. The weakness of Brazil's economy, which showed almost no growth last year, has forced manufacturers to look increasingly towards exports. The new political intervention has been prompted by strains that the issue is placing on Mercosur, the southern cone trade group in South America. The organisation, which also includes Paraguay and Uruguay, has agreed to abolish internal trade barriers by the end of 1994. Alarm at the growth of Brazilian imports led Argentina in October to treble to 10 per cent a tax on nearly all imports. The move has already led to protests by Paraguay under Mercosur's new disputes procedure. Brazil is willing to sign an investment protection agreement with the UK, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the Brazilian foreign minister, indicated to British officials in London yesterday. The details of a proposed accord, which may be the first of its kind to be signed by Brazil, are being examined by the UK government.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Only answer in Bosnia is to establish right balance of power Sir, The uncharacteristic stridency of Mr Ian Davidson's article ('Least bad option', January 26) betrays the feebleness of his case against arming Bosnian government forces. He objects that: one could not calculate in advance exactly how much help they should have or exactly who should provide it; 'the only certain result . . . is that Russia and other Slav states would step up their help to the Serbs'; and the most likely threat to peace is of open conflict with Russia. How unconvincing each of these is. Since when was support for a good cause made conditional on exact advance costing? Remembering the continual flow of arms from Serbia to Bosnia which was reported all last year, whence comes Mr Davidson's 'certainty' that it would increase? And a Russia on the brink of social collapse can hardly be capable of 'open conflict' with the west. But the main point, which Mr Davidson entirely misses, is that only a balance of power in Bosnia can lead to a peace settlement, and the only way to establish a balance of power is to arm the government forces. Obviously Serbs and Croats will only agree acceptable peace terms if they realise that they cannot win. Had that situation confronted them two years ago the war would have been over long ago.

			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQ EXPELS 3 U.S. DIPLOMATS, EUROPE ENVOYS  </P> <P> In a further escalation of tension in the Persian Gulf crisis, Iraq ordered the  expulsion Friday of three U.S. diplomats and the military attaches of 11  Western European nations.  </P> <P> The United States promptly responded by announcing that three diplomats at the  Iraqi Embassy in Washington, including the military attache, must leave. All  the envoys ordered out of both Baghdad and Washington were given a week to get  their affairs in order.  </P> <P> "This action comes as a result of the Iraqi government's expulsion of our  embassy's defense attache and two other diplomatic officers," State Department  spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in Washington.  </P> <P> The mounting battle of diplomatic expulsions came on a day when a tough message  from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein warned his people to prepare for war  against the "dwarfs and small people" aligned against him. He vowed there will  be no retreat.  </P> <P> Officials in Europe said their military specialists and other embassy personnel  had been ordered out of Iraq in apparent retaliation for the European  Community's decision Monday to expel Iraqi diplomats.  </P> <P> Of the 12 EC member countries, only Portugal said it had not received an  expulsion order from the Iraqi authorities. Portugal has no military attache at  its Baghdad embassy.  </P> <P> The total number of European diplomats being expelled was not clear, but it  appeared that several envoys from each nation would be affected. Officials in  Cairo said the Egyptian military attache also had been told to leave Iraq.  </P> <P> "The expulsion is a reaction to what we did to them," British Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd said at a news conference in London. "I am keen that the rest of  the (embassy) staff in Baghdad should be able to carry on with their job  helping the British community."  </P> <P> Tutwiler said Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Jock Covey phoned Iraqi  Ambassador Mohammed Mashat to protest the expulsions in Baghdad and to inform  him that Iraq must now make similar cuts in its own staff.  </P> <P> On Aug. 27, the United States told Iraq to reduce its embassy staff of 55 to  19. A few days later, Iraq also restricted the number of American diplomats in  Baghdad to 19.  </P> <P> The current round of expulsions began after Iraqi troops in Kuwait forced their  way into the diplomatic compounds of France, Canada and Belgium last week and  detained diplomatic personnel who had stayed on in defiance of an Iraqi order  to shut down.  </P> <P> The French military attache was detained for several hours, and in response,  French President Francois Mitterrand ordered Iraqi diplomats out of France and  sent more French troops to Saudi Arabia to join the multinational force  deployed after Iraq's invasion of neighboring Kuwait on Aug. 2.  </P> <P> The European Community governments acted immediately after Mitterrand's move.  </P> <P> In Britain, meanwhile, the government announced Friday that it will expel newly  enrolled Iraqi students at British schools, intensifying the European freeze on  official exchanges with the Hussein government.  </P> <P> For his part, Hussein remained defiant. In a statement broadcast early Friday  on Baghdad television, the ruling Revolutionary Command Council appeared to be  preparing the Iraqi people for war.  </P> <P> "There is not a single chance for any retreat . . . from waging the battle  according to principles of honor and deep faith and determination to achieve  victory," it said.  </P> <P> Accompanied by footage of a grim, uniformed Hussein presiding over Thursday's  council meeting, the statement said that "God wants Iraq to wage battle on  Iraqi soil for the liberation of Jerusalem and the holy shrines" of Mecca and  Medina in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> God, it went on, is behind the Iraqi cause against Washington and its allies in  Cairo and Riyadh. "They have reached in their meanness to a degree where they  cut off from the great people its supply of food and medicine, and from the  children their milk," said the statement, referring to the U.N.-sponsored trade  embargo against Iraq. "Oh, what dwarfs and small people they are."  </P> <P> Iraqi Information Minister Latif Jasim told a Turkish newsman that Baghdad  seeks a drawn-out conflict -- two years or more in duration -- and that the  all-out air war favored by Western military strategists "wouldn't be in Iraq's  interest."  </P> <P> Baghdad asserted Friday that two unidentified planes flying from Saudi Arabia  had violated its airspace by as much as six miles before turning back. It was  the third such complaint since the gulf crisis began.  </P> <P> A U.S. military spokesman said that no American aircraft had violated Iraqi  airspace, while Saudi authorities had no immediate comment.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, there were unconfirmed news reports that Saudi Arabia had shut off  oil supplies to Jordan, where pro-Iraq sentiment runs high among the populace.  </P> <P> The Mideast Mirror, a London publication, quoted an unidentified Jordanian  official as saying the pipeline to Jordan's Zarqa refinery had been shut down  Thursday. There was no immediate confirmation from Saudi Arabia, which had  agreed to supply Jordan with oil if it reduces its imports of Iraqi crude.  Before the invasion of Kuwait, Jordan received 90% of its oil from Iraq,  reportedly at discount prices.  </P> <P> The paper quoted the Jordanian official as saying the Saudis had closed the  pipeline because Amman failed to pay its bill, which he estimated at $48  million. It said the Saudi action was intended to punish Jordan for not taking  a hard line against Iraq.  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES, A6-10, D1  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A provincial meeting on rural work closed in Kunming  yesterday. During the meeting, provincial party committee  Secretary Pu Chaozhu once again emphasized the importance of  in-depth reform in rural areas at and below the county level.  Vice Governor Huang Bingsheng delivered the concluding speech.    Pu Chaozhu said: To deepen the reform in rural areas at and  below the county level, we first need to properly adjust the  ownership structure. The reality in Yunnan is that the province  has an underdeveloped economy and a simple ownership structure  both of which are unfavorable to development of the productive  forces.    Pu Chaozhu stressed that it is necessary to start the  adjustment of the ownership structure from the following  aspects: First, it is necessary to transform small state-owned  enterprises at and below the county level into collectively-run  or private enterprises through auction, sale, lease, or contract  for private management with the ownership retained by the state.  Second, it is necessary to go all out to develop the individual  and private economies. Third, it is necessary to vigorously  introduce the joint-stock cooperative system. Fourth, it is  necessary to contract out uncultivated hilly land, slopes, and  plots of land on river banks or in valleys to individuals for  management. Local residents, people from the vicinity or from  other provinces, and foreign investors are all welcome to  contract for the management of all sorts of wasteland. To  deepen the reform in rural areas, we must also thoroughly change  the form of production and management, promote socialized  large-scale production, expand the socialized service system,  and run the businesses at an appropriate scale of operation.  With regard to the management system, we must introduce the  system of integration of agriculture, industry, commerce,  technical services, and trading, as well as the  production-supply-marketing integrated system. By and large, we  must go all out to further the rural reform in depth and to  vigorously promote the productive forces in rural areas.    In his concluding speech Vice Governor Huang Bingsheng said:  During this meeting we have conscientiously discussed such  issues as the tasks regarding rural reform, the adjustment of  the rural production structure, and the plan to strive for a  bumper harvest this year. The participants now have a better  understanding, reached a consensus, and have clearly defined the  targets, tasks, measures, and methods regarding the future  development of agriculture and the rural economic reform in our  province. Some requirements have been set on this year's spring  farming.    The meeting commended 57 advanced localities which had  upgraded their agriculture to a new level in 1993, of which  Eryuan County, Dali City, Puer County, and Luchun County were  awarded first-class prizes, Qujing Prefecture and 22 other  localities won second-class prizes, and Wenshan Zhuang and Miao  Nationality Autonomous Prefectures plus 29 other prefectures,  autonomous prefectures, cities, and counties won third-class  prizes.    Vice Governor Yang Jianqiang presided over the meeting.  Present at the meeting were provincial party, government, and  army leaders Liang Jinquan, Zhao Shumin, Zhang Baosan, Meng  Jiyao, Bao Yongkang, Zhao Tingguang, Qiu Chuangjiao, and Li Jie;  former leading members of the provincial party committee Sun  Yuping and Liang Jia; party and government leaders from all  prefectures, autonomous prefectures, cities, and counties; as  well as the people in charge of all the departments and  committees of the provincial party committee, state organs at  the provincial level, the provincial commissions, committees,  departments, and bureaus, various public organizations, and all  colleges and universities.</p>

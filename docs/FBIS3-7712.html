He said the  international community should instead engage in constructive  dialogues with Yangon [Rangoon] if it wants to seek change in  the country. Speaking at the end of his three-day official  visit to Myanmar, Mr. Goh said that after many years of  self-isolation, the country now wants to open up its economy.  He said ASEAN's policy of constructive engagement is the right  one. The prime minister also encouraged businessmen and leaders  from Western countries to visit Myanmar to assess the situation.  More importantly, such visits will give them the opportunity to  put forward their viewpoints to the country's leadership.    Myanmar's minister for national planning and economic  development, Brigadier General David Abel, said Mr. Goh's visit  has built a lot of confidence in the business community. He  added he now expects better rapport between businessmen in the  two countries.</p>

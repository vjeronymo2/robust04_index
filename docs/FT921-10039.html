			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Berlusconi's rescue plan for La Cinq under fire A LEADING figure in France's broadcasting establishment has criticised the attempt by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the controversial Italian entrepreneur, to take over La Cinq, the ailing French TV station. Mr Patrick Le Lay, president of TF1, France's biggest single TV channel, yesterday condemned the Berlusconi rescue bid as 'amoral'. One reason for his criticism was what he claimed were overly long repayment periods for La Cinq's creditors. He was also critical of Mr Berlusconi's plans to provide programming for the French station on the grounds that the Italian businessman would be using his influence at La Cinq to make profits from selling his own programmes to it. TF1, together with two other French channels, Canal Plus and M6, has produced proposals for a French-language news service to replace La Cinq. If the Berlusconi bid fails, La Cinq would go off air and this service would be one of the contenders to take its place. However, the views of the French broadcasting establishment will play a part in determining the success, or failure, of Mr Berlusconi's rescue proposals which need the approval of the Paris commercial court and of the Conseil Superieur de l'Audiovisuel, the body that regulates French broadcasting, to be implemented. Mr Berlusconi submitted his bid, which involves a FFr1.5bn (Dollars 279m) recapitalisation for La Cinq, of which he is one of the largest shareholders with a 25 per cent stake, to Mr Hubert Lafont, the station's administrator on Monday. His was the only one of the three rescue plans that Mr Lafont deemed suitable for further consideration. If his bid is accepted, Mr Berlusconi is committed to reinvesting in La Cinq to maintain his holding at 25 per cent, the maximum allowed under French law.</p>

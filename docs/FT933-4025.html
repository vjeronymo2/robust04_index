			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / BTR shares dip despite improved results SHARES in BTR lost 17 1/2 p to 381 1/2 p yesterday after the UK industrial conglomerate expressed caution about the strength of its markets in the second half. The shares fell even though BTR announced a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, a disposal worth up to Pounds 165m and an enhanced scrip dividend. Mr Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, said: 'Despite the pronouncements of governments and economic forecasters, the outlook remains uncertain for any economic recovery in the second half.' BTR said evidence that the UK recovery was translating into significant increases in profitability was still inconclusive. The recovery in the US, so marked in the last quarter of 1992, had not maintained the same momentum in the first half of this year, although a number of group companies had improved their performance. Some of BTR's businesses had been severely affected by the rapid deterioration of the major European economies in the first half - particularly those serving the German automotive industry. Even with the loosening of the exchange rate mechanism, recession on the Continent would remain a sensitivity into 1994. BTR's pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 548m to Pounds 602m in the six months to June 30. Sales were 13 per cent higher at Pounds 4.87bn. Gearing is down from 79 to 61 per cent. The group said the results demonstrated its ability to prosper in unfavourable trading conditions. Robust performance from other parts of the world had helped compensate for difficulties in Europe. Profits continued to improve from Hawker Siddeley, the engineering group BTR bought for Pounds 1.55bn at the end of 1991. The group has agreed to sell Newey &amp; Eyre Group, a Birmingham-based electrical distribution group, for up to Pounds 165m to Hagemeyer, a Dutch-based international trading house. Newey &amp; Eyre, which has 200 branches and 2,800 employees in the UK and Ireland, had sales of Pounds 355m in 1992 and net assets of Pounds 50m. Initial payment will be Pounds 110m, with provision for up to Pounds 55m more, depending on performance targets in 1994 and 1995. Fully diluted earnings per share rose by 4 per cent to 10.5p (from 10.1p). The declared interim dividend was increased 6.5 per cent to 4.95p (from 4.65p). BTR is offering an enhanced scrip alternative worth 7.425p, a 50 per cent enhancement. BZW will pay a minimum cash alternative of 7.2765p. Disposal details, Page 26 Lex, Page 20</p>

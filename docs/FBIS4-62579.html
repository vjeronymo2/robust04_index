			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F> correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Russia will give the Palestinians aid in equipping  and, partially, training their policemen stationed in the Gaza  Strip and in the city of Jericho. "We are resolving these  issues in practical terms," a senior member of Russia's Foreign  Ministry, Viktor Gogitidze, told Interfax.    The decision to give aid to the Palestinian police was taken  in principle during the recent meeting between President Boris  Yeltsin and the PLO leader, Yasir 'Arafat, in Moscow, he noted.  "This concerns the granting of light firearms and some other  types of equipment. Each of these types is to be endorsed by  the Israelis," he explained.    When the Israelis and the Palestinians signed their  Gaza-Jericho first agreement in Cairo, the coordinating  committee for giving aid to the Palestinian police force, Russia  is a member of, held a session. "We studied everything done in  terms of giving aid to the Palestinian police force, and  considered what else they need," he said.    According to Gogitidze, despite the difficulties the  Palestinian police and security forces are ready to take the  greater part of functions connected with maintaining law and  order in Gaza and Jericho upon themselves. "This is  particularly important because under agreements the withdrawal  of Israeli troops and the process of transferring power from the  civilian and military administration to the Palestinian  structures in Gaza and Jericho should be concluded before the  end of May," he said.    As Interfax's interviewee noted, "the process of Middle East  settlement will depend largely on how the Israeli-Palestinian  talks on the West Bank, that is on the autonomy as such, will  proceed." "Gaza and Jericho will be the sample under which the  further spread of autonomy in the West Bank will be built. The  problem of settlements and the issues of jurisdiction,  particularly territorial, are the most complicated, he said.  These talks should necessarily be resumed, since the agreement  on Gaza and Jericho is good, but it is insufficient and too  isolated."    Talks in the other directions, such as Israeli-Syrian, got  stalemated, the diplomat conceded. "On the whole the situation  is favorable for breaking the impasse. As far as we can judge,  the Israelis realize that Syria is a key country in the Middle  East. Movement forward in the entire peace process is  unthinkable without progress in the Syrian direction, he said.  The Syrians also realize that the situation is changing for the  better. Everything hinges on the circumstance that they expect  the Israelis to make a clear statement as to their willingness  to comply with Resolution No. 242 issued by the U.N. security  Council, that is withdraw from the Golan Heights altogether."</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Shoppers in the line of fire: Effects of UK tax rises If it were not for the British consumer, the economy would still be looking glum. Spending by individuals has motored the UK back to recovery over the past year or so. But this weekend, it is as if they are being penalised for their efforts. Building societies have already written to mortgage holders informing them that payments will rise at the end of April because of a cut in tax relief on interest payments; VAT was imposed on consumers' gas and electricity bills from yesterday; and take-home pay will also drop, with increased national insurance contributions and a reduction in the married couple's allowance. In total, the tax changes will raise about Pounds 8.4bn in 1994-95, or 1.3 per cent of gross domestic product. Over the next three fiscal years, they will raise a total of between Pounds 15bn and Pounds 17bn, the equivalent of 7p in the pound on the standard rate of income tax. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, says the tax increases - introduced in the last two Budgets - are essential to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement, which is expected to reach about Pounds 48bn in 1993-94. The government believes the present PSBR is enormously high and has to be reduced in order to regain control over public finances. Moreover, it argues that a low PSBR would encourage confidence. But with recovery still fragile, is Mr Clarke wise to tinker with what is currently the economy's main driving force? A particular feature of the recovery is that it has been almost entirely consumer led. Since early 1992, consumer spending has risen by an average of 2.7 per cent a year, while government expenditure and private investment - the other main components of demand - have barely increased. In contrast, the recovery after the recession of 1974-75 was led by strong export growth, while that of the early 1980s was - at least initially - spurred by a rise in capital spending. This time, consumer spending has been encouraged by a fall in mortgage interest rates, from a peak of 15.4 per cent in 1990 to about 7.6 per cent today. The benefit of lower rates is still being felt, as homeowners with mortgages reviewed annually switch to making lower payments. The continuing impetus to growth from interest rate cuts allows the government to argue that the recovery can withstand tax increases. This conclusion is shared by the majority of the Treasury's six 'wise men', or economic advisers, in their latest report. Several City analysts agree with the Treasury panel. Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at investment bank Morgan Stanley, says some of the tax increases, such as on tobacco and vehicles, have already been introduced, while others  -the freezing of tax allowances, for instance - will not reduce nominal take-home pay. 'Roughly half the fiscal pain (from higher taxes) is either behind us or will go unnoticed,' he says. Mr Gardiner predicts GDP growth of 2.8 per cent this year, compared with the Treasury's forecast of 2.5 per cent and with 1.9 per cent in 1993. He forecasts that, without the tax increases, consumer spending would have grown by up to 4 per cent this year, but he still expects a healthy 2.7 per cent rise. Similarly, Lombard Street Research, part of discount house Gerrard and National, concludes: 'Concerns (about the tax increases) seem exaggerated, given that the increases will amount to only 1 per cent of personal disposable income in 1994-95 and about 0.2 per cent of personal wealth, and have been known about for a year.' There is some evidence to support the argument that the tax increases are not coming as a shock to consumers. They appear to have started scaling back their spending already: the annual growth rate in retail sales slipped to 2.5 per cent in February from 3.7 per cent the previous month. Even if the tax increases do have an effect, consumers could keep spending at the same rate by increasing borrowings or by running down their savings. There are three incentives for consumers to reduce their savings: falling unemployment, which reduces the need for precautionary saving; lower nominal interest rates; and subdued inflation. The savings ratio - personal saving as a percentage of disposable incomes - dropped to 10.2 per cent in the last three months of 1993, from 11 per cent in the previous three months. It may fall further: Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at broker James Capel, predicts that by 1995 the ratio will have fallen to about 8 per cent. That, he reckons, will be in line with 'the equilibrium savings ratio in periods of low inflation, such as the 1960s'. But not everyone shares the government's confidence that consumer spending will withstand the tax increases. Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University, a dissenter among the six wise men, says: 'This is a very feeble recovery. The balance of payments is weak, unemployment is still high and output is unimpressive. If it was not for the falls in unemployment, you would not have much sense of a recovery.' Similarly, Mr Peter Warburton, at Robert Fleming Securities, says it is doubtful that growth has gained enough momentum to resist the fiscal tightening: 'If interest rates had been cut earlier in the year, then we could perhaps have started off on a positive footing. Now we are facing the most unpleasant change in taxation for 13 years, and negative momentum is liable to build.' Nevertheless, even if the tax increases do depress consumer spending more than the government might hope,there could be long-term beneficial effects. In the past, surges in UK consumer spending have sucked in imports, leading to a deterioration in the balance of payments, a fall in sterling and eventually a rise in interest rates. The UK's trade position is already deteriorating. The current account deficit widened to Pounds 2.6bn in the last three months of 1993 from Pounds 1.8bn in the previous three months, as earnings from services and financial transactions proved insufficient to compensate for the deficit in 'visible' goods. Mr Andrew Sentance, of the London Business School, says: 'Consumer spending now absorbs a much higher share of GDP in the UK than in other countries, reducing the proportion of national resources devoted to investment. If this imbalance is redressed, the UK will be able to maintain a higher rate of investment without balance of payments or inflation problems. That should put the economy in a better position to sustain growth over the medium term.' There are some tentative signs that investment is emerging from the recessionary doldrums. Gross domestic fixed capital formation increased by 2.5 per cent between the third and fourth quarters of 1993, the fastest quarterly increase for five years. The risk, which cannot yet be ruled out, is that Mr Clarke has got his calculations wrong - and has stifled consumer spending to such an extent that the recovery will stall. But the pick up in investment offers some encouragement to the government that the tax package will amount to a gentle application of the brake, allowing the economy to steer a smoother growth path.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Dusan Radovanovic] </F>   [Text] Paris, Feb 24 (TANJUG) - A proposal by Russian  President Boris Yeltsin that the United States, Great Britain,  France, Germany and Russia should gather for a summit on former  Yugoslavia's crisis has been received in the West with certain  diplomatic reserves.    Using a familiar diplomatic formula that it cannot take a  stand on the issue because it has not received Moscow's  "official" proposal, Paris has clearly shown its restraint in  the matter and thus concealed its reluctance to leave the  initiative in former Yugoslavia's crisis to Russia.    French sources maintain that such a summit would be  "premature", alleging that the choice of the countries to attend  the summit is debatable.    After all their mediating efforts aimed at resolving former  Yugoslavia's crisis which have not been very successful so far,  the European Union believes that it has every right to attend  the summit.    French daily Le Figaro refers to Russia's initiative as  "spectacular" and goes on to say that its goal is "clear and  ambitious" and directed to putting even more emphasis on the  "Dalin aspirations to re-establish its status of the  indispensable great power."    French commentators say Sayosin's undoubtedly successful  diplomatic initiative around Sarajevo has enabled Russia "to  take its place (?in) the international [word indistinct]," but  Moscow, they claim, now insists on "playing the first violin in  that orchestra."    Last week NATO was ready to launch air strikes in the  Sarajevo area, which was in line with the ultimatum set to  warring sides in Bosnia, requesting them to demilitarize  Sarajevo. However, the ultimatum practically referred only to  Bosnian Serbs.    Moscow, which severely critized the ultimatum set by the  Western military alliance, guaranteed to Bosnian Serbs that  Russian peacekeepers would be located in a buffer zone between  Bosnian Serbs and Moslems in the Sarajevo area. It was only  after they received these guarantees that the Bosnian Serbs  pulled back their artillery.</p>

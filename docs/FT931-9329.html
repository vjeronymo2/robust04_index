			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Rifkind sees peace role in Bosnia MR MALCOLM Rifkind, defence secretary, indicated yesterday that British troops would be likely to take part if a new UN peacekeeping force were sent to Bosnia, but that their participation might be temporary. British forces have been deployed in the former Yugoslav republic since September, when they were sent to escort humanitarian supply convoys organised by the UN. A larger UN force is expected to be required to police the latest UN-EC peace plan, involving the division of Bosnia into 10 provinces, which recently received tacit approval in Washington. Mr Rifkind said: 'If the US and other countries are prepared to play their part, then the UK would want to take the same responsible position as the international community as a whole.' He said on ITV's Walden programme that if peacekeeping plans appeared to involve a much greater burden the UK would be 'very careful before we go in'. A new force would be sent only if there were a real ceasefire, he said. 'There is no question of British forces being sent into a combat role in Bosnia or elsewhere in former Yugoslavia.' He said Britain would have to examine the implications of any long-term commitment. The UN should adopt a rotation system enabling the initial participants in a peacekeeping operation to withdraw and be replaced by troops from another country. He said many UN members could share the task of policing a ceasefire in Bosnia. This kind of action would be more akin to traditional peacekeeping operations than present deployments in the country. He said Britain would not keep troops there if they became involved in combat. 'I would not have the slightest hesitation in wishing to see our forces withdrawn at the earliest possible opportunity,' he said. Mr Rifkind dismissed demands made by the all-party Commons defence committee last week for the government to cancel all its planned reductions in the infantry to enable it to meet its commitments. He said this would be 'frankly unnecessary' and would cost an extra Pounds 200m a year, which would have to be taken from other government programmes. The committee persisted with its call after Mr Rifkind cancelled two regimental amalgamations and increased the planned strength of the army in the mid-1990s by 3,000 to 119,000. Mr Rifkind said yesterday: 'I could double the size of the army tomorrow and you could still say in theory that it might not be enough.'</p>

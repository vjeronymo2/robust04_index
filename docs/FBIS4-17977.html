			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksey Pushkov, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI deputy </F> editor in chief, under the "In the World" rubric: "The  Arrogance of Strength and the Presumption of Weakness"]    [Text] A tide of anti-Americanism is swelling in Russia.  According to a long Russian tradition, the sobering with regard  to the United States is beginning to boil over. Now it is not  only Zhirinovskiy's supporters, but those who have fairly  recently been moderate intellectuals that accuse the United  States of planning to "exterminate the friendly Serb people" and  of harboring intentions to impose a new "Pax Americana," and  urge Russia to fence off NATO so as to counter the bloc with "an  independent center of strength" in the form of the CIS.    These sentiments have not seriously affected Russia's  official policies so far. Moscow's recent departure from its  initial stance of unquestionably following in Washington's steps  rather reflects its desire to balance relations with the United  States. Still, it was not without heeding these sentiments that  Moscow recently put off indefinitely its accession to the  "Partnership for Peace" program, and it reminds the Americans on  every occasion that "Russia is a great power;" and Andrey  Kozyrev keeps talking, insistently so, about Russian plans  "aggressively to defend its interests," thus awakening  reminiscences in the West about Cold War terminology.    Of course, Russia currently lacks either the strength,  capabilities, or even the desire to set itself against America.  The goings-on, however, are fairly dangerous. Under certain  conditions, Russia's desperate -- but still unsuccessful --  search for its role on the world scene instead of the one it has  lost may result in the return to a fairly familiar, nearly  genetic anti-Americanism. In this case it will be more show  than real, more posturing than policy, but even this posture can  do great damage to Russian interests.    All the more so because a counter-tide is mounting in the  United States itself. It has not given rise to anti-Russian  actions yet, but the shagreen leather of restraint is shrinking  fast. Passages about "Russia's neoimperial ambitions" have  already become a commonplace in the statements of U.S.  high-ranking officials. The fact that the United States is  providing Russia with moderate financial assistance gives the  Americans additional reasons constantly to remind it that as of  today the United States is the sole superpower in the world.  And also to give Moscow instructions as to what deals it may  conclude with India or Iran, how it should behave itself in the  Middle East or in its disputes with the Baltic states.    "There should be no anti-Americanism, but neither should  there be pan-Americanism," believes a high-ranking official of  the Yeltsin administration, who appears to be expressing the  general viewpoint of our government bureaucracy. This is an  understandable wish, albeit one that can scarcely be fulfilled  completely: Any powerful system -- and the United States is  precisely one -- seeks to become a monopoly. Still, this should  not give rise to yet another surge of anti-Americanism, but  serve as a reason to work out a counterpolicy that would make it  possible to maintain constructive relations with the United  States and at the same time enable Russia to defend its  legitimate interests.    This symbiosis is realistic for two reasons: First, the  United States -- as shown by its failures in Somalia and Haiti,  not too strong positions in trade wars with Japan, and  continuous overtures to China despite Beijing's human rights  violations of all possible sorts -- is far from omnipotent.  Second, it needs Russia for objective reasons -- insofar as it  uses, not rejects, Russia's remaining possibilities to influence  international processes.    The evolution of the situation around Bosnia is a case in  point. If President Clinton were certain that the strategy of  bomb strikes is bound to succeed, he would not have called Boris  Yeltsin on the phone last week, nor would Warren Christopher  have met with Andrey Kozyrev in Geneva. The course events took  after Russia's diplomatic defeat in Gorazde only emphasized that  it is still one of the key players on the Balkan scene against  which both the United States and NATO prefer to measure their  actions.    The West needs Russia to an even greater degree to control  the course of events on the territory of the former USSR.  Although in the United States scenarios of playing "the  Ukrainian card" are being contemplated with a determination  worthy of a better purpose, in reality the United States is  unable actually to oppose Russia in that space.    Anti-Americanism is flawed at least because it attributes to  the United States the possibilities it does not have. Moreover,  there is no better way of giving a strong boost to  anti-Americanism than to project the image of a Russia hostile  to the United States and the West. On the contrary, it should  act accurately and carefully as it takes part in numerous  international games -- from the Bosnian one to the partnership  with NATO -- and prudently use its influence on a case-by-case  basis either on the American side or in favor of emerging  alternatives.    Neither pro-Americanism, which is fraught with its unbridled  antithesis in Russia, nor anti-Americanism, which is rolling our  country back to what is has left behind with such difficulties  are acceptable for it. Russia should stop measuring itself  against this leading, but not omnipotent pole of world politics.  Only by so doing will it be able to overcome its historical  inferiority complex with regard to the United States, to come to  the balanced realization of its national interests, and to help  diffuse the American influence if and when it runs counter to  its needs.</p>

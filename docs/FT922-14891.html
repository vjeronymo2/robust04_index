			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Indemnity notice from Lime Street nearly month late LIME STREET Underwriting Agency, the Lloyd's members' agency that went into liquidation in early March, told its Names it had not renewed its indemnity insurance nearly one month after the policy had expired, in spite of an instruction from Lloyd's to do so at once, it emerged yesterday. Notification came in late July last year, although the policy had lapsed in June. By then, legal claims for liability by Names against the agency may have been hindered. Names managed by Lime Street make up a high proportion of the membership of large loss-making syndicates such as Gooda Walker 387, which has an estimated loss of 750 per cent of pledged assets for 1988. Names are individuals whose assets underwrite insurance at Lloyd's. A letter sent by Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, to underwriting agencies on April 11 last year and obtained by the Financial Times says members' agents should notify their Names 'immediately' if they were not renewing their errors and omissions (E&amp;O) cover, or doing so on a more restricted basis. Lime Street did not send out letters to its Names informing them that it was not renewing E&amp;O cover until July 22 1991, at which point it told them the policy had expired on June 30. A number of Names had already notified Lime Street of potential claims on the advice of action groups formed by members of some of the worst suffering syndicates. Until last year, when Lloyd's relaxed the regulations, E&amp;O insurance was compulsory for both members' and underwriting agencies. Directors of Lime Street told creditors at a meeting when the company was liquidated last month that the delay in notifying them was caused by continued attempts to obtain cover at affordable premiums, which proved impossible. Representatives of Lime Street refuse to give any details of the E&amp;O policy, arguing that any information might jeopardise payments by the underwriters. Lime Street's E&amp;O policy is believed to have been written on a 'claims made' basis, however, which means it will cover only claims notified before the expiry of the policy. The notifications from Names by that time are likely to have formed an important part of the estimate of claims given by Lime Street to its underwriters. The statement of affairs presented to creditors at a meeting last month showed claims totalling about Pounds 21m against the company so far. A number of others were unquantified because they are dependent on losses that are not yet known. It also emerged yesterday that one of the Lime Street directors in the mid 1970s was Mr Frederick Sasse, a Lloyd's underwriter whose syndicate ran up heavy losses arising from its insurance of properties in US cities. Mr Sasse was a director of Lime Street Underwriting between 1976 and 1978. He had been a director of Saturn Insurance, which became Lime Street in 1976, when Mr Robin Kingsley joined the board.</p>

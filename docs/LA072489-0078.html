			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'NOT NECESSARILY' A LAST BASTION OF NECESSARY SATIRE  </P> <P> It's Wednesday Night Live.  </P> <P> It's also "Not Necessarily the News," a weekly (three times a month) series on  HBO and a TV institution (now in its sixth year) whose fate is in the balance.  </P> <P> Well, junior institution.  </P> <P> "NNTN" is a minor league pitcher (audience-wise) with a major league curve.  Because it's been on cable (HBO claims an audience of 15.9 million households),  it hasn't even approached the ratings or exposure of NBC's infinitely more  infamous "Saturday Night Live." No one has written any books or made any TV  movies about the cast of this series.  </P> <P> Yet "NNTN" has always been one of TV's funniest shows (often more consistently  funny than "SNL") and a rare TV venue for slashing political satire.  </P> <P> The question is whether truly biting political satire is craved by American  viewers in sufficient numbers now to keep a 10:30 p.m. half hour like "NNTN" on  the air. Perhaps not.  </P> <P> HBO reports that the show's ratings are in the "blah" range, passable but  hardly institution-like. So, whether "NNTN" is extended past its present  nine-episode commitment that ends Aug. 2 remains uncertain.  </P> <P> Here's hoping. . . .  </P> <P> A creation of Moffitt-Lee Productions, "NNTN" is in some ways better and meaner  than ever.  </P> <P> This season's "live" element and cast are new, and the format increasingly  resembles an actual newscast, with Annabelle Gurwitch and Tom Parks as anchors.  Most important, the show's mandate -- to deliver as many cheap shots and low  blows as possible -- happily survives.  </P> <P> Example: A takeoff on the ABC News "Person of the Week" -- substituting another  "P" word for Person.  </P> <P> As with much satire, there are as many misses as hits: Some of the humor is  especially cheap and sophomoric. Dopey reporter Joe Guppy is dopey. And heading  the list of good ideas that flopped were Gurwitch's "interview" with embattled  author Salman Rushdie, and also the usually amazing Harry Shearer as former  House Speaker Jim Wright (good impression, bad material).  </P> <P> At its best, though, "NNTN" is not only fearlessly tasteless, but frightfully  funny.  </P> <P> Continuing to top its repertoire are often-hilarious "dirty tricks" interviews  of political figures -- ranging from President Bush to members of his  Administration -- in which "NNTN" mischievously slices its own questions and  reactions into footage of actual interviews, changing their meaning.  </P> <P> In the hands of "NNTN," for example, Secretary of State James Baker's taped  responses to an unknown interviewer somehow became a conference with a nun  about the conduct of Baker's son "Jimmy" at a Catholic school. In another  episode, Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater appeared to be responding to  Parks' question about Vice President Quayle when he said: "I think he's a  charlatan and phony."  </P> <P> You can fault "NNTN" for distorting reality, but at least its intentions are  bad.  </P> <P> The show also has a collection of acerbic political commentators, the best of  whom has been Will Durst, who noted recently about the Bush presidency: "The  only problem with doing nothing is, how can you tell when you're done?"  </P> <P> One of the show's most inspired bits to date, meanwhile, found Gurwitch  daydreaming as Parks delivered a nasty commentary on Bush. Suddenly she was  Madonna, gyrating and dancing in her underwear while fawning over a Bush  look-alike in a parody of the singer's "Like a Prayer" video.  </P> <P> Not all of the show's targets relate to politics.  </P> <P> It was "NNTN" that broke the story on "Batman and Rainman," for example. And  one of show's brightest elements is Richard Rosen's hard-hitting Rosen Report,  tough, relentless and passionate, investigative journalism at its best.  </P> <P> Only recently he was brutally confronting dishonest New York street vendors,  not only those selling phony Rolex watches, but also sellers of counterfeit  Rolodexes ("This one has no vowels").  </P> <P> Also ranging far and wide is the show's consumer advocate, Merrill Markoe, who  looked and sounded suspiciously like writer/TV commentator/coffee spokeswoman  Linda Ellerbee recently when she put on large eyeglasses to offer her  credibility and services to advertisers:  </P> <P> "I have access to cameras, studio time. I've got the eyeglasses, everything it  takes to make your refreshing beverage a huge seller. And as long as I keep  talking with this big smile on my face and a certain amount of authority, I bet  no one notices this isn't part of a newscast."  </P> <P> With HBO and MTV launching comedy channels and stand-up comics continuing to  proliferate throughout television, the small screen is becoming America's  electronic Catskills, a training and growing ground helping to revitalize an  entire industry. Fine, as long as the social and political humor of an "NNTN"  isn't killed off in the process.  </P> <P> Wednesday's episode is the show's 80th in a long run that deserves to be even  longer, one that has proved "Not Necessarily the News" is necessary.  </P></p>

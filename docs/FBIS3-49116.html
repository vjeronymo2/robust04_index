Egyutteles respects the laws and the Constitution and does  not seek the revision of the state borders with Hungary, Duray  said, adding that his movement wants to strive to ensure rights  for the Hungarian minority only as a legal part of the Slovak  Republic. It is only by coincidence that the Komarno meeting  will take place on the eve of U.S. President Bill Clinton's  meeting with the presidents of the Visegrad countries in Prague,  Duray said.    Egyutteles demands that the ethnic principle is taken into  account while introducing the new territorial division of  Slovakia, he said, adding that his party intended to propose  that the Komarno meeting appeal to the Slovak parliament to  ratify the European Parliament Charter of European Towns and  Regions. The Slovak Republic has not yet joined this agreement.</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Salinas joins race to head WTO - Political jostling could lead to bruising transatlantic row The race to head the World Trade Organisation, the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has entered a new phase with the decision by President Carlos Salinas of Mexico formally to put his name forward. His nomination was confirmed as it emerged that South Korea plans to become the first Asian country to propose a candidate for the WTO. The name, believed to be that of an experienced trade policymaker, will be announced in Seoul today. Meanwhile, a note of uncertainty was injected into the European Union's plans to back Mr Renato Ruggiero, a former Italian trade minister, for the post, when officials in Brussels said he might not be formally endorsed by EU leaders at their Corfu summit this weekend. The officials said that though Mr Ruggiero remained the only declared European entrant, EU leaders were expected only to discuss his candidacy informally in Corfu. They would probably leave it to their foreign ministers to deal with the question next month. Mr Salinas' decision to enter the race comes earlier than expected, and almost two months before the election in August which will choose his successor as president when he steps down after a six-year term in December. His nomination follows his broad endorsement at last week's Ibero-American summit by the heads of all Latin American states except Brazil, which has proposed Mr Rubens Ricupero, its finance minister, for the post. 'My personal feeling is that the US, as well as Canada and most Asian countries, will support the Salinas candidacy,' Mr Manuel Tello, Mexico's foreign minister, who is running President Salinas' WTO campaign, said. Mr Salinas is the best known of three candidates to have declared so far. A committed free-trader, he was the driving force behind agreement on the North American Free Trade Area embracing the US, Canada and Mexico. While he is widely considered to have outstanding political credentials for the WTO post, his nomination could further complicate a decision on a candidate. That likelihood would increase if he were actively supported by Washington, while the EU promoted Mr Ruggiero. In that event, some international trade officials believe, the outcome could be a bruising transatlantic confrontation, into which other countries could be drawn, or a stalemate which could open the way for a compromise candidate. Furthermore, Mr Salinas' candidacy threatens to divide Latin America if Brazil stands by its nomination of Mr Ricupero. Mr Tello has written to Mr Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign minister, asking him to withdraw Mr Ricupero's name. He said Mr Amorim told him on May 30 that Brazil would reconsider its position if Mr Salinas chose to run, and had assured Mr Salinas Brazil would look favourably on the candidacy of the Mexican president. Since then, Brazil appears to have persuaded Argentina to retreat from the backing it gave Mr Salinas at the Ibero-American summit in favour of Mr Ricupero. Mexico says it has not been informed of any change in Argentina's stance.</p>

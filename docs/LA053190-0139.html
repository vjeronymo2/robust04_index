			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> SUSPECT NOT CHARGED IN MURDER OF BOY, 12  </P> <P> Authorities said there is currently not sufficient evidence to file murder  charges against a suspect in the shooting of a 12-year-old boy along the  U.S.-Mexican border, but they did accuse the man of the bow-and-arrow robberies  of two groups of illegal immigrants. The alleged robberies -- committed within  10 minutes of each other in March and involving a total of seven victims -- are  not connected to the murder, said Deputy Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Luis Aragon. The accused, Leonard Paul Cuen, 21, whose family home is about a  quarter of a mile north of the international boundary, is still considered a  suspect in the May 18 murder of Emilio Eusebio Jimenez Bejines. The boy was  gunned down about 350 yards south of Cuen's home.  </P></p>

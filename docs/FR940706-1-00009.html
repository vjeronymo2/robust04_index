			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA has addressed such situations in other rulemakings (e.g., permit-required confined spaces, &sect;1910.146(g)(4); and the control of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout), 1910.147(c)(7)(iv) by requiring employers to verify their compliance with a requirement through a written certification. The Agency has found that a written certification is a reasonable means by which to establish accountability for compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, OSHA determined that an employer could adequately verify compliance with the hazard assessment requirement through a written certification which identified the workplace evaluated; the person certifying that the hazard assessment had been performed; the date(s) of the hazard assessment; and which identified the document as a certification of hazard assessment. Accordingly, the Agency added this requirement to the final rule as &sect;1910.132(d)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes that verification through written certification would also be appropriate with regard to hazard assessments to be performed under proposed &sect;1915.152(b). Therefore, OSHA solicits comments, with supporting information, as to the need for certification of the hazard assessment and the anticipated impact of such a requirement on the shipyard industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Certification of training <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Proposed &sect;1915.152(e) required that employees be trained in the proper use of their PPE. Proposed &sect;1910.132(f) contained an identical requirement. Based on comments received in relation to proposed &sect;1910.132(f) (Exs. 3:41, 3:46, 3:49, 3:62 and 3:129) which expressed concern regarding the level of documentation employers would be required to provide for their training efforts, OSHA raised Issue 4 in the hearing notice (55 FR 3414, February 1, 1990) to elicit additional information on the recordkeeping needed to document compliance with the proposed paragraph. The commenters (Exs. 7:8, 7:19 and 7:39) generally supported some sort of certification for completion of training. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the rulemaking record and the considerations raised above in regard to Reopening Issue 1, OSHA determined that employers could adequately verify compliance with proposed &sect;1910.132(f) through a written certification. Accordingly, the Agency revised proposed paragraph (f) to add paragraph (f)(4), which requires a certification record that identifies each employee trained, the date(s) of training, and which identifies the document as a certification of training in the use of PPE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes that verification through written certification would also be appropriate with regard to training to be provided under proposed &sect;1915.152(e). Therefore, OSHA solicits comments, with supporting information, as to the need for certification of employee training and the anticipated impact of such a requirement on the shipyard industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Training elements <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . As mentioned above, proposed &sect;1915.152(e) required that employees be trained in the proper use of their PPE, and proposed &sect;1910.132(f) set forth an identical requirement. Based on comments and testimony received in relation to proposed &sect;1910.132(f) (Exs. 3:36, 3:41, 3:50, 3:60, 3:73, 3:86, 3:88, 3:116, 3:128; 7:3, 7:8, 7:11, 7:20, 7:29, 7:38; Tr. 23:24; 4/3, Tr. 272&hyph;286; 4/4) which expressed concern that the proposed language did not provide enough detailed guidance regarding what constituted adequate training, OSHA determined that more specific guidance should be provided by the final requirement. Accordingly, the Agency determined that more specific guidance was appropriate and revised proposed &sect;1910.132(f) to require, at a minimum, training in the following areas: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;When PPE is necessary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;What PPE is necessary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;How to properly don, doff, adjust, and wear PPE <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The limitations of the PPE; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;That proper care, maintenance, useful life and disposal of the PPE. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, many of the above comments and testimony suggested that in order to have a successful training program, employers should set measurable training objectives and have their employees demonstrate that they have reached those objectives. Also, it was suggested that retraining be provided, when the employer determined that employees may not possess sufficient knowledge about the PPE. Accordingly, the following provisions were added to &sect;1910.132(f) in the final rule: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Each affected employee shall demonstrate an understanding of the training specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and the ability to use PPE properly, before being allowed to perform work requiring the use of PPE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

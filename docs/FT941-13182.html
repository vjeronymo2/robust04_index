			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / Van Miert equal to the competition despite defeat: Andrew Hill examines the policy significance of the go-ahead given to a controversial steel-tube joint venture The European Commission's decision yesterday not to block a three-way joint venture between French, German and Italian steel-tube manufacturers is a small blow to the pride of Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner. It is the Belgian socialist's first defeat on a proposal to the Commission since he took over the job from the UK's Sir Leon Brittan a year ago. The setback has again raised the question among competition policy purists of whether Mr Van Miert is fighting his corner as fiercely as Sir Leon used to. Mr Van Miert did back his officials' case against the steel-tube venture - based on the supposition that it would have created an anti-competitive 'duopoly' in the EU market - although he was said to have had some initial doubts about the argument. However, as one respected Brussels competition lawyer put it yesterday: 'I think he's basically conscientious and balanced, but Leon Brittan would have been able to get it through.' Evidence from the same Commission meeting and Mr Van Miert's 12 months in the job suggests that such an analysis is too harsh. Yesterday, commissioners also approved, without discussion, a tough line towards French government subsidies to Bull, the computer group, and endorsed Mr Van Miert's move to open an investigation into aid for the Klockner steel mill in the German state of Bremen. Indeed, Mr Van Miert seems to be proving more than equal to tackling state subsidies - the area he has identified as his greatest challenge when he took over the job. He set the tone at a conference organised by French public-sector companies a year ago: directors of France's largest utilities heaped praise on 'Mon cher Karel' and addressed him informally as 'tu'; Mr Van Miert chose to address them throughout with the polite French 'vous'. Since then, he has shown particular grit in persuading governments to agree unanimously to subsidy cuts in the sensitive steel sector, although he admits the December decision was an unsatisfactory compromise. Moreover, observers believe Mr Van Miert's style - more emollient and less confrontational than Sir Leon's - probably helped persuade suspicious fellow commissioners to agree controversial plans last year for further liberalisation of the telecommunications sector. Mr Claus-Dieter Ehlermann, who has headed the Commission's competition policy directorate under Sir Leon and Mr Van Miert, says such liberalisation programmes will reinforce the importance of his department's policy over the next few years. In particular, the internal market and the Commission's plans for trans-European networks - large infrastructure projects in telecoms, information technology, energy and transport sectors - would be undermined if Brussels abandoned a strong competition policy. 'The existence of trans-European networks presupposes that the goods which are transported on them circulate freely,' he points out. Certainly, competition policy remains the staple dish on the commissioners' weekly menu of decisions. Even when new legislative proposals are thin on the ground - as has been the case over the past two years - the volume of competition decisions rarely flags. For example, under Mr Van Miert the Commission last year took 58 merger decisions, compared with 60 the previous year under Sir Leon. Some 435 state aid cases were decided, against 502 in 1992, with roughly the same proportion of positive and negative decisions under both regimes. In fact, the same questions are raised by competition specialists now, as used to be raised when Sir Leon Brittan was in charge of the dossier. Brussels-based competition lawyers agree that yesterday's steel-tubes decision is a setback for officials in the Commission's merger task force. Had the joint venture been blocked it would have been only the second deal to be outlawed in the three-year history of the EU's merger regulation. It would also have established an important legal precedent, by allowing the Commission to take potential duopolies into account when examining the implications of mergers and joint ventures, even when the companies involved had no structural links. But for Mr Van Miert, the decision amounts simply to further evidence that even the best-argued recommendation on competition policy is still subject to the vagaries of a political decision by 17 commissioners. In that respect, nothing has changed since the days of Sir Leon, and, as lawyers point out, nothing will change unless Brussels decides to take the great leap towards the establishment of an independent European competition authority.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Kashmir shrine siege talks collapse VIOLENCE erupted yesterday on the streets of Srinagar, capital of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, after talks on ending the siege of the city's holiest shrine collapsed. At least 40 people were injured as security forces used teargas and batons to disperse hundreds of demonstrators marching in support of militants who have taken control of the shrine and are surrounded by troops. Meanwhile, Pakistan has expelled one Indian diplomat and three staff at the Indian consulate in Karachi for 'indulging in espionage and other activities incompatible with their official status'. The expulsions were in response to India's demand that four Pakistani diplomats leave New Delhi on Monday, after India had charged Pakistan with 'direct' involvement in a conspiracy to damage the holy shrine in Srinagar.</p>

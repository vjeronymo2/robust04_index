			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Republican leader to quit: Michel goes, Gingrich may take over in House IN a move which could herald more confrontational relations between the Republican party and the Democratic administration, Congressman Robert Michel, leader of the Republican minority in the US House of Representatives, yesterday announced he would retire from Congress after the next election. Mr Newt Gingrich, an acid-tongued Georgia conservative, is the front-runner to take Mr Michel's place as leader. Mr Michel has in recent weeks signalled growing disillusionment both over his chances of ever becoming Speaker of the House and over the strident tone of the right-wingers in his party. Announcing his retirement in his native Peoria, Illinois, Mr Michel said that he would have felt an obligation to continue to serve if former President George Bush had won re-election last year. 'I don't have that obligation now,' he said. 'Even though I believe the prospects are excellent for our winning big in the House next year, I'm not sure it will be enough to make me speaker. Therefore, I believe it's appropriate to announce my intention to bow out now, when we're on a high and there's time remaining in this term to help make an orderly transition from my leadership to whomever,' Mr Michel added. Mr Michel, 70, has been in Congress for 37 years and served as House Republican leader since 1980. His obvious discontent with the younger right-wingers in his party in the past few years has less to do with content than with style. His own voting record is solidly conservative on economic, social and foreign policy issues, but he also comes from a tradition of working with the majority Democrats in order to win concessions. He particularly resents those of his colleagues who spend their time in Washington criticising Congress. 'I never went to Congress with the idea of trashing that institution,' he said. The younger right-wingers, who now dominate the House Republicans, 'judge not by philosophy but by belligerence', according to former Republican congressman Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma. Mr Gingrich, a mop-headed former history teacher, has been the leader of this school, and now holds the Republicans' number two position as minority whip. Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader in the other chamber, faces much the same sort of challenge as Mr Michel from Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, another aggressive right-winger.</p>

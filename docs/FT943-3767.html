			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Unbridgeable hatreds divide Moslem and Serb: Beside the ancient Visegrad bridge in Serb-held Bosnia, Laura Silber finds old antagonisms undimmed Amid the destruction of Serb-held Bosnia, the bridge at Visegrad, built more than 400 years ago, bears witness to the region's Ottoman past. For Bosnian Serbs, the bridge's 11 arches, spanning the River Drina, represent the linking of Serb lands. For Moslems, they symbolise Bosnia. Under an international peace plan, overwhelmingly rejected by the Bosnian Serbs, the bridge and most of Visegrad, in the south-east near the Serbian frontier, are designated to the Moslems. With about 135 international monitors due to be deployed this week on the frontiers of Serb-held Bosnia and Serbia proper to supervise Belgrade's embargo, the people of Visegrad are likely to feel even more isolated. It was in the Drina valley that Serb forces undertook some of their most brutal operations at the start of the 28-month war. Here Moslems were expelled and murdered before they even realised that a real war had begun. These days a heavy silence hangs over Visegrad. On a road slicing through the wilds of Bosnia, the densely wooded landscape is tainted by a chain of deserted villages and burned-out houses. In one hamlet on the road to Visegrad, a smashed minaret on a heap of rubble testifies to the area's Moslem heritage. The Serbs of Visegrad cherish the bridge despite the fact that it was built by Mehmed Pasha Sokolovic, the Ottoman Vezir of Bosnia. After all, explains Mrs Snezana Kojic, of the town council, Mehmed Pasha was originally an Orthodox Serb who as a child was kidnapped by the Turks from his home near the Drina. She is retelling the Bridge on the River Drina, the novel in which Nobel prize winner Ivo Andric wove the story of the bridge into four centuries of Bosnian history. Andric wrote that the bridge 'formed an indispensable link on the road between Bosnia and Serbia and further ...' There is still Turkish script etched in stone in the middle of the 180-metre structure. Thirteen verses remind travellers that Mehmed Pasha built the bridge in 1571. Asked why this Ottoman treasure escaped destruction, Mrs Kojic answered, 'It connects Serbs on both banks of the Drina.' 'In any case,' she added, 'Mehmed Pasha went back to his Serbian roots when he came here to build the bridge.' The legend describes how Mehmed Pasha struggled against evil witches who undid the work each night until the Vezir immured two Serb children in the bridge. For centuries, according to Andric, Moslems and Serbs lived in harmony in Visegrad - but their world would quickly come apart whenever neighbouring countries and the Great Powers upset the balance in Bosnia. Now, having erased almost all traces of Turkish rule, local Serbs say they will never give up Visegrad. 'We will not accept this plan,' said Mr Drago Gavrilovic, town boss of the ruling party. Bosnian Serb leaders rejected the proposed maps, which calls on them to surrender one-third of the 70 per cent of Bosnia they control. 'There are no Moslems left,' he says of Visegrad, where they once made up nearly two-thirds of the town's 21,000 inhabitants. Despite Mr Gavrilovic's claims that Serb refugees have brought the population to its pre-war level, wrecked houses once owned by Moslems remain empty. On the eve of the war, one Saban Muratovic, a Moslem, took a sledgehammer to the statue of Andric, which overlooked the bridge. This act, say local Serbs, started the war. Soon after war broke out, the Moslems of Visegrad either fled or were killed. Unconfirmed reports say a paramilitary leader, Vladimir Lukic, led the slaughter - shooting Moslems throughout the night and dropping their corpses off the bridge. Lukic frequents a local cafe on Visegrad's main street. Once named after a Moslem partisan hero it now bears the name of the Russian Cossack volunteer brigades who came to Bosnia to fight with the Serbs. The cafe is the haunt of the new Vezirs of Visegrad - young, battle-scarred thugs whose dull eyes betray no fear. Mrs Kojic scoffs at the notion of an international war crimes tribunal. 'Are we Serbs capable of any crimes?' she asks. In Visegrad, Lukic is a hero. Andric wrote about the Moslems organising gangs to hunt down Serbs after the young revolutionary Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914 - one of the events which triggered the first world war. The bridge then separated Moslems and Serbs. 'The bridge remained as if under sentence of death,' Andric wrote. 'But none the less still whole and untouched between the two warring sides.' By the end of the novel, however, as if in a dream, the old Moslem hodja sees 'the ruined bridge, horribly, cruelly cut in half'. In Visegrad today the front line and the Moslems are far away. 'We are now deep into Serb territory,' says Mr Gavrilovic. Editorial comment, Page 21</p>

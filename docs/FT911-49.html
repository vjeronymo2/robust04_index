			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Leading Article: A charter for consumers THE prime minister has set himself the task of completing work on his citizens' charter this summer. If the charter is to form the centrepiece of the Conservative election manifesto, he would be wise to review his holiday plans - for while the aims are admirable, many important questions about the charter's implementation need to be answered if sceptical consumers are to be convinced of its merits. The charter is designed to raise the quality of public services which cannot immediately be privatised or exposed to competition through contracting out. Budgetary controls can force service providers to make more efficient use of limited resources, but there is often little that consumers can do to ensure that their preferences are satisfied. The citizens' charter - more appropriately a consumers' charter - would strengthen the consumer's voice with two innovations to mimic the relationship between buyer and seller in market transactions. The first would create a contract between the service provider and the consumer which specified the services to be provided. Thus BR might make the commuter a range of promises on matters such as punctuality, cleanliness and reliability of services. NHS patients could be guaranteed treatment within time limits which depended on the seriousness of the complaint. Council tenants would be entitled to repairs within a specified period. Direct redress This contract would be enforced by the consumer through the second innovation: simple and direct channels of redress. So there might be rebates or discounts when a train was repeatedly cancelled. More radically, a consumer whose NHS operation was cancelled could be entitled to reasonable reimbursement for the cost of private treatment (some local authorities already reimburse tenants for the cost of repairs in such circumstances). So far, so good, if a challenge to the imagination. But when it comes to the details of how the charter would operate, substantive proposals are lacking. For a start, which services will be covered? It is hard to see the charter having much to say about education, unless it offers to pick up the fees for Eton for parents let down by their local comprehensive. And what is to stop managers re-organising services to avoid penalties, simply by sharing the misery around more equally? Then there are the cost implications of compensating dissatisfied customers. Even if redress is only in the form of modest cash payments (as BT now offers when it fails to keep home appointments), the cost is born by other customers either in higher charges or worse service. The costs become much more substantial if they empower the customer to claim back the cost of private provision when the public service fails. For the NHS to make a similar offer could lead to a rapid explosion of costs unless the service targets were so modest as to be empty. Consumers' interests Consumer empowerment needs more than just redress systems. The evidence suggests that only a small minority of consumers ever use such systems - and those in most need are often least able to do so. The achievement of the regulators who oversee the newly-privatised utilities suggests a model for advancing the interests of consumers which could be extended to the public services, although a public service regulator could not use his private counterpart's most effective weapon - price restraint - in services which are free at the point of consumption. Questions such as these do not present insuperable problems, but finding answers requires a willingness to confront hard issues. Some public services are poor because they are badly managed: the citizens' charter could certainly encourage improvements. Others are underfunded, and a charter would only expose the low levels of service which have become the norm. To improve many of Britain's public services requires a combination of consumer power and extra investment. Charters alone will not guarantee the improvement in public services which all parties now seem committed to delivering in the 1990s.</p>

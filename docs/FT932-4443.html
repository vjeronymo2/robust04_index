			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Great Portland That expectation is far more powerful than reality in the property market these days is graphically demonstrated by Great Portland Estates. Despite a dilutive Pounds 95m rights issue, a 16 per cent fall in asset values, and a probable 20 per cent dividend cut for 1994, the company's shares sailed 4 per cent higher yesterday. One only wonders what would have happened if it had some really bad news to report. To be fair, Great Portland has earmarked the rights proceeds for worthy purposes. Unlike some of its peers, it is not seeking fresh funds simply to reduce gearing and take the pressure off management to make disposals. The company wants to continue diversifying away from central London real estate. Some Pounds 70m will be used for specified acquisitions; another Pounds 20m will be spent on redevelopment. Those investors with sufficient patience should be rewarded. Over the past 30 years, the property sector has swung between periods of massive underperformance or outperformance against the market. Its general direction has invariably proved more important than its precise valuation. Having sunk so low, it is hardly surprising that its current rebound is so sharp. The entire property sector was worth less than Grand Metropolitan at its nadir last September, accounting for just 1.2 per cent of the FT-A All-Share's capitalisation. Since then, the sector has doubled in value. But there is still a long way to go: at their last peak in 1988, property shares accounted for 4.2 per cent of the market's value.</p>

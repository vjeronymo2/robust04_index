			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOWN AND DIRTY IN THE MARINA;  </P> <P> DIVERS SCRUB AND SCRAPE TO KEEP YACHTS SAFE FROM DENIZENS OF THE BAY  </P> <P> Marko Mavrovich spends most of his working day upside down, immersed in a  cloudy green saline solution whose exact composition would fascinate a  toxicologist. On his hands and knees he scrubs and scrapes, fighting the  resistance of wet suit and water. He breathes slowly -- air is money in this  business -- and works his tongue to expel the steady trickle of brine that  sneaks into an inverted scuba mouthpiece. He hopes the propeller looming in the  murk doesn't suddenly spring to life.  </P> <P> Welcome to the dark underbelly of Marina del Rey, a hidden battleground and  venue of one of the world's toughest jobs. The teak-and-brass encrusted yachts  and their wealthy owners may gleam gloriously in the summer sun, but below the  waterline a voracious community of tiny tubular worms, slimy microbes and  corrosive electrons is on the offensive. And the essential task of defending  boating civilization from this onslaught falls to the hardy young men of the  dive service industry.  </P> <P> "It's a special breed of person who can do this," says Paul Skipper, owner of S  &amp; K Dive Service and a pioneer of the underwater maintenance business in  Marina del Rey. "It's always hard to tell if a guy's really got it in his heart  to work this hard."  </P> <P> Jack Robinson, a former stunt man and owner of Galiongee Mariner Service, said  his firm once went through more than 70 people in one year. And that's for a  job that can pay $500 to $800 for a 30- to 35-hour week. "We get these  ex-Marines and body builders in here saying 'I can do anything,' but they calm  down after a few days." Californians usually can't handle it, says Robinson.  Too laid-back. Israeli army veterans are a much better bet.  </P> <P> Mavrovich, who was raised on an island in Yugoslavia and went to merchant  marine school, is modest about the physical demands of cleaning boat bottoms.  "It keeps you in shape, but it's not something you can do all your life," he  says with massive understatement. Scott Gee, a former Navy diver, notes with a  sardonic grin that "the guys who are used to looking at pretty fish don't last  long." Salvage work in the Navy, Gee says, was child's play compared to boat  cleaning.  </P> <P> Mostly, divers clean off undersea growth, which is as interesting as scrubbing  floors, only harder. In Marina del Rey, the primary culprits are tube worms,  tiny organisms that grow in coral-like strands on metal hardware such as  propellers and on any thinly painted portion of the hull. Don Speaker, owner of  Yacht Services Co. and perhaps the leading local authority on various aquatic  adversaries, says they grow 1/16 of an inch per day in the warm summer water.  Less nefarious algae cling even to well-painted surfaces.  </P> <P> Divers also replace the chunks of zinc that are attached to the hardware of  boats to prevent corrosion. Because propellers, shafts and rudders are made of  metal alloys, they corrode by an electrolysis reaction when immersed in salt  water. When zinc is attached, it corrodes instead of the alloy. Some divers  also wield drills and saws, driven by compressed air, to install knotmeters and  exhaust ports and the like.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Independent Contractors  </P> <P> And then there are "recoveries." July 5, like any other day after a holiday,  brings lots of calls from people who managed to let indispensable items slip  into the harbor. Keys and glasses are the mainstays of recovery, but the  veteran divers have seen it all. Moshe Kotlov of Neptune Divers says he's  recovered a drunk LAPD officer's gun as well as diamond rings, Rolex watches  and credit cards. Skipper once went down after the entire wardrobe of a man  who'd had a fight with his girlfriend.  </P> <P> Nearly all divers, including Mavrovich and Gee, are independent contractors who  work for underwater service companies on a piece-work basis. Typically, the  companies charge 75 cents to $1.10 per foot, depending on the type of boat, for  a monthly clean, and the divers collect 40% to 50% of that fee. Divers who have  the endurance to clean 10 30-foot boats a day can thus do pretty well -- if  they avoid ear infections and adapt to the strange psychological pressure that  comes from spending every day underwater.  </P> <P> They can make even more, of course, if they keep the whole fee for themselves.  And since it takes little more than a regular scuba outfit plus a 40-foot  air-hose (tanks are left on the dock or in a dingy) to be your own business,  the competition is ferocious. In Marina del Rey, four big service companies  have 600 to 1,000 accounts each, but dozens of independent operators also ply  the waters, offering lower prices and promising better service.  </P> <P> In a business where hands-on management means donning scuba gear, quality  control is a major problem for the all the companies, especially since most  customers never really see what they're being billed for. The temptation is  strong, at the end of a tough day, for a diver to wipe off the film along the  waterline and call it a clean. Skipper, Robinson and other owners -- who all  once did the cleaning themselves -- still go under unannounced to check their  contractors' work. As in any service business, customer satisfaction is  everything, and boat owners are a fussy lot.  </P> <P> One would expect divers to get some respect, since the they're the first line  of defense against possible threats to a very valuable investment. Nope. "Most  of the owners see you as the equivalent of a gas station attendant, there to  serve," says Kotlov. "But a few, especially the racers, are very  knowledgeable."  </P> <P> "Race cleans" are in fact the divers dream, as they involve little more than  dusting off the hull of a well-maintained boat. No rock-like tube worms. No  menacing engines. On a recent stellar morning in Marina del Rey, as the divers  from S &amp; K puttered off in their skiffs across the glistening water, it was  almost possible to think of diving as a fun job. Almost.  </P></p>

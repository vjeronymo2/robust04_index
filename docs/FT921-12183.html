			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Pensions fund code issued THE NATIONAL Association of Pension Funds yesterday unveiled a code of practice designed to prevent fund management groups from selling their services based on misleading presentations of their performance records. The code, intended to be voluntary, follows an association study which concluded that fund managers competing for business presented information about their success that made comparisons difficult. Mr David Adams of the British Rail Pension Trust Company, who chairs the NAPF committee which drafted the code, said: 'People naturally wanted to advertise their best points for commercially valid reasons.' The code applies to all unsolicited advertisements received by pension fund trustees and is intended to take effect immediately.</p>

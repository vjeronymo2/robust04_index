			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Leading Article: The way ahead for Poland TWO YEARS ago Poland summoned up the collective will to make the leap across the chasm from a state-controlled economy into the free market. It did so with a lot of external good will, advice, and practical help. Yet today the faltering progress Poland has made stands as both an example and a warning for those emerging nations to its east about to undertake the same great adventure. Even before the fall of communist regimes throughout the region, individual Poles travelled the length and breadth of the Soviet empire trading and building. The entrepreneurial culture was not as enfeebled as in, for example, Czechoslovakia. This individualistic spirit, linked to the continuing existence of private farming, made it possible for Poles to fill their food shops within weeks of embarking on the economic stabilisation plan in January two years ago. That same spirit enabled the remarkably quick privatisation of the retail and wholesale system and service sectors, such as trucking and construction, which are now largely in private hands. What is proving far more difficult is the privatisation and restructuring of the real socialist legacy - the thousands of monopoly enterprises tied in to old technology, but often providing sustenance to entire communities. The hoped-for supply side response to market price stimuli has not worked under these circumstances. The problem was made far more acute by the collapse of the old Comecon, and especially Soviet, market, which many of these factories were specifically created to serve. Bad debts In order to free up resources, many of these enterprises need to be closed. Instead, they have gone on accumulating losses which have been financed by collusion with other enterprises in a similar position. But the growing bad debts of these bankrupt enterprises have deprived the government of its main source of income and made it impossible to contain the public sector deficit. This is serious, not least because the willingness of foreign governments to write off 50 per cent of Poland's Dollars 33bn official debt and the disbursement of investment funds from the IMF and World Bank are linked to a set of performance criteria which Poland has simply not been able to meet. Fragile base At the same time, the political unity which was Poland's strength two years ago has gone. The country's first free democratic elections last October were fought under an electoral law which resulted, predictably, in a parliament with 29 political parties. This has proved a fragile base upon which to build a workable government coalition. Mr Jan Olszewski, a man of impeccable democratic credentials, whom President Walesa himself wanted as prime minister a year ago, managed to secure sufficient support in parliament to form a new government. But he has been undermined by a president whose own political ambitions sit uncomfortably with Poland's attempt to create a parliamentary democracy. This is gravely to Poland's disadvantage. Looking further afield, those countries which in recent years have successfully reformed economies badly distorted by statist policies, such as Mexico, Chile and Turkey, have done so under relatively authoritarian political regimes. This Poland does not need. What is required is the best democratic alternative: a government with broad-based support prepared to persist with the unpopular decisions that must be taken if the sacrifices made thus far are to bear fruit. Last week, the World Bank indicated its continuing support for the transformation of Poland's economy. There is, in any case, little alternative but to carry on with the tasks of stabilisation and privatisation, both of which have been slowed by recent politicking. The rapid development of a dynamic private sector, most of it either export-oriented or service-providing, is the only way for Poland and the other former communist states to provide alternative employment. It is foolish to expect governments to be purist in their devotion to economic adjustment. None the less, they must keep in sight this ultimate economic goal.</p>

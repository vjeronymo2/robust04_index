			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mzimkulu Malunga] </F>   [Text] Nobody can quantify the actual cost of the  Government's Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP] says  the head of the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]  Commission, Professor Ben Turok.    "I think the whole attempt to put a price tag on the RDP was  a mistake. It is too big a programme for anybody to try and  quantify," he says, arguing that the RDP should be treated in  the same way as the Marshall Plan which Western countries put  into place after the Second World War to help Western Europe  recover from the war.    He is adamant that determining the cost of the RDP does not  allay investors' fears either, particularly when there is no  consensus on the actual cost.    Turok is confident that the programme can be financed  through  savings in both the national and provincial budgets. There are  a number of items that have been included in the previous  budgets which can be safely ignored and resources directed  elsewhere, he argues.    At national level, every single Government department is  being scrutinised to identify possible areas where money can be  saved to finance the RDP.    One saving strategy will be to cut down the bureaucracy and  increase efficiency. However, he goes on to say that watering  down the bureaucracy will not amount to large-scale dismissals  of people as there are already a lot of jobs left vacant by  people who quit when South Africa's new era unfolded.    "These jobs that I am talking about are in the budget so we  do not need additional money to pay people who will fill them,  we just need to advertise them, that's all," says Turok.    "The problem is not as big as we thought. For instance, I  was in a meeting with other government officials a few days ago  and we identified R1 million [rands] within minutes," he says.    Turok says there is money that could be found within  government structures as well; an organisation like the  Transvaal Provincial Administration [TPA] has a budget of R6  billion and that money will be going to the PWV government.    It is estimated that the eventual budget for the PWV will  about R12 billion.    He says the TPA is likely to be charged with new  responsibility so that it falls in line with the RDP.    Turok says the R2.5 billion which President Nelson Mandela  announced as initial funding for RDP came from savings.    This long-time Pan-African economist is in favour of duties  on luxury goods such as tobacco and liquor, arguing that the  money coming from such tariffs could create many more jobs  elsewhere.    As for tax increases, Turok believes the forthcoming budget  will not see any hikes in taxes. "The key lies with the  expansion of the economy not in tax increases," he says.    While many expect a public works programme to "kickstart"  the  economy, Turok says the main focus in the PWV will be  nonstimulating productive capacity.    Many of the projects will be based in and around the  townships, and black business will play a key role in ensuring  that this programme bears fruit.    As for the role of multilateral institutions such as the  International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Turok says the  emphasis of the new government is not on borrowing but on  investment.    He says he is happy to see a new sense of realism among  economic commentators in the country. Prior to the elections  the mass media were beating the drums of borrowing, but now  everybody is aware of the consequences of such a move.    In the 1970s many African countries went on a borrowing  spree  and the debt-accumulated interest rates steadily climbed to the  extent that by the mid-eighties Africa found itself in a deep  debt crisis.    Today Africa's debt is about a trillion rands. In some  countries debt repayments swallow up to 40 percent of the total  value of goods and services produced in any given year.    However, this country cannot ignore these powerful financial  institutions. South Africa could still benefit from the  analytical studies that these organisations conduct from time to  time, he says.    "At times their recommendations make a lot of sense," says  Turok, pointing to the fact that in one of its recent studies on  this country, the World Bank suggests a redirection of resources  to disadvantaged areas. The study, according to Turok, says  that the re-allocation of resources from white to black areas  will mean that no additional money will be needed to finance the  reconstruction of the townships.    On foreign money generally, he says: "We are quite happy  with  grants, but a bit cautious with loans."</p>

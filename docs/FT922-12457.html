			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market fails to conquer new peak THE LONDON stock market's phenomenal run finally lost its energy on Thursday as tired traders looked towards the Easter break rather than back at the Conservatives' general election win. Early hopes that the FT-SE Index of the 100 biggest stocks would breach its all-time high faded as the day wore on. International investors, who have been pouring money into London for the past week, took a back seat and Wall Street came off its record high. That lack of support and a more cautious view from the futures markets ensured that the Footsie closed 1.6 off at 2,638.6. Turnover remained significant, but the final figure of 897.4m shares looked slightly less impressive once the impact of a placing of 120m shares in Midland Bank was successfully carried out. Commentators are now expecting the market to pause for breath and possibly drift back. Optimism for a record-breaking burst seemed well founded when the day began. On Wednesday night, the FT-SE future contract for June delivery closed 25 points above its estimated fair value, the premium that takes into account dividends and carrying costs. Then, on Wall Street, the Dow Jones moved up more than 47 points to close at a new high. On Thursday, London marketmakers adjusted their prices accordingly and the Footsie opened 27.5 points higher. It moved up a further 5 points within the first few minutes of trading. Then, as with the Labour party's hopes on April 9, although signs were encouraging the support was lacking. The Footsie dribbled off throughout the day, trading a few points up on the previous day's close in the morning and moving below it after Wall Street began to drift. Turnover was the highest it had been all week, suggesting that customer retail business could have been above Wednesday's Pounds 1.56bn. However, investors were far more selective than previously and some were beginning to take profits on certain stocks. The market received further pressure from the performance of gilts which fell heavily and short sterling, which was also off a few points. It seemed that a rise of some 280 points within six trading days was too much too cope with and analysts said that, while the market has obviously entered a new era following the general election, it could slip back another 80 points before regaining its strength. Retail business in equities was comfortably above Pounds 1bn all week as money poured into London from overseas investors.</p>

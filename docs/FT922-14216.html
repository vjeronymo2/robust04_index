			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / World Trade News: Protectionism 'will hit EC most' THE European Community, and Germany in particular, stand to lose most if the Uruguay Round under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) fails, according to the BDI, Germany's leading industry association. Economic and political reforms in eastern Europe would also be threatened, and the danger of mass migration to the west would be increased. A drift back into protectionism could be 'devastating,' according to Mr Heinrich Weiss, association president. Condemning the EC's 'inefficient and unfair' common agricultural policy and special protection afforded farmers, Mr Weiss demanded determined reform. Concern over prospects for the talks has risen in Germany, where room for political manoeuvre is limited by Bonn's long-standing special relationship with France, the main opponent of agricultural concessions demanded chiefly by the US. It was paradoxical that farming, which contributed just 3.5 per cent of net value added in the Community and 2 per cent in Germany, should be a stumbling block, Mr Weiss said in a report just published. Germany derived 32 per cent of national income from exports, compared with 11 per cent in Japan and 10 per cent in the US. More than 60 per cent of mechanical engineering jobs were export-related, 51 per cent in the motor industry, 57 per cent in chemicals and 46 per cent in electrical engineering, the report said. The Community, accounting for 40 per cent of world trade, was the world's biggest export region, even after allowing for intra-member dealings and would therefore be hardest hit by any relapse into protectionism. The results would include: Higher producer and consumer prices. Current estimates put the cost of protection against imports at between 2 per cent and 3 per cent of gross domestic product, the report claimed. Projected through the EC as a whole, this would amount to Dollars 140bn (Pounds 80bn) annually. Loss of employment. Some 44m people work for exports; a proportion of these jobs would be put at risk. Political conflict and instability, particularly between the the Community, Japan and the US, the so-called triad. Reuter adds from Bonn: The 24 members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development must resolve to continue world trade talks and prevent protectionism if the talks fail, Mr Jean-Claude Paye, OECD secretary-general said. He said it was imperative OECD members 'state very clearly their full resolve to prevent any drift in the direction of protectionist measures.' Portugal's plan for a special meeting of EC trade ministers to discuss world trade talks has been shelved, the European Commission said, Reuter reports from Brussels. Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the EC, had proposed the plan to analyse prospects for Gatt talks before he and European Commission President Jacques Delors visit Washington on April 22.</p>

The  Russian foreign minister expressed his satisfaction at a press  conference in Tashkent on Tuesday [8 February] after the  negotiations with Uzbek Foreign Minister Saidmukhtar Said Asymov.    "These are sharp issues for people but we work to ease them  and not to aggravate the situation through deterioration of  state political relations," Kozyrev emphasized. He suggested  that there would be "good draft proposals," including the ones  on humanitarian issues worked out for the Russian-Uzbek summit  in Moscow planned for February 25.    Earlier, when speaking at the Russian Embassy in Tashkent,  Kozyrev pointed out that the situation with human rights of the  Russian-speaking population had changed in comparison with that  during his previous visit in November, 1993. "It is hard to give  a definite evaluation. However, the element of mutual  misunderstanding seems to have decreased," Kozyrev said.    He met with about 50 representatives of the Russian-speaking  population gathered near the embassy. According to them, there  were incidents connected with violation of human rights and even  physical injuries.    Kozyrev announced that the parties had discussed not only  juridical and humanitarian issues but also economic ones aimed  at strengthening the economic union. In his words, the issue on  a single system of settlement and correlation of the currencies'  exchange rates was high on the agenda.    The military-political issues were also discussed. "I think  we can recommend that the president sign a treaty on  military-political cooperation with Uzbekistan," Kozyrev said.</p>

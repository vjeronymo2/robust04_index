			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE RELEASE of figures showing a rise in industrial production, coupled with a feeling that recent falls had been overdone, helped reverse the recent decline in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened at a poor 2,299 the early trading in the September contract on the FT-SE continued dull for the first few minutes as a large securities house completed a sell order started on Wednesday. Many traders were, at this stage, left with the impression that another dull session was in store. However, with the sell order completed, dealers were keen to cover short positions which helped September regain momentum. The release of favourable industrial production data boosted the contract and it moved gently forward to reach 2,338, the high point of the day by 2pm. Then, early reverses on Wall Street led to more selling, which caused a retreat in the contract. September closed at 2,329, up 28 on Wednesday's close, and around its fair value premium to cash of about 12. Turnover at 10,907 was reasonable. The traded options saw a slight improvement in turnover at 25,593 lots with the FT-SE 100 index option trading 13,337 contracts.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ART NOTES: ARTIST GUERRERO'S DEPICTION OF TIJUANA NIGHT LIFE ON VIEW  </P> <P> Raul Guerrero's moody, provocative paintings of Tijuana night life made their  local debut at the David Zapf Gallery downtown last year. A selection from the  continuing series is now on view in a three-person show at the Saxon-Lee  Gallery in Los Angeles (through Nov. 3). Next January, the David Zapf will  celebrate its second anniversary with a solo exhibition of Guerrero's paintings  and drawings.  </P> <P> The city of Carlsbad recently announced that Guerrero's contribution to last  summer's temporary public art exhibition in Carlsbad has been made permanent.  Guerrero's tile bench on Carlsbad Boulevard and the incised rock trail by Jim  Wilstermann and Machi Uchida, also made for the temporary show, were recently  purchased by the city, marking the first time the city has bought -- rather  than commissioned -- works of art for a public place.  </P> <P> San Diego sculptor and installation artist Kenneth Capps will be exhibiting in  New York from Oct. 27 to Dec. 8. His show at the Vera Engelhorn Gallery will  consist of "steel drawings" and sculpture.  </P> <P> Local sculptor David Beck-Brown was recently appointed artist-facilitator at  the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Ysidro. Beck-Brown had been  the director of Grossmont College's Hyde Gallery and will continue to curate  exhibitions there. In his new position, Beck-Brown and several other artists  will work with inmates in drawing, painting, ceramics and theater.  </P> <P> Performance artist Guillermo Gomez-Pena will speak at the Dia Center for the  Arts in New York on Nov. 10 and 11 as part of a lecture series titled "The  Politics of Images: Issues in the Presentation of Contemporary Art." The series  begins in London at the Tate Gallery this weekend and concludes in New York  next month. Gomez-Pena, a performance artist whose work addresses the  bifurcated nature of life on the U.S.-Mexico border, will speak on "Alternative  Curatorial Roles: Questions in Public and Private Sectors."

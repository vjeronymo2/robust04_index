			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION ISSUE IN COMING ELECTIONS  </P> <P> I was dismayed reading your article "Pro-Choice Groups Target Pringle, 8 Others  for Defeat" (Oct. 15). It clearly seems to suggest that, in fact, pro-choice  politicians will be enjoying more public support than pro-life counterparts.  </P> <P> So many of the facts were misrepresented, it was difficult to ignore. For  instance, Gov. Bob Martinez called a special session of the Florida Legislature  in an attempt to enact some restrictions on abortion. This legislation never  made it out of committee. Indeed, this was a pro-choice win, but not reflective  of the convictions of the entire Florida Legislature, which would have been a  more accurate barometer of actual public opinion.  </P> <P> Tricia Hunter's victory in a run-off election was hailed as a significant  victory for pro-choices. However, she won by an extremely narrow margin over  pro-lifer Dick Lyles, who actually made a strong showing as a write-in  candidate in the final election. Even Ms. Hunter acknowledged that his  percentage of the vote was impressive for a write-in.  </P> <P> I like to see both sides represented fairly. Facts like over 35,000 people have  risked arrest to attempt to save unborn babies and that seven out of 10 state  legislative races have been won by candidates who claim to be in favor of  protecting the rights of the unborn must be considered as well. C'mon, Times,  if you're trying to make a point, at least be fair to the other side.  </P> <P> K.C. WILLIAMS  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Zedillo vote passes 50% mark in Mexican poll Mr Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party won more than 50 per cent of the vote in Sunday's presidential election, according to the latest figures released by the Federal Electoral Institute. The PRI vote has edged above the symbolically important 50 per cent mark thanks to its strong support in rural areas, where ballots have been counted last. With about 90 per cent of results in, the PRI vote stood at 50.1 per cent, the centre-right National Action Party at 26.8 per cent, and the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution at 17 per cent. The turnout in the election was 77.6 per cent, far higher than had been predicted. While the election is widely regarded to have been much cleaner than those in Mexico's past, Civic Alliance, the most prominent group of election observers, has reported widespread irregularities that in says call into question the legality of the result. In 34 per cent of polling booths surveyed the vote was not secret, in 16.5 per cent voters were put under pressure, in 10.2 per cent at least one person voted who was not on the polling station's electoral list, and in 8.2 per cent people were allowed to vote who had indelible ink on their thumb suggesting they had voted before. The latest polling figures show the PRI having won all 32 states in Senate elections, having narrowly defeated the centre-right PAN in the state of Jalisco, and at least 278 of the 300 districts in the election for the Chamber of Deputies. Under Mexico's complex electoral system, which assigns a proportion of congressional seats to the opposition, the ruling party will have 95 of the 128 seats in the Senate, and 300 of the 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. The big PRI victory led to falls in long-term interest rates yesterday, with rates on one-year paper declining to 12.43 per cent. However 28-day paper yields rose and the stockmarket was down nearly 1 per cent by mid-morning.</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Securitisation: a viable financing option - International Earlier this month, GPA, the aircraft leasing company, completed a Dollars 1bn securitisation of its aircraft lease portfolio. The issue, called Alps 94-1, is the second of its kind by GPA and one of only a handful of similar repackagings of aircraft leases. Securitisation allows companies to remove assets from their balance sheets by repackaging them as securities, with interest payments serviced from the cashflows on the assets. In the US, mortgage-backed securities are a Dollars 1,000bn market, and a broad range of other assets, from credit card receivables to car dealers' loans, have been securitised. In Europe, the market has been much slower to take off, partly because there are fewer large homogeneous pools of suitable assets. The largest market in Europe, the UK mortgage-backed sector, has faltered due to the weakness of the housing market. However, the Alps deal is an example of the applications of securitisation to niche areas such as aircraft financing, and may point the way towards the development of a smaller, more structured market for securitisation in Europe. The decline in the credit quality of airlines in recent years has made it increasingly difficult for them to secure funding through conventional aircraft lease financing. In particular, the appetite of Japanese institutions for leveraged lease transactions has shrunk. 'The banks and other specialised financial institutions which have traditionally financed the airline industry are reviewing their exposure, retrenching and in some cases withdrawing altogether,' says Mr Ian Falconer, head of securitisation at Freshfields, the City law firm. 'A full-scale securitisation re-characterises the perceived risks away from the particular industry in to a homogeneous tradeable instrument with a prime credit rating.' The result is that securitisation - where credit ratings are based on the quality of the assets and the structure of the transaction - suddenly appears an economically-viable option. The senior tranche of the Alps deal pays interest of 48 basis points over Libor, compared with a spread of up to 100 basis points which would have been needed for conventional financing, according to bankers. 'Some of these credits could not be done at over 100 basis points in the bank-funded market,' said one banker. However, few companies have the right sort of characteristics to benefit from transactions such as the Alps deal. Because GPA is a lessor, rather than a lessee, it can offer the substantial diversification needed to complete a public offering of securities. Most airlines cannot offer such diversification, and therefore any deals are likely to be completed as private placements, with a more specialised group of investors. However, some deals will be done by grouping airlines together and pooling their leases to create the necessary diversification. Others will be done as individual credits, based on the recovery value of the aircraft and backed by an 18-month liquidity facility (for long-term financings of 10-12 years). There is likely to be a growing number of transactions, although most will not be publicised. 'The fact is that there is an ageing fleet out there and there will be an increasing need to purchase new aircraft,' said Mr Guy Hands, executive director, European securitisation, at Goldman Sachs. There is also likely to be an increase in activity in other more esoteric areas. Airlines unable to securitise their leases are trying instead to securitise the receivables from ticket sales, for example. 'We are working on some of the strangest beasts, securitising things like chemical and petroleum products and shipping leases,' said a securitisation specialist at one bank in London. Bankers are also working on securitising commercial property loans, particularly in areas like France and Scandinavia, where banks are weighed down by illiquid loans. Among the other assets being securitised in private transactions are trade receivables in southern and east European countries and other developing countries. The notion of pooling small groups of assets has already been successfully used in the asset-backed commercial paper market. In recent years, several European banks, including NatWest, Deutsche and UBS, have set up conduit vehicles, backed by clients' receivables, which issue commercial paper in the US market. The market for asset-backed securities may never become the liquid, highly-traded market it is in the US, but a more structured market may be evolving. Its importance, according to Mr Falconer, is that it 'enables originators to diversify away from their traditional bank sources of finance into the capital markets, in circumstances where the originator would be unable to access the capital markets in its own name and on the strength of its own balance sheet. This is particularly important for originators in sectors which are out of favour with the banks, or in respect of which the banks are already fully lent'.</p>

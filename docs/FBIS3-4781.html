			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Japanese and U.S. Negotiators Need to Stop </F> Thinking Like Bureaucrats and Lawyers"]    [Text] The new economic framework talks between Japan and  the United States looked like a dispute between a group of  lawyers and the bureaucracy.    The main posts in the Clinton administration are occupied by  lawyers, including President Clinton and U.S. Trade  Representative Kantor, who is in charge of negotiations with  Japan. American lawyers make free use of various logical  arguments to achieve their goals. Sometimes, therefore, they  are unable to see the whole situation.    In the Japan-U.S. consultations, such thinking had it that  because Japan was a peculiar nation, the only way to open its  markets was to set numerical targets. Some of their arguments  completely ignored the reality of Japan's economic position.    Those who faced the U.S. lawyers were Japanese bureaucrats.  The Ministry of Finance, which puts a premium on financial  logic, is at the center of the bureaucratic system.    Japan delayed compiling economic pump-priming measures.  Moreover, the Economic Reform Study Council, which was set up to  tackle issues likely to be raised at the Japan-U.S. economic  talks, failed to spell out the drastic measures Japan should  adopt to reduce its trade surplus because of interruptions by  bureaucrats.    If the two countries do not take a new approach different in  the future, they will be unable to find a solution to their  unresolved bilateral trade problems.    Since the summit talks, the United States has begun to adopt  a policy of shaking Japan into action. U.S. officials made  comments approving the yen's appreciation. The country is  preparing to impose sanctions, asserting that Japan is not being  fair over the issue of mobile phones. The president himself  criticized Japanese bureaucrats.    It seems the United States is trying to get compromises from  Japan by making it feel uneasy. The reason why the United  States has delayed announcing an expected revival of the Super  301 provision of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act may  be that it is now watching to see what moves Japan will take.    The Japanese Government, which was upset by the U.S.  strategy, has moved to work out new market-opening measures. It  is beginning to look as though, as far as relations with the  United States are concerned, Japan does not act without pressure  from Washington, and is inviting strong arm tactics from the  United States. However, the U.S. strategy is a "dangerous game."    There is fear that Japan-U.S. relations will fatally worsen  as long as the United States continues to demonstrate such an  aggressive attitude. The way in which the United States takes  lightly multilateral trade rules will only lead to it falling in  the estimation of the international community. We would like to  earnestly ask the U.S. administration to show self-restraint.    As for the mobile phone issue, it is not clear which part of  the Japan-U.S. accord Japan is violating. There is a strong  impression that the office of the U.S. Trade Representative,  which was trying to find fault with Japan, and Motorola, Inc.,  which wants to reduce its stocks, cooperated in coercively  raising the issue. The two countries should move to make  concessions before sanctions are exercised.    The Japanese Government will start a full study of new  market- opening measures next week. We would like to make two  requests, and urge the government to come up with fruitful  measures.    First, new market-opening action should help cut the trade  surplus. The reason why the U.S. administration is hastily  demanding results on trade issues is that it is irritated at  Japan's trade surplus, which has not decreased at all. The  Japanese Government must steadily implement measures to expand  domestic demand and approve the yen's appreciation to its  current level.    The second request is that the government implement drastic  deregulation to sweep away the Japan revisionism [nihon  ishitsuron] which has deeply infiltrated the Clinton  administration.    It has been revealed that the Ministry of International  Trade  and Industry instructed economic organizations to support the  economic pump-priming package recently announced by the  government. The U.S. negotiators must have questioned whether  "the Japanese Government, which controls domestic industries in  this way, is qualified to oppose managed trade." The collusion  between government and industry has grown worse.    Although there are problems with the way the U.S. has dealt  with the mobile phone issue, some people have pointed out the  lack of clarity in the way the Ministry of Post and  Telecommunications administers such issues and its excessive  regulations on and intervention in industry.    The government regards the promotion of deregulation as the  main plank of its new market-opening measures. However, we  question to what extent deregulation will be implemented.  Unless the prime minister gives a shock to bureaucrats by  showing his readiness to replace all officials higher than  bureau chiefs at each ministry, the nature of the bureaucracy  will probably not change.</p>

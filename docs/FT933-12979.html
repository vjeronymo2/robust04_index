			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jittery oil market awaits Opec action A JITTERY World oil market looked to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries for action this week to halt the collapse in prices that has been caused by expectations of Iraq's return to the export market. But although member countries have agreed to meet in Vienna next Wednesday, their room for manoeuvre is severely limited. The uncertainty surrounding Opec's action and the likelihood of an Iraqi agreement with the United Nations on oil exports will add to price volatility in the coming week. 'It is very difficult for Opec to do anything, the best they can hope for is that Iraqi exports hit the market in the fourth quarter when demand will be higher,' said Mr Geoff Pyne, oil analyst at UBS in London. The recovery in oil prices from a three-year low of Dollars 15.98 a barrel in London on Monday to Dollars 16.71 yesterday bears witness to the market's faith in Opec's ability to deal with the situation. The organisation is at its best when managing a crisis and a collapse in price has in the past galvanised it into decisive action. Mr Jean Ping, Gabon's oil minister and current president of Opec, set off for Saudi Arabia yesterday on the first leg of his tour of the Middle East, where he will be seeking to build some degree of consensus ahead of the July 28 meeting. But some industry observers see Opec's moves as little more than a cynical attempt to talk up the oil price. 'I'm not sure they have enough goodwill to take any decisive action,' said Ms Irene Himona, analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull securities house, in London. Opec has at least achieved a short-term aim of improving oil prices, even though many buyers are steering clear of the market until some of the uncertainty is cleared away. If the organisation is unable to follow through with any attempt to staunch the flow of its own oil and make room for Iraq in the market, it could face a price collapse of several dollars. However, its hands will remain effectively tied until it knows the terms of any oil accord reached between Iraq and the UN. The Iraqi government is still considering a draft deal reached last week, but there are many technical details to be clarified. Oil prices collapsed over the weekend and fell further on Monday following the Baghdad government's expression of willingness to comply with UN requirements over monitoring of missile sites. Although this is not directly connected to the oil talks it is seen as improving the chances of agreement being reached on a Dollars 1.6bn oil sale to pay for humanitarian aid. One problem for Opec is that its members are all producing at more than their current output ceilings and Kuwait is steadily building up its own production after refusing to sign on to the organisation's last accord. Opec's overall ceiling is 23.6m barrels a day but the flow of members' oil is believed to have reached between 24.3m b/d and 24.5m b/d. A first step for Mr Ping would be to persuade members to improve their performances on adherence to the existing quotas. Traders point out that Opec countries have mostly sold their crude for August and would be unable to cut exports immediately. But they could trim production in order to stick to their quotas from September. Towards the end of the year oil demand picks up for seasonal reasons, which makes the timing of any Iraqi oil deal crucial. Fourth quarter demand for Opec oil could be as high as 26m b/d, which gives the organisation room to accommodate some 500,000 b/d from Iraq as well as higher Kuwaiti output, as long as the other member countries keep production within their current quotas. The real haggling for Opec will come if the Iraqis win agreement for an earlier return to the market. That could result in other member countries having to cut their existing output if they wanted to prevent prices collapsing. But Opec has had so little success in its past few meetings - with most countries continuing to produce flat-out regardless of their agreed ceilings - that it will be extremely difficult to apportion cuts. 'After the mess they made of the last meeting, I don't think they would be able to convince even the hall porter in the Vienna Marriott if they say they're cutting back immediately,' said one trader with a major oil company. Other analysts point out that the organisation needs to develop a game plan for dealing with the situation after the return of Iraq to the market, as the Dollars 1.6bn one-off sale could be followed by a wider lifting of sanctions. 'They have no aces up their sleeves, but they need to remove the uncertainty over what they might do when Iraq comes back,' said Mr Joe Stanislaw, analyst with Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Boston. With oil prices having dropped by about Dollars 3 a barrel over the past month, the producers' cartel needs to reach swift agreement on any action it can take to support the market, even if that only involves some smart talking.</p>

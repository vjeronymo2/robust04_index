			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy </F> by Pavel Paral; place and date not given: "I Do Not Advocate  the Asian Tigers' Principle for This Country"]    [Text] [Paral] The government forecasts economic growth  of 2-3 percent this year, while the Czech National Bank [CNB]  anticipates 2 percent at most. These figures seem rather small  to me considering that they are seen as a turning point in  economic development. Apparently, all the basic things in  reform have been done.    [Dlouhy] Are you sure that everything has been done?    [Paral] The prime minister declared recently that reform was  over.    [Dlouhy] We will certainly still get round to enterprise  management, enterprises that have gone through coupon  privatization, the role of the privatization funds, and the real  state of relations between the owner and management. This is  all just in the process of being defined and will be defined.  On the other hand, I would not make an issue out of the  differences between the government's estimate and that of the  CNB. Bankers everywhere are, by nature, more skeptical than  politicians, who "must" instill optimism.    [Paral] I am not making an issue out of it. It is just that  the two estimates seem low to me.    [Dlouhy] If 2-percent growth is achieved, it will be a very  good result, and I will consider it a real success. However,  this is conditional on several facts. First and foremost, on  whether the current dynamism of exports can be maintained. It  will also depend, in the annual context, on how 1993 turned out.  I said in July that the second half of the year would be worse  and that we should expect decline. I was criticized for this,  but we had a decline in the third quarter--for a rather prosaic  reason. The third quarter of 1992 was so high that the  year-to-year comparison simply had to be worse.    On the other hand, the first quarter of 1993 was very low,  so  the first quarter of this year may be high. This is what  reporters have said, after all. So, when growth is being  considered, statistical issues play a role.    It is also of no fundamental importance whether economic  growth this year is 1 or 2 or 2.5 percent. On the other hand,  what is of fundamental importance is the fact that the trend in  the gross domestic product [GDP] is from - 14.2 percent in 1991  to - 7.1 percent in 1992, zero in 1993, and + 1.8 or + 2.2  percent in 1994, which not even RUDE PRAVO, which is associated  more with the opposition political parties, can overlook as  successful economic development.    Growth will depend on the dynamism of exports. I have to  mention that, from the point of view of the UN European Economic  Commission, for instance, the Czech Republic was the only former  communist country that recorded an increase in exports. In view  of the figures already referred to, further growth in the first  quarter is virtually certain. Furthermore, we can expect growth  in real domestic demand, both in investments and in households'  consumption.    [Paral] In your opinion, then, is this year going to be a  real turning point in the Czech economy's performance?    [Dlouhy] You always use shock therapy terminology. Why do  you always expect a turning point? I like this trend, - 1.1 in  1990, then - 14.2, - 7.1, and 0, and now it is improving  slowly and, in time, cyclical fluctuations will become the norm.  Would you want economic development like this? (Vladimir Dlouhy  draws a V-shaped graph)    [Paral] Yes.    [Dlouhy] I do not advocate the Asian Tigers' principle for  this country.    [Paral] Do you think that, after such a profound decline,  growth rates between 2 and 3 percent are acceptable for this  country?    [Dlouhy] Let us be realists in 1994 and 1995. The basic  building blocks for a market economy have been laid in a  rudimentary form here and, from this point of view, we are  really a market economy. However, from the point of view of  privatization, we see that small private enterprises are the  only effective segment. This applies to only a few of the large  enterprises, and a number of them will still undergo  restructuring under the management of new owners. Nevertheless,  they will also undergo a certain learning process, how to own  and manage properly, which is, without a doubt, a bit of an  impediment. Therefore, I do not anticipate particularly rapid  growth for the next two years. It will then depend on the kinds  of lessons this country learns and on the external conditions.  Given a sensible economic policy, we can then achieve greater  economic growth. I repeat, however, that I have never claimed  that we can become an Asian Tiger. Nevertheless, if I am  mistaken, all the better.    [Paral] We have a Polish neighbor, however, who has  conducted a very similar economic policy, apart from  privatization, and recorded a growth rate of approximately 4  percent last year and expects to do the same this year.    [Dlouhy] Of course, the situation is a little different in  Poland. You have to realize that they have a different  situation as far as their debt, inflation, and other  macroeconomic indexes are concerned. Apart from this, I feel  that there is a danger of the economy in Poland overheating.  All the data tells me that we did well when we embarked on a  path of maximum macroeconomic stabilization. Now, of course,  while maintaining stability, we are looking for growth as fast  as possible. If it is 2 percent next year, thank God.    [Paral] Are the Poles not achieving higher growth because  they have also paid more attention to structural changes?    [Dlouhy] We compiled special industrial figures for the  first three quarters of 1993. We can elicit a specific change  in the structure from these figures. Industry is contracting.  This is not a tragedy, however. After all, we said that  industry has to be reduced in size. Of course, it must not  disappear into a black hole, but it is quite in order for  industry to be reduced in size from the point of view of the  number of employees and from the point of view of its proportion  of the GDP. This is a natural restructuring process.    The issue here mainly involves whether restructuring is  taking place during a period of decline. An average of  35,000-40,000 people per month are made redundant in our  country. Despite this, the unemployment rate is rising  relatively slowly. This means that the majority of these people  find a new job immediately. At the same time, I see changes in  the cost structure, in productivity, and in employment away from  heavier branches such as metallurgy, the power-generating  industry, and bulk chemicals toward general engineering and  certain branches of light industry. Therefore, I am able to  argue that slowly but surely changes are taking place.    [Paral] Don't you think that branches such as heavy  engineering should be shaped and restructured according to  demand? After all, they know that we have to build roads and  highways, reconstruct railroads, and modernize the telephone  network and that materials and equipment are necessary for this.    [Dlouhy] Am I preventing the managements of these firms from  making the predictions you mention? I sincerely hope that they  are making them. If they are not doing this, they are bad  managements.    [Paral] But the government has a very stepmotherly attitude  toward these projects?    [Dlouhy] This is not true. Last year, especially in the  second half of it, was the first time we said something more  conceptual about the infrastructure. You have to realize that  we inherited a divided state. A strategy was devised in the  second half of the year to construct a highway network before  the year 2005. By the way, the Bavarian industry minister told  me that it is clear to him that we will complete the highway  from Prague to Rozvadov in 1997, but they will not complete  their 35 kilometers from Amberg until the year 2000. This means  that these projects do not proceed so fast even in Germany. We  now know that the Prague-Berlin, Breclav-Vienna, and  Nuremberg-Prague railroad routes will be constructed. Other  issues are also under discussion. Tenders are being issued for  the Ingolstadt oil pipeline. The fundamental trends in the  upgrading of telecommunications are also obvious. No company is  being prevented from structuring itself in accordance with  anticipated demand.    [Paral] I have heard that only half of the budget resources  intended for investment were drawn on last year.    [Dlouhy] I do not know these figures by heart. If this were  indeed the case, it would not be due to unwillingness on the  part of the government. I have not come across a case whereby  the Finance Ministry has not wanted to apportion the funds  projected by the state budget for investments. If this is the  case, it means that these projects were not ready.    [Paral] As far as I am aware, your opinion of the budget was  somewhat different from the current budget concept asserted by  the Finance Ministry. Do you think that the budget also has to  be balanced in the short term?    [Dlouhy] It depends on whether you look as this issue as the  trade and industry minister or as the finance minister. If I  were finance minister, I would work for a constantly balanced  budget. As industry minister, I like the idea of expenditure  temporarily exceeding revenue with its possibilities for  rejuvenating the economy and for facilitating the opposite ratio  between income and revenue in the future. The problem is that  few people have recorded such development in the history of  advanced countries. This is an argument against my point of  view. The Reagan policy began well in this regard in 1981,  then, under political pressure following the deployment of SS-20  missiles, the United States had to increase its armaments, and  the potential budget surplus was nullified in this process.    Despite this, I would at least leave it open to discussion  that it is unnecessary to be afraid of a sensible deficit if it  really has the effect of economic growth. On the other hand,  the question is to what extent our economy is ready for such  stimuli. To what extent the businessman is capable of using tax  relief, the foreign investor will really use such relief for our  development, and so on. The question is, what effect would a  greater volume of state orders and so on have on demand? We  could take the prime minister at his word here. If we have  indeed laid the foundations of the market economy, we should  begin to believe more in the progrowth effect of the budget  deficit.    [Paral] Now, of course, enterprises both private and state  are grappling with the fact that they have no money. The reason  is widespread insolvency. However, they have not been provided  with sufficient capital since the era of state ownership.    [Dlouhy] This is a combination of several problems. The  first is the problem of primary and secondary insolvency. A  number of people have expressed opinions that insolvency should  begin to be perceived as a specific business credit. I am not  saying that insolvency has ceased to be a problem to me. It is  enforced, whereas business credit is voluntary.    [Paral] I think the fact that the enterprise cannot afford  this is an even greater problem. It cannot afford to defer  payment because it would not have anything to make purchases  with.    [Dlouhy] But this is also because the banks do not want to  give it anything because it is in a poor financial situation,  and it is in a poor financial situation because the firms it  supplies do not pay it. Low capitalization is associated with  the level of savings--how people and companies are able to make  a profit and how they are willing to turn it into capital. We  have too short a time behind us for this. A number of  businesses are making a loss. Only a few businesses make such a  large profit that they can immediately invest it. Credit is  also accessible to only a limited circle of enterprises. There  is no long-term financing or long-term credit in this country.  After all, RUDE PRAVO should be closer to Marx--from the point  of view of membership in political parties--than I am. If  something is perfectly described in Das Kapital, then  it is, in the first volume, the original accumulation of  capital. This is quite relevant from the point of view of the  Czech economy in the 1990's. In England, the original  accumulation of capital took decades, and, although the  situation is now completely different, we had an incredibly  undernourished economy here after 40 years, an economy that has  even received a couple of blows from outside--for example, the  collapse of traditional markets and the recession in Europe.    There is another reason we will not emulate the Asian  Tigers:  South Korea and Taiwan tightened their belts and created a  capital basis to the detriment of the population's standard of  living. This cannot be implemented in our country. So, in our  country, the 1990's will be a period of forming capitalization.  All of this will still lead to many changes in the structure of  the economy and to changes in employment. By saying this, I am  not imparting pessimism. This is sober and real optimism,  which, however, forces me to accept that our enterprises are  under capitalized, that it is difficult for them to gain access  to finance, and that this is associated with a whole bundle of  problems that will begin to be unwrapped gradually.    [Paral] In the wake of coupon privatization, a large number  of enterprises are in the hands of the major investment funds,  and it is not in their interest to increase the enterprise's  capital. The fund is interested in having a good enterprise in  its portfolio and not in helping an enterprise in difficulty.  When an enterprise finds itself in trouble, the fund sells its  shares and buys others and does not extricate it from the mess.  What are your experiences?    [Dlouhy] Naturally, there are a great many problems here.  In part, in the actual execution of ownership. There are  difficulties in administration, management, supervision of it,  in some places outright gold-digging by means of membership on  boards, collecting royalties, and so on.    You say that in advanced countries the funds try to sell an  enterprise in difficulty. In this advanced economy--and the  more so in our country--they also try to restructure and revive  this enterprise before they sell it. We said that the state  will do this only in exceptional cases. The new owners should  do this. The funds will be in a situation where they will have  good and bad enterprises and where they will inherit large  holding companies--for instance, Aero. To sell them, they will  have to be restructured. A bad enterprise will be divided. The  completely inefficient part will be declared bankrupt, and the  remainder will be kept or sold. What is happening is not  evidence of a poorly chosen means of privatization.    I personally place greater emphasis on the issue of  executing  ownership rights. It is not that people do not know how to make  strategic decisions. The problem is putting such a decision into  effect--both from the point of view of the supervisory council  and the owner and the board and the director general. This is  where I see the weakest element. The issue does not so much  involve the managers--we have good ones--but the method of  supervising them, encouraging them, and their sometimes  unnecessarily high salaries.</p>

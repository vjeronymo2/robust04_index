			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Arts: Today's Television BBC2's generally good series of sports documentaries On The Line deals today with England's first-class cricket umpires. Who knew that after a county match umpires are 'marked' by the team captains? With only a seasonal contract and the sort of intimidation of umpires now practised by players, the job looks pretty unappealing (8.30). The penultimate offering in BBC2's season of drama repeats from the 1960s and 70s, The Wednesday Play, is 'Hard Labour', devised by Mike Leigh, and with a cast that includes Bernard Hill, Ben Kingsley and Alison Steadman. (9.00). The star is Liz Smith who plays a put-upon housewife and char. In its 'gay' season Channel 4 shows the movie The Hours And Times, an account of an imaginary weekend in Barcelona in 1963 with John Lennon resisting the advances of Beatles' manager Brian Epstein. ITV pursues its fixation upon crime and punishment with a 2 1/2 hour drama documentary about a young criminal who killed himself in Swansea prison three years ago, 15: The Life And Death Of Philip Knight (9.00).</p>

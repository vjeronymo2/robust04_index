			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Arts: Ubu - Theatre Alfred Jarry (1873-1907) wrote the first of his four Ubu plays in 1896. It ran for two nights at its opening, and has been perplexing audiences ever since. Now, the Nada Theatre has taken its Avignon Festival version of the Ubu plays on tour: this makes anarchic, playful and life-enhancing theatre. Jarry wrote the original for puppets. Nada use fruit &amp; veg. They tell a tale of regicide, state ceremony, political intrigue, insurrection and war. The cast amounts to two actors and a battalion of 'fruits et legumes': leeks, potatoes, cabbages and celeriac. The exotica arrive in the form of 'ananas' and 'pamplemousse'. Vegetables without stage presence (mushrooms, peas, jerusalem artichokes) need not apply. But the cast still needs a little purple asparagus for the regal touch. Ubu feels like an allegory for something else; but, as befits a play adored by the high surrealist Guillaume Apollinaire, it signifies nothing. Through the alchemy of theatre, anything can mean anything; or as Hans Arp used to say, 'the tongue is a chair'. The play does provide a full platter of madness and invention. The range of the actors (Babette Masson and Guilhem Pellegrin) beggars belief. Masson's voice soars to become a bagpipe at a military parade and plummets to mimic the gravelly tones of a palace guard. She controls the vegetable-puppets and wields the vegetable-weapons. Pellegrin negotiates the wonderful miming: including a stage horse and a final voyage out, done with some water in a zinc bathtub. As the actors commune with the vegetables, one is gradually implicated into the winning absurdity of the evening. Where conspirators are cabbages, the 'noblesse' leeks, and high financiers yellow peppers; life in the kitchen garden suddenly seems to apply everywhere. Ubu is acted in French, and lasts a breathless and exhilarating hour. Tour: Warwick Arts Centre (June 15-16); Manchester Green Room (June 18-20); Glasgow Tramway (June 22-24): all details on 041-422-2023.</p>

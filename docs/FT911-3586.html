			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: MCI down 21% despite revenue rise MCI Communications suffered a 21 per cent fall in first - quarter earnings in the highly competitive US long-distance telephone market, despite record revenues. The second largest long-distance carrier earned Dollars 123m, or 48 cents a share, down from Dollars 156m, or 62 cents, a year ago. Revenues advanced to just over Dollars 2bn from Dollars 1.8bn, but operating income fell to Dollars 265m from Dollars 283m. Mr Bert Roberts, president, blamed the decline on the recession and competitive pressures. He noted that MCI had launched an unusually large number of services in recent months, notably Friends &amp; Family, which offers discounts to residential subscribers for frequently-called numbers. MCI has a 13 per cent share of the long-distance market. Although MCI's share was boosted by last year's acquisition of Telecom USA, the fourth-biggest operator, it was expected to have garnered a larger slice of the market by now. Mr Courtney Munroe, analyst at Northern Business Information, said MCI's problems have been compounded by aggressive cost-cutting. 'In trying to improve margins they've cut corners in customer service,' he said. Recent surveys by NBI indicate that, despite a host of impressive new services, MCI's image in the marketplace has deteriorated as a result of the belt-tightening measures.</p>

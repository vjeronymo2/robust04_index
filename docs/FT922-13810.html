			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Arts: The Beggar's Opera Is this latest RSC The Beggar's Opera the same play which prompted Sir John Hawkins to comment in 1776: 'Rapine and violence have been gradually increasing since its first representation'? Director John Caird's anodyne middle-of-the road version would scarcely seem to be so. This pleasant, pasteurised production at The Swan, Stratford-upon-Avon, capitalises on the longueurs of John Gay's 1728 original, but fails to catch the trenchancy of Gay's urban-pastoral wit. This results in undemanding, easy theatre which belies the demands levied on a cast enjoined to sing and act. Caird has homogenised the action in an RSC period blend of costume, set and manner. If Kendra Ullyart's fine tumbledown design pleases the eye, the play's issues hardly touch the mind; after all, the Opera was important enough to be condemned by Burke and copied by Brecht. Gay deserves more stringency, for this is funny social satire which pillories the usual eighteenth-century targets (lawyers, medics, bankers) by siding with the underworld of pimps and pick-pockets. The message is that 'of all animals of prey, man is the only sociable one'. The plot follows Captain Macheath, a polygamist highwayman loved by Polly and Lucy, the daughters of his fence and his gaoler. The play opens in a bedlam of competing sights and voices, and slowly untangles itself. The action takes place as a performance in St Giles, London, topped and tailed with an induction and moral; this gives actors licence to play actors, and the customary RSC clap-along finale knitting up the play is especially protracted. The Opera has as much opera as drama. Ilona Sekacz's Muzak score amounts to folksong soundbites ('Over the Hills', 'Lillibullero') with more bass and wire brushes than suits the music. Even easy listening can be entertaining, but these snippets are never consistently melodic enough to build a musical structure, so one does not identify characters by how or what they sing. The best musical scene has Macheath's two wives, Polly and Lucy, simultaneously and separately pining for him below stage - that makes melodic sense. The singing needs to be everywhere more confident and relaxed; individuals sound painfully exposed against the amplified background. The sprawling action finds its high points: a wonderful coach chase and highway robbery, a trawl of trollops from Cheapside called to solace Macheath, and some grubby Newgate scenes from a tightly-run, privatised gaol. Paul Jesson as Peachum the fence and Anthony O'Donnell as Lockit the gaoler stay on terms with Gay's text, trading the great line 'I can forgive, as well as resent'. David Burt rightly plays a hopeful Macheath, orbited by Elizabeth Renihan (Polly) and Jenna Russell (Lucy). Nick Holder as a rough 'Brummie' brigand enlivens every scene he acts. In the end, the entire cast is either hanged or transported, until the author's companion (played by the dignified Griffith Jones) intervenes for a happy conclusion.</p>

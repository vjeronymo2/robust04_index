			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MT. SAC RELAYS;  </P> <P> WALNUT TAKES DANA HILLS OUT OF RELAY  </P> <P> Mike Tansley never had a chance. And for that, he can thank Matt Hempel.  </P> <P> Tansley, running the anchor leg of the boys' 4 x 1,600-meter relay at the Mt.  San Antonio College Relays Friday, never got a chance to show his speed.  </P> <P> Hempel, part of a brother combination for Walnut, broke the race open on the  leg before Tansley got the baton, and Dana Hills was too far behind to make it  close.  </P> <P> Hempel got the baton back in fifth place but ran powerfully into the lead  midway through his leg. And when he handed off to brother Scott, Walnut had a  10-second lead on Dana Hills.  </P> <P> Walnut went on to win in a meet-record 17 minutes 35.61 seconds, breaking Santa  Barbara's 10-year-old standard of 17:42.8.  </P> <P> Dana Hills, despite a fine 4:19.75 leg by Tansley, was a well-beaten second in  17:44.77. Tansley had turned in a personal-best and school-record of 9:10.11  for 3,200 two weeks ago at the Arcadia Invitational.  </P> <P> Steve Niednagel, Andrew Tansley and Dan Niednagel ran the first three legs for  Dana Hills.  </P> <P> Mater Dei, thanks to a strong 4:17.5 anchor leg by Mike Nielsen, came from  behind to take third in 17:47.94.  </P> <P> El Modena was fifth in 18:02.27.  </P> <P> Earlier in the afternoon, with 600 meters to go in the boys' invitational  3,000, a pack of about six runners -- including Jimmy Rodriguez of Santa Ana  Valley -- were bunched at the front.  </P> <P> But David Welsh of Sacramento Jesuit quickly ruined any hopes the others had of  winning. Welsh used a long, drawn-out kick to win in a meet-record 8:23.11,  breaking the old mark of 8:24.7 set by Ramon Gomez of L.A. Belmont in 1984. And  in the process he pulled the field to some very fast times.  </P> <P> Jorge Ibarri of Mexico was second in 8:25.97, and Bryan Dameworth of Agoura was  third in 8:29.02.  </P> <P> Rodriguez was fifth in 8:31.12, a personal best for the distance, which is run  less often than the 3,200 in boys' competition.  </P> <P> Eddie Lavelle of Corona del Mar, who had run in third until just past the 1,600  mark, finished seventh in 8:34.06. Lavelle will run the invitational 1,500  today at 11:20 a.m.  </P> <P> Orange County teams fared well in boys' 4 x 400 meter relays.  </P> <P> Edison had the fastest time among county teams, running 3:24.97 for second in  its race. Ken Arao, a transfer student from Japan, ran an unofficial 50.8  leadoff leg, Matt Hart followed with a 53.8, Tom Tyler 50.5 and Dave Baker 50.0  as Edison finished a close second to Leuzinger (3:24.44).  </P> <P> Katella ran 3:26.84 to edge Valencia, which ran 3:26.88, to win its heat.  </P> <P> In the 4 x 100 relay, Valencia's team of Eric Whitcomb, Rick Smith, Brian  Anderson and Kevin Thomas ran 44.1 to win its heat over second-place Etiwanda  (44.4) and third-place Edison.  </P> <P> Mt. SAC Notes  </P> <P> The high school portion of the meet continues today at 8 a.m. . . . Brian  Zeiler of Trabuco Hills won the pole vault with a leap of 13-feet-6. . . . Andy  Marron of Dana Hills finished second to Terry Pearce of Paso Robles in the  discus. Pearce outthrew Marron 154-7 1/2 to 144-9.  </P></p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Home-grown recessions THIS week's House of Commons exchanges between Britain's incumbent prime minister and the pretender to his throne were unedifying. On both Tuesday and Thursday, Mr Major and Mr Kinnock engaged in a row over whether the government or the outside world should be blamed for the length and depth of the current UK recession. The truth lies in between. Mr Major's injured innocence is understandable. Over the past two years he has done almost everything that both the British economic establishment has told him to do, and that Labour said it would do. He has joined the European exchange rate mechanism, cut interest rates regularly, and effectively ditched his balanced budget rule. But the economy remains stuck in its sixth quarter of recession, with no chance of a worthwhile pre-election recovery. It is true that growth has also slowed in Japan and Europe, and turned to recession in the US and Canada. Yet Mr Kinnock's argument carries weight. The UK recession started first, and has proved deeper than in all these countries. Moreover, its immediate cause is the tight monetary policy in the two years prior to ERM membership. What does unite these non-European countries is that they deregulated their financial markets in the 1980s; subsequently experienced a build-up of asset price inflation and personal and corporate debt; and have been forced to use tight monetary policy to puncture their asset market bubbles in a painful fashion, without inflating away the outstanding debt. These were government choices. In addition, Britain has joined the ERM. The US, Japan and Canada have all moved to a loose monetary policy over the past year. But UK interest rates have been kept high by Germany's tight monetary policy. So UK real short-term interest rates remain above 7 per cent compared with less than 1 per cent in the US. Unwillingness Little wonder that the UK recession has been so deep. Recovery will not materialise until consumers start borrowing and so reduce the savings ratio from its current high level. Their unwillingness to do so has left egg on the face of most of the UK economics profession. Economists at S G Warburg, for example, were forecasting as recently as November that the savings ratio would fall to 8.6 per cent this year. They now expect it to rise to 10.7 per cent, and have cut their 1992 growth forecast by more than half. Goldman Sachs remains more optimistic, expecting savings to fall and spending to pick up this year. Consumers, it argues, are saving more than 'is justified' by past behaviour or the level of household debt. If only someone would tell them. The truth is that not until they feel secure about the future will consumers start spending again. When this will be is anyone's guess, as is shown by yesterday's news that US non-farm employment fell last month, against an expected rise. Low real interest rates cannot, by themselves, persuade consumers that the immediate future will be better than the immediate past. Sustained recoveries Only when spending on durable consumer goods picks up decisively will sustained recoveries be assured. In the UK, the recent evidence is not encouraging. Housing sales in the last quarter of 1991 were down on the previous quarter and 1992 has not started any better. House prices fell again in January compared with the year before, while sales of new cars hit their lowest January level since 1982. Commercial investment is no more likely to drive the recovery than consumer investment. The latest Confederation of British Industry survey confirmed that investment will fall throughout this year. The news that Ford is laying off 2,100 of its UK employees, thereby clawing back the negotiated increase in its salary bill, will have done nothing to boost consumer confidence. Nor are export markets likely to be a source of economic growth this year. The US recovery is still on hold, while German interest rates now look set to remain high until the wage round is complete, depressing prospects for growth in Europe. Little wonder, against this depressing background, that Mr Major is looking for scapegoats. He does have some room for manoeuvre on fiscal policy, the one area of economic policy where a real debate continues. Labour would offer a budget for investment; the government may well choose to cut personal taxes. Yet neither has much room to play with. Mr Major's one advantage is that he still retains some residual influence over interest rates. With sterling comfortably above its floor in the ERM, he can and should cut interest rates and soon. Further bad news in Germany could easily force German rates up, and thereby close this rate cut window. Then Mr Major would surely go naked into the election campaign.</p>

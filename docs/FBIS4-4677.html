			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan Should Voluntarily Remove Trade </F> Barriers"]    [Text] The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR)  recently submitted to Congress the 1994 edition of the "National  Trade Estimates Report on Foreign Trade Barriers."    The number of items and descriptions related to Japan has  increased from the previous year and occupies a large portion of  the report. It can be said that the report clarifies the  Clinton administration's trade strategy urging Japan to open its  markets wider.    Certainly, Japanese markets are still bound by many  government regulations and the principle of competition is not  fully being carried out in Japan. The relationship between the  government and the private sector lacks transparency. Also,  complicated business practices still exist. Reforming the  economy's structure is a top priority task for Japan to open up  its markets wider.    Japan should voluntarily and actively remove trade barriers  to imports of both quality and less-expensive goods as well as  services before other countries demand that it do so.    The removal of such trade barriers will help maximize the  effect of the yen's appreciation, bring benefits to consumers,  and help develop world trade. In this sense, Japan should  listen to the voices of other countries hoping to gain access to  Japanese markets.    However, it will be a different story if the United States  unilaterally imposes sanctions, such as retaliatory tariffs, if  its demands are not met.    The USTR report provides a basis for application of the  Super  301 provision of the U.S. Trade Act (which outlines steps for  retaliation against trade partners' unfair practices) that was  reinstated by Clinton's executive order. The USTR will specify  by the end of September the countries and market fields that are  subject to the application of the Super 301 provision.    This year's report covers all topics negotiated in the  Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, including Japanese Government  procurement of telecommunications equipment. It is expected  that if no agreement is reached in the framework trade talks,  the United States will seek solutions in individual sectors by  threatening sanctions under the Super 301 Provision.    Needless to say, unilateral sanctions in line with the Super  301 provision will run counter to the agreement in the Uruguay  Round of multilateral trade talks to be signed in mid-April.    Asian and European nations have urged Japan to open its  markets wider. But they are also very critical of the U.S.  strategy of threatening sanctions in trade negotiations. We  hope Washington will reconsider its strategy.    What Japan and the United States should do now is to resume  the suspended framework trade talks. Japan has recently  announced the "outline of external economic reforms," which is  inadequate but a step forward. We hope opinions and criticism  should be exchanged at the negotiating table. We believe that  this is the way to create a new relationship of trust.    Recent remarks and actions by U.S. officials, including the  USTR annual report, are full of assertions that past Japan-U.S.  agreements have yielded almost no results. Such assertions  could be aimed at urging Japan to implement bold market-opening  measures. Even so, they will cause misunderstanding among the  peoples of both countries.    We should refrain from overreacting in each case, but we  think the recognition of facts should be done more accurately.    For example, beef imports increased 1.9 times and orange  juice imports 4.3 times between 1988 and 1992. Artificial  satellites have all been procured from the United States since  the signing of a bilateral agreement. There are more examples.  As such, Japan-U.S. economic relations never remain stagnant.</p>

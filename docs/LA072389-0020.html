			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEIL AND BRUCE  </P> <P> It is a laughable assertion that Bruce Springsteen would never have written  "Born in the U.S.A.," about a bitter and disenfranchised Vietnam veteran,  without the precedent of Neil Diamond's "America," an anthem so jingoistic it  could be inscribed on the Statue of Liberty.  </P> <P> Perhaps the myopic Mr. Paul derived his understanding of Springsteen's song  from Ronald Reagan, who had obviously had heard only the title when he let the  song be used in his '84 campaign.  </P> <P> WILLIAM BROUGH  </P> <P> Downey  </P></p>

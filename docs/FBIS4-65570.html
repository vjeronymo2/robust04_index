			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Susana Alcelay report: "Grinan: Labor Market Has Revived, </F> at Stage Prior to Recovery"]    [Excerpt] Madrid -- Labor Minister Jose Antonio Grinan  asserted yesterday that "we are witnessing a stage of revival of  the labor market, which normally precedes expansionary cycles of  the economy," although he pointed out that it will depend on the  reforms pending -- the INEM [National Employment Institute],  vocational health, and a single law on unemployment benefit. He  also announced that the government is considering imposing  penalties when one of the parties refuses to negotiate an  agreement.    The labor minister appeared yesterday after the Congress [of  Deputies] had given its approval to the labor reform in order to  explain that the government had kept its election pledge to  carry through this law, which he said is the only law possible  right now. "It is a reform," he stated, "which goes no further  because it would be impossible to apply, and if it fell short,  it would be impossible to apply."    Grinan admitted that the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers  Party] has had to yield to the demands of some groups such as  Convergence and Union and the Basque Nationalist Party in some  aspects of the labor reform, although he emphasized that "the  amendments which have been introduced have improved the original  text and served to achieve greater consensus." "The labor  reform," he stressed, "is basically what the Socialist  government wanted."    The minister showed himself very optimistic about the fall  in  unemployment recorded in April -- 24,810 people -- and stated:  "I will not say that we are in a stage of growth, but that the  economic trend has changed, and we must consolidate this period  of revival in order to proceed to recovery, which will be more  effective if we introduce structural reforms capable of creating  jobs."    He pointed out that the reforms pending are a single law  containing all the changes introduced in unemployment benefits,  a vocational health law, and the reform of the INEM.  Nevertheless, he made it very clear that the government does  not intend to approve the strike law for the present, although  it was also included in the PSOE's election program.    Grinan did not hesitate to cite the labor reform as one of  the factors which have helped revive the labor market, since "it  has especially helped the hiring of groups with difficulties."    He referred to the outcome of the first labor reform  measures  to be introduced -- the forms of hiring approved by decree law  in January -- and disclosed that 75,000 apprenticeship contracts  were registered up to 30 April, mostly with pay exceeding the  Interprofessional Minimum Wage, and 40 percent with young people  who have not completed Basic General Education.    The labor minister cited one of the essential aspects of the  labor reform -- collective bargaining -- and emphasized that the  aim is to give labor relations between the social agents a  priority role. He therefore called on employers and trade  unions for an effort to "make profitable" the negotiations and  end the year with the creation of net employment.    On this point, he announced that the government is  considering the possibility of imposing penalties when any of  the parties refuses to negotiate, contrary to the ethical  principle of the "duty to negotiate" contained in the Workers'  Statute.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Nikulin by N. Gavrileva; place and </F> date not given: "Rossiya Will Not Depart From Its Program"]    [Text] Quite a pile of material, in which people ask to one  extent or another what has happened to the Rossiya bloc, why has  it become virtually in opposition to the president, and much  else, has accumulated at the newspaper recently. We put these  questions to Sergey Nikulin, Rossiya faction chairman.    [Gavrileva] So what has happened to the Rossiya bloc since  the elections? People say that it has ceased to exist....    [Nikulin] Truly, the bloc did end its existence  simultaneously with the conclusion of the elections to the  Supreme Soviet--this is legally unexceptionable and should not  be a cause for any concern. But the bloc's traditions and  continuity have been preserved in the Rossiya faction, which has  absorbed almost all the supporters of this election bloc--more  than 40 persons; they are united by its program. Please recall  that it is based on the program of the Crimea Republican Party,  (Crimea republican movement), the party that secured election  victory for the president and deputies of the Supreme Soviet.    [Gavrileva] But, at a news conference the Respublika faction  declared that you had departed somewhat from the joint election  program and, how to put this as gently as possible, that you  observe somewhat different moral principles....    [Nikulin] As far as the program is concerned, let anyone  find  even one insignificant clause in which this has been manifested.  For example, we spoke to our electorate about the restoration of  the constitution of 6 May, it was done, it was restored. We  spoke about the protection of Crimean conscripts--it was done,  the law on the service of Crimeans in Crimea--it was adopted. We  spoke about privileges for needy families--a decree on the  cancellation of VAT on children's passes was adopted. I could  continue....    [Gavrileva] Enough for the time being, time is clearly  short....    [Nikulin] As far as moral principles are concerned.... It is  sufficient to hear how representatives of the Respublika faction  behave at plenary meetings--they have not submitted a single  constructive proposal, everything is geared to destructiveness  according to the principle of the worse, the better. I, truly,  cannot recall a serviceable proposal coming from this group.    [Gavrileva] Please explain, if possible, the faction's  position in regard to parliament's relationship with the  president's team.    [Nikulin] Let us begin with the fact that the contradictions  between the president's team and the Supreme Soviet are clearly  exaggerated--there are certain forces in Crimea and outside that  are endeavoring to split the two branches of power--this is  really in vogue, note, and not only here in Crimea.    An attempt was made to accuse the leaders of the Rossiya  faction and the Republican Party of an endeavor to push through  "their" people into government. For heaven's sake, the  Republican Party is the victorious party, and throughout the  civilized world it is the victorious parties that form the  government. It was assumed that this was how it would be with us  also. This is a normal process. We have a fine team and the most  experienced and professional specialists of all sectors of the  economy. The list by which Mr. Saburov and MESHCHANSKAYA GAZETA  attempted to put us to shame was prepared by us at the behest of  the president of the Republic of Crimea and Sergey Pavlovich  Tsekov (at that time still simply leader of the party) and at  the request of V. Minin, leader of the Office for Public  Administration. So these are not "our" people, if by this is  implied people selected according to the principle of nepotism  and family relationships, but the people of the president of the  Republic of Crimea, who secured his dazzling victory at the  presidential elections and who are recognized specialists in  their fields. We should be speaking today, rather, about the  others being appointed as a counterweight to our proposals and  according to the principles mentioned above, what is more.    Nonetheless, I have complete confidence that the government  will treat our recommendations correctly because we have already  shown our competency in the building of the statehood of the  Republic of Crimea.    But I see nothing extraordinary in the events connected with  the situation surrounding the government: The normal mutual  adaptation of two branches of power only just recognized and  supported by the people is taking place. And inappropriate  emotions should not be added to this.    [Gavrileva] Sergey Vladimirovich, what can you say about the  fact that both in our editorial mail and in telegrams to the  Supreme Soviet your faction virtually is being accused of  betrayal of the president?    [Nikulin] Moreover, we are being accused of having been  elected to the Supreme Soviet on an oath of loyalty to the  president and of not fulfilling it! But let us take these things  in order. We have supported the president in all his  undertakings, except for his being granted decree-issuing  authority: We believe that it is necessary to operate not from  the position of a state of emergency but on the basis of a  profoundly calibrated and practicable plan. It was this plan  that we wanted to hear from Vice Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov  and his ministers. It is not our fault (or misfortune) but  theirs that they were unable to present it to the Supreme  Soviet, and this is why additional time for the conclusive  formulation of their intention was determined. Nonetheless,  those whom the president has proposed have been appointed  ministers, and as quickly as possible, what is more.    And apropos the "oath of loyalty" I will say that the same  "oath" was given by the president of the Republican Party to the  Rossiya bloc--this oath being the actual program of the bloc,  which both we and the president intend to fulfill.</p>

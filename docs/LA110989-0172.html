			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TO PRESS 'SHOTGUN MARRIAGES' ON SOME S&amp;LS  </P> <P> The government will press for mergers between struggling savings and loans and  stronger competitors to build a smaller but healthier thrift industry, M. Danny  Wall, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Speaking to the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the main thrift industry  group, Wall said his agency would use the threat of penalties against thrifts  to arrange "shotgun marriages" with potential suitors.  </P> <P> "We are calling this our arranged marriage program. Where I come from, they  would put the word 'shotgun' in there," he said. He said the program would  start in a week.  </P> <P> The forced mergers would apply to S&amp;Ls that fall short of tough new capital  requirements issued by the office this week.  </P> <P> The capital rules and merger programs are the latest steps by the chief federal  regulator of the 2,900 U.S. thrifts to reform the industry after heavy losses  forced Congress to pass a $159-billion bailout law.  </P> <P> Wall said well-run institutions in the thrift industry, which is a major source  of loans for home buyers, have been penalized for imprudent and criminal  actions by some savings executives.  </P> <P> Wall, who has been heavily criticized by members of Congress, vowed he will be  a diligent enforcer of new rules requiring thrifts to put more of their own  funds at risk in the form of capital.  </P> <P> The capital rules issued by the thrift office Monday will require many thrifts  to increase their capital beginning next month as a cushion against losses and  if they cannot, to submit a plan to comply.  </P> <P> If a cash-strapped thrift receives an offer to be acquired but is too coy about  accepting, the regulators will have to consider whether the thrift's behavior  violates a rule against operating in an unsafe manner, Wall said.  </P> <P> "We will consider enforcement actions," he said.  </P> <P> Wall said as many as 300 thrifts could disappear into acquiring firms, which  might be healthy thrifts, commercial banks or industrial companies and will  include non-U.S. firms.  </P> <P> A Japanese firm is acquiring part of a Hawaii thrift for $20 million, Wall  said, without identifying them. He said Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto, the  largest trust company of Canada, is investing $110 million in Pacific First  Financial of Seattle in order to expand.  </P> <P> "Major international financial service organizations share our vision of a  positive future for the thrift industry," Wall said.  </P> <P> In another area, the agency will soon issue rules that will specify when an  undercapitalized thrift must limit or omit dividends to help build up capital,  Wall said.  </P> <P> He said the number of thrifts that are insolvent because they have liabilities  exceeding assets will continue to grow.  </P></p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Bid for Midland: London the headquarters but much independence at a local level THE DESIGN for the enlarged HSBC Holdings after the takeover of Midland Bank is disarmingly simple and represents an application to international banking of the management idea: 'think global, act local.' The holding company will pool all of the transnational aspects of the two main bank's activities - international customers, investment banking, treasury and technology - while the key operating units will remain relatively independent to pursue growth within their borders. Regulation and logic require that the 'brain' of the new bank be in one place, London. London will be the headquarters of the holding company and the residence of the senior executives who will hold the main responsibilities. The board of HSBC will be internationalised to include not only the top executives from the main operating arms - Hongkong Bank and Midland Bank - but, in due course, non-executives directors from the US, Europe and Asia. The boards of the main operating banks will further be localised. But while the rationale for the takeover is growth through increased business, Mr William Purves, HSBC Holdings' chairman, believes there will be considerable scope for rationalisation and the effect of that increased efficiency on the combined banks bottom line. He also forecasts synergy in a number of activities: Trade finance. Hongkong Bank started in trade finance in 1865 and is regarded as one of the best in the field. Mr Purves believes that his bank has much which it can teach Midland about trade finance and that should have benefits for Midland in European trade and trade between Europe and the rest of the world. Technology. Last year the combined banks spent about Pounds 625m on information technology and Hongkong Bank believes economies can be achieved not only in the acquisition of new technology but in the processing of information, systems development and maintenance. The issues before the enlarged bank are the creation of a five year plan to improve Midland's technological capability and, in Mr Purves's words 'the need to get the two banks' computers talking to each other better than they are.' The treasury area offers big scope for rationalisation and the banks plan to merge their two treasury operations. These will also be enlarged to take in dealings in government securities as well the more usual foreign exchange, money market, and derivative products. The problems Hongkong Bank has had in negotiating swaps with other financial institutions that have a post 1997 maturity will disappear with the merger - leading, theoretically, at least, to a lower cost of finance. Investment banking is another area ripe for rationalisation. While the separate identities of Samuel Montagu, James Capel, Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt, Euromobiliare and Wardley will be retained, the plan is to run investment banking as a global business where overlapping activities are rationalised.</p>

The contracts' total value is over $6000 million.    Kiselev told Interfax today that the deals envisioned  launching the 21st low-orbit satellite within the framework of  the global telecommunications system "Iridium" designed by the  American "Motorola," one of the satellites of the third series  of the international consortium INMARSAT, another one of the  American company Loral, etc.    Kiselev pointed out that the cooperation with Lockheed and  signing the deals was possible only thanks to the Russian  government's decision to join the system of international  control of non-proliferation of missile technologies. At the  moment, Russia does not have deals running counter to this  treaty.    According to Kiselev, the year of cooperation with American  partners who took up marketing the most powerful Russian booster  ever used and licensing satellites manufactured by western  companies enabled the Russian Space and Missiles Center to pack  up the program of commercial launches up to 2000 and look into  the future with optimism.</p>

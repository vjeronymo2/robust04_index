			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Quotation marks as received] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh 25 Jun (AKP) -- "The Cambodian People's  Party (CPP) categorically opposes all attempts by the Khmer  Rouge [KR] to abolish the constitution of the Kingdom of  Cambodia in their demand for the dismantling of the National  Assembly and the royal government. The Khmer Rouge has demanded  the establishment of a new government that also comprises their  representatives," says a statement made public on Wednesday by  this party.    "The CPP, the statement continues, considers the  constitution  of the Kingdom of Cambodia a precious acquisition of the entire  Cambodian nation and also the international community, who has  provided considerable and sincere assistance.    "This precious acquisition has also been obtained through  His  Majesty Norodom Sihanouk, very revered leader," stresses the  statement.    "If we make concessions to those responsible for the  genocide  and those who torpedoed the Paris agreement, boycotted and  sabotaged the elections, and who are now destroying the country,  this would be serious contempt of the Cambodian people and a big  blow to the results of the UN operations in Cambodia."    The CPP also (?says) that it will stick to its position now  and in the future. Future generations of Cambodians also have  the duty to value this achievement. The CPP demands that the  settlement of all Cambodia's current problems be in accordance  with the country's constitution.    The CPP eagerly supports the idea advanced by the United  States, the other governments, and the public the world over.  This concerns the establishment of an office to carry out  research on the crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge against the  Cambodian people and foreign nationals for the preparation of  files so that court proceedings could be instituted.</p>

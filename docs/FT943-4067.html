			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Asprey's shares dip as big spenders stay away Shares in Asprey fell by more than a third yesterday after the exclusive jewellery retailer gave a warning that the loss of a few big-spending customers would severely depress its profits. The shares closed 110p down at 200p down after dropping as low as 178p during the day. Mr Naim Attallah, chief executive, said sales in the core Asprey businesses had fallen dramatically, with the biggest decline in high-value sales to 'certain customers in the export market'. 'Many heads of states are not spending the kind of money they used to,' he said. 'We are still dependent on a few big accounts, and the volume of high-value sales has been very low so far this year,' he said. There were no signs of an upturn, he added, and the fall in sales would significantly reduce profitability in the first half of the group's financial year. Asprey's Bond Street shop stocks items including a set of jewellery made from diamonds and Burma rubies retailing for Pounds 2m and a pair of life-sized panthers made from oxidised silver offered at Pounds 450,000. The prices of commissioned items, which accounted for 10 per cent of turnover last year, can be much higher. Evidence during the recession suggested that even the super-rich had been discouraged from buying luxury goods while prices in that sector of the market were held steady by lack of demand. Although Asprey has sought to expand its customer base through an aggressive acquisition strategy, the core Asprey business contributed 75 per cent of profits and 55 per cent of sales in the year to March 31. The company also owns Mappin &amp; Webb, Garrard and Watches of Switzerland. Mr Attallah also identified other areas of concern in the group. Garrard, the crown jewellers, had suffered a fall in export sales that was 'likely to eliminate its contribution to group profits in the first half'. The contribution from Watches of Switzerland was also likely to be depressed, as overhead spending had exceeded sales growth. The division has opened 10 new outlets since its acquisition by Asprey in 1992. In an effort to attract younger customers, it launched a subsidiary, Zeus, last year, where watches cost hundreds rather than thousands of pounds. In the year to March, Asprey reported an 18 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 25.4m and sales up 30 per cent from Pounds 144.7m to Pounds 187.6m.

A  party spokesman said: An Army vehicle carrying 40 antiaircraft  missiles from the north and heading south was seized by a  southern brigade. He did not say when the missiles were seized,  but said this was a new proof of the escalation of the political  and the military tension in the country.    The announcement came hours after Planning Minister  'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani blamed Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid's party for delaying the signing of an accord to end the  political crisis paralyzing the country. Al-Iryani said: There  are no arrangements for the signing of the accord neither in  Amman nor inside Yemen as new conditions have been set by the  Yemen Socialist Party. He said: The YSP wanted constitutional  legal and security conditions not included in the accord. He  did not give details, but political sources said the YSP was  apparently seeking guarantees for its officials from security  services run by the president's supporters.</p>

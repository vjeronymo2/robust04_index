			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (2): Third world reaches for the big-time - Investment: Institutions and managers Only a few years ago investors regarded third world securities as being of interest only to specialists and speculators. The International Finance Corporation, the Washington-based development institution, ploughed a lonely furrow in formulating stock market indices and generally promoting the potential of the emerging equity markets. Now emerging markets have emerged into the big-time. 'The early investors were only the sophisticated ones,' says Mr Narayan Ramachandran, of the Connecticut-based pension consultants Rogers, Casey &amp; Associates. 'Today this is widely accepted as a legitimate asset class.' He reckons that emerging markets now account for about 10 per cent of the international allocation of equities by US pension funds. Other investors may be more adventurous: the US Securities Industry Association estimates that in the 1990s US investors of all kinds have directed nearly 15 per cent of equity outflows into emerging markets, against 4 per cent of a much smaller total in the 1980s. In London, Mr Michael Howell, global strategist with Baring Securities, reckons that even this is an underestimate, because a significant part of the US outflows pass through London before being invested in emerging markets and are not clearly reported to the American authorities. Baring estimates that from a tiny base in the 1980s - only Dollars 3.2bn from all international sources went into Latin American and Pacific Rim equities (excluding Japan) in 1988 - the total soared to almost Dollars 20bn in 1992 and to Dollars 38bn last year. This year the figure is likely to rise further, to some Dollars 45bn. At the end of 1993, says Mr Howell, international holders owned emerging market equities worth Dollars 160bn. US investors accounted for two-thirds of this total. A variety of factors lies behind the surge in interest. The growth of market-oriented economic policies has opened up many countries to serious foreign investment, and in Latin America the ending of the debt crisis has been crucial to the restoration of international confidence. For institutional investors, however, the slowdown in western economies and the accompanying sharp fall in long-term interest rates, especially on dollar bonds, may have been vital triggers. US pension funds cannot meet their actuarial rate of return targets by investing in top grade domestic assets, and so are looking further afield. 'The principal rationale for investment in emerging markets is high returns,' says Mr Ramachandran. 'The overall rate of return expectation for a pension plan is 10 per cent, but for emerging markets the projection is 15-20 per cent.' Mr Howell takes this a stage further by arguing that mature market equities are likely to provide much less attractive returns in the future because of slower economic growth in the developed world. Accordingly a third of mature market equity portfolios should be shifted into emerging markets. For a typical US defined benefit pension plan this would imply that a fifth of its overall portfolio should be in emerging market equities. Mr Nigel Morecroft, of Foreign &amp; Colonial Pensions Management, argues that the exposure of UK pension funds to what are today defined as emerging markets will climb from 2 to 20 per cent over the next two decades. It is certainly true that many investment institutions are seeking to raise their exposures sharply. Several pioneering emerging markets fund managers have therefore been in a strong position to cash in on the mushrooming demand for their expertise in this area. The biggest is probably the Capital Group, the Los Angeles- based firm of global money managers that linked up with the IRC in 1986 to launch the Emerging Markets Growth Fund, a US closed-end fund now worth some Dollars 3bn. A London consultancy firm, Fund Research, conducts highly detailed research on emerging markets fund managers, both on a global and regional basis. It says that the top-ranking managers are to be found in the US, the UK and Hong Kong. Among the top firms, besides Capital Group, is Emerging Markets Management, of Virginia. This was founded in 1987 by Mr Antoine van Agtmael, himself a former executive at the IRC. EMM is described as a 'leading edge' manager which has recently been exploring the potential of the more esoteric markets in Africa and eastern Europe. Another top manager is Templeton, like Capital Group a bottom-up stock-picking global investor which has been drawn into emerging markets by the values to be found there. Mr Mark Mobius runs Templeton's emerging markets funds out of Hong Kong. Back in the US, Morgan Stanley Asset Management has been very prominent in the recent institutional charge into emerging markets, under the chairmanship of Mr Barton Biggs. As for the UK, Schroder Investment Management is a highly- rated participant, along with GT Management and Genesis Investment Management. The first two have the advantages of being substantial international organisations: GT, for instance, runs all its emerging markets funds out of Hong Kong, while Schroder operates primarily in London, although with the benefit of an international network. Genesis, however, is a young (less than five years) specialist boutique which has quickly built up a presence of approaching Dollars 1bn in emerging markets. Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial is probably about the same size in emerging markets: it built up its presence under the name Latin American Securities, but it now trades as F &amp; C Emerging Markets. This is not, of course, an exclusive list. Giants such as Merrill Lynch and Fidelity run a lot of emerging markets money. In London there are many other contenders for a slice of this booming sector, including Baring Asset Management, Mercury Asset Management, Kleinwort Benson and Robert Fleming (the latter especially through Jardine Fleming in Hong Kong). Nowadays there are even emerging markets index-tracking funds, for instance the IFC Investable Emerging Markets Index Fund which was launched last October. It is run by State Street Asset Management out of Boston. According to Mr Peter Jeffries of Fund Research the best emerging markets managers tend to be quite senior people. 'Because general research in this area is so scant you need to have very experienced people,' he says. 'Stock selection is becoming terribly important,' he says. 'There is a huge performance disparity among managers.' A question for the future, perhaps, is whether the emerging markets specialists will continue to remain a distinct category among global managers. In a rapidly maturing scene, the picture of the sturdy pioneer with a survival pack who is the first foreign investor to hit town is becoming rather irrelevant. Much of the emerging markets investment is now conducted through deals in the principal financial centres such as New York and London. For instance, turnover in the American Depositary Receipts of Mexican companies is running at Dollars 30bn a year. This shows the scale of the boom. But how robust will the emerging stock markets prove to be in a more demanding investment climate? The recent successes have been achieved in the context of a continuous rise in share prices on Wall Street for more than three years, and a pump-priming monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve, which led to US capital outflows of well over Dollars 100bn last year into all global securities markets. When the Fed tightens will there be a dangerous emerging markets panic as foreigners retreat? Probably there will not be any serious exodus on the part of the US pension funds. Mr Ramachandran of Rogers, Casey accepts that there is some concern among institutional investors over the possibility of a short-term correction. However, he adds: 'Our investors all realise they went into these markets for the long term.' Retail investors who have bought emerging markets mutual funds or (in the UK) unit trusts could be another matter, however. They have often been chasing short-term profits: for instance, several unit trusts investing in south-east Asia achieved 100 per cent-plus returns last year, as did one or two global emerging markets funds. In December 1993, net sales of unit trusts in the Far East excluding Japan sector reached Pounds 114m, and there were also big sales of international growth funds which include the global emerging markets specialists. Emerging markets funds may have therefore accounted for something like a fifth of all unit trust sales for that month. But these open-ended funds can rapidly go into net redemption when conditions worsen and investors try to take their profits. Fund managers are forced to sell at any price to meet the demands of their investors for immediate cash. 'When the Fed finally hikes US interest rates and slows savings flows to US mutual funds, some of these emerging markets could experience larger corrections than New York,' warns Mr David Hale, international economist at Kemper in Chicago. In the space of a very few years many third world securities markets have emerged from volatile obscurity into the mainstream of global investment. But the emerging markets may not yet have left their often turbulent past completely behind them.</p>

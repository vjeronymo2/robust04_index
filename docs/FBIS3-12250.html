			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Most of Yasir 'Arafat's aides believe the peace  process must be pursued, because halting the process would be  tantamount to giving a prize to the insane murderer who acted in  Hebron. This was said this evening by a senior source in the  PLO leadership to our correspondent Moti Amir. He also said  that tonight or tomorrow morning it will become clear whether  the peace process will continue in its present format in  Washington. The source emphasized Yasir 'Arafat is facing  severe pressures by various PLO factions which are opposed to  the continuation of the peace process, and is continuing his  consultations in Tunis.</p>

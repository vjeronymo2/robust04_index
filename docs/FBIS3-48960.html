			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Warsaw, 30 Dec -- On 30 December 1993 Internal  Affairs Minister Andrzej Milczanowski repealed the clause  "confidential" from the Ministry of Internal Affairs' [MSW] 1983  instruction on principles and ways of handling classified  information and professional confidentiality.    The instruction is one of the executory regulations  accompanying the 1982 Law on the Protection of State Secrets.  MSW press spokesman Andrzej Szczypinski announced that the text  of this regulation would be made available to the press next  week. [passage omitted]    Szczypinski did not deny that today's decision by the  interior minister was connected with a discussion on the  government's draft Law on the Protection of State Secrets and  Professional Confidentiality presented in the Sejm on 2 December  1993. Among other things, the draft bans every person,  including journalists, who has information classified by the  government as secret from revealing it. Jerzy Zimowski, deputy  minister of internal affairs, said on 22 December that the  ministry "will not favor solutions too harsh for journalists"  and suggested that the role of the press in cases of classified  information should be discussed.</p>

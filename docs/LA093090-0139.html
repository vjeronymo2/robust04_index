			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALABAMA GETS FIRST VICTORY, 59-28  </P> <P> Alabama ended its longest losing streak in more than three decades Saturday,  and Coach Gene Stallings got his first victory with a 59-28 Southeastern  Conference win over Vanderbilt.  </P> <P> Robert Jones had two one-yard touchdown runs for Alabama, and Gary  Hollingsworth threw a 25-yard scoring pass to Kevin Turner.  </P> <P> Tarrant Lynch ran 77 yards for a late touchdown.  </P> <P> The Crimson Tide, which had dropped five games dating back to last season,  improved to 1-3, 1-2 in the SEC. Vanderbilt (1-2, 1-1) handed Alabama its first  31 points on mistakes, the same kind of errors that had given Alabama its  longest string of losses since 1956, when the Tide ended a 15-game skid.  </P> <P> Vanderbilt's Mike Healy had touchdown passes of eight, four, and 28 yards to  Derrick Gragg, but it was not enough to turn the Tide, which led 52-7 at the  half.  </P></p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Survey of Derivatives (9): Europe has something special to offer - Managed futures, the superstitious fear of futures and options is receding THE MANAGED futures business, which recently started to take off in the US, is also beginning to take root in Europe. It is based on the controversial idea that derivtives constitute a separate asset class, distinct from equities, bonds and commodities, and so represent a crucial part of a balanced portfolio. Worldwide - but principally in the US - there is an estimated Dollars 21bn under management in managed futures programmes: money which represents both institutional investments, such as pension funds and insurance funds, and also savings from retail investors, both on and offshore. The industry in Europe is estimated to be responsible for a mere Dollars 2bn of this money, but that figure may be set to grow. Mr Micky St Aldwyn, senior manager of institutional business development for E D &amp; F Man, the oldest and biggest managed futures firm in Europe, says 1993 will be 'the year when the European managed futures industry sees its biggest growth so far'. Globally, managed futures are enjoying something of a boom, mostly on the back of claims that they offer diversification from the more traditional investment fields of equities, bonds or cash, all of which have been vulnerable to the vicissitudes of their markets in the past few years. Suddenly, the superstitious dread with which many traditional investment managers viewed investments in futures and options has started to lift. Managed futures investments have shown themselves to be top performers during periods that have been difficult for other types of investment. However, there have also been periods when they have substantially underperformed other sectors of the market. Europe has shown itself to have something special to offer. The number of derivatives exchanges in Europe has increased rapidly, resulting in more products in which to invest. Beyond that, a consensus has developed across the industry that the more established and familiar US derivative products are not correlated with those coming out of Europe. The argument is that, by including European futures investment in a US portfolio, you can add further diversification to an existing portfolio, and have a better chance of achieving the above-average performance expected of the industry. Evidence of this could be taken from the consistently strong performance achievements of Hasenbichler, a firm of Austrian commodity-trading advisers now based in Malta, which has appeared top of the Managed Account Report performance tables for much of the past year. The most important factor in this apparent wave of interest in Europe is that it is coming at an institutional level. One of the first examples was seen last year, when part of the money under management in the State of Virginia's pension scheme was put into managed futures - and not just managed futures run out of the US. A UK-based futures manager, Sabre Fund Management, got some of that money to manage. The blue-chip fund manager Henderson Administration bought 25 per cent of Sabre last March as its first step into the managed futures industry. Mark Fox-Andrews, of Sabre, says: 'There is a lot happening at the moment, because the message is getting across to the actuaries, trustees and clients that derivatives and managed-futures programmes are available, cheap and efficient. I hope that firms like us are going to be competing more with other forms of investment activity.' At the retail level, the regulatory restrictions on managed futures funds in Europe are still draconian. Only four European countries have regulations for such funds in place: the UK, France, Luxembourg and Ireland. Only France and the UK have domestic, retail managed futures funds. France has 18 funds, launched by the big French banks, which have headed into the industry with enormous enthusiasm; while the UK has two types of fund, the futures and options fund (Fof) and the geared futures and options fund (Gfof). One of the first in the market in the UK, and still one of the principal players, is John Govett, which has 12 Fofs and two cash funds that run alongside. The firm has raised Pounds 133m for its Fofs, mostly through the broker bond route. Adam Parkin, director of John Govett and responsible for derivative investment, is aware that they have led where others now plan to follow. 'There is no doubt that John Govett opened a door and raised the consciousness of retail funds in the UK,' he says. The next to step through that door is Fidelity, which has initially launched four Fofs, the Stabiliser Growth Range of Controlled Risk funds. In their turn, these funds are now part of Fidelity's Asset Manager money management service, designed to provide a better long-term return than a building society on the investor's savings. To find futures and options funds for sale in the UK to the retail public is staggering. To find them on sale as a better option than a building society deposit is quite extraordinary. 'We have a real commitment to this market,' says Trevor Robinson, head of derivatives, who reports that Fidelity plans further futures and options products, possibly even a Gfof, which has as yet not been seen in the UK. Less successful, but equally enthusiastic, was the launch of the US Masters Guaranteed Futures Fund this year, by Johnson Fry Securities, better known for its distribution of tax-shelter products in the UK. The US Masters fund raised Pounds 4m, and Johnson Fry is coming back to the market with another managed futures product in the spring. Citibank Private Banking Group has raised the most money for a managed futures fund in Europe, with its TradeWinds private offering in 1992, which raised Dollars 135m. TradeWinds had a state-of-the-art guarantee, based on a letter of credit, which limited the downside risk without tying up large amounts of the investment capital. Market research showed that 95 per cent of TradeWinds' investors went into the product because of this letter of credit. Citibank now plans a new fund, aimed at the retail market in Germany and institutions in Switzerland, Holland and other European countries. It is believed that the product will be denominated in Deutsche Marks and equally revolutionary in structure. The clearest sign that the Europeans are competing with the Americans is the recent news that a UK information and research house specialising in the managed futures industry, TASS Management, has been selected by the US industry trade associations, the Managed Futures Association and the Futures Industry Institute, to develop a definitive index for the managed futures industry. Nicola Meaden, managing director of TASS, says: 'Much of the traditional fund management community now recognises the value of incorporating managed futures into well diversified portfolios.'

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: CentreGold valued at Pounds 50m on 125p pricing SHARES IN CentreGold, which is coming to market through a placing and intermediaries offer later this month, were priced at 125p yesterday valuing the publisher and distributor of video games and computer entertainment software at Pounds 50.3m. The Birmingham-based group was founded 10 years ago by Mr Geoff Brown, a former teacher who is now its chief executive. CentreGold has grown rapidly, fuelled by booming sales of home entertainment software for Sega and Nintendo video games machines and personal computers. Of the 20.6m ordinary 1p shares on offer, 12m are placed firm and another 8.59m are being placed subject to a clawback by intermediaries. Ten per cent of the shares placed subject to clawback are being made available to directors and employees. The shares on offer, representing 51.2 per cent of the enlarged issued capital, comprise 11m existing shares and 9.6m new shares. Mr Brown is selling 3.95m shares but will retain a 35 per cent stake in the group following the flotation. The new shares will raise an estimated Pounds 11.2m net for the company of which Pounds 600,000 will be used to redeem loan stock. The balance will provide additional working capital to support ongoing development and enable the group to take advantage of new opportunities. For the year to July 31 CentreGold achieved a 60 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.72m (Pounds 1.7m) on turnover ahead 23 per cent to Pounds 68m (Pounds 55.1m). Earnings per share were 5.53p and the notional dividend was 2p. The historic p/e multiple at the offer price is 22.2 and the notional gross dividend is 2 per cent. Dealings in the shares begin on October 28.</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Race body calls for tougher rules THE COMMISSION for Racial Equality called on the government yesterday to compel all employers to carry out ethnic monitoring as a part of a package of measures to tighten up race laws. The commission's second review of the 1976 Race Relations Act also calls for a framework of legislation with equality of opportunity as its objective and a duty on employers to adopt goals and timetables where appropriate. Ethnic monitoring is the only way in which discrimination can be systematically detected, the commission says. The home secretary should also be given powers to introduce ethnic monitoring of recipients of public-sector services such as housing and education. Sir Michael Day, commission chairman, said the 1976 act had made a substantial contribution to good race relations, but there was continuing evidence of widespread discrimination. He warned the government to give 'a better response' to the second review than it did to the first, published seven years ago. Among measures the commission is seeking are: A special discrimination division within the industrial tribunal system with power to award victims up to Pounds 30,000 in compensation. Legal aid for discrimination cases in tribunals. The tightening and extension of the definition of indirect discrimination. Laws against racial discrimination in Northern Ireland. The introduction of a specific law against incitement to religious hatred. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said: 'The commission . . . is right to draw attention to the enormous problems still faced by many in the ethnic community.' Second Review of the Race Relations Act 1976. CRE. Pounds 5.</p>

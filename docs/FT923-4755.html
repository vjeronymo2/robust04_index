			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: Leading Japanese bank to restructure KYOWA Saitama Bank, a leading Japanese commercial bank, yesterday unveiled a restructuring plan including cuts in executive salaries and a cut in capital spending. Its move follows similar pledges made by Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, the largest commercial bank, earlier this week. Last week, in its economic support package, the Japanese government called for the rationalisation of operations at Japanese banks. The banks are working on a plan to set up a corporation which would buy land being used as collateral for bad loans and the government has hinted there might be government help. The banks' announcements comes as the Japanese business community has started to express dissatisfaction at the 'special treatment' being given to the banking industry. Although other leading commercial banks are expected to follow DKB and Kyowa Saitama, it will probably be insufficient to win public approval for the government support the sector is being given. Kyowa Saitama's programme includes a 5 per cent cut in executive compensation and a Y45bn (Dollars 366.3m) reduction in capital spending over the next four years. Entertainment and travelling costs will be cut, and the number of directors, currently 50, will be cut. The bank will also review its branch network.</p>

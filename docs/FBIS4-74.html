			<p>BFN     [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] says it will  make available to the Goldstone Commission all the facts and  evidence at its disposal on the fatal shooting at Shell House on  Monday. Eight people were shot dead in front of the ANC  headquarters. The ANC said it had nothing to apologize for or  to hide about the role of its security staff members in the  exchange of fire. It said they had had to mount a legitimate  defense at the organization's offices and staff against an  outside attack.</p>

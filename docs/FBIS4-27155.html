			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 28 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu, calling North Korea an heir of sinic civilization,  advised it Saturday to take after China and Vietnam and pursue  economic restructuring.    "As Vietnam is learning from China, North Korea can and  should learn from Vietnam," Han said in a luncheon address to an  international workshop that opened here Friday.    "It should because that is the only way out of its present  predicament," Han told participants in the workshop titled "the  durability and direction of the four remaining socialist  countries: China, Vietnam, Cuba and North Korea."    The sinic civilization, he said, is defined by Confucianism,  Taoism, Buddhism and Chinese ideograms. This "cultural edge,"  as he called it, is what made Japan the world's second biggest  economy and the Asian dragons the envy of developing countries,  he said.    "What prevents Pyongyang from making the same choice as  China  and Vietnam? Perhaps its unique internal structure, such as its  personality cult, and its presumed fear of the South may be the  major causes," the foreign minister commented.    "On the other side of the ledger, however, Pyongyang should  know that it possesses a very powerful tool for its survival,  namely, its common sinic cultural heritage."    Whether North Korea chooses to learn from China and Vietnam  will ultimately show in its attitude toward South Korea. But  for now, Pyongyang chooses to depend on the United States.    "This relationship... can evolve either toward an economic  embargo or gradual improvement," he said. "It can go either way,  depending on Pyongyang's fateful choice regarding its nuclear  program."</p>

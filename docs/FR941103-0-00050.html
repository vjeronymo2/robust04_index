			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Advanced Pricing Concepts/Implementation Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Alternative Pricing Concepts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Numerous commenters proposed alternative pricing methods,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other than those pricing methods normally permitted by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission. The methodologies advanced by these commenters varied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from conceptual ideas to detailed formulas. Certain concepts and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods were advocated by more than one and in some cases several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters, including:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Combinations of, or hybrids between, the ``or'' and the ``and''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policies, many of which advocated recovery of all incremental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> some  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> contribution (but not necessarily 100%) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average embedded system costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Variations of recovering strictly incremental or marginal cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , rates based on long-run incremental cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing for long-term firm transmission service and short-run  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marginal costs for other transactions. Another commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed short-run marginal costs for transactions not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring upgrades.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Numerous proposals for a single transmission owner and for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regional pricing, planning and operating approaches; for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example: (1) The forced divestiture of all utilities'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmission assets and formation of a single transmission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owning national grid company or ``gridco''; (2) joint ownership,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation and pricing of all transmission within an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established region with all transmission users obtaining load  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ratio shares of the regional grid and paying on an average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> embedded load ratio basis; (3) a proposal simply to price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmission in a region as if there were a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmission owner; and (4) many suggestions for the Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to further examine the companies formed in Norway, Sweden, New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Zealand, Victoria (Australia), India, Argentina, England and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Establishing a secondary market in transmission rights_transmission purchasers having the capacity to contractually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broker, resell, trade, partially assign, or assign firm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase entitlements as they choose. Capacity trading will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide for the repackaging of capacity rights to fit market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs, thereby creating a market mechanism to ``price'' and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``clear'' transmission services as a commodity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Numerous proposals advocating that the Commission require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unbundling of rates for transmission and sales services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unbundling would require transmission owners to include a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate (transparent) transmission charge in any use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utility's transmission system for the delivery of power in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wholesale market, including that utility's own wholesale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sales. Transmission terms and conditions should be the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for all wholesale transactions, regardless of whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seller is the owner of the transmission facilities used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Distance/Flow-Based Rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives to postage stamp rates would make rates sensitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the transmission distance involved in providing the service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatives suggested include various ``MW-mile'' approaches and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other methods based on load flows (such load flow methods can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also treat issues involving multiple parallel paths and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmission losses associated with particular transmission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transactions). Commenters' support is split between distance-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing and postage stamp rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory/Government commenters express a clear preference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for distance-sensitive rates (over postage stamp rates). Most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory/Government entities, some IOUs, some NUGs/IPPs, and some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Others argue that distance-based rates would compensate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmitter for increased transmission costs as more of its system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is used. This encourages more efficient use of the transmission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. Where more miles of the transmission system are utilized,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distance-sensitive rates reflect the proper cost causation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters believe that simplified distance-sensitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing methods, such as some MW-mile methods, used in conjunction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with approaches such as zonal pricing that reflects system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constraints, would be appropriate. Numerous commenters advocating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distance-based rates recommend zonal pricing as a compromise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the administrative simplicity of postage stamp rates and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more appropriate price signals of certain distance-based rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GROSSMONT HAS RECORDS, WANTS 2-A TITLE  </P> <P> Grossmont High is preparing more than two pages of statistics from its 1990  season for the San Diego Section record book.  </P> <P> The Foothillers have set single-season records for runs scored (309), hits  (318) and victories (28) and are close to setting season marks for on-base  percentage, batting average, RBIs and stolen bases. Grossmont catcher Todd  Cady, only a junior, has shattered the single-season RBI record with 61 -- the  old mark was 47 by Jeff Meyers of Carlsbad -- and barring injury is sure to set  career records in RBIs, homers and hits.  </P> <P> But Coach Jeff Meredith and his team would undoubtedly give all of this up for  a place on page 2, where the 2-A team champions are listed.  </P> <P> Last year Grossmont earned a spot there but under the heading "runner-up" --  the Foothillers lost to Carlsbad in the section final, 7-4.  </P> <P> "Last year, when we got there, nobody thought we'd be there," Meredith said.  "We were up-tight and lost."  </P> <P> This season, Grossmont has lost but two games and has been ranked at or near  the top of every poll since mid-eason. So it would seem the Foothillers would  have a tendency to be up-tight again. Meredith says no.  </P> <P> "I don't think the pressure is on us," he said. "We already handled the  pressure in coming from behind our last two games (against Escondido and San  Pasqual). We've got an experienced team. Most of these guys have now been  through two years of this."  </P> <P> Grossmont's opponent at 3:30 p.m. today at the University of San Diego --  third-seeded San Diego -- also knows pressure. Its past six games, including  three in the playoffs, have been must-win. The Cavers had to win their last  three regular season games to take the City Central League title. They have won  nine of their past 11.  </P> <P> San Diego came back from an 8-0 deficit to defeat Madison, 9-8. It also  rebounded from a 4-1 fifth-inning deficit to beat Coronado, 5-4, in the  quarterfinals.  </P> <P> The key to Grossmont's season has been its bats (.367 average) and an  underrated pitching staff (2.96 ERA). San Diego (20-7) has won on experience --  seven senior starters -- and togetherness.  </P> <P> Josh Stepner, San Diego's top hitter and pitcher -- .386 average, seven homers,  7-1 record -- said this year's team has been a happy family compared to last  year's.  </P> <P> "Last year, we had guys sitting on the bench talking about other things -- not  even thinking about baseball," Stepner said. "This year, there are no selfish  players on the team."  </P> <P> Coach Tom Lopez said improvement personally is one reason for San Diego's  turnaround.  </P> <P> "I wasn't a very good coach last year," he said. "I had some personal problems,  and I let it affect my coaching. I made up my mind to change things this year,  and I've had my best coaching year."  </P> <P> Stepner is expected to get the pitching start today against Grossmont's Dan  Lennon (10-1, two saves, 3.25 ERA).  </P> <P> The last time Stepner faced Grossmont, he was knocked around for five runs, but  he came back to beat the Foothillers with his bat -- hitting a three-run homer  in the bottom of the seventh that gave San Diego a 6-5 victory in the second  game of the Lions Tournament. It was Grossmont's last loss.  </P> <P> Grossmont will be without first baseman Jim Earley (.436, 5 homers, 24 RBIs),  who broke his foot before the playoffs began, and Lenny Van Every (.414, 14  stolen bases), who was ruled academically ineligible three weeks ago. But  outfielder Jason Eckridge (.328), who was suspended for a game after running  into Escondido's catcher, will be back.  </P></p>

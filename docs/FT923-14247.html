			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Kohl tries to dispel domestic disquiet FOR Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the Munich summit extravaganza is likely to prove a mixed blessing. He managed to get through the event unscathed by any substantial criticism of Germany's budget deficit and high interest rates. By producing his draft budget for next year just a week beforehand, showing a strict 2.5 per cent nominal spending growth, he defused any harsh words there might have been. On the home front, however, the sight of huge security arrangements, cavalcades and celebrations for his fellow-heads of state, and the bill  - at an estimated DM35m (Pounds 12m) - have irritated the electorate. 'It's a disgrace,' was the most printable comment from a Munich taxi driver. The perception of conspicuous consumption was compounded by graphic television pictures of Bavarian police manhandling demonstrators who dared to boo and whistle at the visitors. Add to this the feeling that on the environmental front, including action to make safe the worst nuclear reactors in eastern Europe, Mr Kohl secured less than he should or could have done, and it is no wonder he was on the defensive at his closing press conference. When asked why there was no successful conclusion on Gatt, Mr Kohl insisted negotiating positions had converged in recent months. He stopped short of blaming his friend President Francois Mitterrand for the final stumbling block, as some of his colleagues had done, but he was confident there would be a deal by the year's end. When questioned on the half-baked nuclear deal, he admitted it was only a first step, but Germany could not do it alone. An attack on police tactics won the longest reply of all. The whole point of the summit was to 'show Germany in a most commendable light, and at the same time to fulfil the demands made of us internationally,' Mr Kohl said. 'When flags are flown, and leaders of other countries visit us, this must happen in an atmosphere of dignity. 'People who come along to shout unpleasant things at guests should not expect any sympathy. It is deliberately doing down our country.' It was an answer that might appeal to the conservative lobby. But it will not dispel the impression of an extravagant event, with too little substance to appeal to voters.</p>

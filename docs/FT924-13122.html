			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / French threat to farm reform FRANCE has no intention of complying with agreed reforms to the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP), senior European Commission officials said in Brussels yesterday. Since France is Europe's main farming superpower, and its leading farm exporter, this may put in jeopardy principal aims of the reform, including substantial cuts to the farm subsidy regime that is hobbling the EC budget. It would also explain France's increasingly fierce opposition to a compromise settlement on the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation, raising fresh doubts about whether a deal can be reached. Optimism among Community negotiators that they are able to conclude a deal with the US is underpinned by an assumption that the CAP reforms agreed in May will deliver the farm subsidy cuts demanded by the US and other farm exporters. Hopes have risen this week that a breakthrough is imminent in the long-stalled Uruguay Round negotiations, following US-EC talks in Brussels early this week, which reached tentative agreement on two of three unresolved disputes over subsidised farm trade. Negotiators failed to settle the last outstanding issue, on the EC's oilseed subsidy regime, because the US could not be convinced that proposed CAP reforms would deliver the cuts that EC officials say would follow. During talks aimed at persuading intransigent French officials that a Gatt deal can be agreed without adding to reforms already worked out under the CAP reform, senior European Commission officials have told the French that even if the EC accepts the full 24 per cent cut in subsidised cereals exports the US wants, the Community will still be able to export 23.5m tonnes in six years' time. This would be more than the 19m tonnes of exports projected under the reform of the CAP. But French officials told them they do not believe the CAP reform will work or be adhered to. 'It is clear now that France never really intended to comply with CAP reform,' one senior Commission official declared yesterday. If Washington now concludes that France, the US's main competitor, thinks the CAP reform which underpins the Gatt negotiations is not to be taken seriously, their last-ditch efforts to obtain a deal may evaporate. The danger of a trade war between the US and the EC would then be grave, with the entire international trading system likely to be affected. The French position ignores inconvenient facts, EC officials say: it is the US, which originally wanted 90 per cent cuts on export subsidies and 75 per cent cuts on internal support, that has moved towards the EC negotiating position, which most Community officials see as strengthened by President Bush's electoral plight. Quite apart from France's commitments under CAP reform, President Mitterrand, UK prime minister John Major and Mr Delors all agreed at July's Munich summit of the Group of Seven on a 21 per cent cut in subsidised food exports, according to member-state and Commission officials. The 24 per cent cut sought by Gatt and the US was originally put forward by Mr Ruud Lubbers, Dutch prime minister and then EC president, at a meeting in The Hague last November with Mr Bush.</p>

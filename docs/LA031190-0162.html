"We knew we had to stop them from getting open shots."  </P> <P> On offense, the Pioneers received balanced scoring, with senior 6-foot-8  standout Ed O'Bannon leading the way with 18 points despite playing most of the  game in foul trouble.  </P> <P> "(The fouls) took me away from being more aggressive out there," said O'Bannon.  "Hopefully, a game like this will help us in the finals next week."  </P> <P> Glendora (28-6), which won the Southern Regional Division II title last season,  led, 36-35, early in the fourth quarter. However, Artesia outscored the  Tartans, 22-8, in the game's final seven minutes.  </P> <P> Artesia guard DeAndre Austin scored 10 of his 14 points in the final quarter.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CIF ROUNDUP  </P> <P> Bishop Montgomery 56, Servite 54 -- Senior guard Darrell Daniel, shaking off  the flu, scored seven of his game-high 17 points in the fourth quarter to help  the Knights rally for an Angelus League victory at home and strengthen their  hold on second place.  </P> <P> Bishop Montgomery trailed by its largest deficit, 46-40, a minute into the  fourth quarter before reeling off eight unanswered points, capped by a Daniel  three-pointer, to go ahead with 4:50 remaining.  </P> <P> Servite regained the lead, 52-50, with 3:43 left on a basket by guard Jamie  Rosenkranz, but the Friars went cold from the floor in the waning minutes and  didn't score again until forward Steve Marusich beat the buzzer with a follow  shot.  </P> <P> "Our guys sucked it up down the stretch," Bishop Montgomery Coach Doug Mitchell  said. "We got a lot more intense on defense. We caused some turnovers, and that  got us back in it."  </P> <P> While Servite was scoreless for most of the last four minutes, the Knights  opened a lead by making six of 10 free-throw attempts. Daniel's foul shot with  eight seconds left made it 56-52 and iced the game.  </P> <P> "He's a gamer," Mitchell said of his leading scorer. "He didn't practice (this  week) because he was sick. I didn't think he would play this well."  </P> <P> Forward Pete Tolliver added 12 points for Bishop Montgomery and, along with  forward Joe Magyar, did a good job of battling the taller Friars on the boards.  </P> <P> Servite was led by 6-4 Adam Anderson with 15 points and 6-7 Marusich with 14.  Rosenkranz added 11 but scored only two in the second half against tenacious  pressure by guard Kirk Jones.  </P> <P> Bishop Montgomery (13-5 overall) improved to 4-2 in league play, good for  second place behind unbeaten Mater Dei. The Knights visit Mater Dei at 7:30  Friday night. ROB FERNAS  </P></p>

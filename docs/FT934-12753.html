			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / A moral realist speaks out A gruesome front page story in the Los Angeles Times last week related how inner-city violence was spreading to traditional safe havens such as sedate Orange County. A gang had provoked outrage in a tranquil suburb by ramming a metal rod through the head of a youngster. The victim was not expected to regain consciousness. The story made a fitting backdrop for an interview I had arranged with Mr James Wilson of the University of California at Los Angeles. Mr Wilson, an avuncular intellectual, represents the opposite, civilised pole of US society. The only kind of weapon you can imagine him wielding is a phrase from Aristotle. But his remarkable new book, The Moral Sense*, throws light on modern social problems. His goal is to demolish one of the most entrenched myths of the 20th century: the belief that there is no scientific or logical foundation for morality. Just about every intellectual trend has undermined conventional values. Marxists depicted morals as a bourgeois tool for suppressing the masses. Freudians urged people to liberate themselves from a repressive super-ego. Existentialists told us to invent our own moral codes. Logical positivists, absurdly, claimed that moral statements were meaningless. Market liberals proclaimed that, as an ought can never be derived from an is, morality is a matter of convention. The trend toward moral relativism was reinforced by changes in teaching practice. Starting in the late 1960s, US schools began to embrace a doctrine known as 'values clarification'. This required school teachers to stop 'moralising, criticising, giving values or evaluating'. The predictable result, says Mr Wilson, is that people rapidly lost confidence in their ability to make moral judgments. Some of his own students, he relates with exasperation, are unwilling to condemn even the perpetrators of the Holocaust. 'It all depends on your perspective,' said one. 'I'd first have to see those events through the eyes of the people affected by them,' said another. What worries Mr Wilson most is that students typically begin their moral analysis by searching for excuses for bad behaviour. His book is designed to 'help people recover the confidence with which they once spoke about virtue and morality'. He regards his work as an extension of arguments first advanced by Anglo-Scottish Enlightenment thinkers such as Francis Hutcheson, David Hume and, above all, Adam Smith, who was 'the pre-eminent moral philosopher of his age'. The book's arresting title is a trifle misleading: in practice Mr Wilson is not prepared to follow Hutcheson in arguing for a moral sense on a par with sight or hearing. Instead he follows Hume and Smith in defining it as 'an intuitive or directly felt belief about how one ought to act when one is free to act voluntarily'. Mr Wilson advances the arguments of Smith and others by showing that empirical science in the past two centuries has confirmed rather than refuted their belief that man is an intrinsically moral creature, with an innate sympathy for his fellows. Thus he cites a classic study showing that a lone bystander is more likely to help somebody in trouble than a group of bystanders. This undermines the argument that altruism is really a self-regarding attempt to gain the approval of others. He cites research showing that young children spontaneously develop a concept of fairness and seek to share their possessions without the prompting or even knowledge of adults. And he argues that the willingness of prisoners of war to endure torture, even when hope of escape is remote, implies the existence of an inner 'voice of conscience'. In Mr Wilson's view, these moral predispositions are universal in nature. Anthropologists are right to argue that different cultures have different moral rules, but wrong to infer big underlying differences in moral values. Different moral rules, he claims, mainly reflect differences in circumstances. A truly virtuous man will be recognised as such everywhere. The claim that morals have no validity outside of a given culture is thus bunk. But if the moral sense is innate and universal, how could intellectual fashions have contributed to violence in Los Angeles and other American cities? The answer lies in evidence cited by Mr Wilson suggesting that moral development is linked to the quality of relationships formed in childhood. A study of the people who risked their lives to help victims of the Holocaust in the second world war, for example, shows that they were disproportionately from close-knit families; sympathy for strangers, it seems, is a byproduct of sympathy for one's kin. Moral relativism and the associated view that lifestyles should be chosen as freely as flavours of ice-cream has thus contributed to moral decay by creating environments in which children are not properly nurtured. Mr Wilson concludes that the collapse of the traditional family in recent decades (a majority of American children are now expected to spend some of their formative years in single-parent households) is 'at the core of our social problems'. Sceptics should read the book before airily dismissing this still unfashionable conclusion. *Published by the Free Press, New York. Dollars 22.95.</p>

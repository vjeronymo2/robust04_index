Hosokawa told reporters at his official residence that he  believes the coalition leaders merely "froze" the tax program  "for political reasons," rather than having killed it with  Friday's seven-party agreement.    "I would only seek the same thing which I appealed to the  public to accept, if I appeared again" in a televised news  conference, Hosokawa said.    In a predawn press conference Thursday, Hosokawa surprised  the people and even members of his coalition partners with his  announcement of the plan to create a 7 percent "National Welfare  Tax," starting in April 1997.    At Friday's press briefing, Hosokawa said the tax is  necessary to finance a 10-year welfare program for the elderly,  raise pensions in tandem with annual price rises, and redeem  additional deficit- servicing bonds expected to be floated from  fiscal 1994.    The new tax, whose mechanism is virtually similar to that of  the current 3 percent consumption tax, would be slapped on sales  of most goods and services in Japan.    Hosokawa cited budgetary estimates of expenditures to be  financed by the tax, which were unveiled by the Finance Ministry  on Thursday.    Hosokawa said his tax program would fund an outlay of 800  billion yen to finance the welfare program, 1.3 trillion yen to  cover an increase in government procurement-related spending as  a result of the tax, as well as 1.4 trillion yen for redeeming  additional deficit-servicing bonds.    Under the overall tax plan of 9.5 trillion yen, these  outlays  would be tacked onto a total of 6 trillion yen in income and  corporate tax cuts, of which national and local income tax would  account for 5.3 trillion yen, he said.    Ichiro Ozawa, a chief coalition strategist and co-leader of  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], told a news conference earlier  Friday that the coalition parties "have reached the conclusion  that they should scrap both plans to introduce the new tax and  implement a tax cut as they could not reconcile their  differences over the plans."    Ozawa, widely regarded as a main architect of the tax  proposal, made the announcement after emerging from the meeting  of coalition leaders.    Hosokawa also told reporters the revenue-boosting measure is  indispensable to enable his administration to compile the fiscal  1994 state budget.    "I want coalition party leaders to come up with the right  answer as quickly as possible so the government can compile the  state budget according to its original schedule," he said.    Coalition officials said the leaders had to give up the tax  program to avert a political crisis which was threatening to  scuttle the coalition government.    The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the biggest party in the  alliance, threatened to quit the coalition unless Hosokawa  abandoned the plan, which the SDP said would amount to a de  facto more than doubling of the consumption tax.</p>

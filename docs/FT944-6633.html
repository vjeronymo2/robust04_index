			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Builders warn on cuts in Budget Government efforts to raise private finance for railways, roads, schools, hospitals and other infrastructure should not be used as an excuse to cut public spending, building industry leaders said yesterday. The eve-of-Budget warning follows a recent statement by the chancellor that spending departments would be required to consider whether there was a private finance alternative before approving public spending projects. Mr Hugh Try, chairman of the Building Employers ConFederation, the biggest industry trade association, stressed yesterday that the initiative 'was intended to supplement, and not replace, existing planned public expenditure'. Construction companies are worried that Mr Clarke may announce further cuts in the road programme to curtail public spending. They also expect the chancellor to make a feature of the private finance initiative - possibly announcing approval for some light rail schemes and more privately financed roads. Industry leaders say, however, that they will be dismayed if this is accom-panied by substantial cuts in public investment on construction. Mr Try said yesterday: 'We shall be monitoring the position carefully to see that future public sector capital expenditure is maintained at the necessary levels with additional schemes being brought on stream through the private finance initiative.' Mr Clarke told a a Confederation of British Industry conference this month that he expected private finance to provide 'the main source of growth' for public investment projects. He said the requirement on public sector bodies to investigate private finance alternatives would concentrate 'finite public capital provision on those areas where, for whatever reason, private finance is not possible'. The Building Employers Confederation said it was concerned that progress on the private finance initiative was 'unnecessarily slow.' More effective procedures needed to be developed by the Treasury and other government departments for dealing with projects, it said. Banks and construction companies also needed to be more positive in bringing schemes forward. Mr Try said ministers had promised to overcome unnecessary bureaucracy and constraints. It was also up to 'the construction industry to rise to the challenge to deal with the risks and deliver value for money and profit from its investment'.</p>

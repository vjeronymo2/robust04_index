			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / France clears its first Maastricht hurdle FRENCH ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European union comfortably passed its first hurdle yesterday, with a large government majority in the national assembly in favour of the corresponding revision of the country's constitution. The legislation must now go through the Senate, before a final vote in a joint session of parliament. Only then will France be able to ratify the treaty, either in a simple parliamentary law or by referendum. The national assembly debate dragged on all night as deputies ploughed through 80 amendments. The final vote in mid-morning yesterday was 398-77, with 99 abstentions. This was a significantly bigger majority than might have been predicted, given the vociferous opposition from a minority of right-wing Gaullists and other nationalists. Last week, Mr Philippe Seguin, a nationalist Gaullist, mustered the support of 101 deputies, including 58 Gaullists, in a move to reject the treaty in its entirety. In yesterday's vote, many Gaullists changed their minds, and only 31 voted against the constitutional revision. The government may have owed its enlarged majority to its acceptance of four opposition amendments. The most significant will give parliament a greater involvement in debating Community legislation; other amendments are purely symbolic, like the one declaring French to be the language of the republic. The government also assuaged some Gaullist fears by declaring that France's right to impose a veto in defence of vital national interests, by virtue of the so-called Luxembourg compromise, was just as great as ever. In reality, this right of veto is purely imaginary. However, it ignored Gaullist protests against the Maastricht provision giving the vote in local elections to people from other EC countries. Yesterday's result will restore the government's confidence that it will secure a majority in the Senate and the minimum three-fifths majority in the joint session, which which be held in Versailles. The debate provided a further bonus for the government in its vivid demonstration of the acute divisions between the conservative opposition parties over the EC. There is a deep gulf between the Gaullists who are allergic to anything which smacks of federalism and the centre-right UDF and centrist UDC groups, which are firmly committed to the principle of European integration. Gaullists are further split between those who are reticent about the Community and those who are downright hostile, with only a small minority in favour.</p>

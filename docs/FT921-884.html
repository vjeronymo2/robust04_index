			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iranian smelter plan to go ahead - A 220,000 tonnes-a-year aluminium project IT NOW seems that the Al-Mahdi aluminium smelter near Bandar Abbas in southern Iran is definitely going to be built. Like most big projects, it has spent a long time at the planning and early construction stages without the backers feeling utterly certain that they will complete it. But last week in Tehran the minister of mines and metals, Mr Hussein Mahlouji, said that the project would be built 'unless something extraordinary happens', and the managers on site now take it for granted that 'we're building a smelter'. The project is owned 60 per cent by the ministry of mines and metals and 40 per cent by the International Development Corporation of Dubai. The IDC, in turn, is owned principally by the former United Arab Emirates' ambassador to London, Mr Mahdi Al-Tajir, with the British contractor, George Wimpey, and the Swiss metals trader, Marc Rich. The intention is to build a smelter with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes, which could be expanded to 330,000 tonnes. Actual construction costs are estimated at Dollars 1.6bn, with financing costs and other spending, before full production is reached, consuming a further Dollars 300m to Dollars 400m. So far, camp buildings, apartment blocks, compacting and foundations have been completed and work on the smelter buildings is expected to start in the next few weeks. Wimpey is concerned mainly with design and project management. The actual building to date has been done by Iranian sub-contractors, an arrangement described by Mahdi Sajjad, who runs IDC, as 'very, very successful'. Work on the pot rooms in the later stages of construction will be done by Wimpey with technical help from the Dubai Aluminium Company, which runs the successful smelter in Dubai. Dubal is selling its technology and generally advising on the project. The Export Credits Guarantee Department in London, which put Iran 'on cover' in December last year, has given Wimpey an indication in principle that it will back work on Al-Mahdi. But the ECGD has held back from giving actual guarantees because it worries that the smelter is not in the Iranian five-year plan and it wants to be sure that there will not be changes in the project. Now that the smelter has been given the approval of the Iranian Central Bank and Finance Ministry, as well as the Planning Ministry, the ECGD is said to be sounding very positive. The European credit insurance agencies are already issuing guarantees on exports of equipment, which will be principally German. The owners feel confident that their smelter will be profitable. Although it will be far from its source of alumina (aluminium oxide), which will be Australia, and from its market, which presumably will be mainly the fast-developing economies of the Far East, the smelter will benefit from very cheap power, which is the biggest cost in aluminium production. Mr Sajjad said the Iranians had 'made a bold decision to use their gas without being too sensitive on how they price it'. The government has been much more interested in having the smelter as a focus for development and a source of employment than in extracting every last cent it can from its gas reserves, which are by far the biggest in the Gulf region. The smelter project will have its own 450MW power station fed from the Sarkhoun gas field, which will be a tied source. It is also guaranteed 200MW from a large 1,200MW power station nearby. The gas and electricity supplies are priced at levels that will give the smelter the same cost per megawatt for both its power sources, and, although neither the Iranian government nor IDC are saying what the prices are, they have made it known that they will be the cheapest outside Canada. They say the price will be comparable with hydro-electric power, which in Canada costs some 0.3 to 0.5 US cents per kilowatt hour. If aluminium prices have recovered to Dollars 1,500 to Dollars 1,600 a tonne by the mid-1990s, the owners say they will be perfectly happy. Prices have fallen from Dollars 1,400 to Dollars 1,500 a tonne two years ago to Dollars 1,300 a tonne, and at one point dipped below Dollars 1,000 a tonne. But the project's backers believe general trend of world demand, now just over 14m tonnes a year, is strongly upwards, and everybody concerned is confident that there will be a place for the smelter's production in the market. A recent study by the Economist Intelligence Unit suggested prices of Dollars 1,750 to Dollars 1,850 a tonne by 1995. In the past year some old production capacity has been closed and the owners believe that, when the recession ends, there will be demand for extra output equivalent to at least two new Al-Mahdi smelters a year. 'You can't build smelters as fast as that,' said Mr Sajjad. The backers of Al-Mahdi do not feel threatened by their friends at Dubal, which has an output of 243,000 tonnes a year, or by the expansion programme under way to raise capacity at the other Gulf smelter, Aluminium Bahrain (Alba), from 210,000 tonnes to more than 400,000 tonnes. Nor are they concerned about a project for a smelter at Yanbu, in Saudi Arabia, where the backers are still negotiating with the government on loan terms and gas prices. In case the market does not evolve as predicted, the Al-Mahdi backers say they are aiming to make a very high quality ingot, so that at least they will always be able to sell what they produce. Achieving this requires good management and the right working discipline, rather than extra investment. It will be a challenge for a later stage of the project.</p>

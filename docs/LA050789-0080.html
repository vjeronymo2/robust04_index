			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRANK O'ROURKE, 72; PROLIFIC WRITER OF WESTERNS, MYSTERIES  </P> <P> Frank O'Rourke, who wrote more than 60 novels after embarking on a writing  career with "E Company" in 1945, has died of complications of asthma, it was  learned this week.  </P> <P> O'Rourke, who specialized in Westerns and mysteries, was 72 when he died April  27 in Tucson.  </P> <P> "The Writers Directory" lists more than 60 novels and short-story collections  under his name. He often completed three books in a single year. His books  appeared so often that his publishers asked him to use pseudonyms, which he  did. Some of them were Kevin Connor, Frank O'Malley and Patrick O'Malley.  </P> <P> Some of his works were made into films, including "The Bravados," a 1958  Gregory Peck vehicle, "A Mule for the Marquesa" (called "The Professionals"  when it was released with Burt Lancaster in 1966) and "The Great Bank Robbery."  </P> <P> Some of his major novels were "The Bright Morning," telling of youths growing  up in the Midwest in the 1930s; "The Far Mountains," a historical novel of the  Southwest in the 19th Century, and his first, "E Company," about his military  service.  </P> <P> His works were sprinkled with colorful names, some of them old cowboys he had  encountered in his travels. One was Doughbelly Price, featured in two of his  books, "The Diamond Hitch" and "The Last Ride." Others came from historical  sources, such as Talache Coyote in "The Bride Stealer." O'Rourke found Coyote  in the Spanish Archives of New Mexico, which the writer said contained records  from 1621.  </P> <P> Asked by compilers of the anthology series "Contemporary Authors" what advice  he would offer aspiring writers, O'Rourke responded: "I learned a long time ago  that people don't want advice."  </P></p>

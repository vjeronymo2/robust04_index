			<p>BFN     [Text] Kigali, June 5 (AFP) -- The United Nations suspended  relief flights to Rwanda after government forces shelled  Kigali's rebel-held airport Sunday [5 June] while a plane  carrying Italian Junior Foreign Minister Franco Rochetta was on  the tarmac, officials said.    The flights were suspended "until further notice," the  officials said.    A Canadian C-130 military transport plane that had just  landed with Rochetta and three other Italian officials on board  took off again before they could disembark after a shell slammed  into the airport behind the control tower.    Seconds after the plane left the ground, a second shell hit  the runway. Nobody was hurt and there was no damage to the  plane.    "The shells were certainly fired by the RGF (Rwandan  Government Forces)," UN military spokesman Major Jean-Guy Plante  told reporters on the tarmac when the shells landed.</p>

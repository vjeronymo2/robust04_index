			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Gurkan Sari from Xanthi] </F>   [Text] Republican People's Party [RPP] leader Deniz Baykal,  his delegation, and former independent deputy from Xanthi Ahmet  Faikoglu were attacked by fanatic Greeks in Xanthi in western  Thrace.    On the second day of his visit to western Thrace, Baykal  visited Mufti Mehmet Emir Aga in his home. Fanatic Greeks  demonstrated when the bus carrying Baykal, his delegation, and  journalists arrived in Xanthi. While Baykal was replying to  questions by Greek journalists, the demonstrators attacked Ahmet  Faikoglu. Greek police manhandled the Turkish journalists who  were trying to capture these incidents on film. Some of the  journalists were stranded in Faikoglu's office.    The demonstrators then threw stones at the bus carrying the  delegation. Speaking at the Turkish Union in Xanthi, Deniz  Baykal said: The stones hurled at the bus show the oppression  to which the Turkish identity that we want to keep alive is  subjected.    In an earlier speech in the village of Gokceler, Baykal  pointed out that if the western Thrace Turks are approached with  a new understanding, they could constitute a bridge between  Turkey and Greece. He noted that it is not customary for  Turkish politicians to show an interest in or support western  Thrace, adding: For some reason, we have always refrained from  talking about western Thrace. Turkish politicians think that if  they show an interest in western Thrace they might hurt our  friendship with Greece. We must overcome this. We want to be  friends with Greece. We will be friends with Greece but not at  the cost of the Turkish identity, faith, and language of the  150,000 people living here.</p>

KOREA ON TRADE  </P> <P> The United States has given South Korea five months to resolve  telecommunications disputes or risk trade sanctions, Seoul officials said  today.  </P> <P> They also said little progress was being made in the first round of U.S.-South  Korean talks on opening Seoul's market to American telecommunication goods and  services.  </P> <P> U.S. delegates, led by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative's director  for Korean affairs, Gordana Earp, said South Korea must show sincere commitment  in opening its market by Feb. 18, 1990, or incur stiff penalties under new U.S.  trade laws.  </P> <P> Washington accused Seoul in February of keeping its markets closed to American  telecom products. It said it would slap up to 100% tariffs on  telecommunications imports from South Korea if bilateral talks fell through.  </P></p>

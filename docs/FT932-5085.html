			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt active in automotive and retail sectors THERE were mixed performances among bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT produced notable gains in the automotive and retail sectors as the DAX index rose 8.23 to 1,637.85, up 0.4 per cent on the week. Turnover rose from DM4.3bn to DM5.1bn. Among carmakers, Daimler rose DM7.80 to DM562 and Volkswagen, ex a DM2 dividend, by a net DM7.20 to DM324.70; in retailing, Douglas put on DM7 to DM491 and Karstadt DM12 to DM530. The industrial background has not been encouraging in either case. Orders for German carmakers released yesterday were down 14.1 per cent by volume in April; and on Wednesday, the Ifo economics research institute said that west German retail sales would drop by a real 3 per cent, and a nominal 1 per cent this year, due to recession. VW has been making encouraging noises about the second half of this year, which may imply more recent knowledge of events. Karstadt, in share price terms, has been falling behind Kaufhof which on Thursday produced a 6.2 per cent sales rise for the first five months of this year. In financials, AMB produced one of the biggest gains of the day, DM45 to DM930; Mr Stephen Dias of Goldman Sachs said that yesterday's results had reminded the market that AMB had sold a large, troublesome stake in BfG Bank over the past year; the size of the gain, he said, probably reflected lack of liquidity in the stock. MILAN was unsettled by a 4 per cent fall in Montedison, triggered by the announcement that Mr Sergio Cragnotti, a former managing director, had decided not to return to the group to help with the restructuring programme. The shares fixed down L46 at L1,132, before easing further to L1,118 on the kerb. Ferruzzi, the holding group, lost L50 or 4.7 per cent to L1,016. The Comit index eased back as a consequence, closing off 6.77 at 531.42, for a fall of 1.5 per cent on the week. Fiat continued to lose support with a report that Italian May car sales had fallen by 28 per cent against the same period last year. The shares dipped L59 to L5,590, a drop of 4.6 per cent over the week. Profit-taking in the telecommunications groups, Stet and Sip, saw the shares slip L54 and L37 respectively to L2,023 and L3,195. ZURICH closed at a new record high, the SMI index rising 15.4 to 2,284.3 for a 0.6 per cent gain on the week. Relatively good earnings performances and the strength of the dollar were advanced as reasons for the improvement. SMH surged SFr150 to SFr2,160 on the watchmaker's announcement that it expects another significant improvement in 1993 earnings, following a 64 per cent climb in group profits in 1992. MADRID's general index nosed past the 260 level, 1.29 higher at 261.24 and 1 per cent up on the week, hopeful that the weekend's general elections would be followed by a quick cut in interest rates. STOCKHOLM, satisfied with the Volvo/Procordia announcement on Thursday, nevertheless fell back on scattered profit-taking. The Affarsvarlden general index slipped 2.10 to 1,089.20, barely changed on the week, in turnover of SKr1.3bn. The B shares in Volvo and Procordia moved forward by SKr10 and SKr4 respectively to SKr416 and SKr197. Ericsson was also prominent, rising to an all time high, up SKr3 to SKr329 in the B's, with foreign investors continuing to be attracted by its strength in the European telecoms sector. AMSTERDAM was flat on the day, the CBS Tendency index ending at 104.7, a slight loss on the week. KLM lost nearly all of Thursday's gains, down 80 cents at Fl 25.50. VIENNA followed this week's break through the 800 mark with the ATX index up 10.14 at 815.77, 2.3 per cent better on the week. Traders said the gains were partly generated by the OeTOB futures and options exchange.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- June 4                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              Open     10.30     11.00     12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1160.62   1160.18   1160.67   1159.69 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1218.79   1217.52   1217.07   1216.50  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1158.50   1160.93   1158.77   1159.95 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1214.25   1216.63   1213.76   1214.21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Jun 3     Jun 2    June 1    May 28    May 27  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1160.81   1155.78   1153.22   1161.58   1165.01 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1217.28   1215.58   1215.43   1224.85   1231.31  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1163.45 ; 200 -  1220.71 Low/day: 100 -  1151.54  200 -  1207.94 .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

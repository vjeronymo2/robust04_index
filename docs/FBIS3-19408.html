			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Toulon, France, March 17 (AFP) -- Police made eight  new arrests, mainly among suspected members of the local  underworld, in the Toulon area early Thursday [17 March] in  connection with the mafia-style murder of anti-corruption MP  Yann Piat.    They said it was the third such swoop since Piat was  murdered  in a contract killing on February 25 that exposed links between  political corruption and France's Mediterranean mafia out for  kickbacks.    Piat's two presumed killers, Epifanio Pericolo, 28, and  Denis  Labadie, 27, were arrested and charged two weeks ago, but police  are trying to find out who ordered the murder.    Several prominent local politicians have been questioned in  connection of the slaying of Piat, a member of the center-right  UDF-RPR [French Democratic Union-Rally for the Republic]  parliamentary group, who was also campaigning against drug  trafficking.    In a posthumous letter, Piat, 44, denounced what she had  called "collusion between elected officials and the local  underworld" in a variety of financial deals.    Piat's killing was the first of a French parliamentarian  since December 1976 when Prince Jean de Broglie was murdered.  That case remains unsolved.</p>

Shiryayev, deputy director of the Moscow </F> Government's Department of Finances, by Igor Ostrovskiy; date  and place not given: "A War of the Banks or a Victory of Market  Thinking?"]    [Text] During the past week, the mass information  media have actively discussed the decision of Yu. Luzhkov,  Moscow's mayor, to transfer the city's budget account to six  proxy banks: Menatop, Most-Bank, National Credit, Capital,  Tekhnobank, and Orbita. The commercial People's Bank managed the  budget money up until now. Some commentators consider the city  government's decision a victory for the lobbyists for a (group)  of banks that have decided to divide the budget pie. Others see  in it a manifestation of market relations in a delicate area  like the implementation of the city's budget. V. Shiryayev,  deputy director of the Moscow government's Department of  Finance, talks about the motives of the Moscow government's  financiers.    [Shiryayev] We did not start thinking yesterday about the  need to improve the settlement system with the city's on-budget  organizations. The unpleasant situation with the Bank for  Foreign Economic Relations, which delayed a multi-billion  payment to the Department of Construction for four days in  September, accelerated the decision. Three similar cases are on  the accounts of the People's Bank. These were not premeditated  delays but breakdowns in the electronic systems of the Central  Bank's Inter-Regional Information Center. However, you will  agree that this did not make it easier for those who did not  receive their wages on time. Based on common sense, we  understood that there is no and cannot be any modern bank  capable of coping by itself with such a bulky and cumbersome  thing as Moscow's budget. I will say for informational purposes  that it exceeded three trillion rubles last year.    We are not the only ones thinking about how to organize the  management of local budgets. Russia's Ministry of Finance, for  example, considers it necessary to establish a network of  regional treasuries which would assume these functions. The idea  of municipal banks is also being heard. Neither the first nor  the second suggestion is acceptable to us. Where would we get  the billions to support the treasuries? Where would we get the  money to form the charter funding of a municipal bank? That is  why we selected our own, a Moscow, variant -- to work with six  proxy banks. We will receive results without expending a single  budget kopek.    [Ostrovskiy] Some specialists are saying that you will  receive six bank monopolies instead of one and that nothing will  really be changed?    [Shiryayev] I want to call the specialist's attention to the  document adopted by Moscow's government on 22 February. It is  called "On Improving the Conditions for Bank Clearing Operations  for Accounts Using the City of Moscow's Budget and the On-Budget  and Off-Budget Accounts of Municipal Institutions and  Organizations." Our vision for the interaction of the city's  government with commercial banks is formulated there. We are  talking about establishing a powerful information system and  common standard documents. We want to achieve the "transparency"  of accounts, that is, to obtain access to them at any second and  receive complete information about what is being done with  budget money. With the help of the proxy banks, we want to  construct a settlement vertical line, that is, a system thanks  to which each on-budget city organization would receive its  upkeep on the precisely defined day.    [Ostrovskiy] Are you confident that the banks selected by  you  will cope with this task?    [Shiryayev] We hope so. The experience from our cooperation  with Most-Bank, which manages the health accounts, strengthens  our hopes. The vertical line, about which I spoke, has worked in  two municipal okrugs. There, questions concerning financing do  not arise among health care workers. The proxy banks, for  example, have suggested adding interest to the daily remainder  in the accounts. The money will probably not be very much but we  are happy for any additional kopek because of the very acute  budgetary shortage.    [Ostrovskiy] The People's Bank did not provide you these  services?    [Shiryayev] At any rate, it did not propose them to us. You  will agree that a bank should devise conditions beneficial to  such a sizable customer as Moscow's government under market  conditions. Concerning the monopoly of six proxy banks over the  jurisdiction of the budget accounts, I assure you that the list  is not closed. We are prepared to discuss suggestions, including  with the People's Bank.</p>

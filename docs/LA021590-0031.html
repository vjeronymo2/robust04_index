			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEW RULE HAS JET SKIERS GOING IN CIRCLES  </P> <P> Personal watercraft -- commonly called Jet Skis -- will should have to travel  counter-clockwise in two designated parts of Mission Bay, the City Council's  Public Facilities and Recreation Committee decided Wednesday.  </P> <P> The change had been recommended by George Loveland, park and recreation  director.  </P> <P> But a spokesman for users of the small craft objected to the new rule, telling  the committee that going in circles would prove so boring that people would  wander into the general-use areas of the bay, creating worse dangers. The craft  still are allowed in the general-use areas under the new rules, with no  restrictions on their patterns of travel.  </P> <P> "Jet Skis were designed . . . to be operated, safely, by making many course  changes. It's very boring to ride a Jet Ski around in a big circle," said  William E. Jacobs, an attorney for the San Diego Personal Watercraft Assn. "If  you impose that obligation on people in that personal watercraft area, a large  proportion of those users are going to go around that area a couple of times  and they are going to shoot right out on the bay."  </P> <P> If they do that, Jacobs said, they will get into more severe accidents with  boats.  </P> <P> (Personal watercraft is the generic name for the small, fast-moving vehicles  marketed by Kawasaki as the Jet Ski and by Yamaha as the Wave Runner.)  </P> <P> Although the committee approved the new safety measure anyway, it also required  the park director to report on the measure's effects in the fall. Committee  members Bob Filner, J. Bruce Henderson and Abbe Wolfsheimer voted for the  measure; Judy McCarty and John Hartley voted against it.  </P> <P> The measure will become effective when the new rules are posted, said Chris  Brewster, captain of the city's lifeguards.  </P> <P> A 10-year-old boy died in September, 1988 while riding a Jet Ski, focusing  public attention on the dangers of the watercraft. Thomas M. Ready broke his  neck when he cut between a water skier and the tow-boat.  </P> <P> City lifeguards held public hearings that fall with groups such as boat clubs  and boat rental businesses and devised measures to increase safety in the bay,  which went into effect last summer. Among them: all boats within 100 feet of  the shore must travel at 5 m.p.h. or less and only water-ski boats are  permitted within 200 feet of water-ski loading and take-off areas.  Additionally, boating rules were posted at all boat launch ramps, and a second  area north of the entrance to Fiesta Island was designated for the exclusive  use of personal watercraft.  </P> <P> Although the number of boating accidents remained about the same,  serious-injury accidents -- cases in which people went to the hospital --  dropped from 25 in 1888 to 11 in 1989, Brewster said.  </P> <P> Brewster said after the meeting that 48 accidents were reported in Mission Bay  in 1989. Of these, personal watercraft were involved in 19.  </P></p>

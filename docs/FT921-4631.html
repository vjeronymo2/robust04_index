			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Compromise on tied-aid rules THE Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has forged a compromise over the transition to tough new rules intended to stop aid funds being mixed with commercial loans to help exporters win contracts. The compromise, which emerged last week, is expected to defuse a row between the US and Spain over two unusually large Spanish credit lines to Mexico and Venezuela which were rushed through before curbs on mixing aid with commercial credits came into force on February 15. At the same time, efforts by the OECD to get member states to report outstanding unused tied credits have achieved little success. Just six of its 24 member states have disclosed their aid 'overhang', none of them leading users of tied aid. No replies have been received from Japan, the UK, France, Italy, Germany or the US. OECD efforts to eliminate 'mixed credits', in which governments cheapen the cost of loans for projects in target markets by mixing aid funds with pure commercial credits, have made significant progress. Rules that came into force on February 15 limit tied aid to projects that are not commercially viable. They also ban the use of tied aid for loans to better-off developing countries - defined as those with gross national product per capita of Dollars 2,465 (Pounds 1,400) or more in 1990. The controversial Spanish credits were seen as an abuse of both principles. The credits, of SDR723m (Pounds 567.55m) to Mexico, and SDR650m to Venezuela, were among the five largest credits ever notified to the OECD, and compared with total Spanish aid in 1990 of Dollars 800m. The compromise agreed this week will not force Spain to withdraw the credit lines, but their lives will be strictly limited. They can be assigned to projects - even those that are seen as commercially viable  - up to December 31 this year, and must be notified to the OECD by then. The special transition rules for other existing unused tied credits will allow countries to notify projects to be funded by these credits up to August 15 this year. Tied credits are normally valid for two years after signature. Under the new rules, it will not be possible to prolong them. Up to August 15, it will be possible to use these credits even in countries with per capita GNP above the agreed threshold. But for the rest of the life of the credit, it can be used only for non-commercial projects. The aim of the changes is to boost aid flows to the world's most needy countries, and into non-commercial but important projects.</p>

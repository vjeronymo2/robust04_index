			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: Elf chairman sees recovery in net profits next year ELF AQUITAINE, the French oil group, expects net profits to recover next year after falling by around 35 per cent in 1992, said Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, chairman. He attributed the likely fall, from a FFr9.8bn (Dollars 1.81bn) net profit in 1991, to the decline in the dollar's value, the fall in oil prices and factors linked to the economic slowdown. These included 'very bad' refining margins, 'considerable' overcapacity in the petrochemical industry, a collapse in French demand for diesel and petrol during last summer's truck strike, and a delay in fertiliser orders caused by farmers' fears of the impact of European Community agricultural policy reforms. Margins for all of Elf's products had been hit in the UK, Italy and Spain because of the decline in their currencies against the franc. Mr Le Floch-Prigent pointed out, however, that Elf's profits fall would be less serious than that likely from some competitors. Oil production had increased and distribution of special oil products and speciality chemicals had done well. Elf Sanofi, the group's pharmaceutical subsidiary, would also have a strong year, helped by its alliance with Sterling Drug of the US. Elf Aquitaine planned to trim investments during the downturn but would stick to its basic strategy, which has been to keep a rough balance between upstream and downstream operations, with a slight bias towards production, the group's traditional domain. Mr Le Floch-Prigent expected oil prices to recover to around Dollars 20 per barrel next year, from Dollars 18.84 currently.</p>

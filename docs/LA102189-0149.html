			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FATHER HELD AS MURDER SUSPECT IN BEATING DEATH OF 3-YEAR-OLD  </P> <P> A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the  beating death of his 3-year-old son, sheriff's officials said Friday.  </P> <P> Authorities said that around 8:15 a.m. Thursday, Joaquin Figueroa Ayala, who is  believed to be a Santa Ana resident, had driven his son to the Mission Viejo  house where his wife works as a maid.  </P> <P> There, Sheriff's Lt. Bob Rivas said, "he told his wife that the child was not  feeling good."  </P> <P> "She saw that something was wrong," Rivas said, "and called the paramedics  because it appeared that the child was not breathing."  </P> <P> The boy was taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo,  where he was pronounced dead at 8:51 a.m. Thursday.  </P> <P> Preliminary findings from an autopsy completed Friday indicate that the child,  whom coroner's officials identified as Francisco Trujillo, died from  blunt-force trauma to the head and body, Rivas said.  </P> <P> Ayala was arrested shortly before 9 p.m. Thursday.  </P> <P> Sheriff's investigators could not confirm where the alleged beating would have  occurred.  </P> <P> Rivas said that investigators had determined from an interview with Ayala in  the hospital that Francisco had been with his father before arriving at the  house in Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> Ayala is being held in Orange County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail, Rivas said.  </P> <P> The boy's death comes at a time when reports of child abuse in Orange County  have reached an all-time high. According to data compiled by the Orange County  Child Abuse Registry, reported cases of abuse for a one-year period ending in  July rose 8% over the previous 12-month period, and they were nearly 25% higher  than they were for the year before that.  </P></p>

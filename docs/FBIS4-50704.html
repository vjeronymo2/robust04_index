			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article from the "Grasp the Opportunity, Revitalize the </F> Pillar Industry" column by Sheng Huaren (4141 5478 0088),  general manager of the China National Petrochemical Corporation:  "The Petrochemical Industry in the Year 2000"]    [Text] Revitalizing the petrochemical industry and turning  it into a pillar of the economy is a historical demand set forth  by China's socialist modernization and also a major strategic  task placed before the petrochemical industry.    The petrochemical industry occupies an important position  and  plays an important role in the national economy. It is a  leading industry and a pillar which has supported economic  takeoff and social development in many developed countries. The  petrochemical industry has become an important scale to measure  a country's economic strength and scientific and technological  standards. In our country, the petrochemical industry is still  a new industry. In the wake of more than 40 years' of  development, and especially after the founding of the China  National Petrochemical Corporation [CNPC] in 1983, a number of  modern oil refining, chemical industry, chemical fiber, and  chemical fertilizer enterprises have been established, thus  substantially increasing the comprehensive strength of China's  petrochemical industry. By the end of 1993, the total value of  the assets of China's petrochemical industry amounted to 182.9  billion yuan, an increase of more than 500 percent in 10 years;  the petrochemical industry's sales reached 145.2 billion, an  increase of more than 200 percent in 10 years; and the  accumulated total financial revenue turned over by the  petrochemical industry over the past 10 years was more than 130  billion yuan.    In order to develop the petrochemical industry into an  economic pillar, we must first of all set an aggressive,  realistic target which can be accomplished through effort. This  target must consist of both quantitative and qualitative  criteria. Quantitatively speaking, we have put forth a basic  idea about a two-stage program according to the guideline laid  down by the central authorities. In the first stage, by 2000 we  will raise the annual crude oil processing capacity to about 200  million metric tons and ethylene production capacity to about 5  million metric tons, thus initially upgrading the petrochemical  industry to be a pillar of the national economy. In the second  stage, by 2010, we will raise annual crude oil processing  capacity to over 300 million metric tons and ethylene production  capacity to 8-10 million metric tons, thus enabling China's  petrochemical industry to approach or reach the advanced world  levels both in terms of scale and actual capacity. Qualitatively  speaking, our first main task is to increase the variety and  brands of our products, raise our product quality and grade,  increase economic returns, and strive to optimize the industry's  returns. Over the past 10 years since the founding of the CNPC,  returns (profits and taxes received) have doubled, from 10.7  billion yuan in 1983 to 21.7 billion yuan in 1993. We are  planning to double returns again in the next seven years, that  is, by the year 2000, mainly through such measures as speeding  up technological progress and intensifying business management.  This will be a very arduous task to accomplish, as it requires  us to work really hard indeed.    Comrade Jiang Zemin has noted: "To strive for development we  need new ideas too." In light of this spirit and the  requirements laid down in an inscription written by Comrade  Jiang Zemin, we need a new idea to guide our efforts to  revitalize the petrochemical industry and build it into an  economic pillar. We maintain that the eight-character principle  of "large scale, advanced technology, serialization of products,  and intensive production" must be upheld in order to explore a  road with Chinese characteristics to speed up the development of  the petrochemical industry, to revitalize the industry, and to  build it into an economic pillar. Large scale means economies  of scale. In other words, we should emulate the successful  experiences of foreign countries, stress economies of scale when  starting new projects in the future, oil refining installations  must have an annual capacity of over 5 million metric tons each,  ethylene installations must have an annual capacity of 450,000  metric tons each, and all existing medium and small-scale  installations must undergo technological transformation to  gradually increase their economies of scale. Advanced  technology means to implement in real earnest Comrade Xiaoping's  idea that "science and technology is the primary productive  force," keep track of advanced world standards, speed up  scientific and technological progress, apply advanced technology  in achieving the greatest economic returns, and seek development  by tapping internal potential. While stressing self-reliance in  vigorously developing new technology, we must also attach  importance to assimilating and making use of the advanced  technology available abroad so that our country's petrochemical  industry can develop from a more advanced starting point.  Serialization of products means to vigorously develop the  intensive processing of crude oil, synthetic materials, and  chemical materials; strive to develop a full range of upstream,  midstream, and downstream products; produce high-quality  products with advanced technology, new designs, high added  value, and marketability; and constantly develop a series of  products including oil products, plastic products, synthetic  fibers, synthetic rubber, and fine petrochemical products.  Intensive production means to sum up our practical experiences,  boldly assimilate advanced management experience from abroad,  establish a modern enterprise system and operational mechanism  which suits the needs of the socialist market economic  structure, and ensure scientific management, high efficiency,  low inputs, and high outputs, thus scoring the best results.    Deepening reform is the only way out to revitalize the  petrochemical industry and develop it into an economic pillar.  According to the guidelines laid down in the "Resolution"  adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, the CNPC must be gradually reorganized into a  shareholding company to suit our country's national conditions.  At the same time, it is necessary to fully delegate all the  decision-making powers to enterprises that the "Regulations"  have vested in them and to extricate enterprises from the yoke  that has been placed on them by the highly centralized planned  economic structure of the past, so that they become real, active  entities in the market. Therefore, as far as business strategy  is concerned, it is necessary to gradually develop a business  operational mode characterized by the "group enterprise  structure, transnational operations, the joint-stock system, and  diversification." The introduction of the group enterprise  structure means to give full play to the advantages of the  socialist system which can pool resources to accomplish big  projects and to give full play to the initiative of all  departments of the corporation through the rational assignment  of duties and readjustments of power and interests within the  corporation, thus increasing the competitive power of Chinese  petrochemical products in domestic and overseas markets.  Transnational operation means to adapt to the international  market and promote comprehensive cooperation with foreign  countries, including measures to attract foreign businessmen to  start investment projects and establish plants in China, import  advanced foreign technology, jointly exploit oil resources with  foreign investors, directly import oil resources from abroad, go  straight to start investment projects and set up plants abroad,  and expand exports of products, technology, and labor services,  as well as overseas project contract operations. Promoting the  joint-stock system means to encourage more local investors and  foreign businessmen to run joint ventures in the petrochemical  industry and to develop joint-stock companies in various forms  after the model of a company with limited liability and a  limited stock company. Existing enterprises also must carry out  reform to introduce the joint-stock system step by step and in a  planned way, and the CNPC must speed up its pace in transforming  itself into a state-owned shareholding company. Diversification  means extending intensive processing operation to produce  midstream and downstream petrochemical products and to further  develop more upstream products. At the same time, it is  necessary to actively develop tertiary industry and gradually  build up a large-scale diversified cross-trade and  cross-sectoral operational structure which integrates industrial  production, trading, commerce, banking, scientific and  technological research and services, engineering, information  services, and consultancy services, thus increasing economic  returns and our economic strength.</p>

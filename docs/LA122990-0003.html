			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SHERIFF ASKS DISASTER DECLARATION FOR COUNTY;  </P> <P> FREEZE: CROP LOSSES MAY REACH $100 MILLION, AGRICULTURE OFFICIALS SAY, WITH  LEMON ORCHARDS ALONE TOTALING $38 MILLION IN FRUIT DESTROYED BY COLD.  </P> <P> Acting in his role as director of disaster services, Sheriff John Gillespie  declared Ventura County a disaster area Friday, the first step to obtaining  emergency federal loans for area growers devastated by last weekend's deep  freeze.  </P> <P> County supervisors have tentatively scheduled a special session for Thursday to  ratify the declaration, officials said. The declaration will then be sent to  Sacramento where the governor will decide whether to forward the request for  low-interest disaster relief loans to the federal government. Ten other  counties are also considering declaring an emergency.  </P> <P> "Since agriculture is the No. 1 industry in Ventura County, this is truly a  disaster," Gillespie said Friday. "It's as disastrous as if the county had  burnt from wildfire or flooded."  </P> <P> In preliminary estimates, agriculture officials set the loss to county crops at  nearly $100 million, with the county's valuable lemon orchards suffering the  brunt at $38 million in lost fruit.  </P> <P> In other figures released Friday, agricultural officials estimated a  $17.5-million loss of avocados, or about 32% of the county's crop; a  $16.5-million loss of Valencia oranges, or about 27% of the crop; a $7-million  loss of nursery stock, about 7.5% of the crop; a $4-million loss in  strawberries, 5% of the crop; a $4-million loss of celery, about 5% of the  crop; and a $2.5-million loss in cut flowers, about 10% of the crop.  </P> <P> With another freeze expected to plunge temperatures into the mid- to low 20s  tonight and Sunday night, losses may continue to climb, officials said.  </P> <P> A second Arctic air mass was expected to arrive late today, said National  Weather Service agricultural meteorologist Terry Schaeffer. If the cold spots  are restricted to the same inland areas of Ojai and Santa Paula that have  already lost fruit, losses this weekend could be held to a minimum, Schaeffer  said.  </P> <P> "Some areas did better than others," he said.  </P> <P> But Schaeffer predicted that the extremely cold mass that he earlier had feared  would move into Ventura County tonight will deliver only a "glancing blow" to  the county before veering off to the agriculturally rich San Joaquin Valley  that has already measured $75 million in damage to citrus crops alone.  </P> <P> Total losses to this year's crops will not be known for another few months when  growers determine how much of their young fruit is salvageable, said Deputy  Agriculture Commissioner David Buettner. Growers say it will be two to three  years before they can measure the long-term damage to trees, damage which will  result in lower crop yields.  </P> <P> The county's vegetable and other row crops, which lost only about 5% of their  total value, fared better than citrus and avocados because the growing fields  are in slightly warmer areas, Buettner said. In addition, many vegetable and  row crops produce several harvests a year, with last weekend's freeze having  little or no impact on future crops.  </P> <P> The areas hardest hit by the freeze were in canyons near Santa Paula and the  Ojai Valley, where a stagnant and frigid air mass settled on some of the  county's richest citrus and avocado orchards.  </P> <P> The Oxnard Plain, where much of the county's broccoli, lettuce, celery and  other row crops are cultivated, was spared the harshest temperatures, Buettner  said.  </P> <P> Strawberry growers will lose most of the berries on plants that were already  flowering, Buettner said, but that represents only about 5% of the total  strawberry crop. The county produces berries from January through July.  </P> <P> Cut flowers, many of them grown in the Oxnard Plain and the Santa Clara River  Valley which was also spared the hard freeze, suffered 10% loss, but baby's  breath fields were about 95% destroyed, Buettner said.  </P> <P> "It's very susceptible to frost damage, so it won't be back until Valentine's  Day," he said.  </P> <P> Most nursery stock growers were able to protect their sensitive plants, he  said, but the county's $94-million-a-year industry still suffered a 7.5% loss,  he said.  </P> <P> Friday marked the second time in three years that Ventura County has declared a  disaster because of frost damage.  </P> <P> The county suffered more than $51 million in crop damage in 1987, Buettner  said.  </P> <P> Another 10 counties statewide were preparing to declare emergencies, said Joe  Bandy, regional coordinator for the California Department of Food and  Agriculture in Sacramento.  </P></p>

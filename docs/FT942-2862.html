			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Growth projection likely to be raised The Treasury will publish an updated forecast for the economy on June 28 in which it is expected to revise upwards its projection of economic growth this year from 2.5 per cent forecast in its November Budget. The government will thus meet the requirements of the industry act, which specifies that it should publish economic forecasts twice a year. Until this year, it published forecasts with its Budget in March and in the autumn. The late-June forecast is in response to the decision to scrap the spring revenue-raising Budget and have a unified Budget in November.</p>

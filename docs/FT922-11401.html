			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Food &amp; Drink: Takeaway porcupine - Street Food NGUYEN VAN CHUONG leant over the table and proceeded to break up the fish in the broth with his chop sticks. 'The stomach is for you,' my guide said, 'a Vietnamese delicacy.' Something, thankfully, was lost in the translation, I later discovered. It was not stomach but bladder. It was not unpleasant, having taken on the flavour of the soup. And even if it had been, the delicious tastes of the juicy white fish itself and the accompanying spicy prawns would soon have made up for it. That first meal in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) - at a kerbside restaurant with as many cats as patrons - was just one of many based around soup. Noodle soup with quails eggs for breakfast, rice spaghetti soup with pork for lunch, spicy beef soup with noodles and broth for dinner. The soups - a national dish of Vietnam  - provide a hearty and readily available meal. In every village, town or city in southern Vietnam, privately-run road side stalls and cafes provide the Vietnamese equivalent of fast food. A plateful of fresh herbs and vegetables to put in the soup - like mint, coriander and bean sprouts  - a few chillis, and a pot of tea make it a meal. A Coke or beer can increase the price of lunch almost six-fold to about 60p. Much of Vietnam's daily life takes place on the street. Vendors hawk rice squares wrapped in banana leaves, soya bean cakes, carved pineapple pieces and bread rolls. One of the joys of Vietnam is the abundance of seasonal fruits and vegetables. There are the usual - such as watermelon, mangoes, strawberries, oranges, avocados and artichokes - and the less familiar; jackfruit, a pendulous affair the size of a football containing thick perfumed orange petals; and muop, a long pale green vegetable, the flavour of which reminded one diner of wet swimming towels left rolled up for several days. Much of it comes from Dalat in the Central Highlands, a temperate area famous as a retreat during colonial rule. Early in the morning, farmers bring their fresh fruit, vegetables and flowers to Dalat's central market. Splashing out in Vietnam means spending maybe Pounds 3 at one of the big hotels in Ho Chi Minh City. The Rex Hotel's rooftop bar offers a wonderful view of the city - and a pleasant escape from the noise and heat of the streets below. Work your way through the delicious and refreshing fresh fruit juices - pineapple, mango, strawberry, orange and even avocado. Experience shows that it is best to order food at least half an hour before hunger strikes. When it finally arrives, the prawn and pork salad is mouthwatering - a huge dish packed full of prawns seasoned with lemon grass and a basil-like herb called rau ram. If the waiter remembers, it might also be accompanied by nuoc cham, a fermented fish sauce mixed with sugar, lime juice, vinegar, shallots, garlic and carrot. Nuoc mam, the concentrated version, accompanies most Vietnamese meals on one form or another. It is to the Vietnamese what soy sauce is to the Chinese. Vietnam's long coastline and the mighty Mekong River mean the country is well served for seafood and fish. At the dinner table, prawns come wrapped in rice rolls (cha gio), moulded on sugar cane sticks (chao tom), or battered and fried. Deep-fried soft-shelled crabs, which can be eaten whole, can be rolled in lettuce with fresh mint leaves and dipped in nuoc cham or chilli sauces. Adventurous palates are well served in Vietnam. Cobra, python, porcupine, frog and bats can be found in specialty restaurants. The Rex Hotel serves up sea slug with pig's trotters, while at the Seri Hotel in Bao Loc - a pretty town on the way to the Central Highlands  - underemployed waiters will bring you sea leech with deer's leg for about Pounds 1.30.</p>

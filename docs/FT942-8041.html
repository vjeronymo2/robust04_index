			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Corporate aid to charity declines Corporate support for charity has declined for the second successive year, according to research published today by Directory of Social Change, a leading voluntary sector publishing and training organisation. Tighter financial controls adopted during the recession are only part of the explanation. Researchers believe the drop in donations may reflect a trend for big companies to treat corporate community involvement as a more commercial activity. Many companies are ceasing to support charities unless they fit into community involvement strategies reflecting core business interests. Directory's research, published in its Corporate Citizen magazine, shows that charitable donations by British Petroleum - the UK's top corporate donor with Pounds 9m in 1992 - fell to Pounds 6.5m last year. Imperial Chemical Industries' donations were down from Pounds 3m to Pounds 1.2m. National Westminster Bank cut its donations from Pounds 2m to Pounds 1.5m, and Barclays Bank fell from Pounds 2m to Pounds 800,000 in three years. Although some donors increased their support, the overall trend was downwards. Directory says charities received almost Pounds 1m less from the top 16 companies with financial years ending last December, compared with the year before. The figures measure only financial support for charity. Staff secondments, provision of office space and equipment and other activities push up the total value considerably. A growing number of companies are adopting more focused community involvement polices which reflect their business interests - for example, insurance companies supporting crime-prevention charities. While such partnerships can benefit both corporate donors and the voluntary sector, they are likely to accentuate a decline in random charitable giving.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> MEDICAL CENTER PLAN FOR UCI APPROVED  </P> <P> A proposal for a medical research center on the UC Irvine campus will be  forwarded to Chancellor Jack W. Peltason after receiving unanimous approval  from the school's Academic Senate on Thursday.  </P> <P> The proposal, a one-page report written by a special committee appointed by the  Academic Senate last year, urges that "the highest priority be given to the  planning and implementation" of the research center.  </P> <P> An on-campus hospital has met with stiff community opposition, and in 1983 the  University of California regents ordered UCI to drop the plan. Community  concerns centered on the question of whether a new hospital on campus would  drain resources from UCI Medical Center in Orange, which serves many low-income  people, at a time when health-care options for the poor are shrinking.  </P> <P> But this time, administrators hope a change in the concept of the medical  facility and the support of the faculty will turn the tide in favor of the  project.  </P> <P> "I'm hoping that the climate is different because the proposal is fundamentally  different," said Dr. Walter Henry, vice chancellor of health sciences.  </P> <P> Supporters of the new plan don't even want to call their proposal a hospital,  saying that gives a false impression of what the facility would be. Instead,  they say the proposed On Campus Center for Health Sciences will deal primarily  with specialized care, such as Alzheimer's disease, and will not include an  emergency room.  </P> <P> An on-campus facility is also favored by faculty and students who must now  commute 40 minutes to the UCI Medical Center in Orange.  </P> <P> Edward Arquilla, a professor of pathology and chairman of the committee that  drafted the proposal, said that people who now need the highly specialized care  the proposed facility could provide must now drive to UCLA to receive it.  </P> <P> "In the past, the proposals have been to build a community hospital," Henry  said. "We're not proposing that."  </P> <P> Henry also emphasized that the new facility would not compete with UCI Medical  Center.  </P> <P> The proposal now goes to Peltason and to an adminstrative committee which  discusses priority projects at the university. Another resolution approved  Thursday calls for regular reports on the status of the proposal.  </P> <P> The vote came eight months after the a contentious debate in the Academic  Senate that ended with the establishment of a committee to study the issue.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By CRIME-PRESS correspondents Olga Semyonova, Larisa </F> Kislinskaya, and Yuriy Shcherban]    [Text] Moscow June 15 TASS -- The presidential anti-crime  decree of June 14 is important and very timely. It does not  infringe upon civil rights and curbs only the rights of criminal  groupings, a high-ranking Russian counterintelligence official  said.    In an interview with the CRIME-PRESS news agency on  Wednesday, Yevgeniy Sevostyanov, head of the counterintelligence  service in Moscow and the Moscow region, said that the decree  aims at protecting the population of Russia from organised  crime. "The adopted measures limit only the rights of the  members of criminal gangs and their direct accomplices."    Vasiliy Kuptsov, Moscow criminal police chief, said that the  measures could have been even tougher. "If the old law does not  provide adequate measurers against criminals, a new law is  needed," he said.    "We should have resorted to such measures earlier, then  there  would be no such orgy of crime and innocent victims of criminal  score settling," Kuptsov said.    "I believe such measures must be used also against other  people who are suspected of participation in criminal gangs or  serious crimes," he added.    This opinion was shared by Constitutional Court Judge Gadis  Gadzhiyev. He told CRIME-PRESS that as a means of fighting  crime the decree should have appeared three years ago. He  believes the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, and the  Federation Council, the upper house, must approve the decree as  soon as possible in order to avoid the unnecessary criticism of  the decree.</p>

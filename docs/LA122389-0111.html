			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'KINGFISH' ARRIVES WITH TEETH INTACT  </P> <P> Down, Kingfish. Don't kill the critics. There's a good boy.  </P> <P> We are discussing Marlane Meyer's "Kingfish," a comedy of perception. First  seen at the Los Angeles Theatre Center two seasons ago, it arrived Thursday  night at Joseph Papp's Public Group Theater, to negative reviews.  </P> <P> "Self-conscious absurdism," said the New York Times. "An old dog trying to  learn new tricks," said Newsday.  </P> <P> Nonsense. "Kingfish" is a wonderful play. Unless, of course, it merely  coincides with this reviewer's private obsessions. How would the world look if  we could get above ourselves?  </P> <P> The very question of the play. It is Meyer's opinion that in the world of the  human mind, there is very little there. Things are what we agree to call them  and we make some bizarre agreements, from which real-world consequences flow,  and sometimes blood as well.  </P> <P> Rather a timely point for a play to make as the truths of the Cold War get  revised. "Kingfish" is not, however, a preachment. It's a shaggy-dog story, or  rather a shaggy-box story.  </P> <P> Again Buck Henry plays, to fussy perfection, a lonely bachelor whose best  friend in the whole world is a Doberman named Kingfish. All that we see is a  black box about the size of a television set with a green slash on one end for  teeth, but to Henry it's a true killer-dog, and the play demonstrates how such  a fiction can become a fact when it is to the interest of enough people to buy  into it.  </P> <P> "Harvey" made the same point in another way, and, "Kingfish" offers some of the  same theatrical fun, updated to the style of the 1980s, for those not so on  their high horse that they can't see it. Baleful as it sounds, the play is a  comedy, a point not forgotten by David Schweizer's cast, including David  Schweizer.  </P> <P> Once more he perches above the black-box set on a light bridge, reading aloud  the stage directions while a colleague, Arthur Hanket, throws Kingfish his  barks and growls.  </P> <P> "Why?" somebody wanted to know at intermission. Because it works. Also, I  imagine, to stress the idea that "Kingfish" is a story about the boxes that  people perform their lives in. What's on-the-nose about this off-the-wall story  is the sense that its characters, like Chekhov characters, are stuck in  separate mental compartments, although nominally sharing the same plot. They  seem to have signed a mutual nonaggression pact: I won't test your reality if  you don't test mine.  </P> <P> When someone does test someone else's reality -- when it is suggested that  perhaps Kingfish is only a barking box -- someone has to pay for his  impertinence. Truth in "Kingfish" is a punishable offense.  </P> <P> Abstract as it may sound, Meyer's characters do live in their version of the  real world. Jacque Lynn Colton is again the randy practical nurse. Tony  Abatemarco is the dog trainer (real dogs). Barry Sherman is the hustler -- less  eerie than the late Merritt Buttrick at LATC, but just as hysterical. Kevin  O'Rourke is the CIA agent -- Ollie North, where Sam Anderson gave us John Wayne  at LATC.  </P> <P> Henry takes the last two men to live with him, as his "sons." (Another  lietmotif of the play is "family.") Will the boys inherit his money, or will  Colton and Abatemarco, or will Kingfish? Or will he die at all? The situation  is clear-cut and the ending not to be taken literally. But we get the message.  Ideas in this play don't just have legs. They have teeth.  </P></p>

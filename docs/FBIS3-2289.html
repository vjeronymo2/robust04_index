			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 5 (CNA) -- The ceiling on total  foreign investment in the Taiwan Stock Market will be raised to  US$10 billion starting next Monday [5 March], the Central Bank  of China (CBC) announced Saturday.    "The move signifies our commitment to promote financial  liberalization and internationalization," CBC Deputy Governor Yu  Cheng told a news conference.    Yu explained that the ceiling on investment by foreign  financial institutions will be raised from the current US$5  billion to US$7.5 billion. In addition, Yu said, four local  securities investment trust companies will be allowed to issue  mutual funds abroad to raise a maximum of US$2.5 billion for  investment in the local bourse.    China Securities Investment Trust Corp., International  Investment Trust Co., Kwang Hua Securities Investment and Trust  Co. and National Investment Trust Co. have been authorized to  issue mutual funds abroad.    The central bank has approved US$4.7 billion in foreign  investment in the local stock market, and some US$3.4 billion of  the amount has actually been remitted here.    Asked whether the central bank will further raise the  foreign  investment ceiling, Yu said it will depend on the domestic  financial situation and the speed of foreign remittances.    An influx of foreign capital in the local stock market  during  the final quarter of last year helped push Taiwan's balance of  payments into the black. Taiwan registered a surplus of US$1.45  billion in its 1993 balance of payments, compared with a deficit  of US$600 million in 1992.    Nevertheless, the central bank has been very cautious in  raising the capital inflow ceiling for fear of fueling inflation  and appreciation of the new Taiwan dollar.    CBC Governor Samuel Shieh said last week that the Central  Bank will ease restrictions on capital inflow in a "gradual  manner" with a view to maintaining domestic financial stability.</p>

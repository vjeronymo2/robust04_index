			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Tate &amp; Lyle in Pounds 36m Mexican investment Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar and sweeteners group, yesterday announced a Dollars 56m (Pounds 35.8m) investment in Grupo Industrial Azucarero de Occidente, Mexico's fifth largest sugar group. The UK company is buying a 49 per cent stake from the Saenz family, whose trusts will continue to own the remaining majority share. The Mexican company, also known as the Saenz Group, recorded turnover of some Pounds 89.1m for the 10 months to October 31, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.6m. Net assets stood at Pounds 69.3m. Saenz has an estimated 7 per cent of the Mexican sweetener market, which produces approximately 4m tonnes a year. The top five sugar processors in Mexico account for about 60 per cent of total Mexican output and 64 per cent of refined sugar production. Tate &amp; Lyle said that Saenz's operation of two mills in the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas and one in Jalisco, gave quick access to the growing markets in Guadalajara, Monterrey and northern Mexico. It added that the investment would enable the group to play a part in the fast expanding soft drinks market in Mexico. Strong demand was also expected from the food processing and retail grocery markets. The move was part of the company's strategy of expanding into emerging markets through joint ventures and partnerships.</p>

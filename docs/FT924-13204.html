			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Panic claims breakthrough after Kosovo talks MR Milan Panic, the Yugoslav prime minister, yesterday claimed he had made a breakthrough with ethnic Albanian leaders in the Serbian province of Kosovo after pledging to abolish discriminatory legislation. 'We have to democratise the system ..on the long road towards establishing democracy in Kosovo, we have made the most important steps,' said Mr Panic in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, after talks with Mr Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority. 'Mr Panic has agreed to lift all discriminatory laws and I am grateful for that,' said Mr Rugova. The prime minister's visit followed clashes this week between Serbian riot police and thousands of Albanians demanding the reopening of Albanian language schools and universities closed by the Serbian authorities. If Mr Panic succeeds in brokering a peace between the region's radicalised Serbs and its Albanians, he will have scored an important victory in his struggle with Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic. Kosovo's Serbs, who comprise just 8 per cent of Kosovo's 2.1m population, mistrust Mr Panic. They revere Mr Milosevic for bringing the province under direct rule by Belgrade three years ago, when he stripped Kosovo of its autonomy, dissolved the parliament, and discontinued Albanian language media. While Mr Panic has to convince Serbs of his nationalist credentials, he faces an equal challenge in persuading Albanian political leaders to accept being part of a country they have renounced. He must prove he can deliver on his pledge to democratise a province under virtual apartheid. Albanians have boycotted state education, attending underground schools, and rejecting curriculum foisted on them by Belgrade. The threat of war in Kosovo, after the death and destruction in neighbouring Bosnia, may strengthen Mr Panic's hand. It may steer Serbs and Albanians into reaching a compromise. Even Kosovo's Serbs, who control the province's state enterprises, have been hard hit by the war and United Nations' sanctions against Yugoslavia. Britain yesterday despatched a first party of Germany-based troops to Bosnia and fended off criticism by Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN mediator, about the time taken deploying forces to help UN relief efforts, writes David White, Defence Correspondent. The UK contingent, the largest among the forces assigned to the UN Protection Force II, is being increased by a third from initial plans announced a month ago, to 2,400. This will include 400 engineers sent to set up accommodation, water supplies and sanitation. Britain has to change its initial plans for escorting aid convoys in order to avoid crossing ethnic boundaries. Its force, to be fully deployed by November 13, will have its main logistics centre at the port of Split, with a battalion base at Vitez, northwest of Sarajevo. The new UN force includes French, Canadian and Spanish units. The leader of Bosnia's Serbs, Mr Radovan Karadzic, said yesterday he would return home from Geneva this weekend to persuade his forces to hand over their aircraft to United Nations monitors. Mr Karadzic spoke after Major-General Zivomir Ninkovic, head of the rebel Serb air force, refused to honour an agreement made in Geneva by Mr Karadzic after he came under intense pressure from peace mediator Lord Owen.</p>

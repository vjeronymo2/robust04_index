			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei softens as yen climbs against US currency Investors remained sidelined as the yen rose to the Y97 level against the dollar and the Nikkei 225 average lost ground on small-lot arbitrage selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index closed 11.00 off at 19,958.29 after a day's high of 20,055.41 and low of 19,907.68. Arbitrage buying supported shares in the morning, pushing the index above 20,000, but unwinding of long positions later depressed the index. Volume came to 200m shares, against Friday's 397m. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 6.62 to 1,586.46 and the Nikkei 300 shed 1.38 to 289.89. Losers led gainers by 508 to 451, with 195 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.08 to 1,300.35. The dollar fell below Y98 for the first time since September 26, depressing investor confidence. While traders said the currency movements failed to prompt heavy selling, sentiment remained subdued. The US currency was later supported by intervention from the Bank of Japan. Electricals were lower, with NEC down Y30 to Y1,230 and Sony losing Y20 at Y5,950. Foreign selling depressed Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, with the shares falling Y300 to Y5,030. Some investors took profits on steels and chemicals which were higher last week on buying by overseas investors. Mitsubishi Chemical and Kawasaki Steel dipped Y3 apiece to Y580 and Y445 respectively. However, Nippon Steel moved up Y1 to Y389 and Ube Industries Y6 to Y430. Sumitomo Metal Mining, the most active issue of the day, advanced Y16 to Y995 as speculation that a leading US hedge fund was purchasing gold prompted individual and dealer buying. Japan Telecom declined Y10,000 to Y3.89m and East Japan Railway receded Y1,000 to Y483,000, but Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose for the fifth consecutive day, by Y7,000 to Y893,000. Textiles gained ground, with Toho Rayon adding Y13 at Y460 and Mitsubishi Rayon Y5 at Y458. In Osaka, the OSE average eased 38.78 to 22,309.84 in volume of 17.6m shares. Nippon Shoji fell by its daily limit of Y100 to Y896. Investors sold the issue after the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, the securities industry watchdog, filed a charge with the Osaka district prosecutors office last week for alleged insider trading by 32 of the company's employees. Roundup Mixed performances were seen in the Pacific Basin region. SEOUL continued its forward momentum in brisk trade, the composite index ending at a record closing high of 1,109.87, up 13.39 or 1.2 per cent. Brokers commented that a number of positive factors were influencing investors at present, including prospects for high economic growth and good company earnings. TAIPEI was also firmer, led by rises in the food sector, but the weighted index finished off the day's high, up 35.77 or 0.5 per cent at 6,731.23. The session's peak was 6,778.34. Turnover totalled TDollars 79.06bn. In the food sector, President Enterprises went the day's limit up to TDollars 56 on hopes that the company would make a TDollars 5.5bn to TDollars 6.2bn profit by selling its stake in affiliate President Chain Store. MANILA was supported by property issues and the composite index added 1.7 per cent at 3,050.14. Some brokers observed that investors seemed to be targeting large manufacturing companies such as Petron and San Miguel. Turnover amounted to 2bn pesos. SYDNEY was firmer, although bond weakness dampened sentiment. The All Ordinaries index was finally up 8.2 at 2,014.2 after touching 2,024.4. Among the day's leading performers, BHP advanced 24 cents to ADollars 20 and News Corporation moved ahead 13 cents to ADollars 8.38. HONG KONG finished just off the day's lows in reaction to a weak dollar and continuing concern over the health of China's leader Deng Xiaoping. The Hang Seng index retreated 94.99 to 9,455.94. The H-share index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong fell by 3.2 per cent, on the back of a drop in Shanghai A shares. SHANGHAI's A share index fell 50.54 or 7.5 per cent to 627.55 after a local Communist party newspaper voiced sharp criticism of the media for irresponsible reporting on the market, brokers said. Brokers added that the index also fell on fears of a flood of so-called 'legal person' shares, prompted by an exchange announcement that Zibo Investment Fund would list a portion of its institutionally owned units on November 4. They will be the first institutional securities on the market. Most shares in Chinese listed companies are owned by institutions and are not traded. KUALA LUMPUR gave up early gains to close lower as the market's consolidation and lack of foreign demand kept a lid on prices. The composite index eased 2.33 to 1,126.12 in volume of 307.07m shares. Hong Leong Bank made a striking debut, closing at MDollars 8.75 to give the stock a MDollars 5.45 premium. Amalgamated Industrial, the steel products maker, hit the 30 per cent limit-up in the morning at MDollars 5.70 before the company asked for a suspension in the afternoon trade. BOMBAY was lower on sustained selling pressure which left the BSE 30-share index 21.00 down at 4,365.43.</p>

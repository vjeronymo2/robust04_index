			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Society receipts fall BUILDING SOCIETY receipts fell to Pounds 543m in March from Pounds 608m in February, mainly because investors withdrew funds to apply for electricity shares. However, mortgage advances rose sharply to Pounds 3.356bn from Pounds 2.681bn in February as falling interest rates spurred homebuying. Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association, predicted that lending would continue to pick up in the coming months.</p>

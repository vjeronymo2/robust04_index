			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: NFC As the market was quick to appreciate yesterday, NFC will receive a boost if the disposal of its waste management business goes ahead at the indicated price of around Pounds 100m. Although the rubbish market has become highly fashionable of late, NFC would have to invest heavily to ensure its subsidiary's continued success. Its money could be better spent expanding its core distribution businesses. A gearing ratio of 55 per cent currently constrains these ambitions. This disposal would restore its flexibility by halving net debt. Whether Wessex Water and the US-based Waste Management are as wise to contemplate paying such a hefty sum is another matter. The mooted price represents a spectacular premium for a business which may make profits of less than Pounds 4m this year. The worry is that Wessex Water will overpay in its determination to expand into areas which escape the industry regulator's gaze - although Waste Management's record suggests it would temper any such impulse. Nevertheless, water companies are still struggling to prove the value of diversification. Certainly, Severn Trent's purchase of the Biffa waste business has yet to prove its worth.</p>

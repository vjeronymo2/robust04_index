			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: A pleasant surprise for NZ wool growers - An upturn in sales and prices that has lifted the gloom in the industry THERE HAS been a sharp and unexpected turnround in the fortunes of New Zealand's wool farmers. Wool fetched the highest prices at auction for 18 months last week, thanks to a shortfall in supply, a rise in overseas demand and a sharply lower Kiwi dollar. The market indicator was 494 cents (153p) - 25 per cent up from early last month. Each sale has seen another sharp rise, and this is beginning to worry exporters, who feel this trend, if it continues, will frighten off buyers. At recent sales buyers from all main markets, Western Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the Far East, were active and the market was supported by locally-based exporters who had entered into contracts some time ago and now had to fulfil them. The indicator was set at 391 cents on December 5 and rose to 428 on January 23, 450 cents on February 5 to 462 cents on February 15 and 494 cents on February 20. That was the highest price since August 1990, when farmers received price support payments from the wool board. Last week's sale was the first occassion since then that farmers had received more than the Dollars 4.85 a kilogram that the board guaranteed. The sustained rise in prices has taken the industry by surprise: in November it was widely predicted by industry analysts that the indicator would slip back to 370 when the bulk of the crossbred clip came on the market. By historic standards, however, wool is still inexpensive, especially in overseas currency terms, given the 15 per cent devaluation of the New Zealand dollar over the past 18 months and the much higher prices of the mid-1980s. The Wool Board analysts say that the recent rise may still not be sufficient to halt the drift of farmers out of sheep and into beef production, where returns are better. Even with the latest rise, the average sheep farm will still only earn an average NZDollars 24,000, out of which they have to pay tax, make debt repayments and provide for operational drawings. But the industry is encouraged that international customers are paying as much as they are for the clip, which is being bolstered by the sale this season of 150,000 bales from the Wool Board stockpile. So far this season the board has sold 82,000 bales, leaving its holdings at 476,000 bales, which it intends to dispose of over the next three years. The forced sale follows the board's decision last January no longer to attempt to support the market, and to make an orderly withdrawal. This means that international buyers must be found for all the wool New Zealand can produce this season, plus a share of the stockpile. Pessimists believed this would pose severe price difficulties, especially when the bulk of the crossbred wool, which makes up about 70 per cent of all New Zealand production, became available from November. The industry is heartened by the strong demand, with export sales up 31 per cent in the first half of the season, although on an annual basis the increase is 17 per cent. Several unexpected factors boosted demand. One was a substantial drop in the value of the New Zealand dollar, which has fallen 4 per cent against a trade weighted basket of currencies from early December, on top of a 10 per cent devaluation in 1990. This has made quality New Zealand wools price-competitive against synthetics. Another factor is a change in shearing patterns. Because of the low returns many farmers appear to be shearing every 12 months instead of eight months previously. This is being reflected by smaller than expected offerings at most recent auctions, forcing buyers to pay more. Also China has re-entered the market with vigour. Its purchases so far this season are up 290 per cent. The Chinese are buying for their own consumption, especially hand knitting wools, which are sold in 500 gram hanks to peasants who knit cardigans and jerseys for the cold winters. The Chinese are major buyers of lambs' and medium wools, and prices for these types have been very firm. However the Wool Board believes that the Chinese demand may not be sustained, as there are fears that the strong domestic recovery may falter. So far this season they have bought 25,600 clean tonnes, about a quarter of all exports. Demand from India for crossbred wool, used in carpet making, which accounts for the bulk of New Zealand production, picked up sharply this month. This followed the New Delhi government's decision to waive the 150 per cent import licence fee for this type of wool in a bid to encourage carpet exports. The imposition of this tax, originally at 200 per cent, had hit sales of New Zealand wools to India badly. Last season India bought 16,000 tonnes of wool, making it New Zealand's fourth largest customer. In the first six months of this season it bought only 4,000 tonnes, because of the import fee, but exporters believe the Indians will continue to buy large quantities over the remainder of the season as they attempt to rebuild stocks. It is expected that they will buy a total 12,000 tonnes this season. An unexpectedly strong demand has come from Nepal, which is finding keen buyers for its hand-knitted carpets in western Europe, particularly Germany. Turkey, which is mounting an export drive partly based on machine-made carpets, has also increased its purchases sharply. Exports to the Commonwealth of Independent States have been minimal in recent months because of political and foreign currency problems. In the early part of the season former Soviet republics bought 4,000 tonnes under a credit arrangement that is now exhausted. The Soviet Union for many years was one of New Zealand's biggest wool customers, but the New Zealand Wool Board's research group manager, Roger Buchanan says that significant shipments to the CIS are unlikely in the short term, and the sales of about 27,000 tonnes a year to the former Soviet territories were a 'thing of the past'. Wool exports to Belgium rose by 43 per cent and to Germany by 33 per cent, although the total shipped to Europe this season is expected to be unchanged because of deep recession in other European Community countries, which cutting demand for carpets. Exports to the UK, for example, fell 22 per cent. The US bought 15 per cent more but Japan 14 per cent less, although both are expected to increase purchases in the second half of the season. Wool Board figures show exports for the first half of the season totalled 109,500 clean tonnes, up from 83,600 for the same period last season. The value of exports rose 9 per cent to NZDollars 538m, up from NZDollars 491m.</p>

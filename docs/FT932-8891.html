			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Bank may use new measure of money THE BANK of England is considering a change to its way of measuring monetary growth in the economy following widespread dissatisfaction with existing measures of the money supply. An article in the Bank's quarterly bulletin, published tomorrow, concludes that a 'divisia' measure of money might have a closer relationship with total expenditure in the economy than conventional monetary aggregates. A divisia index weights each of its components - such as cash and bank and building society deposits - according to the extent to which they represent money for spending rather than saving. Existing money supply measures simply add together the components without weighting. The article points out that if the weights reflect the ease and cost with which money - cash, low-interest deposits or high-interest deposits - can be used for spending, the index will be more closely related to total expenditure. Broad money supply measures have been criticised for their failure to provide a reliable indicator of the relationship between the level of money in the economy and future inflation. In spite of doubts about the accuracy of broad monetary aggregates, the government reintroduced a monitoring range for M4 - notes and coins in circulation plus bank and building society deposits - in October last year as part of its strategy to control inflation following Britain's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism. The monitor range for M4 is 3-9 per cent. The government also watches M0, mainly notes and coins in circulation, which has a monitor range of 0-4 per cent. The Bank says that treating cash in the same way as interest-bearing deposits is probably misleading. A divisia index, with weighted components, would 'provide a measure of the total quantity of money held in the economy for transaction purposes as opposed to savings purposes'. The government should not hesitate to cut interest rates again if recession in continental Europe starts to threaten the UK's recovery, according to Oxford Economic Forecasting, the UK consultancy. Its latest assessment of economic prospects, published today, says GDP will grow by 1.7 per cent this year and 2.9 per cent next year. It says fiscal policy should be tightened immediately to create room for lower interest rates as those on the Continent come down. Tax increases set out in the March Budget did not go far enough, OEF says.</p>

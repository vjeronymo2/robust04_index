			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Granada If Granada's problems have not proved as great as feared, its recovery has also been swifter than expected. Since his arrival as chief executive just over a year ago, Mr Gerry Robinson, dismissed as a mere caterer by television professionals, has helped lift Granada's shares by more than 80 per cent, adding some Pounds 600m to its market value in the process. Shedding 8 per cent of the company's workforce (with yet more to come) and ruthlessly squeezing cash has worked financial wonders. So have ingenious schemes to tickle growth from mature rental and television businesses - as yesterday's 129 per cent profits improvement on near static sales amply illustrates. A Pounds 21m turnround at the troubled computer services business also helped. But Granada is still struggling back to first base. Profits remain Pounds 34m adrift of what they were three years ago and with the benefits of the bounce fading, the question looms of what rate of growth Granada can now sustain. The market was impressed by the revitalised potential of the computer business and Granada's ability to milk cash from motorway service sites and TV rental shops, even in recession. Further out, Granada's BSkyB stake adds extra spice and some acquisitive growth can be expected to kick in. But moving from cutting to growing mode can prove difficult. A forward rating of 15 allows for little pause for consolidation.</p>

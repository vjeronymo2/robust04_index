			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Councils' reporting rules may change LOCAL AUTHORITIES will be required to maintain registers of all their fixed assets for the first time under sweeping new reporting rules proposed by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. In guidelines circulated this week, the institute calls for an accounting system that shows most fixed assets in councils' balance sheets at current cost. The system would require all authorities to identify the assets they hold and have them regularly revalued, at least every five years. The proposals are open to consultation until April 19 and are expected to be endorsed by the Accounting Standards Board this summer. They would become mandatory for the 1994-95 financial year. Mr John Scotford, treasurer of Hampshire county council and chairman of the institute committee which produced the proposals, said: 'The capital side of local authority accounting just doesn't stand up to any kind of examination. It does not attempt to show their worth or how they use their assets.' Local authorities have traditionally presented their accounts with the emphasis on how assets are financed. They have long resisted the move towards capital accounting primarily because of fears about the costs of changing their systems. The institute estimates that the one-off cost of change would be Pounds 7m across England, Wales and Scotland, while further revaluations would amount to Pounds 1m each year. The new standards are an essential step in extending contracting-out of local authority work to white-collar services. Town hall functions such as architecture, planning and local tax collection could be contracted out under legislation passed before the general election. These functions cannot be subject to competitive tendering until councils have introduced internal trading accounts which make costs more transparent. Sharing overheads between different functions and the valuation of fixed assets will be central. The value of the assets has a further importance to the in-house team if they are bidding against outside contractors for their work. With services already subject to competitive compulsory tendering, the in-house team must make a 5 per cent return on capital employed.</p>

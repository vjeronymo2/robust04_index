			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Compass It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, in stock market terms at least, Compass is a business whose moment has gone. The Pounds 72m acquisition of SAS's catering arm is an attractive enough deal and will enhance earnings. The trouble is that at this point in the cycle contract catering looks a trifle dull. Likely earnings growth in single figures and a sub-market yield represent meagre attractions. Compass must hope that disillusion with the financial constraints facing many recovery stocks will encourage investors to return to its steadier virtues. Such concerns will not be lost on Gardner Merchant as it contemplates its eventual market debut.</p>

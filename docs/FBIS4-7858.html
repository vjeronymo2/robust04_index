			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Janina Paradowska: "A New Bermuda Triangle; </F> President, Prime Minister, Chairman"]    [Text] Without a doubt, Aleksander Kwasniewski,  fleeing from journalists by going down a ladder from a window,  has become the political hit of the past few days. In the past,  there was talk about Professor Geremek to the effect that, when  he is on the stairs, you never know whether he is going up or  down the stairs. This time, there was no such dilemma:  Kwasniewski was obviously going down the ladder. Does his  going down have a symbolic meaning?    If one takes a look at political events of the past few  weeks, one comes to the conclusion that, apart from the  confusion (which in fact should not be taking place because a  coalition is in power that has such an enormous majority that  definitely no other coalition will have this type of majority in  the years to come), there are a lot of other things as well. A  few pieces are emerging that compose quite a definite picture.  And the picture is not that new, by the way.    It was clear from the beginning of the coalition consisting  of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] and the Polish Peasant  Party [PSL] that it is based on a lack of mutual confidence by  the partners, and that acting in a way that would avoid  deepening this lack of confidence will be one of the most  significant problems. I dare say that nothing positive has been  accomplished in that regard, but, instead, a lot has been done  to increase the lack of confidence. Everyone is terribly excited  about the president's refusing to appoint Dariusz Rosati deputy  prime minister and finance minister, whereas I am surprised that  Mr. Rosati wanted to be a candidate at all, after Prime Minister  Pawlak reordered his office (an hour before going to the  Belweder) by dismissing Witold Modzelewski of the Finance  Ministry and appointing Mr. Jan Kubik of the PSL in such a hurry  that the person concerned was not even notified. I can see no  difference of merit between the situation that forced Marek  Borowski to make his dramatic resignation and what happened  recently. Back then, a deputy minister was dismissed behind the  minister's back, whereas this time the changes were even more  wide-ranging. This fact contradicts, of course, a popular  theory that the president and the prime minister had a deal in  Rosati's case. If they did indeed have a deal, what would be  the goal of the prime minister (who usually procrastinates in  signing various nominations) signing whatever came across his  desk? The only goal was that he was rather sure of the  nomination, and he wanted to have his own man in the Finance  Ministry, who would take care of the PSL's interests, not just  in the sense of party interests but also--let us be fair--the  interests of the countryside electorate.    Peasant activists were not thrilled at all by the fact that  a  large part of low-interest credits (established within the "1  Million Per Hectare" program) found themselves in Warsaw banks,  where farmers tend not to do business. They were also not very  happy about the fact that the candidate for deputy prime  minister for economic affairs has not even met the PSL  Parliamentary Club, despite the fact that the club asked for  such a meeting. Rosati is definitely an excellent candidate for  both posts for which he was chosen, but the way his candidacy  was dealt with tends to shed a rather miserable light on  politicians of the party that promoted Rosati.    It is clear that a few lessons from the past were forgotten  in all of this. Aleksander Kwasniewski, who studies the history  of the Citizens Parliamentary Club so diligently, so as to  prevent it from repeating itself with regard to his own Sejm  deputies club, somehow ignored the past case of Jaroslaw  Kaczynski, who was the "main player" while the Jan Olszewski  government was being formed. The main player soon became the  prime minister's petitioner. It is a strange thing that the  prime minister's post continues to be underestimated in Poland  for some reason, despite the fact that it is the prime minister  who has the instruments to exercise real power. After the  PSL-SLD coalition was formed, it was not before the crisis  associated with Marek Borowski's resignation that it was  determined who really is the prime minister. From that moment  on, it was clear that it is Waldemar Pawlak who is the prime  minister. So, what should have been done was to reconsider once  again the principles of cooperation within the coalition, and to  put government and coalition ranks in order. But not a lot was  done in that regard. An agreement has not been reached on ways  of handling personnel changes, witness the case of Zbigniew  Siemiatkowski, whose road to a post in the Defense Ministry  [MON] has been so long and winding that one is entitled to feel  that the road must indeed span the globe.    More importantly, an agreement has not been reached on  program-related issues, either. In all of his recent  interviews, Aleksander Kwasniewski emphasized that the previous  crisis resulted in the budget no longer being nobody's budget  and becoming instead the budget of Prime Minister Pawlak's  government. That is true. But we still do not know whether  privatization is a completely private business of Minister  Wieslaw Kaczmarek, especially given that, during debates on a  draft of a privatization statute, quite clear differences of  opinion emerged between Minister Podkanski (PSL) and Minister  Pol of the Union of Labor on the one hand, and the Ownership  Transformations Ministry's chief, who is from the SLD, on the  other. It is not known whether the whole concept of changes in  the so-called civil service, which was drafted by the Council of  Minister's Office (and whose effect is making civil service  political to the maximum extent possible), is Minister Strak's  (PSL) business, or, alternatively, whether it is the coalition  that is behind the concept and now supports it. If the latter  is the case, the so-called coalition agreement concerning  officials' professionalism and nonpolitical nature should go in  the waste basket, and for good. These are some examples off the  top of my head, which does not mean they are unimportant. Both  problems pertain to the country's political system.    For many weeks, the coalition held sessions, they decided on  who-knows-what, but nothing practical came out of it anyway,  apart from headlines in the press announcing that Siemiatkowski  will take his MON post the next day, while the prime minister  will present the president with his candidate for deputy prime  minister and finance minister the day after that. But, in fact,  the prime minister (in his usual style) temporized with the  signing of the nominations, and he procrastinated with  presenting his own candidate. There was unofficial talk that an  intentional humiliation of Aleksander Kwasniewski was taking  place. It must be true that right now, the SLD insists on  Rosati's candidacy (which misfired, it can now be said) in order  to humiliate the prime minister, who does not look unhappy at  all about the president's decision (Minister Strak, for  instance, was kind enough to have made several public statements  to the effect that a lack of finance minister brings no harm to  the country's economy). But it is beyond any doubt that Prime  Minister Pawlak is in a tough situation because he clearly does  not want to see a war with President Walesa. By the way, that  is no surprise--if you have a coalition partner who has more  votes in the Sejm, you still need another ally even if you  cannot trust him, either. It is always more convenient to have  two solutions rather than to be against the wall all of the time.    Waldemar Pawlak experienced being against the wall before he  was prime minister. But once he became the government's chief,  he could see no reason for that to continue. Still, a question  must be asked: Where is the endurance limit of the SLD ally,  the kind of limit that, once crossed, will make the SLD say:  "Enough," which can mean only one thing: the SLD leaving the  coalition. At that point, Waldemar Pawlak, as chief of a  minority government, even if it enjoys the Belweder's support,  will become Aleksander Kwasniewski's petitioner because he will  have to make efforts to gain Kwasniewski's support when it comes  time to enact laws indispensable for the functioning of the  country and its economy. It seems that that is about time the  prime minister will ask himself that question in no uncertain  terms. A further weakening of the coalition (which is extremely  fragile to begin with) is not in the interest of the government,  not to mention the country's interests. Incidentally, when it  comes to the country, it seems that politicians have completely  forgotten about it, while being preoccupied with their maneuvers  in the upper echelons. Aleksander Kwasniewski should also ask  himself a question like that. Getting the prime minister  involved in a war with the president will eventually not turn  out to the government's advantage.    Because of his rejection of Dariusz Rosati's candidacy,  President Lech Walesa received an enormous amount of criticism;  Walesa is blamed for a continuous destabilization of the  situation. It is said that Walesa's measures are associated  with the beginning of the presidential campaign, which the  president just launched. The truth is that a great many  politicians have already joined the campaign, while the  president himself has been taking part in it for some time now.  In my view, the point is not about the campaign but about the  president having always taken advantage of disagreements among  politicians in order to gain something for himself. Everyone  can see what the president is like, and he cannot be changed. I  would be surprised if the president, while seeing so many cracks  and disagreements in the coalition, did not try to maneuver them  somehow, although, when it comes to the Rosati case, Walesa's  success is dubious, unless his intention was to have everyone,  from Bugaj to Hall, unite against him; this is what indeed  happened. But, if the intention was to get rid of another  serious candidate for finance minister--Leslaw Paga--the  president succeeded in that marvelously.    So I am not surprised with Lech Walesa's actions. What he  will do about the budget will be a test of his real intentions.  If he refuses to sign, which I doubt, I will regard the  president as having acted against the reforms and having  destabilized the economic situation for the first time. So far,  he has signed a law on compensatory payments, even though he  raised serious reservations. These reservations are reasonable  from an economic standpoint. Using equally rational  argumentation, he refused to sign a neo-popiwek  [wage-controlling] law, which is a legislative little monster,  having no chance of defending itself before the Constitutional  Tribunal (possibility of introducing taxes through an ordinance  by the Council of Ministers.) The president's refusal to sign  the law may cause trade unions to be grateful to him, in  addition to employees of big plants, and opposition members both  in parliament and outside of it. So the neo-popiwek law was  undoubtedly the coalition's gift to Lech Walesa. Therefore,  there is no reason to constantly repeat the same scenario over  and over again: The president says "No" in a situation, and he  has a right to that, while the SLD immediately makes noise about  limiting the president's constitutional powers. Spur of the  moment tinkering with the Small Constitution is one of the worst  possible ideas. Why does the Sejm simply not get down to work,  prepare a draft of a constitution, and submit it to a  referendum? If we keep announcing changes in the Constitution  with every small conflict among politicians (this is not a  conflict between the coalition and the president, but between  the SLD and the president), we will lead Polish democracy  astray, from where it will be hard to return. We had quite a  start: Two Sejms whose terms ended ahead of schedule, and  constant predictions--coming from different corners, by the  way--that this particular Sejm will not survive the full term,  either.    So, instead of the ever-nervous atmosphere, which,  unfortunately, is being created by all of the parties to those  disputes, and instead of spectacular escapes using a ladder and  insisting on a candidate who, as can be seen, is not desired a  great deal by either the prime minister or the president, I  would expect some reserve scenarios and talks among political  elites before the damage is done, not afterwards. Sejm Speaker  Jozef Oleksy has suggested to the president that regular summit  meetings be held. Lech Walesa should respond positively to that  proposal. Otherwise, the president-prime minister-chairman of  the biggest parliamentary club arrangement will indeed turn into  a Bermuda Triangle, in which Polish politics will get stuck  completely, while being incapable of solving the real problems  and concentrating instead on various maneuvers and  ambition-driven games.    What is the legacy of the recent crises so far? It is the  lack of a director of economic policies and a future weakening  of the finance minister's position. Whoever becomes the next  finance minister will not have the position Marek Borowski used  to enjoy in the government. What does a weak finance minister  mean in our situation? It is better not to even think. Another  legacy is the loss of popularity and social confidence by  politicians of the governing camp. Jacek Kuron again leads in  the popularity polls.    And so we have a situation that resembles something out of  the strangest dream. The opposition practically does not exist,  while concentrating mainly on debates on what it means to be an  opposition, while the government's performance is declining. It  is indeed quite a difficult thing to do--to so effectively  disorganize a coalition like this.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: The Met as it might have been - Susan Moore finds the refurbished galleries doing a traditional job The greatest compliment that can be paid to the design of a picture gallery is to realise that one soon ignores it. Such is the success of the new 19th century European paintings and sculpture galleries at the Metropolitan Museum in New York that the visitor presumes this is more or less how they originally looked. The pleasing proportions and restrained decoration of the Beaux-Arts classicism, the coherent layout of the galleries and their sympathetic lighting, are all taken for granted. It is the works of art that compel our attention. The Met's latest refurbishment is worthy of a new chapter in the history of museology because it is not a straightforward exercise in the restoration of period rooms, as seen in, say, the National Gallery of Scotland. Since the opening of its permanent galleries in 1880, the Met has been in a state of perpetual reconstruction. These new galleries were fashioned out of a 1970s glass and limestone shed of an extension the size of a football pitch. They were conceived to look as though designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White - the architects of the Fifth Avenue facade - at the turn of the century. We are presented with picture galleries as they might have been but never were. David Harvey, the museum's senior exhibition designer, working with the curator, Gary Tinterow, and the Philadelphia architect, Alvin Holm, has played it straight. The classical language of architecture is employed literately and without apology - and without any tiresome Post Modernist distortion of detail. The historicism is particularly appropriate given that most Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art was intended for Beaux-Arts interiors. Nonetheless, the design betrays the defeatism - or is it pragmatism? - of our age. It effectively concedes that for non-contemporary art the sculpture and picture galleries of Soane and Schinkel cannot be bettered. Certainly the state-of-the-art former installation was found sadly wanting after only a decade. In the spirit of the Beaubourg, it offered a vast, bright, open-plan space studded with 'flexible' star-shaped screens that provided a confusing multiplicity of vistas and proved too cumbersome to move. Not least of the merits of reverting to traditional galleries is that wall space is increased by 30 per cent. Significantly, it was the Met's curatorial team, and the collection itself, that determined the design, size and disposition of the galleries. Presumably its director and trustees were wary of vesting absolute power in the relatively new breed of superstar architects who have been allowed to impose their vision on museum design regardless of the works of art within. There is none of the visual belligerence that characterises, say, Gae Aulenti's Musee D'Orsay in Paris or James Stirling's Clore Gallery in London which sets superb Turners in an airport lounge. The 200ft by 120ft space has been divided into a sequence of 21 galleries. To the south runs a main corridor which, with a nod to the Louvre's Grande Galerie, has been widened to display large Salon paintings and 19th century sculpture. From there one moves into galleries devoted to neo-Classicisim, Romanticism and the Barbizon painters and on to galleries whose wall space is tailor-made for the museum's holdings of individual artists. Thus intimate spaces are provided for Degas pastels and Degas sculpture while the central double square is given over to a bravura display of Manet. One is made aware throughout of the generosity of the museum's great benefactors, from HO and Louisine Havemeyer, Degas's first American patrons, to the Hon Walter H. Annenberg and Mrs Annenberg who contributed nearly half of the new galleries' Dollars 11-12m construction costs. The decision by the much-courted Annenbergs to bequeath their superb collection to the Met in 1990, made after seeing the model of the new galleries, reveals how important the presentation of works of art has become in museum politics. The collection was widely believed to be going to Philadelphia. The promised Annenberg bequest of 53 works of art, a great coup for the Met's director Philippe de Montebello, will make the museum's Impressionist and Post Impressionist collection arguably the finest outside Paris. The extent to which it will complement existing holdings is revealed by its display in three of the new galleries, until December 12. Gary Tinterow is to be congratulated for the subtlety of his hang which uses the vistas through the galleries to integrate this separate group with the collection beyond. It is possible, for instance, to stand in the same place to view both the Annenberg and Met portraits by Cezanne of his Uncle Dominic as a monk, and Van Gogh's 'Wheatfield with Cypresses' of 1889 and the 'Cypresses' of the same year. Tinterow offers any number of thoughtful resonances throughout the galleries. The only drawback of the vistas is that they impel the visitor to hurry ever onwards. The most controversial aspect of this modestly revisionist hang has proved to be the re-instatement of so many of the academic Salon paintings that had previously languished in store, and their prominent position. Bouguereaus and Cabanals are undeniably kitsch to modern sensibilities, but they do provide an appropriate foil to the Baryes and Rodins. They are even more relevant to the understanding of the Realists and Impressionists beyond. If there is one small gripe, it is about the colour of the gallery walls. The muted greens and blues immediately strike the wrong note. Obviously the sludge and slurry hues of the 1970s - and the decade's antipathy to dark reds and cinnamons - have not quite been exorcised.</p>

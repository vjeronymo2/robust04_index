			<p>BFN     [Text] The Israeli delegation to the multilateral talks in  Morocco has left for Rabat. In the Morocco, the participating  states will deal with joint tourism, economic, and development  projects. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports:    [Begin Segal recording] This round of multilateral economic  talks being held in Rabat, Morocco will focus on new proposals  on regional economics in transportation, agriculture, and  tourism. The Israeli delegation, led by Bank of Israel Governor  Ya'aqov Frenkel and Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir  left for Morocco this morning. The delegation will discuss  implementation of European plans, such as the establishment of a  joint tourism Riviera between Jordan, Egypt, and Israel on the  Red Sea. Within that framework, there are plans to open the  Jordanian-Israeli border to tourism and to linking the  transportation and electricity infrastructures along the  coastline. Fourteen Arab states -- including the PLO -- and 25  states outside the region -- including the United States, Japan  and the EU -- are participating in the fifth round of economic  multilaterals. A Foreign Ministry delegation headed by 'Oded  'Eran, assistant director general in charge of economics, was in  Morocco last week to prepare the meeting with the Moroccans.  The Foreign Ministry believes that progress along the bilateral  track will permit progress in the Rabat talks and along the  Jordanian track.    Other political-economic activity is being conducted by  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres himself, who left for Luxembourg  this morning to attend a meeting of the European Council of  Ministers. Peres is trying to persuade the ministers to reword  the economic accord between Israel and the EU. [end recording]</p>

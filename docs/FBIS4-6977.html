			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Newly elected Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata failed to launch a cabinet Monday [25  April] after the abrupt formation of a new 130-legislator  parliamentary group enraged the largest party in the coalition,  coalition officials said.    The unexpected development has delayed until after Tuesday  the inauguration of a new government.    The intracoalition standoff delayed the process of forming a  new cabinet and the subsequent imperial attestation ceremony at  the Imperial Palace in the presence of Emperor Akihito, they  said.    Hata said in a telephone message Monday night to Eiichi  Nakamura, representative of the Democratic Reform Party, a small  political party in the House of Councillors affiliated with  Japan's largest trade union organization, the Japanese Trade  Union Confederation (Rengo), that he will complete the formation  of his new cabinet by the early hours of Tuesday.    Hata also said he would have to make fairly major  alterations  in the personnel lineup of the cabinet of former Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa, which resigned en masse Monday morning.    The Social Democratic Party (SDP), with 74 members in the  House of Representatives, reacted strongly to the sudden  establishment of the new parliamentary group in the lower house,  from which it is excluded.    Coalition dissension intensified a few hours after the Diet  voted Shinseito leader Hata, 58, as new prime minister in place  of Hosokawa.</p>

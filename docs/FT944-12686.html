			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / ILO warning on Russian jobless More than a third of Russia's industrial workforce is in 'hidden unemployment' and many others are not being paid or have had their wages cut, according to a report published yesterday by the International Labour Organisation. Moreover, open unemployment in Russia - based on standard international definitions - is at least five times as high as the official figures, based on registrations of under 2 per cent, the report said. Enterprises have cut jobs for the fourth year running from mid-1993 to mid-1994, by an average of more than 8 per cent. However, 35 per cent of those still 'in work' had no job to do. These included those on involuntary short-time working and those - a fifth of all industrial workers - on long-term 'administrative leave' receiving little or no wages. The existence of hidden unemployment was a rational response by managers who would otherwise have to pay wages or severance pay, said the report's author, Mr Guy Standing. Even so, nearly half the enterprises surveyed by the ILO were in wage arrears and more than 60 per cent had not paid wages in full. Mr Standing said official figures showing a rise in average real wages referred to contractual wages and not those actually paid. 'Across the board, many workers are taking home much less, if they are taking home anything,' he said. Mr Standing called for enforceable labour contracts and a more comprehensive and generous social protection system to aid the process of enterprise restructuring and to cushion hardship.</p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Chinese hit by optic fibre glut China's fledgling optical fibre cable industry is in crisis due to a nationwide glut that has forced some plants to close and others to slash production. This will be ominous news for international telecommunications companies like AT&amp;T and Alcatel which are planning optical fibre plants in China. The official Economic Information Daily newspaper said yesterday China's cable production capacity had reached 300,000km annually, compared with demand of 60-70,000km. Some 80 companies producing optical fibre had already been set up with another 40 planning to enter the field. 'By the time all these companies are ready,' it said 'China would be able to produce more than 400,000km of optical cables, four to five times more than the market demands'. Problems of oversupply in the Chinese market are being exacerbated by the global glut. The Yangtze Optical Cables, based in Wuhan, central China, and one of the country's leading producers, has been forced to cut prices by up to 15 per cent to preserve its share of the market. Local and international producers have swarmed into the market, lured by China's huge demand for cable to satisfy its ambitious telecommunications expansion plans. But Mr Xu Shanyan of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, said yesterday that the ministry had been warning companies of an impending glut in optical fibre cables. 'We do welcome competition,' he said, 'but the problem is that we can't have too many factories. This will not only have an adverse effect on investors, but also on our own joint ventures.' Mr Xu said there were no plans at this stage to freeze the building of new optical fibre plants, but he urged investors to study the market carefully. Mr Louis Witters of Alcatel said the company was aware of the oversupply problems and was following the evolution of the market.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Observer: Embarrassy While not the worst of Russia's problems, the former Soviet embassy on Berlin's Unter den Linden is proving more of an embarrassy to the purse-pinched diplomats now headquartered in Bonn. 'Grandiose' does less than justice to the Berlin edifice, built in 1951 as part of Germany's war reparations. It boasts an opulence of - among other things - pillared chambers, a stairway of dark green marble taken from Hitler's chancellery, and a stained glass panorama of the Kremlin. Paying for its upkeep is another matter. One idea the Russians have been working on is to use the immense dining hall for 'market-oriented events'. But they have now had another inspiration. It's to get the building listed as a Berlin landmark, so obliging the city authorities to contribute to its maintenance.</p>

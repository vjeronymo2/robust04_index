			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Deutsche Bank operating profits drop 3.2% to DM3bn DEUTSCHE Bank, Germany's biggest bank, yesterday reported total group operating profits down by 3.2 per cent to DM3.06bn (Pounds 1.05bn). The figure was worse than expected by analysts and was the poorest result of the big three German banks. Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank reported double-digit increases in profits for the same period. Partial operating profits - which exclude income from own-account trading gains - fell 4 per cent to DM2.36bn. This compares with a 20 per cent gain at this level at Dresdner Bank and a 14.7 per cent rise at Commerzbank. The decline, which Deutsche Bank attributed to a general deterioration in the world economy, prompted analysts to cut their forecasts for the full year, predicting partial operating profits stagnation rather than growth of around 6 per cent. It also signalled the end of a long period of profits expansion at the bank: last year operating profits advanced 21.7 per cent to a record DM5.2bn. Analysts suggested that other German banks would ultimately experience a similar slowdown. Deutsche said: 'The restrained pace of the world economy and the slackening off of economic dynamism at home have had an increasing influence on the business and earnings situation at Deutsche Bank.' The bank added that in spite of 'dampened expectations', it was confident of a satisfactory result for the full year. Earnings on interest in the Deutsche Bank group rose 6 per cent to DM5.51bn, while the margin on interest fell from 2.41 per cent to 2.30 per cent. Fee income was up 5.6 per cent to DM1.97bn. A bank spokesman said the slowdown had to be seen against the excellent results for last year. He said it reflected in general higher costs of servicing depositors and the bank's growing role in low-margin interbank lending. Refunding costs rose 11.2 per cent to DM11.34bn as customers moved deposits from current accounts to term deposits with higher yields. Some analysts drew comfort from a slowdown in the bank's expenses. These grew at 6.8 per cent - compared with six months of the total figure for last year. Over the whole of last year, expenses grew by 18.4 per cent, reflecting the cost of expansion into east Germany.</p>

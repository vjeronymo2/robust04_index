			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / London considers investor centre PLANS FOR a promotion centre to 'sell' London and act as a 'one-stop shop' for potential investors are under consideration by three of the capital's authorities. The City Corporation, Westminster City Council and the Docklands Development Corporation have commissioned Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy and management consultancy firm, to report on the viability of such a centre. The CBI is also closely involved in the project. If Coopers reported favourably, the centre could be in operation by the start of next year. Premises have already been secured and a blueprint for an arms-length company to run the centre, with a private-sector chief executive, has been drawn up. The centre is expected to cost about Pounds 700,000 a year, met largely by the three authorities in the first year but with growing contributions from businesses and other London authorities in later years. The move would complement the planned London Business Forum, which the government proposes to set up later this year, as promised in the Conservative election manifesto. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, will soon appoint the forum's chief executive - expected to be a prominent industrialist - and has been engaged in talks with the three authorities to ensure they do not compete for the same functions and private-sector funding. Mr David Weeks, leader of Westminster City Council, said: 'A one-stop shop ought to be a valuable commercial resource. Coopers are looking at investors in London over the past four years, and those who, while interested, failed to invest.' He added: 'The centre would be plugged into everything, from the London property market and development scene through to arts and architecture.' The City Corporation is particularly keen on the promotion side, after the success of its architectural exhibition at the Royal Exchange. It believes that a London-wide body with a full-time secretariat could also deflect criticism over the absence of a strategic authority in London. Observer, Page 13</p>

Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> WITNESS TO PALMDALE STABBING AIDS VICTIM, PURSUES, SEIZES SUSPECT  </P> <P> A witness to a stabbing in Palmdale Tuesday night did more than just watch.  </P> <P> When Hank Adame, 34, saw one man stab another during a street fight, he aided  the victim, then chased the attacker a mile to a bar and subdued him with the  help of patrons until police arrived.  </P> <P> Albert Harris, 30, of Lancaster, was charged with attempted murder and was  being held without bail today at the Antelope Valley sheriff's substation. The  stabbing victim, 21-year-old Keith Harper of Palmdale, underwent surgery for  five stab wounds to the chest and abdomen at Palmdale Hospital Medical Center.  He was in stable condition today, a hospital spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Deputy Ron Bozeman said Harris is suspected of stabbing Harper at about 10:30  p.m. Tuesday after an argument over a woman escalated into a fight.  </P> <P> Adame, a Rosamond resident who was in a nearby parking lot, saw the stabbing  and helped Harper into a car that Harper's cousin drove to the hospital, Sgt.  Ron Shreves said. Adame then pursued Harris to the Wel-Com-Inn bar, where he  told patrons of the stabbing. They helped him subdue Harris and called the  police, Shreves said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANINE AID  </P> <P> Traveling eastbound on the Santa Monica Freeway at around 7:15 a.m., Sept. 15,  I witnessed a somewhat remarkable occurrence. Trotting along the divider,  during rush hour traffic, was a frightened young dog.  </P> <P> How does a dog get in the middle of a major freeway? How long had the dog been  there? I saw this dog and I was concerned, yet I did not stop. God forbid I  should be late for work.  </P> <P> One person pulled over to the shoulder -- a young man driving a somewhat  banged-up brown Datsun. I just wanted to say thank you. It's nice to know there  is someone who recognizes the difference between life and death and the  consequences of an action.  </P> <P> And then there are those of us who drive on by, thinking about what we saw,  knowing we did not stop.  </P> <P> AMY PICK  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

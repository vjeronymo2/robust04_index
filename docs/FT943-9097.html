			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Paris plays down terrorist risk France yesterday extended its curbs on Islamic militants but played down the threat of domestic terrorist attacks in reprisal for security measures which include the internment of more than 20 suspected Algerian radicals. Mr Charles Pasqua, interior minister, said the risk of terrorist attacks was greater outside France. 'We do not believe there is a direct terrorist threat in France linked to the events in Algeria, but it is clear that we have to take precautions', he told Le Figaro newspaper. Mr Pasqua's comments coincided with a warning from the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), a radical Algerian Moslem group which claimed responsibility for killing five French nationals in Algiers earlier this month, that France would face 'violent attacks on its interests in Algeria' if it failed to meet various conditions. The conditions included evacuating all French citizens from Algeria and ending support for the military-led government. The GIA also ordered France to protect Moslem rights in its national territory. In France, more than 3,000 people were stopped on Thursday night, taking the six-day tally to about 16,000. Eleven individuals were being questioned as part of the latest checks, according to officials. Twenty-two suspected Moslem militants are being interned at an army barracks. Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, endorsed Mr Pasqua's handling of the police action but sought to distance himself from the interior minister's hardline analysis of the Algerian situation. Mr Juppe denied France gave unconditional support to the Algiers regime and said he had urged the government to hold elections as soon as possible. The Algerian government cancelled an election in 1992 which the now outlawed Islamic Salvation Front was set to win. Mr Pasqua has argued that the only choice in Algeria is to support the existing government or see the country fall into the hands of extremists.</p>

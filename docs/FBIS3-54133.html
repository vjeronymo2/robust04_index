At the end of the session,  Minister Yosi Sarid said that 1994 may yet turn out to be the  most important year in the history of the State of Israel,  during which peace agreements will be signed between Israel and  all its neighbors. Ministers estimated that the intense  political activities might heighten the efforts of terrorist  elements to thwart the political process. Our correspondent Udi  Segal reports on the political portion of the cabinet session:    [Begin recording] [Segal] The weekly cabinet session ended  about an hour ago, and most of it was devoted to a comprehensive  political-security briefing by IDF intelligence elements, headed  by Chief of Intelligence Major General Uri Sagi. Based on these  intelligence assessments, most ministers sounded cautiously  optimistic. [passage omitted]    Minister Hayim Ramon believes that some components of the  Iranian and Iraqi threat may be neutralized through political  action on the Syrian track.    [Ramon] The most significant conventional threat is posed by  Syria, of course. That is why it is so important to reach a  peace agreement with Syria and extricate it from the circle of  war.    [Segal] Turning to more immediate matters, the cabinet  discussed the ongoing negotiations with the Arab partners,  mainly the Palestinians, and the understandings reached by Peres  and 'Arafat in Oslo. Cabinet ministers believe there is a  chance for progress, but there are still numerous difficulties  on the way to the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement.    [Construction Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer] The prevailing  view, to which I fully subscribe, is that sooner or later we  will overcome the difficulties and the Israeli-Palestinian  agreement will get on the road. This cannot be said of the  Syrian track seeing that, as you know, the talks are scheduled  to resume tomorrow but because of the death of Hafiz al-Asad's  son, Syria is having problems and an agreement may very well be  delayed. However, I believe that after one or two sessions we  will have enough indications about the seriousness of Syria's  intentions. I believe that if he had not had enough reasons,  al-Asad would not have met Clinton.    [Segal] Ministers Yosi Sarid and 'Uzi Bar'am asked the prime  minister to explain to them why he sent Deputy Defense Minister  Mordekhay Gur to announce his decision to hold a referendum  about the Golan to the Knesset before notifying the cabinet.  Rabin noted down their criticism. [end recording]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 23 January  adds that "the IDF intelligence briefings indicated a real  Syrian commitment to the continuation of the political process.  Several ministers expressed the view that a breakthrough in  Israel's relations with Syria should be expected because  Damascus was determined to extricate itself from the cycle of  war, improve its relations with the United States, and enter a  period of calm in the Middle East."]</p>

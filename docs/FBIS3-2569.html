The solution to this problem, according  to the mayor of the city, Mr. Li Ziliu, lies in intensification  of reform and implementation of regulation and control measures.    Mr. Li, speaking yesterday at the second session of the 10th  municipal People's Congress, said that in order to control and  stabilize prices in the city, Guangzhou this year must further  improve its reserve system for important commodities, set up a  regulation fund for non-staple foodstuff prices, strengthen  management over markets, especially pay greater attention to the  management, regulation and control over the prices of  vegetables, and establish several vegetable wholesale markets in  its northern and eastern urban districts with the aim of  reducing the amount of intermediate selling circles.    Mr. Li said that management over the meat and slaughtering  markets would also be tightened and there would be a severe  cracking down on such activities as purchasing at  deliberately-forced-down prices, driving up of prices,  overbearing activities in markets, selling of inferior products  and the slaughtering of dead and diseased domestic animals.    The mayor also asked for strengthened supervision over  prices, a stop to illegal charges being levied and the raising  of prices while at the same time the interests of consumers must  be protected as well as guaranteed stability and smooth  operation of the markets.    The goal set to control the price rise in the city this year  is 15 percent.    The city will focus its efforts of the construction of 18  shopping centres, 18 wholesale markets, two commercial districts  and 14 indoor markets and make preparations for the setting up  of futures markets for grain and edible oil and materials for  agriculture and petroleum which will operate according to  international practices, promoting the city's commercial  business to a high level.</p>

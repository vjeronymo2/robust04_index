			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Brussels, May 27 (AFP) -- NATO wants to give a  quick answer to the proposals put forward by Russia before it  will sign the Partnership for Peace (PFP) programme, NATO deputy  secretary general Sergio Balanzino said Friday [27 May].    "It's work in progress, it's a dialogue (with Russia) which  becomes serious and intense and on NATO's side, we'll make our  position known hopefully pretty soon," Balanzino said. [passage  omitted]    Balanzino said: "We've taken good note of the Russians'  intention to sign PFP as it is without any change or  modification."    However, he was cautious on whether or not the signing would  take place during a NATO foreign affairs ministers' meeting in  Istanbul on June 8.    "These are things that need time and reflection. We will  certainly be active and not wait too long before coming to a  conclusion and define our position," Balanzino said.    "But I don't know if we will be able to reach a signature  (in  Istanbul). To dialogue with Russia is not a walk in the park.  We've to be serious and take time," he said.</p>

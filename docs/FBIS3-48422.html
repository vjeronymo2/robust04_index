Build a Uniform Market Mechanism Under State  Management and in Accordance With Socialist Orientations.    Continued efforts must be made to build a new economic  structure, bearing in mind the need to persist in the transition  to the market mechanism while at the same time increasing the  efficiency of state management. Steps must be taken to perfect  apparatuses and policies to create necessary conditions for the  market mechanism to operate effectively. It is necessary to  guarantee the right of autonomy of businessmen. Prices should  be set mainly by the market. Market indicators are very  important factors for allocating resources to production and  business establishments. It is important to adopt incentive  measures to encourage everyone to compete in a legitimate and  wholesome manner. Steps must be taken to limit monopoly.  Business people have the right to earn profits in a legitimate  way. The state only sets the prices of a small number of goods  and services bearing a particularly important socioeconomic  significance or having a highly exclusive nature. In any case,  prices must all be set within the limits of the market  mechanism. It is necessary to stabilize transporation costs and  the prices of electricity, water, fuel, and oil. Steps must be  taken to eliminate the system of providing subsidies for losses.  It is important to regulate income distribution in a rational  way and create conditions for expanding production facilities  and for reducing waste of resources. It is necessary to abide by  the principle of positive [laix duwowng] interests, closely  monitor the rates of inflation, and create favorable conditions  for both savings and loans. It is important to regulate  currency exchange rates in a satisfactory manner, bearing in  mind the need to see to it that the actual rates remain  relatively stable but not rigid and henceforth, help promote  exports and control imports. Plans must be worked out to  determine fees and wages in a rational manner. It is necessary  to formulate a selective subsidy policy for agricultural and  export products. Appropriate measures must be taken to protect  local products and the interests of both producers and  consumers. Uniform steps must be taken to form various types of  markets, products, services, labor resources, capital,  technology, real estate, and so forth.    It is necessary to step up state macro-management to direct  and guide the overall performance of the national economy.  Efforts must be made to create an economic environment and  legal boundaries for production and business activities.  Measures must be taken to develop positive factors, prevent or  contain the adverse impact of spontaneous or negative actions,  and overcome the inherent shortcomings of the market mechanism.  Henceforth, these will cause the latter to become a really  important instrument for distributing and making better use of  all sources of strength as well as for distributing or  redistributing the national income to guarantee equilibrium  between revenue and spending, regulating the interests of the  various economic sectors and people of all walks of life,  meeting the growing demands of development, and ensuring social  justice.    The state macro-management system must cover all areas of  the  national economy and economic sectors instead of the state  business sector only. It is necessary to strengthen the  concentration and uniformity of government agencies when it  comes to exercising macroeconomic management. At the same, it  is necessary to increase the responsibilities and power of  sectors and localities in case they can work out better  solutions to the various problems involved.    It is necessary to guarantee the right to autonomy of  business establishments. Special ministerial agencies should  devote efforts to carry out their functions as development  project planners for economic and technological sectors under  their charge satisfactorily. They should also provide  direction, assistance, and supervision for operations of  business establishments belonging to different economic sectors  and in different areas of activity as specified under their  state management functions. It is important to strengthen the  role of interministerial agencies in overseeing the overall  performance of all sectors and areas of operations, thus putting  all socioeconomic activities under the state's effective  macro-management system.    Administrative organs at all levels should perform their  state management functions in areas under their charge by  overseeing the operations of business establishments belonging  to different economic sectors, bearing in mind the need not to  distinguish between central and local economic organizations.    Steps must be taken to perfect the legal system to ensure  strict observance of rules and regulations. Efforts must be  made to consolidate and strengthen the advisory role of planning  agencies so the latter can formulate good plans and projects to  serve development goals, calculate and maintain a balanced  macro-management system, adjust investment structures, effect  economic restructuring, and serve as a venue for coordinating  efforts to tap all sources of strength at home and abroad and  make effective use of them to realize socioeconomic development  goals.    We must continue to reform the financial and monetary  system fundamentally and comprehensively, while satisfactorily  promoting economic activities to increase investment and  development. We must strive to ensure uniform management of the  national financial system, savings, and expenditure; improve  financial work of the state, enterprises, and the population.  Efforts should be made to improve budget management at the  central and local levels to ensure sufficient allotments for  normal expenditure, investment development, and national  defense. We must mobilize capital at home and abroad, strive to  meet immediate requirements, practice thrift, and promote  investment development for long-term interest.    We must encourage state-run enterprises to carry out  autonomous financial management under close supervision and  control by the state.    We must strive to keep the budget deficit at lower than five  percent of the GDP, make great efforts to increase state revenue  to pay for expenditure, refrain from issuing banknotes to  resolve the budget deficit, and strive to balance income and  expenditure. Efforts must be made to reform the accounting  system and improve auditing at the state and private sectors.    The central state bank must formulate and implement the  monetary policy to ensure effective allotment, transfer, and  remittance of money; curb inflation; coordinate with financial,  trade, and price agencies to maintain average annual price  increase to single digits only; strive to balance international  debt while increasing foreign currency reserves. The financial  and banking sectors must satisfactorily carry out their  functions of establishing funds, and effectively use and provide  credits, and strive to meet requirements for economic  development. This is to maintain their role as a center for the  settlement and circulation of money within society. They must  strive to improve the foreign currency management mechanism to  create conditions for the Vietnamese dong to be effectively  circulated and for it to become the sole currency for the  settlement of debt nationwide.    4. Measures to resolve cultural and social issues:    Our party and state's guiding thought in carrying out the  cultural and social work is to care for, foster, and develop the  human factor to create a driving force for revolutionary  objectives. Efforts must be made to resolve various current  issues to ensure social justice, enhance the people's intellect,  promote a healthy atmosphere in society, and protect and develop  our national cultural traits. To effectively create sufficient  jobs for workers, the state and people must save money for  investment development while satisfactorily implementing the  socioeconomic strategy. They must encourage all economic  components, citizens, and investors at home and abroad to expand  branches and occupations to create more jobs for the laborers  and reduce the number of unemployed workers, expand foreign  trade, and promote the export of laborers. Efforts must be made  to organize vocational training for youths to enhance their  professional skills. For personnel and workers laid off by  administrative agencies and economic units, we must reorganize  and provide them with vocational training as well as loans to  help them become involved in production and business or to find  other jobs for them, while striving to set up consultative  agencies to introduce new jobs.    We must formulate laws to protect the legitimate interests  of  both employees and employers at private capitalist business  establishments. The laws on labor, wages, insurance, and taxes  have been and will be promulgated in accordance with investment  promotion, the elimination of social injustice, and opposition  against illegal businesses. The statutes, regulations, and  disciplines for workers formulated by business establishments  must not stand against state laws.    It is necessary to say that the economic growth rate should  be in parallel with social progress and justice at each stage of  development. Social justice should cover areas such as the  distribution of the means of production, income in accordance  with results in production, and equal opportunity for each  member of the production force to develop his ability. We must  implement the principle of distributing more income to those who  work and contribute more and vice versa, while striving to  oppose mediocrity, and a dependence on others. We must ensure  income is distributed in accordance with labor. We must  encourage and treat competent and capable workers appropriately,  and ensure a fair income for investment projects especially in  production and business. We should encourage the people to  amass wealth through honest means, while fighting poverty and  hunger, motivate the rich to participate in economic  development; formulate policies to rationally promote credit,  taxation, vocational training to create conditions for the poor  to be able to progress and to earn enough and become rich.  Various former wealthy areas should, together with the state,  assist the poor and underdeveloped areas. We must mobilize rich  people to contribute in helping the poor by providing loans,  equipment, and materials and in the transfer of experience and  working methods. We should set up funds to repay those who have  rendered meritorious services to the state, formulate  appropriate policies for the rich, mobilize business enterprises  and private organizations to participate in humanitarian and  charitable activities to help the victims of war and natural  calamities as well as the disabled, the aged, and the homeless  who can no longer work.    The responsibility of each citizen in solving their own  individual and family problems should be heightened. At the  same time, the common sharing of responsibilities in society in  general should be intensified to develop our people's  humanitarian tradition.    The goals and measures set forth in the seventh party  Central  Committee Fourth Plenum Resolution on education and training,  culture, the arts, public health care, and population and family  planning work must be continued so that in a few years  significant achievements can be recorded in our education  service, thereby helping the education service fulfill its role  in upgrading the people's mental abilities, creating the  people's labor force, and improving the people's skills.    At first, compulsory elementary education must be  implemented. And, if possible, universal secondary education  should be introduced in some localities. Policies to exempt and  reduce school fees and provide suitable financial assistance  must be applied to guarantee the education of children from poor  families, especially those living in isolated, high, and former  revolutionary base areas.    Existing ethnic boarding schools must be consolidated and  more boarding schools must be built. We must reorganize the  vocational training system, upgrade the service provided by  teachers' colleges, and rearrange the tertiary education system  by linking academic training with vocational skills, study with  practice, and training and research with production.    National university centers must be built with improved  goals, curriculums, and education methods to meet national  development requirements. Planning for fostering and retraining  the contingent of teachers must be established, policies to  grant appropriate rewards to teachers must be introduced, and  the state management of the education and training service must  be strengthened.</p>

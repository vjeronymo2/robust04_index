			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / The Property Market: Uphill battle The government's consultation paper on commercial property leases underlines the complexity of the arguments surrounding upward-only rent reviews. 'There is little firm information to enable the claims and counter-claims to be thoroughly assessed,' the paper states. The paper, which was published last week, states that there is no likelihood of any legislation being passed that would affect existing leases. But it acknowledges the pressure for reform. 'These criticisms (of upward-only rent review clauses) have grown sharply in recent years as clauses have operated to maintain rents above open market rents during the recession,' it says. The options for reform range from taking no action to prohibiting the use of upward-only rent reviews. There are also some intermediate possibilities, such as allowing rents to move upwards or downwards on review, providing the rents never fall below the initial rent. The paper's main criticisms of upward-only reviews are: Landlords are in a strong bargaining position when there is a limited supply of suitable property. This prevents tenants from freely negotiating their leases and forces them to take on an unreasonable share of the risk inherent in holding property. In periods of recession and low inflation, tenants with existing leases are locked into higher rents than tenants taking new leases. In these circumstances, the market is unable to react to signals. Moreover, upward-only reviews may be inflationary if tenants are able to pass the costs of their high overheads on to consumers. The upward-only rent reviews inhibit free choice because they may make it difficult for tenants to assign their leases when rents are falling. They may also lead to a higher level of insolvencies among tenants. Since upward-only rent review clauses limit the risk to investors, they may divert resources awayfrom other sectors of the economy. The arguments in defence of upward-only rent reviews are: Upward-only rent reviews have become a standard feature because they serve the interests of the market as a whole. They strike a balance between the risk of the landlord and his financial backers on one hand, and tenants on the other. Rather than being inflationary, upward-only rent reviews may allow rents to be set lower than they would otherwise be because of the value of the clause to landlords. By reducing market uncertainty they may also restrain rents and so stimulate investment and supply. Any statutory regulation would inhibit the free operation of the market. Abolition of upward-only rent review clauses might hit capital values, which would be inequitable; such a move would also be deflationary as it would reduce the value of collateral against which banks lend.</p>

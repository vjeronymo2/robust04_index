			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Smith demands 'full account' of exit from ERM MR JOHN SMITH, opposition leader, yesterday intensified his harrying of Mr John Major over the UK's dispute with the Bundesbank. He told the prime minister in a letter that it was unacceptable for Mr Major to try to conclude the dispute with the German central bank by 'drawing a line' under it. He said the Bundesbank's statement, published in the Financial Times this week, suggested an approach had been made to Britain over its realignment within the ERM - contradicting the Treasury's version of events. '(The) British public deserves to know the truth about all the options considered,' Mr Smith wrote. He told Mr Major it was his responsibility 'to provide a full account of the disastrous events which culminated in both an estimated loss of Pounds 1bn on Black Wednesday and this country's humiliating withdrawal from the ERM'. Mr Smith reported Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, as saying the Bank of England had not asked for extra help to save the pound beyond that required under the European monetary system. Meanwhile, the Labour party, which ended its conference in Blackpool yesterday, is refusing to be explicit about its tactics when the Maastricht bill resumes its Commons stages. Although the Labour leadership backs the principle of closer European union, Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy leader, said the party would want to examine the bill's content, particularly in the light of any changes made to satisfy the Danish people. She said Labour would oppose attempts by the government to impose a 'guillotine' on the bill - a measure restricting the time allowed for debate which is usually used to prevent filibustering by opponents. Labour is conscious that the divide among its MPs over Maastricht is substantial, although probably not as deep as among Conservatives.</p>

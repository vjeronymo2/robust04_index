			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Liberal narrowly ahead in Colombia Mr Ernesto Samper, Colombia's governing Liberal party candidate, last night held a narrow lead in the second round of the country's presidential elections. Mr Samper's followers were preparing victory celebrations with 91 per cent of the ballots counted. Mr Samper was 106,000 votes ahead of his opponent, the Conservatives' Mr Andreas Pastrana, with 50 per cent of the votes against 49 per cent. The remaining 1 per cent represented invalid ballots. In the first round Mr Samper and his vice-presidential candidate Mr Humberto de la Calle, had an advantage of 18,000 votes but did not win the necessary overall majority. Mr Samper, 43, is an economist and former minister of economic development. He has been on the campaign trail for a year and fought three elections, starting with the battle for the Liberal party candidacy. He has promised to raise social investment to offset the effects of economic liberalisation and to create 1.5m new jobs. Only minor incidents marred the election day. Turnout was higher than in the first round. Outgoing President Cesar Gaviria, who is barred by the constitution from seeking re-election, yesterday reminded Colombians of their duty to vote despite the disaster which had befallen the national soccer side in the World Cup. On Saturday night the team was beaten 3-1 by Romania, deflating the candidates' publicity campaigns linked to the team. Mr Samper and Mr Pastrana had toured more than a dozen cities in a final dash for votes among the 17m registered voters. Most of the 16 other first round candidates had told their followers to choose as they pleased between the two remaining candidates, though General Miguel Maza, with 55,000 votes, joined the Samper campaign.</p>

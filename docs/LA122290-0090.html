			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILSON ASKS FORESTRY BOARD TO DENY BID TO LOG ACRES OF ANCIENT REDWOODS  </P> <P> Gov.-elect Pete Wilson has written a letter urging the state Board of Forestry  to reject a timber company proposal to cut down parts of one of the last  privately owned ancient redwood forests.  </P> <P> Wilson sided with conservationists against plans by Pacific Lumber Co. to log  an initial 564 acres of the 3,000-acre Headwaters Forest in Humboldt County.  </P> <P> The company's plan was denied by state Director of Forestry Harold Walt but the  board, which meets Jan. 9, can override his decision.  </P> <P> In a letter to the board dated Friday, Wilson said Pacific's logging plans  violate a legal requirement that the company mitigate adverse environmental  impacts caused by its cutting operations.  </P> <P> "I am therefore writing to urge you . . . to uphold the denial," Wilson said. "  . . . As governor, I will work to preserve additional old-growth redwoods in  California's north coast, including protection of an ecologically significant  portion of the Headwaters Forest."  </P> <P> Wilson will take office as governor Jan. 7, two days before the board, made up  of appointees of outgoing Gov. George Deukmejian, is scheduled to tackle the  issue. Both as governor and governor-elect, Wilson can try to persuade -- but  cannot force -- the board to act according to his will.  </P></p>

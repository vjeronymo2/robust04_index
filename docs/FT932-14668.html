			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / UK Company News: A pan-European pipe-dream come true - Delta has seized upon the opportunities presented by the single market IF A company could treat the single market like a blank canvas, it would be easy to establish a pan-European business. In manufacturing, the company could site its factories according to wage and skill levels to give the lowest production costs; in marketing it could promote a single brand and corporate name; in management it could be cosmopolitan, making it easy to spread best practice through the group. Delta, the UK electrical cables and engineering concern, has tried to follow such guidelines in building up a pan-European business for copper-alloy plumbing fittings. It started with a small UK subsidiary, manufacturing in Birmingham and Dundee. The home market was, however, mature as the vast majority of domestic sanitary and heating systems had already been converted from galvanised iron to copper. Continental Europe held much more potential, with only half the old systems converted in the west and plenty of virgin territory in the east. Delta decided that the market offered enough scope for a Europe-wide approach in spite of local variations - in pipe diameters for instance  - and local loyalties to companies and brands. The first step came in 1987 with the acquisition of NIBCO Europe from a US group, bringing in German, French and Spanish subsidiaries. After a total investment of about Pounds 55m, IBP - the name adopted for the Europe-wide business - has factories in five countries and a marketing and distribution network extending to about 20. Sales have doubled since the original NIBCO purchase. IBP accounts for nearly half of Delta's engineering division, the group's biggest operating profit earner in 1992 with Pounds 22.2m on sales of Pounds 320.1m. The NIBCO deal brought in two key executives: IBP's managing director, Mr Rudi Brodkorb, a German, part of whose education was in France, and the production director, Mr Luis Adarraga, also MD of ATCOSA in Spain, whose family has worked in copper for two generations. Their first aim has been to reduce production costs. The idea is to make low-volume items in areas with lower labour costs, such as Spain and Poland, while the emphasis in Germany is on high volumes and automation. When you look at the data on labour, however, 550 of the near 1,200 employees are in Germany. This is partly because it is the biggest market and partly historic. With NIBCO, Delta inherited a copper pipe factory, which supplies a third of in-house needs, a red-brass facility (for threaded components) and a foundry. Mr Brodkorb acknowledges that if the group were starting from scratch it would not locate a foundry in Germany. But the planning barriers to building one elsewhere are prohibitive. In ATCOSA's factory in Cordoba, southern Spain, 800 different products are made - although 26 of them account for 75 per cent of the volume. Some product lines have been transferred to this plant to take advantage of lower labour costs, but such moves are always accompanied by an effort to improve the process. 'We develop a more automated system to deal with a future problem of higher wages,' Mr Adarraga says. Typical improvements are to knock two procedures into one and to find ways of saving material - the next highest cost after labour. For instance the Cordoba factory has developed a method of making an 'elbow' joint that simplifies the cutting process and saves copper in the pipe walls. Such advances can be extended to other areas of the group. But it would be wrong to attribute much of the momentum to the single market. International competition and customer demands for flexibility of supply are the driving forces. On the marketing side, the promotional effort operates on three levels. The bulk of the products, wherever they are on sale in Europe, come under the B brand. This means the customer does not know where they are produced. Mr Brodkorb says that transportation costs are relatively small. Here the single market has saved time and paperwork. However, it has yet to provide a common set of standards. These are supposed to be hammered out by 1994, but Mr Brodkorb is pessimistic about the timetable because national quality standards are still being generated, effectively forming barriers to entry. The next level of branding is the subsidiary name. Here IBP has respected the local loyalties of customers - typically regional plumbing wholesalers - and kept historic names. Finally the pan-European banner is promoted via the IBP prefix. Product prices are an important part of the marketing equation. Before Britain left the ERM, a big effort had been made to bring prices into line. Mr Brodkorb says the variation had been reduced to 7 per cent, which minimised the incen-tive for cross-border under-cutting. The pound's devaluation has severely disrupted this effort. With both manufacturing and marketing presenting a cross between single-market values and historic national constraints, the third ideal of having a cosmopolitan management might seem harder to achieve. However, the IBP board is surprisingly international. The managing and marketing directors are German, the production director Spanish, and the finance director English. Product development and purchasing is split between English and French directors. The benefits of the cosmopolitan approach are the exchange of ideas and technology, and the overview that informs the endless process of rationalisation. This was put to the test when IBP took over Atub in Normandy in 1990. Changes had to be made to both management and technology. But Atub insisted that one of its processes was the best. As a PR exercise initially, IBP decided to hear them out. It turned out that Atub was right, and now some of its technology is being spread through the group. As IBP extends its ambitions, both geographically and in terms of product range, that open-mindedness will increasingly be called upon to ease the tension between European goals and specific regional situations.</p>

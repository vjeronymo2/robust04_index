			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD WANTS TO EXPAND DRUG INTERDICTION EFFORTS  </P> <P> The California National Guard hopes to expand its drug interdiction efforts in  the wake of the Border Ranger II operation last May on the U. S.-Mexico border,  the Guard's top officer said Monday.  </P> <P> Adjutant Gen. Robert Thrasher called the monthlong operation, which deployed  405 reservists at legal and illegal border crossings and in the ports of Los  Angeles and Long Beach, "a model" for military efforts against drug smuggling  nationwide.  </P> <P> But he also warned that the Guard's combat readiness would suffer if the force  were continually diverted to drug interdiction tasks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Much Publicized Crackdown  </P> <P> At a Mission Valley seminar hosted by Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado) and  attended by local law enforcement officials, National Guard officers provided  fresh details of the controversial operation that placed their troops, some of  them armed, on the border. The mission involved surveillance and customs  searches by the soldiers, who then passed on the information to civilian  agencies for further action.  </P> <P> The much-publicized crackdown netted more than four tons of drugs with an  estimated street value of $135 million, said Maj. James Hitsley, who worked on  Border Ranger II as an intelligence and operations officer. Guardsmen searched  13,432 vehicles and 828 shipping containers, and their work led to 569 arrests,  Hitsley said.  </P> <P> The Guard also conducted ground and air surveillance of the border area, he  said. It used ground-based radar at Laguna Salada in the desert and AH-64  Apache helicopters equipped with infrared sensors for the May operation, and  the military technology proved a notable success, Hitsley said.  </P> <P> Although they lacked arrest powers, some of the National Guard units deployed  in Border Ranger II were the first in the nation to be armed with assault  rifles for a drug interdiction mission. Hunter, an advocate of military  involvement in such missions, said armed guardsmen worked only as border  observers and carried weapons for self-defense.  </P> <P> Hunter also said he favors giving the military arrest powers and dismissed  concerns that the proposal would endanger civil rights. "The only thing it  would endanger are the drug traffickers," he said.  </P> <P> It was Hunter, along with Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), who backed legislation  in 1988 that eventually appropriated $300 million for this year's military drug  interdiction efforts. Of that amount, $40 million went to the National Guard,  including $2 million for operation Border Ranger II.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First Operation Canceled  </P> <P> Although that money has nearly run out, the Guard could get as much as $70  million for similar operations in 1990, according to Thrasher. Total  appropriations for next year's military drug interdiction could rise to $450  million, he said.  </P> <P> The 1988 Border Ranger operation, a predecessor of the May effort, was canceled  after one of its first helicopter patrols crashed, killing five sheriffs'  deputies from different parts of Southern California and three guardsmen  aboard. Despite claims of Border Ranger II's success, National Guard officers  at the seminar acknowledged that they could not gauge the effect of the  operation on the overall flow of illegal drugs into the country.  </P> <P> U.S. Atty. William Braniff and San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen attended the  seminar. Representatives from the FBI and the U.S. Drug Enforcement  Administration, Border Patrol and Customs Service were also there.  </P> <P> Some of Hunter's constituents, invited because of their concern about drug  trafficking, repeatedly questioned the officials about potential solutions.  </P> <P> "What would Harry Truman have done about all this?" asked one man.  </P> <P> "If you sell or promote drugs, the first time you are caught (the sentence)  should be 30 years in prison, and the second time the death penalty," said  another, to scattered applause.  </P></p>

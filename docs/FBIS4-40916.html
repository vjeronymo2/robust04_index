			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, June 20, BNS -- Prime Minister Mart Laar  on Sunday formally sent to President Lennart Meri his formal  proposals to relieve Finance Minister Heiki Kranich and Culture  and Education Minister Paul-Eerik Rummo from their duties,  Government Spokesman Ain Saarna said.    According to the country's laws, the president now has got  three days to make his decision.    Kranich and Rummo, both from the Liberal Democratic Party,  entered their resignations last Tuesday. The Liberal Democratic  Party on the same day announced its stepping out from the Pro  Patria-led ruling coalition.    Recent media reports have mentioned Kalle Jurgenson, deputy  chairman of the Pro Patria faction in the parliament, as a most  likely candidate for the post of the finance minister, as well  as Tonis Lukas, the director of the Estonian National Museum, as  a possible new culture and education minister. Both have denied  having received proposals to accept the positions.    Also mentioned have been Andres Lipstok, local  administration  leader in the western Laanemaa county, as possible new finance  minister, and Tiit Sinissaar, head of the Pro Patria faction in  the parliament, as minister of culture and education.    Estonia currently also has the position of the defense  minister vacant. Official reports name Raul Opik as still the  main candidate for the office.    The prime minister in interviews earlier has expressed hope  that the new ministers will be sworn in at summer emergency  sessions of the parliament, due at the end of this month.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CALTRANS OPPOSES SOUND WALL AT FREEWAY  TRUCK-ACCIDENT SITE  </P> <P> A sound wall is not justified near where a truck careened off the Hollywood  Freeway in January, based on sound readings taken Wednesday by the state  Department of Transportation, officials said.  </P> <P> Caltrans had agreed to monitor traffic noise across Babcock Avenue from the  freeway, where houses were built before the freeway opened in 1968. They found  sound levels there between 61 and 63 decibels, below the established 67-decibel  limit.  </P> <P> Noise levels on the freeway side of Babcock Avenue were 76 decibels, in excess  of the limit, but the houses there were built after 1968. According to state  regulations, Caltrans is only responsible for reducing sound for houses that  predate freeways.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, Caltrans agreed to install a guardrail along the freeway to  help prevent future off-road accidents. But neighbors believe that a sound wall  would offer more protection, both from vehicles and noise.  </P> <P> The state maintains that a wall is the city's responsibility because city  officials allowed the houses to be built next to the freeway. The city  maintains that all sound walls are the state's responsibility.  </P> <P> "It's kind of like we're in a limbo here," said Bob Brice, who lives on Babcock  Avenue and has led the sound-wall fight. "It's a big mess."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIVE ALLIES THE LEAD, BUT HOLD REINS;  </P> <P> EUROPE: IF THE UNITED STATES NEED NO LONGER BE THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE'S CEO, IT  MUST REMAIN THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD.  </P> <P> The only thing worse than not consulting the Japanese, a government colleague  of mine used to say, is consulting the Japanese. So it is with America's allies  in Europe. Too much leadership is bullying or high-handed; too little is  weakness or indecision. Now is the time for the United States to let its  European allies take the lead over Eastern Europe, but it is not the time for  us to leave Europe to the Europeans. If the United States need no longer be the  Atlantic Alliance's CEO, it must remain the chairman of the board.  </P> <P> The reason is the center of Europe, the two Germanys. The underlying question  is whether the nature of the state system in Europe has changed enough -- or is  in the process of doing so -- so that old worries are no more. The postwar  division, for all its unhappiness, did solve Europe's historic problem.  Dividing Germany and embedding the western half in NATO created, as the old  saying had it, a Germany that was strong enough to stand up to the Soviet Union  but not so strong as to threaten Luxembourg.  </P> <P> Such concerns may be old-fashioned. After all, the Federal Republic is a secure  democracy now, and it is not as if Europeans have learned nothing from the last  40 years. The European Community, for all its shortcomings, is an impressive  achievement in cooperation.  </P> <P> Yet in this century, Europe's record at ordering its affairs when left alone is  unimpressive, to put it gently. For all the euphoria over freedom's march in  Eastern Europe, there are more than a few echoes of the period between the  wars. Now, as then, German influence -- this time West Germany and primarily  economic -- is spreading through Eastern Europe. As the hand of the Soviet  Union lightens there, old antagonisms are resurfacing, most notable that  between Hungary and Romania.  </P> <P> Franco-German ties that exist now are a far cry from the period before World  War II. Still, the Franco-German connection is weak and uneven, its ups and  downs determined all too visibly by cycles of French concern over its neighbor.  </P> <P> More to the point, there is no strong Anglo-French understanding to serve as an  anchor in the European Community for the Federal Republic. Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher has stubbornly pursued her own view of Europe, akin to that  of Gen. Charles de Gaulle, as one of sovereign states, not of supranational  institutions. Whatever the merits of her vision, it has taken Britain out of  the game, leaving a vacuum at Europe's center.  </P> <P> All politics is local politics, Tip O'Neill is credited with saying, and that  seems true in spades for Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He seems so preoccupied with  reform at home that he has little time for even those foreign relations that  have been most critical to Moscow -- Eastern Europe. Implicitly, he seems to be  saying that he will deal with Eastern Europe, even perhaps Germany, later. He  does have 400,000 Soviet soldiers in East Germany; while his spokesmen  occasionally hint that Soviet troops might leave Hungary and Poland, East  Germany is never on the list.  </P> <P> The continuing stream of East Germans fleeing their county is a reminder of  just how unpredictable the future will be and how fast that future may arrive.  The best of America's experts on East Germany, who are dismayingly few in any  case, were badly wrong about the events of this summer and fall; a year ago  they were talking of East Germany's "success." That East Germans -- Prussians,  after all -- would be satisfied because their standard of living was better  than Poland's seems laughable in retrospect. It should at least make for  humility and an awareness that whatever designs we conceive will be badly  wrong.  </P> <P> Yet that is no excuse for not thinking ahead, still less for leaving it all to  the Europeans. When President Bush meets with Gorbachev, reassuring him that  the West has no designs on Eastern Europe is important. But reassurance and  listening so "not to miss anything," as the President put it, are not enough.  </P> <P> He needs also to indicate America's willingness to stay in Europe, with  military forces, for some time to come. He needs to stress that our primary  goal in Eastern Europe is political and economic change -- "Finlandization,"  though he would not put it that way -- not dismantling the military alliances.  That can come later, if at all. So, too, while the United States cannot be in  the position of preventing its German ally from achieving its dreams about  countrymen to the east, the President also needs to be plain that the questions  at issue are not ones for Germans alone. Other Europeans have large stakes. And  so does the transatlantic chairman of the board.  </P></p>

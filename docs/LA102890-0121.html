			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MERYL STREEP  </P> <P> I am a 36-year-old post-college-educated woman who hungers for intelligent  film.  </P> <P> My girlfriends are mostly professionals who grew up watching Bette Davis,  Katherine Hepburn and Joan Crawford films on TV. There are a lot of us out here  -- baby boomers who have money to spend on entertainment and can appreciate  intelligently written films with strong female leads. "Postcards From the Edge"  sounds like a film that on many different levels appeals to people like us. I  implore the movie industry to satisfy our needs.  </P> <P> HELEN KOLOKOW GARBER  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sun Alliance slips The composite insurance area of the market was rife with rumours of an imminent rights issue, with marketmakers plumping for a big issue from Sun Alliance and moving the share price lower as the session progressed. At the close, Sun Alliance was a shade easier at 396p after relatively good turnover of 3.2m shares. The rest of the composite sector was also under a cloud as the cash-call stories circulated. The rights issue talk was embellished with precise details of the terms of the issue - said to be a one-for-six at 345p to raise around Pounds 500m. Most analysts disregarded the suggestions, saying that Sun Alliance has one of the highest solvency ratios among the UK composites and that its balance sheet had been boosted, along with other insurance groups, by the upsurge in UK equities and gilts in the past few months. Sun Alliance is scheduled to report interim results early next month, with brokers forecasting that the group will achieve profits in the region of Pounds 50m, compared with a loss of almost Pounds 98m in the same period last year. Guardian Royal Exchange, 2 off at 208p, was also mentioned as likely to ask shareholders for cash. GRE's interim figures are due for release on August 26, with the company forecast to report profits of around Pounds 60m, against a Pounds 39m loss. Sedgwick 'old' stood at 194p ex-rights with the new shares finally quoted at 23p after Transamerica, the US insurance group, was thought to have sold its nil-paid rights into the market. A block of just over 23m new nil-paid shares was sold to one marketmaker at 17p and placed in the market at 18p. Britannic Assurance was in good form, ending 10 ahead at 442p, after the increased interim dividend. The banks sector was one of the few areas of the market to encounter heavy investor resistance to the upsurge in share prices. 'There is an increasing feeling that the sector has already run ahead of itself and is due for a correction,' said one banks specialist. HSBC, one of the star performers in the financials area over the past year, ran into a flurry of profit-taking, closing 8 down at 764p on turnover of 4.9m. Barclays also attracted persistent selling, settling 5 cheaper at 472p on 7.5m traded. Standard Chartered continued to defy intermittent bouts of selling pressure, responding instead to forecasts of outstanding earnings per share growth in the current year and closing 6 higher at 989p, after touching a record 994p at one point. Merchant banks, the best performing sector of the stock market since the UK withdrew from the ERM last September, resumed their upward path, led by SG Warburg, 20 higher at 804p, and Kleinwort Benson, 6 up at 499p. British Gas continued to attract large-scale buying interest after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into the gas industry, which is increasingly being viewed by the big institutions as as good an outcome as the market could have hoped for. British Gas advanced 8 more to 335 1/2 p with turnover a hefty 19m shares. Enterprise Oil, a poor market since last week's resignation of Mr John Walmsley, the highly rated finance director, came under renewed selling pressure and fell 7 to 432p, with the big institutions said to have been switching out of the stock and into companies such as British Gas, BP and Shell Transport. Pittencrief jumped 20 to 291p in response to the sharp rise in the price of its US associate, Pittencrief Communications. Shares in British Aerospace were back in favour after the company said it was raising the size of its refinancing package (a five-year underwritten revolving credit facility) that was agreed last month by Pounds 100m to Pounds 1.5bn, after it won widespread support among its banks. The shares rose 13 to 468p. Fears about the financing of its regional jets joint venture with Taiwan had led to weakness in the stock in the previous session. A buy recommendation from Smith New Court boosted Lucas Industries, which gained 6 at 162p. Smith believes: 'Under the existing management, the company is likely to maintain the final dividend.' Motor dealer Evans Halshaw put on a further 16 at 390p as the market continued to appreciate Tuesday's bumper profits. A profits downgrade for First Leisure, said to be by Cazenove, left the shares 15 down at 319p. Stores shares performed strongly as belief in a consumer recovery underpinned by more domestic interest rate cuts attracted investors. Among the leaders, Boots surged 15 1/2 to 490 1/2 p, GUS 'A' 38 to 2058p, Next 6 to 208p and WH Smith 'A' 10 to 479p.</p>

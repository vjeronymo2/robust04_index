			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OHIO MAN CHARGED WITH FAKING HIS OWN DEATH IN $1-MILLION INSURANCE SCAM  </P> <P> An Ohio man appeared for arraignment in Los Angeles Friday on charges of faking  his own death and conspiring with a business partner and a Glendale neurologist  to kill a man to provide a body so they could collect $1 million worth of  insurance.  </P> <P> Melvin Hanson, 48, was flown Thursday night from Columbus, Ohio, to appear in  Los Angeles Municipal Court, but his arraignment was continued to April 27  after a public defender requested that Hanson be examined by a doctor for  fatigue and physical problems.  </P> <P> Hanson, John Hawkins of Ohio and Dr. Richard Boggs of Glendale were charged  with murder, conspiracy to commit murder for financial gain, grand theft and  insurance fraud.  </P> <P> Prosecutors allege the three conspired to kill Ellis Greene, 32, of North  Hollywood, whose body was found in Boggs' office in April, 1988. Boggs, 56,  allegedly identified the body as Hanson's to defraud his insurance company.  </P> <P> Pretrial motions for Boggs are scheduled to be heard Monday. Jury selection is  set for May 1.  </P> <P> Hawkins, 27, Hanson's business partner and sole heir, collected $1 million in  life insurance after Hanson was reported dead, authorities contend. Despite an  international manhunt, Hawkins remains at large, they said.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Albert H. MacKenzie would not comment on how the extradition  of Hanson, who has been in custody in Ohio for more than a year, will affect  Boggs' trial or whether it may help authorities find Hawkins. He said there is  little chance that Hanson and Boggs can be tried together.  </P> <P> But other authorities involved in the case said Hanson's appearance is a key  step in solving the alleged murder-for-insurance scheme.  </P> <P> "Things could change -- it could be a whole new ball game," said Jerry  Treadway, a fraud investigator for the state Department of Insurance. "You've  got 'mister dead man' here now."  </P> <P> Hanson was arrested in January, 1989, and charged by Ohio prosecutors with  criminal grand theft. But the charges were dropped after more extensive charges  -- including murder -- were filed in Los Angeles, and California prosecutors  requested Hanson's extradition. The Ohio Supreme Court on Thursday refused to  review an appellate court decision to extradite him that was reached earlier  that day.  </P></p>

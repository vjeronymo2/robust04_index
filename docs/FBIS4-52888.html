			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  opposition Democratic Party released a statement on May 13  urging the authorities to release and reinstate those who had  been jailed or persecuted for political reasons and set free the  long-term prisoners, a Seoul-based radio reported.    Noting that those who had been "released" formally after  being arrested in the days of "the Fifth and Sixth Republics"  and were still being persecuted without pardon and reinstatement  numbered 568, the statement demanded their pardon and  reinstatement.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KADAFI, BESET AT HOME AND ABROAD, TURNS TO CHARM  </P> <P> Chunks of twisted ceiling panels litter the entrance hall in what was once  Libya's grandest villa. Paintings tilt crazily above overturned sofas.  Upstairs, a child's bloodstained mattress is encased in a glass shroud.  </P> <P> This is at once Moammar Kadafi's former residence and a shrine to Libya's  enduring rage -- a site where young Libyan soldiers and foreign dignitaries are  shuttled through by the busload to ensure that they will not forget the night  of April 14, 1986, when American bombs rained down on Tripoli and Benghazi four  hours before dawn.  </P> <P> In the months that followed the raid -- which, according to Kadafi, killed his  adopted daughter and injured his son -- the contentious, obsessive,  vision-struck Libyan leader, who had plowed like a solitary tank across the  world stage for a decade and a half, was left shellshocked.  </P> <P> Economic sanctions by the United States and severe travel restrictions by  Western Europe were bottling up the Libyan economy. A difficult war in  neighboring Chad was eating up a reported $1 billion a year and spurring  growing unease at home. Borders on two sides were shut from years of feuding  with Arab neighbors. Opposition abroad was mounting, and even loyal Libyans at  home were growing increasingly restless over boarded-up shop windows and long  lines for staples such as meat and bread. The longtime proponent of Arab unity,  for once, found himself almost utterly alone.  </P> <P> "I think in '86 he must have realized that if he continued on in this way, he  was bound for disaster," said one Western diplomat posted in Tripoli. "Quite  simply, he realized he couldn't go on like this."  </P> <P> Now, concluding a week of celebrations marking the 20th anniversary of his  revolution, Kadafi is riding an unparalleled charm offensive that has  restabilized his regime and forged Libya's best relationships abroad since his  growing support of international terrorism first rendered the North African  nation an international renegade.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $300-Million Extravaganza  </P> <P> In a $300-million extravaganza this month hosting 17 heads of state from much  of the Arab world and black Africa, mid-level delegations from dozens of other  countries and more than 700 foreign journalists, Kadafi has worked hard to show  off both the successes of his tenure and his new-found amiability -- while  still pledging to export his odd brand of Islamic socialism around the globe.  </P> <P> In interviews last week, diplomats and business people say there are signs that  Kadafi has moved to distance himself from radical Palestinian terrorist groups  and the Irish Republican Army, reportedly refusing an audience recently with  two Damascus-based Palestinian guerrilla leaders and signaling up to 70  terrorist organizations and national liberation movements around the world that  Libyan financial aid may no longer be so readily forthcoming.  </P> <P> Western officials, used to the mercurial leader's swings of will and whim, say  the new overtures are a practical move, aimed at winning back U.S. technology  for Libya's aging oil fields and potential markets for Libyan agricultural  exports, should they materialize as hoped.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Has a Practical Side  </P> <P> But Kadafi the impatient revolutionary has always had a practical side. In 20  years, his pariah regime has transformed Libya from a land of devastating  poverty to a country with the second-highest per capita income in Africa, a  nearly 90% literacy rate -- and, for a desert-bound nation of just 4.3 million  people, an astonishing presence in the global consciousness.  </P> <P> "Perhaps some people may think that such a revolution that may change the way  of living all over the world could not come from such a small nation as the  Libyan people," Ibrahim abu Kzam, deputy secretary general of Libya's People's  Congress, said late last month. "The most important and significant changes in  history were done by people who were not expected to be important people."  </P> <P> When Kadafi and his military colleagues seized power in a coup on Sept. 1,  1969, while King Idris was away in Turkey seeking medical treatment, Libya was  already riding the upward crest of the oil wave, but only a very few of the  rich were realizing the profits.  </P> <P> Whatever Kadafi has or has not done in the years since, analysts agree that his  revolution has succeeded in redistributing the country's wealth to a  significant degree, ensuring that most Libyans -- unlike many of their Arab  neighbors -- own their own homes and cars and have access to decent medical  care, schools and telephones.  </P> <P> Before the revolution, all of Libya contained only 300,000 units of livable  housing for the country's 365,000 families, and much of the countryside was  peppered with tin shacks. Government leaders say the last hut was burned down  in a celebration in 1976, and while some substandard houses remain in rural  Libya, Tripoli has been rebuilt with modern high-rise apartments and hotels,  most of which are owned by their tenants, either outright or on  government-subsidized loans.  </P> <P> Asphalt roads now stretch into the remotest regions of the southern desert.  Sand airstrips have been replaced with three international airports at Tripoli,  Baninah and Sabha.  </P> <P> Jana, the official news agency, said the regime has increased total hospital  beds from 7,589 to 19,661, established fundamental education for nearly every  child born after the revolution and reclaimed 267 million acres of land to  agricultural use.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Was Nothing Before'  </P> <P> "Libya was nothing before Kadafi," said 26-year-old Mohammed Salem Rheibi, a  mechanical engineer who has a 1988 Mazda and lives with his family in a  six-bedroom, three-story house in Tripoli.  </P> <P> The satisfaction is not universal, however. Despite Kadafi's show last year of  demolishing prisons and freeing political prisoners, outside opposition groups  estimate there are still 200 dissidents behind bars -- victims of Kadafi's  hated but now much less powerful Revolutionary Guards -- and no immediate  prospects for their release.  </P> <P> Moreover, Libya is only now beginning to come out of a devastating economic  downturn occasioned by Kadafi's enormous war expenditures, a decline in oil  revenues and the regime's long discouragement of private enterprise.  </P> <P> In the Green Book that serves as the political Koran of the Libyan regime --  full of Kadafi's pronouncements on Islam, popular socialism, life and Arab  unity that are intended to provide a road map for attainment of a true Libyan  jamahiriya, or "state of the masses," Kadafi had proclaimed that profit making  was one of the ills of capitalism that must be wiped out.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Businessmen Arrested  </P> <P> All over Libya, shops closed. Business people suspected of hoarding profits  were arrested. Lines began forming at grocery stores for even basic supplies.  </P> <P> Then, last year, in one of the first moves of his "green perestroika," Kadafi  declared that profit making wasn't necessarily evil if it was intended to  benefit the revolution. Thus was launched a major privatization program in the  retail and small-service sector that has led to new shops, restaurants,  vegetable stands, shoe stores and clothing outlets all over the capital.  </P> <P> In the old souk, or marketplace, behind Tripoli's Revolution Square,  storefronts and market stalls that a year ago were closed and shuttered are  open again, repainted in the mint green that is the color of Kadafi's  revolution.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bedouins Wander Streets  </P> <P> Strolling up the hot, rank, dusty alleyways are blank-faced Bedouins, the lines  in their faces caked with desert silt, women in white scarfs impatiently  pushing children ahead and teeming dozens of young men making their way  aimlessly from stall to stall, pausing to stare at silver lame shoes and blow  dryers.  </P> <P> Since Kadafi declared that Libyans should not have to perform menial labor,  Moroccans, Algerians and Tunisians -- depending on Libya's mercurial  international relations at any one time -- have been imported to wait on  tables, clean hotel rooms and drive cabs. Foreign labor also performs most of  the skilled duties required at factories and in the oil fields, Western  diplomats say, because Libya remains drastically short of skilled labor despite  all the new universities.  </P> <P> Spending a week in Libya, a country that is governed by an estimated 700  revolutionary "people's committees" that are intended to embody real democracy  at work, one has the sense that it is a nation run by committee.  </P> <P> Last week, a foreign diplomats' tour of a major new public works site was  abruptly canceled "for the moment" -- apparently because no one could agree on  how or when it should be conducted.  </P> <P> Throughout Tripoli last week, during what would normally be working hours,  dozens of young men could be seen in hotel lobbies, restaurants and cafes  clustered around television sets, silently staring at rerun after rerun of the  week's revolutionary parades and speeches.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Libyans Do Not Work'  </P> <P> "The Libyans do not work," explained one Western diplomat. "It's a society  that's based on sitting in front of your shop and looking into the air. Their  officials drink tea and sign papers, but they have no engineers, no scientists,  no technicians."  </P> <P> That is true, said another diplomat who has been based in Tripoli for several  years, because many Libyans have never had to work, and they are both the  beneficiaries and the victims of that state of affairs.  </P> <P> "The Libyans are the most apathetic people that I have ever met. They take the  same approach to political events as we do to meteorological phenomena," he  said. "Even when they come to the point where the government says, 'Close your  shop,' they don't say, 'That is enough.' They say, 'Well, maybe I can find a  way to sell my goods elsewhere.'  </P> <P> "The problem is, their lives have changed too fast. In 1956, they were among  the poorest countries in Africa, and that means in the world. Now, they have a  nominal per capita income higher than most countries of Europe . . . and all  this without them really having to do anything."  </P> <P> It was the vast pools of petroleum beneath the Libyan desert that made all the  difference. At their peak in the early '80s, Libyan oil wells were bringing in  $20 billion a year. Then, with the worldwide drop in oil prices and the U.S.  embargo, revenues slipped to a low in 1986 of $4.7 billion. This year, they are  expected to ease back up to $6 billion.  </P> <P> It is clear that Kadafi's new conciliatory mood may indeed be pragmatic.  Western economic analysts say Libya badly needs new American equipment and  technology in its oil fields, and it also needs to build economic solidarity  with its Maghreb neighbors in North Africa if it hopes to develop new  industries that will outlive the oil bonanza in the decades to come.  </P> <P> Next year, Libya expects to complete the first phase of a massive engineering  project dubbed "The Great Man-Made River" that Libyans hope could be one key to  developing a new, exportable agricultural industry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mammoth Water Project  </P> <P> Reversing the route of traditional water projects, the Great Man-Made River  will import water from desert aquifers to the coast -- via a $25-billion,  2,000-kilometer network of enormous concrete pipes carrying 5.68 million cubic  meters of water a day.  </P> <P> Libya is putting the finishing touches on a $6-billion steel complex at  Misurata, which will be one of the largest industrial sites in the region and  one of the four or five largest steel mills in the world, with an ultimate  annual capacity of 1.32 million tons of liquid steel, one analyst said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Support Galvanized  </P> <P> If the American government hoped that the 1986 bombing raid would destabilize  Kadafi's regime, it hoped wrong. If anything, the image of Kadafi's shattered  home, preserved within the walls of a military compound in Tripoli, has helped  to galvanize support for the man Libyans call simply "The Leader" and his  tireless fury at the West.  </P> <P> Perhaps more significantly, many of Libya's most influential citizens have  become comfortable even with the discomforts of a nation run by a white-robed  desert visionary.  </P> <P> "Some young people here are frustrated," said one successful businessman. "They  see American movies and Egyptian movies, and they say, 'Why are there no discos  here? Why can't I drink?' You know, I studied in London when I was young -- it  was 1968, the time of hippies and miniskirts -- and I had seen all that on TV  in Libya, and I said, 'I want that.' Then, when I got there, I had money only  to go to the movies once a week. My girlfriend and I would say, 'Oh, if we  could go to the movies Tuesday night, and Wednesday night, and Thursday night.'  But we could not.  </P> <P> "Now," he said, "I have a three-bedroom house, a wife. I have money to go to  the movies -- but here there are no movies. You see? It all passes. It is just  the face of our lives."  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TEXACO AND EXXON TO FIGHT $2-BILLION IRS TAX BILL  </P> <P> Texaco Inc. and Exxon Corp. said the Internal Revenue Service is seeking more  than $2 billion in taxes from 1979 to 1982, when the companies purchased cheap  oil from Saudi Arabia, published reports said today.  </P> <P> Texaco said Wednesday that the IRS claims that the oil company owes $1.79  billion in taxes from 1979 to 1981, when it sold oil to its affiliates at  below-market value.  </P> <P> Exxon Corp. said the IRS has billed it $269 million for 1979 in connection with  oil that the government of Saudi Arabia sold to Exxon and Texaco in a bid to  stabilize the world crude market. Interest on the Exxon payments could double  the amount of money the IRS seeks.  </P> <P> Exxon said it has filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court in Washington over the  IRS bill. Texaco said it also will fight the IRS claim.  </P> <P> Texaco and Exxon said that for three years the Saudis sold the oil cheaply on  the condition that it be sold at $4 to $6 a barrel below market, the Wall  Street Journal reported.  </P> <P> Texaco said the IRS is seeking $863 million in back taxes and $925 million in  interest because it said Texaco should have charged the market price when it  sold the oil to its affiliates, the New York Times said.  </P> <P> The refining operations, most of them overseas, reaped huge profits when they  sold the end products.  </P></p>

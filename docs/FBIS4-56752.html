			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- Yesterday, upon announcing the 1994  budget proposal, Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero stated that  from now on, the government will have the moral authority to  demand that other sectors of society, like businessmen and  workers, make sacrifices to enhance the anti-inflation policy.  He said: "We are cutting beyond the meat; we are already  reaching the bone." Having said this, Ricupero harshly  criticized the health sector, which is pressing for more funds  and is increasing its expenditures. Ricupero warned that social  security and health expenditures are endangering the budget  balance.    After stating that the government is firmly committed to  balancing its public accounts, the pillar on which the success  of the economic plan is based, Ricupero said: "These expenses  are jeopardizing the government's projects. There are no funds  left for other sectors." Planning Minister Beni Varas, who  charged the health sector with poorly managing its resources,  made a similar criticism two weeks ago.    Despite acknowledging the hardships and difficulties that  the  health sector -- hospitals included -- is experiencing, Ricupero  blamed previous governments for the worsening of the delay in  transferring resources. Ricupero said hospital expenditures  today exceed the overall spending of the government apparatus.    Ricupero added: "In March, we transferred 589 billion  cruzeiros for health expenses while overall state expenses  totaled 530 billion cruzeiros. This fact was worrisome because  health expenses are increasing geometrically." He noted that  President Itamar Franco ordered the Applied Economic-Social  Research Institute (IPEA), which is linked to the Planning  Secretariat (Seplan), to verify health accounts to determine  what problems are occurring there.    Ricupero reported that thus far this year, the government  has  disbursed only 23 percent of the one-twelfth portion of the  budgeted amount that can be used prior to congressional approval  of the budget. "This represents less than one-fourth of what we  could disburse," he said. "The public sector is making its  contribution to economic stabilization," he added.    In the draft budget submitted to Congress, the government  reestimated its revenues, bringing them up to $98.725 billion  this year. In the previous proposal, revenues had been  estimated at $88.7 billion. Estimated expenditures were also  changed from $88.6 billion to $98.723 billion. Thus, the  government expects to close 1994 with an operational surplus  (revenues less expenditures, including payments on interest on  the foreign debt) of only $2 million. The economic team  believes it will obtain a primary surplus (revenues less  expenditures) of $7.7 billion, which would be equivalent to 1.7  percent of the gross domestic product.    Government economists regard the budgetary balance as a  basic  condition for the success of the plan. The team believes that  upon the elimination of the public deficit, one of the main  causes of inflation -- the issuance of both currency and bonds  for the financing of current accounts -- will disappear.  Ricupero said: "We are proposing a budget that would prevent  the public sector from affecting the country's economic  performance."</p>

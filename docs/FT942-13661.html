			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / A family blown by the winds of change: Lucia van der Post expected a jolly party when her large South African family called for a reunion. But the country's imminent elections infiltrated every conversation Dear relations,' said the letter early last year, 'we come from a large, old-established South African family with a rich history yet many of us do not know each other. Let us have a reunion.' That was how it began. We, (husband, two children, one girlfriend and I) did not hesitate - we knew we had to go. What we did not know then, as we planned what we imagined would be a jolly family outing, was what extraordinary times we would witness. South Africa is in all our bones, in our hearts and in our minds, even though England is now our home. I come from an old Afrikaner family - my grandmother's family was there almost from the beginning, her mother was one of only two survivors of a massacre of the Liebenberg Trek. A great-grandfather fought at the battle of Boomplatz in 1848, two of my father's uncles were killed at Jagersfontein, my grandfather wrote two of the first novels that ever appeared in Afrikaans, had a law practice that spanned from the Orange River to the Limpopo, was the last chairman of the executive of the last parliament of the old Orange Free State and had 15 children. The chance to explore our history and renew these links was irresistible. Our first stop is Johannesburg and a weekend with a cousin. A distinguished lawyer, he gave three years of his junior barrister's life to defending Nelson Mandela, Braam Fischer and others in the Rivonia treason trials. He has had, on the day we arrive, to evict some squatters who are illegally occupying other people's property. They refuse to be tried by him because he is 'white' and sit sulking in their cells. 'Justice,' he retorts, 'doesn't have a colour. It has a quality.' But still they will not come. He lives, like most of white Johannesburg, behind electronic gates with surveillance lights and security alarms. We escape with some of his friends and children to his farm in the high veldt where we sit, like the old Afrikaners we are, chatting round the fire long into the night. The election, of course, is never out of anybody's mind. 'Listen,' says one of the cousins. 'What most of this country doesn't seem to realise is that we are going into this election without a proper constitution. Most of the whites are so relieved to have the moral burden of apartheid lifted that they can't see beyond election day. 'Everybody thinks Chief Buthelezi is an obstinate old fellow but we may all end up being grateful to him - he at least is holding out for a more federal constitution.' I am interested in how they will vote and most, it seems, will vote DP (Democratic Party). 'They are wimps,' says one of the younger members of the group, 'but at least their heart is in the right place.' Another is adamant that in spite of it being the best tactical way to vote (it being most likely to offer anything like a decent opposition to the ANC) he could never vote National Party. 'For 30 years they have been playing a devious game,' he tells me. 'They always had an end-game in mind. They knew this day would come and they plotted and planned so that they and the ANC could stitch up the future of the country between them. They have shopped the legitimate interests of all the other groups for the sake of their own relationship with the ANC.' One of the young cousins' wives, who works with a group dedicated to restoring land removed from tribes when the homelands were established, tells me quietly that she is going to vote ANC. 'For me,' she says, 'it is an emotional thing. All through my youth they were banned and now that at last they have a legal voice I must support them.' It isn't long before we all begin to feel a sense of heightened awareness, of what it is like to live life on the edge. This is far from depressing. At the dinner tables and round the braaivleis, round lawns and on the beach, the chat is endless, the debate furious, the anecdotes rich. Every day happenings big and small reveal the complexity of the issues being thrashed out. When we reach the Drakensberg mountain resort, where 140 or so members of the van der Post kith and kin are to gather, we can hardly wait to hear the individual stories, to find out how they all really feel. We are all saddened that my father, Sir Laurens van der Post, the elder of the tribe, is prevented from coming but Ella, his only surviving sibling, a younger sister, now 86, is to be family story-teller-in-chief. On the first evening as I join the gathering I hear a relation (one of the many surgeons in the group) say: 'Listen, six months ago I was very liberal. Now I'm a fascist.' I hold my breath. In the event all goes well. There turns out to be a remarkable consensus among the group. 'Since the minute we first set foot in Africa,' says a professor of music, 'this day was waiting for us. It had to come. We all know that and most of us welcome it. But we feel it is being rushed through, that it is such a quick birth.' Her sister is ruefully honest about the day her son brought home the Indian girlfriend he was to marry. 'Oh, he was always very radical - refused to fight in the army, used to send his savings to African charities and then he asked if he could bring an Indian girlfriend to his sister's 21st birthday party. 'I said no and he didn't push it. He just bided his time. Then one day her father rang up and Pierre, my husband, answered. Her father said: 'I think we should stop this thing right now.' But Pierre replied: 'I think they need all the love and support they can get.' 'The voice at the other end then said: 'If that's the way you feel then we will go along with it.' The next day my son brought the girlfriend home and this beautiful, educated, composed girl stood at the door and introduced herself. I took to her at once. But it is still hard that people find it so 'interesting'. I wish they could just be happy about it.' In so large a family where so many members are lawyers, doctors, professors, it is inevitable that debate about the constitution rages. It is, it seems, little understood that this so-called constitution is merely an interim constitution. It is 200 pages long, few people have read it and there is general despondency about the South African press which seems never to have examined it properly. Seldom, is the consensus, has the press had such a serious job to do and failed so lamentably to do it. 'It is not through malice, either,' says one. 'They mean well. They have simply been carried away by western liberal pressure for an election - any old election, so long as we can say one man, one vote, they think democracy will have been served. Never mind that scarcely anybody knows what they are voting for.' 'Do you realise,' says a cousin, 'that the incoming government is free to re-write the interim constitution anyway it wants? Do you realise, too, (and I had not until a few weeks ago) that we are not voting for a specific representative as in western-style democracies. When we vote, say NP, the NP will allocate the seat to one of its members. This means the allegiance of that member is almost certain to be to the party, the source of his power, not to his constituency.' Another cousin, who was a member of the Wiehan commission whose report laid the foundations for the big changes in labour relations law which began the opening-up process and whose commitment to change pre-dates de Klerk's 'conversion' by many years, is also deeply perturbed. 'Most of this group here (our family at the reunion) will vote pragmatically  -that is to say, they recognise that what is needed for any sort of democracy to function is the strongest possible opposition to the ANC and so, I can be almost sure, that most will vote NP. 'The difficulty is that history tells us that democracies function best in homogeneous societies. Here in South Africa where we have a multiplicity of tribes and cultures and languages, a federal system would be the best guarantee of peace and proper democracy. The seeds of conflict are built-in to the interim constitution as it stands - it gives too much power to a single group and neglects the interests of all the others.' The sense of dismay and unease is everywhere. It seems widely acknowledged that originally de Klerk promised the country a federal constitution, on very similar lines to the Swiss one, which would cater for different cultural entities, but was forced to abandon it by the ANC. The lawyers in the family (and there are many) tell me that most of the South African judiciary is deeply perturbed by the lack of a proper Bill of Rights. 'All my life,' says one, 'I have never thought I could live anywhere else. This is where I belong . . . but when the National Negotiating Committee threw out the Bill of Rights without even reading it - a Bill of Rights that had been drawn up by the most distinguished legal minds in the country - then I said to my children, OK, now I give you permission to leave.' Even so, few can begin to contemplate living anywhere else. 'We Afrikaners,' they tell me, 'have nowhere else to go. We can't go following our money around the world the way some of the British immigrants have done.' But mostly they do not even want to. 'I would miss everything about South Africa from the country itself to the different peoples, the complexities, the richness of everyday life.' But life, they know, is changing fast - we are reminded just how fast by the presence of a cousin, a Rhodes scholar and legendary rugby player for Oxford and South Africa. When he went with a delegation to Dacca to try and establish a dialogue with the then-banned ANC, he was declared a traitor to his country by de Klerk, lost government contracts for his architectural practice and was shunned by friends. Today he is a hero. For the young, affirmative action is already beginning to change the old certainties. The effect of sanctions and worries about the future have meant that there has been a deep recession. A young architect has almost no work; a recent graduate cannot get a job; a chemical engineer has had it made quite clear to him that the managing director's chair will have to have a black man's name on it. On the day we come down from our mountain resort we see on the evening news that there has been more bloody violence on the streets of Johannesburg. We stay at a hotel on our way down from the Drakensberg and the Indian manager says that all he longs for is peace. 'Few of us are guiltless; we all have cause to search our consciences. But I and my children, we feel passionately that we are South Africans. We don't want to leave.' You cannot be in the country long without sensing the deep longing for peace everywhere. The signs of the peace dove are on car windows, the motorway pay check-outs all wish one 'a peaceful 1994'. A Zulu driver whom we talk to in KwaZulu tells us that he will not vote. 'How can I vote?' he says. 'I know so little about what I am voting for. But I just wish the bloodshed would stop.' Everywhere we go we ask people how they see the future, how they are going to vote. 'Oh, I don't want to grow much older,' says the baggage worker at Durban airport. 'I am afraid for the future. Things are not better. They are getting worse. Everybody blames somebody else. I just want people to stop blaming the past. I want them to start from now, from today.' His words echo the words from Chief Gatsha Buthelezi's great speech made two weeks after Nelson Mandela was released from prison: 'We must all begin by forgiving one another for the mistakes we have made and it must be not an intellectual forgiveness but an absolute forgiveness from the heart.' And that in turn reminds me of the Sotho-Tswana myth recounted by a cousin who is a professor of Political Science at Stellenbosch University. It tells of the two wounded soldiers who come round after a battle to find that they, who are from opposite sides, are the only two left alive - one cannot see and one cannot walk. Without each other, neither will survive. This, as he sees it, is the parable for South Africa today. All the parties need each other. All are wounded. All have something different to offer and to give. But with each day's news comes the sense of an impending tragedy. A State of Emergency is declared in KwaZulu-Natal alone. The irony of Nelson Mandela and the ANC, who themselves suffered under the draconian rules of an earlier State of Emergency, imposing one on their Zulu countrymen is almost unendurable. We all agree that the violence is terrible but nobody seems to spell out the full import of this state of emergency. From now on if a policeman sees a man walking down a road carrying a hoe and decides to arrest him he can do so, without any explanation or court procedure. On our last day, as we wait for our flight, my daughter and I walk up and down the Durban beach front. Here, in my youth, only white children played. ('Can you imagine,' said a coloured woman to me once, 'the challenge it is to help your children grow up without bitterness when all your life you are having to tell them that no, that sea, that swimming-pool, that tennis-court, that fine house, is not for you.') Today there are Easter Bunny Competitions, surfing competitions, families of every colour, caste and creed, swimming, surfing, sunning, doing what people the world over do on beaches. But there is one difference - at intervals along the beach there are voter education booths where impeccably impartial information is handed out. They are manned by whites and Indian and Africans, working together, race at last seemingly irrelevant. We can see that the impetus for the election to go ahead is almost irresistible. Even those who believe it to be undemocratic see no way out. As we leave I am haunted by the fact that I know that a last grim battle is being fought - the prize, if it can even now at this late hour still be snatched, is democracy. The omens are not good. The world is so relieved to be rid of apartheid that it seems to care little about the new tyrannies that are rising up daily. Above all, who weeps for the 600 people, almost all black, who were alive when I arrived in the country and who now lie dead?</p>

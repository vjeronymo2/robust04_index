			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> MILLER'S THIRD SPY TRIAL OPENS  </P> <P> Richard Miller, the only FBI agent ever charged with espionage, betrayed his  country by passing secret documents to his Soviet lover out of lust and "to  make a quick buck," a prosecutor said today.  </P> <P> "He did not begin his (FBI) career to become a spy. But he did become a spy,"  Assistant U.S. Atty. Adam Schiff said in opening Miller's third trial on  espionage and bribery charges. Miller allegedly delivered an FBI intelligence  manual in 1984 to the Soviet emigre with whom he had an adulterous affair and  believed was an agent of the Soviet spy agency, the KGB.  </P></p>

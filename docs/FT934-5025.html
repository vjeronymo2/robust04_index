			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Authorised unit trusts brought into line - Treatment of companies' interest The Inland Revenue is to review the rules for the taxation of interest paid and received by companies. The review will also consider the rules on taxing the return on securities. Mr Clarke's objectives are to consider how far it is possible: To simplify the tax system by removing unnecessary distinctions between different ways of meeting the cost of borrowing and between loans from different types of lender; To allow the interest shown in the commercial accounts as a deduction for tax purposes; To remove the need to app-ortion the return on securities between capital and revenue; To rationalise the treatment of cross-border flows of interest to reflect international developments; To make it easier for businesses to comply with their taxation responsibilities. The chancellor is considering those issues now because reform of tax rules for other costs of financing, foreign exchange gains and losses and payments in connection with new financial instruments, will soon be complete. The Revenue will be contacting interested representative bodies soon to arrange informal discussions. Authorised unit trusts: the chancellor proposes to change the tax rules for authorised unit trusts. The rate of corporation tax they pay is to be brought into line with the basic rate of income tax and there are to be new rules for trusts that invest in assets which pay interest. The chancellor intends to place investors receiving interest indirectly through an authorised unit trust in the same tax position as if they received that interest directly. That will remove a distortion in the domestic savings market. At the same time it will remove a tax barrier to the sale of authorised unit trusts to foreign investors. The changes will take effect for distribution periods beginning on or after April 1 1994. Authorised unit trusts are taxed as companies. The dividends they receive from companies resident in the UK carry a tax credit and they pay corporation tax on their other income at a special lower rate (currently 22.5 per cent). The trust is treated as distributing all of its income to individual investors as dividends regardless of the nature of the income it receives. Investors receive their dividends from the trust accompanied by a tax credit. UK individuals liable at the basic rate of income tax have no further tax to pay on those dividends. So by investing for interest through an authorised unit trust they pay tax at only 22.5 per cent (in the trust) on interest, while if they received the interest directly, they would pay tax at the basic rate. Foreign investors, however, pay more tax if they invest for interest through an authorised unit trust than they would if they invested directly in the underlying assets of the trust. That is because foreign investors will always pay some UK tax on dividends they receive from an authorised unit trust. However, many foreign investors can receive interest free of UK tax by investing in assets such as Eurobonds or by making a claim under the interest article of the relevant UK double taxation agreement. The chancellor's proposals include linked changes to tackle those issues: The rate of corporation tax paid by authorised unit trusts will be realigned with the basic rate of income tax; Authorised unit trusts will be able to pay a new kind of distribution which will be treated as interest for tax purposes. That interest payment may be set against the trust's corporation tax liability on its interest income; The trust will have to deduct income tax at the basic rate from interest payments to investors who will receive credit for the tax deducted; There will be special arr-angements to allow foreign investors to obtain interest payments derived from certain (eligible) assets, such as Eurobonds, of the trust free of UK tax; Many foreign investors will be able to claim relief under the interest article of the relevant UK tax treaty on interest payments derived from other (ineligible) assets. Most UK individuals investing in auth-orised unit trusts will be largely unaffected by the changes. They invest in equity-based funds and will continue to receive their income from the fund as dividends with an accompanying tax credit.</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cuba faced with worst sugar crop in years CUBA IS straining to finish what could be its worst sugar harvest in recent years because it says it needs every tonne to help keep its crisis-hit economy afloat, reports Reuter from Havana. After maintaining a virtual news blackout on the 1991-1992 sugar crop for five months, the Caribbean island's government is now making the harvest a national public issue. 'Our sole option. . . is not to lose a single tonne of sugar,' it said. The government urged the country's sugar workers to make a maximum effort over the next few weeks, a message reinforced by daily television propaganda spots focusing on the harvest. The official media describe the current season as one of the most difficult ever experienced by Cuba, which has traditionally been the world's biggest exporter of sugar. The 1991-1992 harvest started late and has been bedevilled by shortages of oil, lubricants and spare parts that are essential to keep mechanical harvesters and mills running. Adding to the urgency is the possible onset of spring rains in May which could disrupt a late-finishing harvest. Even more worrying for Cuba, the difficulties come at a time when it needs every tonne of sugar it can produce to exchange for vital imports of oil, machinery spares and food.</p>

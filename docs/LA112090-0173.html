			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GORBACHEV AND BUSH PLAN SOVIET SUMMIT IN JANUARY  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush are planning a January  summit in Moscow, American and Soviet officials said today.  </P> <P> U.S. officials in Washington said that they are confident obstacles to a  long-range nuclear weapons treaty can be resolved in time for the meeting and  that setting a summit date could spur negotiations.  </P> <P> The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush is keeping to his  plan to hold a Moscow summit only if a strategic arms reduction treaty is ready  for signing. But they expressed confidence that the outstanding issues can be  resolved by the first half of January.  </P> <P> The two leaders discussed the treaty, which would reduce their long-range  nuclear missiles by up to 50%, at a dinner meeting Monday night, White House  spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> Soviet spokesman Vitaly Ignatenko did not tie the summit to an arms reduction  signing.  </P> <P> He said only, "U.S. President George Bush will pay an official visit to Moscow  at the beginning of January." Asked about an agreement, he said, "If it's  ready, they will sign it."  </P></p>

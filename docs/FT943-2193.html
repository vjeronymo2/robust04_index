			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Medeva joins SKB in vaccine development Medeva, the rapidly-growing pharmaceuticals company, has formed an alliance with its larger rival SmithKline Beecham that will 'secure the future of our vaccines division', said Dr Bill Bogie, Medeva's chief executive. The deal will give Medeva an unspecified royalty income from worldwide sales of a new generation of combination vaccines that allow many drugs to be injected at once. Dr Bogie estimated the world market for such vaccines to be Pounds 650m a year. Under the deal, SmithKline has been granted exclusive worldwide rights to a protein called 69kDa, part of a new whooping cough vaccine that is easier to include in combination vaccines. SmithKline said the deal would 'allow us to accelerate our development projects on combination vaccines.' Whooping cough vaccines are already part of a combination of three vaccines with diphtheria and tetanus (DTP) of which about 30m doses are sold each year in Europe and the US. Dr Bogie said that a vaccine that combines six drugs instead of the current three should sell for about Pounds 20 a shot. Separately, the two companies agreed to co-develop and market in the UK new combined vaccines containing DTP and a hepatitis vaccine. They are also in talks in extending the arrangement to manufacturing. Vaccines have for many years been the poor relation of other drugs mainly because they are given only once.</p>

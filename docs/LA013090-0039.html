			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRITTON ASKS YEAR-ROUND STATUS FOR ALL L.A. SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: SCHOOL BOARD TO VOTE MONDAY ON CONTROVERSIAL ANTI-CROWDING PROPOSAL  THAT WOULD AFFECT EACH PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENT BY 1991.  </P> <P> All schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District will operate on a  year-round basis by next year if the school board approves the overcrowding  relief plan presented Monday by Supt. Leonard Britton.  </P> <P> The plan reduces from three to two years the proposed timetable for converting  the district to year-round, partially in response to parents' complaints that  last month's staff proposal phased schools into such an operation too  haphazardly, causing problems for families with children in different schools  and outside programs that serve students.  </P> <P> Under the new plan, scheduled for a vote by the board next Monday, schools  would operate on the so-called 90/30 calendar, which puts students in school  for three months, followed by one-month vacations. It is similar to a  traditional calendar, but provides a shorter summer vacation and a one-month  spring break.  </P> <P> In presenting the plan, Britton left no doubt that the 612,000-student district  -- the nation's second largest -- is moving toward multi-track, year-round  operation.  </P> <P> "There is no question that a year-round, multi-track system is eventually what  all schools have to be engaged in," he told the board. "It is not a question of  'if'."  </P> <P> Initially, schools could choose either multi-track, which divides the student  body into several groups and creates about 30% more space, because one group is  on vacation at all times, or single track, with all students attending on the  same schedule.  </P> <P> Single track does not create more space, but would allow neighborhood services,  such as child care and camps, to conform and make it easier to add tracks if  enrollment grew.  </P> <P> Single-track schools would have to add other options, such as larger classes or  more portable classrooms, to increase capacity under the plan.  </P> <P> The district already has more than 100 year-round schools -- the vast majority  of them operating multi-track to relieve overcrowding so severe that it must  bus students to other less-crowded schools.  </P> <P> Under the current proposal, 109 additional elementary schools would either go  year-round or hold classes in double sessions beginning this summer. The rest  of the district's schools -- including junior and senior highs -- would go  year-round beginning in July, 1991.  </P> <P> The district is not likely to be able to air condition all the year-round  schools -- a primary concern of many parents, especially in the San Fernando  Valley where summer temperatures often exceed 100 degrees -- because state  funds set aside to pay some of the approximately $1 million cost per school  were recently diverted to other projects.  </P> <P> The board agreed to delay discussion of the controversial proposal until it  votes Monday. But the panel peppered Britton and staff with almost two hours of  questions, demonstrating deep divisions among board members on how, and indeed  whether, the district should take such a drastic step.  </P> <P> The board came to the brink of converting the district to year-round schedules  two years ago, then backed off in the face of parental opposition.  </P> <P> This year, the district faces a literal shortfall of seats by next fall if  enrollment continues to grow as it did this year -- by more than 15,000  students.  </P> <P> "Space is rapidly disappearing," Britton told the board Monday. "All schools  must participate in the solution."  </P> <P> In addition to recommending year-round operation, Britton's report proposed  other space-creating measures, including:  </P> <P> * The reconfiguration of schools feeding into Gardena and Verdugo high schools  so that elementary schools would provide kindergarten through fifth grade;  junior highs would provide sixth through eighth grades, and high schools would  include ninth through 12th, beginning next school year.  </P> <P> * The reopening of Burton Elementary, one of 21 closed schools in the San  Fernando Valley, as a receiver school for children from nearby overcrowded  schools.  </P> <P> To improve the educational environmental at current multi-track year-round  schools, Britton also recommended that those schools slightly reduce their  enrollment and that a pilot project be tried in three of the district's largest  year-round schools -- those with more than 2,000 students each -- allowing each  track to operate almost as a separate school.  </P></p>

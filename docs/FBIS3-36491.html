			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Gryzunov, Andrey Baturin, RIA's own </F> correspondents in Belgrade, specially for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  under the "Balkans" rubric: "Initiative Regained. Zhirinovskiy  Was the First To Visit Yugoslavia After the December Elections,  Now They Wait for Zyuganov"]    [Text] The Yugoslav problem, or rather approaches to its  solution, is becoming not only a weapon of political struggle in  high echelons of power in Russia, but also an apple of discord  between our country and its allies in the West. But if formerly  the Serb card was played only by a part of the former Supreme  Soviet in the struggle against the president, now Yeltsin's and  Kozyrev's stand on the Balkans is opposed by a mighty State Duma  bloc, where the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], the  communists, and nonaligned conservatives may become the main  sources of trouble.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's current visit to Yugoslavia is a  case  in point. Now they are waiting in Belgrade for Gennadiy  Zyuganov, who was invited by the New Communist Movement, a party  that garnered 18,000 votes in the latest elections.    The fantastic promises and statements Zhirinovskiy lavishly  made in Vukovar and Podgorice, in Bosnia and Slovenia, might be  dismissed as hysteria and paranoia. No other representative of  the Russian leadership, however, has thought it necessary to  come here and explain to ordinary folks by word and deed, just  like that, face to face, raising a glass and breaking bread, the  essence of Russia's Balkan policy.    At present, the initiative is obviously held by the  nationalistic patriots and communists. The democratic reformers  still keep the Yugoslav problem on the back burner and keep  losing -- points, so far; tomorrow, maybe, their heads. The  personalities of Zhirinovskiy and Zyuganov elicit mixed feelings  both in Moscow and in Belgrade. The fact remains, however, that  Zhirinovskiy is the first Russian deputy and prominent figure in  Russia to have come to this country after the December  elections. If we recall that before the October events in  Moscow it was also deputies -- Achalov, Pavlov, Isakov,  Konstantinov and their ilk -- who visited Belgrade, the picture  will be complete.    Those who invited Zhirinovskiy expected that his visit would  raise the spirits of the Serbs and the Montenegrins. Both --  those who are weary of living in trenches for the third year  running, and ordinary citizens, whose patience in not limitless  in the conditions of sanctions and blockade.    The expectations of the tour's organizers were fulfilled. At  a time when the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is bracing for a  new spiral -- either a scenario involving force; or the  partition of the scorched country between the Croats and the  Serbs; or lifting the ban on arms sales to the Muslims; or yet  more unexpected options -- Zhirinovskiy told Serbs that they  are no longer alone. That there is a party that will change  Russia's foreign policy, send an army to their rescue, and give  them new secret weapons.    Maybe that is precisely what earned the LDPR leader the  first  order in his career. It happened at a little-publicized dinner  in Belgrade, which was organized in the Russian guest's honor by  Arkan, a man wanted by police of a number of European countries  and by Interpol. A former criminal turned leader of the Serb  Unity Party, who has made millions of dollars out of the war,  decorated Zhirinovskiy with an order that had formerly been  given only to Arkan's own hitmen.    The consequences of the visit are easy to predict. As early  as this Saturday Zhirinovskiy promised to hold a rally in  Moscow. At the Duma he will do his utmost to crush the already  fragile positions of his political opponents under the slogan of  saving Orthodox brothers. The international community,  threatened with a reemerging idea of carving up the world into  blocs and unleashing a new war, which would not necessarily be  cold, will change its strategy and tactics with regard to Russia.    The phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy and Zyuganov, the alliance of  the nationalistic patriots and communists, is a qualitatively  new development in the former Eastern bloc countries. It is  neither pure fascism nor communism. As Adam Michnik fittingly  put it, it is a mixture of the idea of an ethnically pure state  with populist rhetoric and a nostalgia for stability under  dictatorship. This trend is currently thriving all across the  former Yugoslavia, from Zagreb to Belgrade. That is why as soon  as they heard familiar music from Moscow, Vladimir Volfovich's  Yugoslav counterparts invited him to reinforce their orchestra.</p>

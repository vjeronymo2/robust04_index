			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Taunton gains in buoyant market - Three drinks companies report varying levels of profits growth TAUNTON CIDER, floated on the Stock Exchange in July, reported a 32 per cent increase in first half pro forma pre-tax profits, from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 9.9m. Strong gains in a buoyant market by its premium cider brands lifted operating profits 17 per cent to Pounds 10.2m. Earnings per share rose from 4.7p to 6.1p; and a first interim dividend of 2.4p is declared. Proceeds from the flotation reduced borrowings from Pounds 10.4m to Pounds 1.1m, and interest charges fell by Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 2.2m, contributing to actual pre-tax profits of Pounds 8m (Pounds 3.7m). In contrast to the falling demand in other drinks sectors, the UK cider market increased volume sales by 7 per cent in the year to September. Taunton - dominating industry advertising with expenditure of Pounds 7m this year - outperformed the market to increase its share to nearly 34 per cent. Diamond White volumes grew 17 per cent and Brody, launched in May, sold 1m bottles in its first six weeks. In the draught sector, Dry Blackthorn recovered with a volume gain of 3 per cent, and Red Rock expanded distribution from 3,000 to 7,000 pubs. Four new brands have been launched into test markets. A good apple harvest this year has enabled Taunton to buy juice 'at favourable prices', said Mr Peter Adams, chief executive. 'Though market growth has slowed, premium brands are increasing share, and we are well placed to continue to grow both sales and profits,' he added.</p>

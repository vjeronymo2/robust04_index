			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Cambodian Elections: Polling stations in the battleground TO ORGANISE an election when four-fifths of the polling stations are likely to be within artillery range of a notoriously brutal guerrilla group which has vowed to disrupt the voting would seem like folly anywhere else. An election, however, is what the United Nations is determined to hold in Cambodia from May 23 to May 28, despite the concern among senior UN election officials that Khmer Rouge guerrillas will attack polling stations with guns, mortars and small arms. Nervous Cambodian voters can hardly have been comforted by the announcement that the US is sending 6,500 flak jackets, 10,000 helmets, medical supplies and flares for the election workers and monitors, and Australia is providing six armed Blackhawk helicopters. In Kompong Cham, the most populous province in Cambodia and one of the richest by virtue of its fertile farmland, the difficulties facing the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) as it seeks to bring peace and democracy to a country which has known neither for more than 20 years are all too evident. Here on the banks of the Mekong river, and throughout the country, Khmer Rouge attacks on Untac and fighting between the Khmer Rouge and the Phnom Penh administration have abated somewhat in the last 10 days. But most Cambodians and western diplomats regard it as an ominous lull rather than a cause for celebration; and even in this climate of relative calm the pot-holed road between Phnom Penh and Kompong Cham is best travelled with an armed UN escort of Indonesian troops because of daily killings and robberies by unidentified gunmen. Under the terms of the Paris peace accord signed by the four main Cambodian factions in 1991, all soldiers and guerrillas were supposed to have been disarmed before this election, but the decision by the extreme left-wing Khmer Rouge to flout the agreement means that voters will go to the polls in the midst of an unfinished civil war. The fact that the two military protagonists - the Khmer Rouge and the government installed by the Vietnamese invasion which overthrew the Khmer Rouge in 1979 - are both still heavily armed is dangerous not only for voters and election workers but also for the credibility of the election itself. On the one side, Cambodian government forces have threatened to kill people who fail to vote for the government's Cambodian People's Party; in Kompong Cham province alone at least 16 opposition campaigners working for the royalist party Funcinpec or for the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party have been murdered. On the other side, Khmer Rouge guerrillas - who fear the government will win the election and receive the international recognition withheld for the last 14 years - want to discredit the poll and have threatened to kill those who vote. In many cases UN volunteers working as district electoral supervisors feel they are risking their lives for an election of dubious validity, and 60 out of more than 400 nationwide have resigned since a Japanese volunteer was killed last month. Security concerns have forced Untac to reduce the number of polling sites in Cambodia to about 1,500 from 2,200. In Kompong Cham province, which will account for 18 of the 120 seats in the new constituent assembly, UN officials reckon that only 70 per cent of the 703,613 registered voters have a reasonable chance of reaching a polling station. 'I will not say that conditions are there for free and fair elections,' says Mr Theo Noel, the outspoken Canadian who is provincial electoral officer for Kompong Cham. 'If you talk to General (John) Sanderson (Untac's military commander) he will say everything is okay. It's not true.' Untac has been unable to stop blatant intimidation of voters by the government, and has stood by while Khmer Rouge guerrillas expanded the area under their control. Last year they were present in four of the province's 16 districts; today they are active in 15. The strongest justification now offered by UN officials and diplomats for pressing ahead with the election is that the alternatives - cancellation or delay - would be worse. In the words of Mr Noel, it would be 'a disaster for the UN and a disaster for Cambodia' to call off the voting. 'We have no choice,' he says. 'If we had an alternative I would never say yes to this.' For all the violence, many of the country's 4.8m registered voters still seem keen to vote. 'They are very scared, but they still want absolutely to go to the election,' says Mr Noel, although he acknowledges that voters will stay away if the Khmer Rouge does decide to attack polling stations. 'The bottom line is that if they have the choice between their life and the vote, they will choose their life.'</p>

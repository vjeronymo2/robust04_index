			<p>BFN     [Text] The two River Plate countries confirmed their  geopolitical alliance on 10 June by signing notes on work to be  carried out in the Martin Garcia channel, one of the two Parana  River passageways to the Atlantic Ocean.    The work involves the Martin Garcia channel's dredging,  buoying, and subsequent maintenance. The notes commit Argentina  and Uruguay to sharing equally a $107 million payment to open  the channel.    The governments still have two years to resolve their share  percentages of future maintenance costs, which unofficially are  estimated at $9 million.    For almost three years, a strong "lobby" [preceding word in  English] of Argentine grain growers pressed for Argentina not to  fulfill its obligations with Uruguay concerning the Martin  Garcia channel and finance work in the Emilio Mitre channel, the  other Parana River passageway.    Argentina's noncompliance would have been tantamount to  disregarding the River Plate Treaty--signed by [former Argentine  President] Juan Domingo Peron and [former Uruguayan President]  Juan Maria Bordaberry in November 1973--on the management of the  estuary and our country's river border.    In a speech during the signing of the notes, President  Carlos  Menem evoked Juan Domingo Peron's figure as a champion of  American integration and promoter of the 10 June action.    For his part, President Lacalle stressed that the Martin  Garcia channel work will allow linking Uruguay River ports with  the rest of the world, and the river will be 32 feet deep. The  work also will allow Nueva Palmira to become the waterway's  entry port, linking the Atlantic Ocean with our continent's  central region.    Incidentally, Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, who  is interested in the waterway's future and was invited to the  notes' signing ceremony, arrived in our country. The Uruguayan  Government also invited three former [Uruguayan] presidents,  Washington Beltran, Jorge Pacheco, and Julio Sanguinetti, to  witness the ceremony and confirm that the signed notes are part  of the state's foreign policy.</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOSPITAL UNIT EASES TURMOIL FOR ELDERLY WITH DEMENTIA  </P> <P> Derold Biggerstaff was sitting at his desk in his Playa del Rey home when his  wife, Ardnell, teetered into the room.  </P> <P> She wore a high-heeled pump on one foot, a running shoe on the other.  </P> <P> "My shoes are lopsided," the distressed woman told her husband of 51 years.  Biggerstaff explained about her mismatched shoes. "What should I do about it?"  she asked.  </P> <P> The Biggerstaffs, who are in their early 70s, are among the millions of elderly  Americans dealing with the wrenching reality of Alzheimer's disease and other  disorders that produce cognitive impairment or dementia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Helped by Program  </P> <P> Although there is no cure for Alzheimer's, the Biggerstaffs are being helped by  an unusual program at Century City Hospital that offers them both comprehensive  assessment and, if necessary, coordinated treatment of Ardnell Biggerstaff's  medical, psychological and functional condition, as well as psychological and  practical support for her husband -- all at one location.  </P> <P> Lynne Morishita, the nurse practitioner who heads the hospital's Center for  Geriatric Health, said the program is designed so that even people who are  confused can take advantage of it.  </P> <P> Instead of making and keeping track of appointments with a host of different  doctors, social workers and others, an elderly person who wants to be evaluated  at the hospital only needs to make a single appointment. If necessary, the  hospital will provide transportation -- usually in a van that can accommodate  wheelchairs.  </P> <P> About 10 elderly people with dementia are evaluated each week in the  Alzheimer's Disease Institute, which is part of the Center for Geriatric  Health, Morishita said. The cost varies according to the tests and procedures  done (the center, which also evaluates elderly people who don't suffer  dementia, accepts Medicare).  </P> <P> While being assessed, dementia patients spend one whole day at what the staff  calls its geriatric day hospital, a suite of examination, conference and other  rooms next to the hospital's in-patient geriatric ward.  </P> <P> Although they don't spend the night, they are assigned a regular hospital room  with a private bath. The main reason for that, Morishita said, is to ensure  their privacy. "A lot of the things we need to talk to them about are very  delicate," she said, noting that many patients are embarrassed by their memory  loss or other symptoms of cognitive impairment. They may also be sensitive  about such symptoms as the inability to control urination.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Determined by Team  </P> <P> Throughout the day, patients are seen by a team of physicians, including a  psychiatrist, nurses, social workers and others with geriatrics training.  Patients' condition, their emotional and intellectual state and their need for  speech therapy or other rehabilitation are determined by the team. Any tests  needed, except for X-rays, are done in the geriatric day hospital. Patients are  escorted to X-ray sessions by hospital staff.  </P> <P> One advantage is that the schedule is flexible -- important when dealing with  people who may have enormous difficulty expressing themselves, may be irascible  or may simply tire easily, Morishita said. Instead of starting right off with a  medical history, "we'll have the social worker go first if the person is  resistant," she explained.  </P> <P> Because the patient is there the entire day, the staff is able to observe how  well the person functions. Is the patient able to use the bathroom? Is he or  she angry or withdrawn? Does the patient try to wander away? What kind of  vocabulary does he or she use? During lunch, is the patient able to feed  himself or herself?  </P> <P> An evaluation of how well the individual actually functions is as important, in  its own way, as the diagnosis of any disease that may be present. "What we are  most concerned about is quality of life," Morishita said.  </P> <P> Dr. Robert T. Wang, whose specialty is geriatric medicine, said even excellent  physicians who lack special training may fail to identify the problems of  elderly patients.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Diagnoses  </P> <P> "They are very good at treating disease, but they may not be very good at  seeing the patient as a whole and what the person needs to function more  efficiently," Wang said.  </P> <P> Often, he noted, people who come in for dementia have already been told they  have Alzheimer's when they actually have some other disorder. Although  Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, affecting  between 5% and 10% of all those over 65, Wang said he and his colleagues see at  least as much stroke-related disease among their confused or otherwise  intellectually impaired patients.  </P> <P> Alzheimer's can really only be diagnosed by a microscopic analysis of brain  tissue, usually only done during an autopsy, Wang explained. Although  Alzheimer's disease is progressive and incurable, some other forms of dementia  are treatable.  </P> <P> Dr. David Trader, the program's geriatric psychiatrist, said about half the  elderly people he sees suffer from depression or some other treatable  psychiatric disorder. Prescription drugs may also cause dementia-like symptoms,  especially sleep medications and sedative-hypnotic drugs such as Valium.  </P> <P> The staff is not yet convinced, for instance, that Ardnell Biggerstaff has  Alzheimer's. Although she shows signs of confusion and memory loss, she  surprised everyone when she was asked if she had seen anything interesting  recently on TV. She answered, yes, that she had been disturbed by the murder of  young actress Rebecca Schaeffer, whose name she recalled.  </P> <P> Whenever possible, the staff likes to see the patients' families. Trader said  the team often asks relatives to corroborate information supplied by the  patient, who may have lost the ability to describe his or her problems.  Moreover, families themselves are often in need of psychological support  dealing with such painful issues as fears that they too will eventually develop  Alzheimer's.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Takes Toll on Families  </P> <P> Dementia takes its toll on the whole family, the team agreed. Besides listening  to family members' concerns, "we try to help the family adjust their  expectations," Morishita said.  </P> <P> Trader said he has observed adult children of patients with dementia "being  nicer to their own children," apparently because they realize that some day  they too may be disabled and dependent.  </P> <P> Sherrie Ellman is the team's gerontologist -- someone, in her own words, "who  has learned to look at the world through the eyes of the older person."  </P> <P> Ellman, who often develops a relationship with patients and their families,  helps obtain case workers for patients who need them, helps the families  develop long-term care plans and assists with such painful decisions as whether  or not to care for the ill person at home.  </P> <P> "Every situation is different," Ellman said, echoing Tolstoy's observation that  every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. The gerontologist routinely  answers families' questions about how to protect patients' assets. She also  arranges for legal advice from volunteer attorneys.  </P> <P> At the end of the day, the evaluation team meets to share their findings and  make recommendations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Staff Isn't Depressed  </P> <P> Surprisingly, the team doesn't find it depressing to work with patients who are  often not going to get better. Most medicine is like that, Wang said.  </P> <P> "Medicine in general doesn't cure," the doctor said. "It manages. It tries to  prevent further deterioration." Small improvements in the patient's comfort or  mobility or ability to communicate can be major triumphs.  </P> <P> "By and large," Trader added, "we can make changes in people's lives."  </P> <P> Although Ardnell Biggerstaff still spends much of her time staring off into  space, her husband is very glad they found their way to the program. "You feel  kind of alone in these situations," he said. "I don't feel so alone about it  any more."  </P></p>

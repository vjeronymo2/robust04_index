			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The process of Crimea's secession from Ukraine,  initiated by the communist nomenklatura, has gone so far that  the Crimea has in fact become an independent state. This  opinion was voiced by Levko Lukyanenko, cochairman of the  Ukraine Democratic Association, in an interview with the NOVYNY  television and radio agency. Lukyanenko believes that Yuriy  Meshkov's presidency is illegal, as were illegal Crimean Supreme  Soviet resolutions to introduce the post and elect a Crimean  president. Speaking of Yuriy Meshkov's possible activities in  the new post, Lukyanenko pointed out that the Crimean Republican  Party leader used to be a propagandist, while now he has became  president and will have to take into account realities.  According to Lukyanenko, Yuriy Meshkov's goal to improve the  lives of Crimean residents is not obtainable without Ukraine.</p>

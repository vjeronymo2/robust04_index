			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Fund VA has filed with the Commission on Form N&hyph;8A a Notification of Registration as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act and a registration statement on Form N&hyph;4 under the Securities Act of 1933 in order to register as securities the Current Contracts. Future Contracts issued through Fund VA or any Other Accounts will be registered as securities under the 1933 Act. Other Accounts established in the future by Travelers to fund the Future Contracts will be registered with the Commission as unit investment trusts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Fund VA currently is subdivided into twenty-one subaccounts (``Subaccounts''), each investing exclusively in shares of corresponding registered open-end management investment companies (``Underlying Funds''). Other Subaccounts may be created in the future to invest in additional Underlying Funds which may now or in the future be made available. Each Subaccount of any Other Account established by Travelers in the future will invest exclusively in the shares of a specific corresponding open-end management investment company registered with the Commission. Shares of the Underlying Funds will be sold to Fund VA at net asset value. Each Underlying Fund is responsible for all of its own expenses, including applicable investment advisory fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Sales, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Travelers, Inc. and an affiliate of Travelers, will be the principal underwriter of the Contracts. Sales is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The Contracts are designed for use in connection with retirement plans that may qualify for favorable federal income tax treatment under Sections 408, 403(b), 401(a), 401(k) and 457 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and for non-qualified group and/or individual contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The Contracts provide for the allocation of purchase payments to the Subaccounts and/or to a fixed account funded by the general assets of Travelers. Certain minimum purchase payments are required under the Contracts, which also provide for annuity payments on a fixed or variable basis. Fixed payments are based on the tables shown in the Contracts. Variable annuity payments will increase or decrease during the payment period. The first payment is based on the tables shown in the Contracts. Subsequent payments will increase or decrease depending on the net investment performance of the underlying funds chosen for investment during the annuity payment period relative to the 3.5% assumed interest rate used to determine the tables shown in the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to annuitization, Contract owners may transfer all or part of the Contract Value between Subaccounts at no cost. Currently, there are no restrictions on the frequency of transfers, but the right is reserved to limit transfers to no more than one in any six-month period. Currently, no charge is made for transfers among the Portfolios. The death benefit paid under individual Contracts and certain group Contracts for a death of the Annuitant prior to age 75 will equal the greatest of: (a) Contract Value, less applicable premium tax or outstanding cash loans; (b) total purchase payments under the Contract, less prior surrenders or cash loans; or (c) Contract Value on the most recent fifth contract date anniversary on or immediately preceding the date of receipt of proof of death by Travelers, less applicable premium tax, outstanding cash loans or prior surrenders not previously deducted. In the event of the death of an Annuitant on or after age 75, the death benefit will be Contract Value, less applicable premium tax or outstanding cash loans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Certain charges and deductions are assessed under the Contracts. An administrative charge of $15 will be deducted from Contract Value semi-annually for each individual Contract and for each participant account under a group Contract, and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> upon full or partial surrender or other termination, death of the annuitant, or commencement of the annuity payment period. This charge is to reimburse Travelers for its actual administrative costs expected to be incurred over the life of the Contracts. Administrative charges are guaranteed not to increase during the life of the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Applicable premium taxes, currently ranging from 0.5% to 5%, will be deducted from Contract Value upon death, surrender, annuitization, or from Purchase Payments at the time they are made under the Contract, but no earlier than when Travelers incurs a tax liability under state law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Contract owners may elect to participate in an asset allocation program (``CHART Program'') provided under the Contracts by entering into a separate investment advisory agreement (``Agreement'') with Copeland Financial Services, Inc. (``Copeland''). Copeland, an affiliate of Travelers, is an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the CHART Program, purchase payments and Contract values may be allocated among certain Subaccounts. Travelers will be authorized under the Agreement to redeem, in a non-taxable transaction, a sufficient number of units from a Contract owner's Contract Value to pay a quarterly fee, which will be paid directly to Copeland. In addition to a $30 initial fee, Copeland charges for its advisory services a maximum of 1.50% of the assets subject to the CHART Program. This fee currently is reduced by 0.25%, the amount of the fee paid to the investment manager of the relevant Underlying Funds, and further reduced for assets over $25,000 and for certain plans. Applicants represent that the fee payment arrangement will be operated in a manner substantially identical to that described in a no-action letter,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Travelers Insurance Company, et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (IP&hyph;7&hyph;93, avail. Sept. 3, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

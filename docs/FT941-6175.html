			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Mexican rebels agree basis for peace The Mexican government and rebel guerrillas have reached a preliminary agreement aimed at ending the peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas. 'We have reached the end of the first chapter of the dialogue of the reconciliation of peace,' Bishop Samuel Ruiz, the mediator in the peace talks, said yesterday. The government responded point by point to 34 of the rebel demands. Except for those of national scope, such as calls for democratic reforms, there seemed to be broad agreement on key issues. The government promised to meet rebel demands for improved housing, education, health, and employment in the state of Chiapas. The rebels will now return to their villages and consult with their supporters. The government is seeking to meet rebel calls for national electoral changes indirectly through talks with the main political parties in Mexico City. The opposition parties and the government have already reached partial agreement on changes to electoral rules, and an extraordinary session of Congress to approve the reforms now seems imminent. The self-styled Zapatista rebels seized San Cristobal de las Casas and several other towns in Chiapas on New Year's Day, in a revolt they said was prompted by the poverty suffered by Indians. The preliminary accord with the rebels did not prevent further weakening yesterday morning in the peso and the stock market, amid investor nervousness about the country's economic situation. The 24-hour peso/dollar exchange rate fell to 3.25 yesterday noon, down slightly on the day, but against a rate of 3.10 prevailing most of February. The stock market fell some 0.6 per cent to 2,502 on the opening. Analysts attributed the decline in the peso to the recent rise in US interest rates and the decrease in rates on Mexican government paper. Yesterday, the steady fall in Mexican short-term interest rates was reversed, as rates on 28-day government paper rose 20 basis points to 9.01 per cent. Foreign confidence has been dented by Mexico's low economic growth, with GDP rising 0.4 per cent last year. 'Many people bought Mexico for the growth and are disappointed by GDP figures,' Mr Jay Polaski, of Morgan Stanley in New York, said. The sell-off was a normal correction in a market that climbed rapidly in January and the final quarter of last year.</p>

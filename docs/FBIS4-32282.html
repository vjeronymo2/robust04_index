			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 21/6/1994 -- Gheorghe Tinca,  the Romanian national defense minister, returned home after  official visits to the United States and Portugal. On arrival  at the Otopeni Airport, Mr. Tinca said the two tours abroad had  ended with positive results. "What counts is that now I feel a  stronger sense of responsibility than I used to have before my  departure, and that is because the results of these visits  invite us to proceed as fast as possible to concrete actions.  The time for statements and shows of will is gone, in my  opinion. People expect us to join very palpable cooperation  actions," Mr. Tinca said.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDENT PROTESTS OF DRESS CODE MARRED BY VIOLENCE  </P> <P> Students protesting the first day of an anti-gang dress code clashed with  school officials and sheriff's deputies in the Antelope Valley on Thursday,  boycotting classes and attacking a patrol car, officials said.  </P> <P> Two students were arrested and two others were being sought.  </P> <P> The uproar coincided with similar protests on Los Angeles' West Side.  </P> <P> In the Antelope Valley, students were angered by a ban on all but official  school baseball caps and by wide-ranging authorization of school officials to  prohibit any clothing regarded as gang-oriented.  </P> <P> At Antelope Valley High School in Lancaster, a crowd of about 200 student  demonstrators who had boycotted classes rushed a sheriff's sergeant who had  detained four young men off campus, pelting his car with rocks and debris and  chanting "Let them go," deputies said.  </P> <P> The sergeant was questioning four adult gang members who had nothing to do with  the demonstration, Sgt. Ron Shreves said.  </P> <P> A 16-year-old boy described as a leader of the demonstrators was arrested,  Shreves said.  </P> <P> At Palmdale High School, an estimated 200 students staged a peaceful but noisy  walkout for three hours.  </P> <P> But at Quartz Hill High School, a 16-year-old boy was arrested for threatening  a teacher when school administrators began seizing banned baseball caps from  students, Deputy Gil Arce said.  </P> <P> Assault and other charges will be filed against the two arrested students, and  two others were being sought, Shreves said.  </P> <P> The protests reflected widespread student discontent with the dress code  adopted last month by trustees of the Antelope Valley Union High School  District. School officials began enforcing the code Wednesday.  </P> <P> On Los Angeles' West Side, about 75 University High School students staged a  similar protest Thursday, gathering on the school grounds and chanting "Hats,  hats, hats" on the first day of a ban on headgear as "distracting" and symbolic  of street gangs.  </P> <P> The hat ban at University High School was the first controversial decision of  the school's newly formed "shared decision-making council" composed of the  principal, teachers, parents and community members.  </P></p>

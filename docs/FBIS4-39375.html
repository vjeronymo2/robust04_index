			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed NEGA report in the "Georgia" column] </F>   [Text] On 12 June elections to the Georgian republic  parliament will be held in another three hitherto explosive  areas of western Georgia -- Zugdidi, Tsalendzhik, and  Tskhorotskusk. Each district will elect one deputy. (In  October 1992, when Georgia-wide parliamentary elections were  held, they did not take place in these areas owing to a  complicated sociopolitical situation. At that time the  districts were controlled by armed supporters of Zviad  Gamsakhurdia).    Among the six deputies running for one seat in the Zugdidi  district is Georgian Prime Minister Otari Patsatsiya. Born in  Zugdidi, he held responsible economic and state posts in the  district for several years. Many observers believe that Otari  Patsatsiya will win these elections in the Zugdidi district,  where his efforts to stabilize the situation in November 1993  are well remembered.    On 12 June, elections will also take place in the city of  Rustavi in eastern Georgia. Zhiuli Shartava, Georgian  parliament deputy from this city, was assassinated on 27  September 1993 by Abkhaz militants during the storming of  Sukhumi. At the time he was chairman of the Council of  Ministers of the Abkhaz Autonomous Republic.    Generally, the issue of elections in Georgia is very acute.  Some political parties propose that early parliamentary  elections be held, considering it important to renew the  parliament composition. Other parties believe that there is no  need to hold elections to the Georgian parliament until  Georgia's jurisdiction has been established over the territory  of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.</p>

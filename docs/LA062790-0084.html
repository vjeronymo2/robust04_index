			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE;  </P> <P> H-P'S PUETTE TO HEAD APPLE'S U.S. SALES UNIT  </P> <P> Apple Computer Inc. has completed a six-month shake-up of its top-level  management with the appointment of longtime Hewlett-Packard executive Robert  Puette as head of U.S. sales and marketing.  </P> <P> Puette, 48, was named president of Apple USA, a position left vacant by the  resignation of Allan Z. Loren in January.  </P> <P> He reports to Michael Spindler, who was named chief operating officer when  Loren resigned.  </P> <P> During a 24-year career at Hewlett-Packard Co., Puette piloted the company's  personal computer business from a start-up to an industry leader. His most  recent title was general manager of the personal computer group.  </P> <P> Puette steps into one of the hottest seats at Apple. In the first six months of  its current fiscal year, the personal computer maker's U.S. sales declined 2%  while international sales surged.  </P> <P> Domestic sales in the second quarter accounted for just 53% of Apple's $1.35  billion in revenue, compared to 60% in the same quarter of 1989.  </P> <P> Critics have faulted the company for failing to meet increased competition from  makers of low-cost IBM-compatible personal computers. While Apple's prices  remain relatively high, makers of less expensive machines have adopted many of  the ease-of-use features that fueled the original popularity of the Apple  Macintosh computer.  </P> <P> After Spindler's appointment, Apple Chairman and Chief Executive John Sculley  took charge of new product development. Jean-Louis Gassee, president of Apple  Products, resigned.  </P></p>

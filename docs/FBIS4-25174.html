			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by Zhong Min (6988 2404): "A Second </F> Batch of Mainland Enterprises To Be Listed in the United States"]    [Text] Recently, the Beijing authorities named a second  batch of 22 state-owned enterprises which have been given  permission to seek listings abroad. While most of them will be  listed in Hong Kong, five are heading toward the United States.  The following enterprises are expected to go to the U.S. stock  market one after another beginning in June: China Eastern  Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Huaneng Electrical, Shandong  Electric Power, and Tianjin Steel Tubes. They will make up the  second batch of "mountain-climbing tigers on the U.S. stock  market," following in the footsteps of Brilliance Automobile,  Yichu Motorcycles, China Tire, and Shanghai Petrochemical, which  were listed in the United States beginning in October 1992.    The term "mountain-climbing tigers on the U.S. stock market"  was invented by some Wall Street stock brokers in New York, as  mainland enterprises showed such a strong rising momentum soon  after entering the United States. For instance, on the very day  Shenyang Brilliance Automobile's shares pioneered on the New  York stock market, investors vied with each other and bought 5  million shares at the unit price of $16. By the time trading  officially opened, the share price had gone up to $18, and,  three weeks later, reached a high of $34. Another example was  when China Tire landed on Wall Street, and it sold 6.1 million  shares at a unit price of $17. A few days later, the price rose  to $18.75, after which it fluctuated before going up to $27 last  December, ranking among the 20 most active stocks in Wall  Street. Also, Shanghai Petrochemical initially issued 18  million shares at a price of $20.39, and, after some small drops  and big rebounds, reached a record high of $49.2 per share  toward the end of last year and became one of Wall Street's  hottest stocks.    The strong recommendations given by several famous  investment  companies in the United States contributed to the popularity of  mainland enterprises on the U.S. stock market. Before and after  mainland shares were listed, 30 fund managers, led by Morgan  Stanley, visited mainland China. On their return, most  expressed optimism about the mainland's economic prospects. A  senior executive of Wall Street's Peiji [1014 1015] Securities  said: "From a long-term point of view, China's stocks have good  prospects, because financiers and entrepreneurs in the United  States and around the world are mostly optimistic about the  Pacific rim economic zone with China at its center." Therefore,  Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch [5019 2651], and Maibonshish [5019  6721 2514 0823] all undertook to sell mainland stocks.    The second batch of five mainland enterprises are being  listed in the United States with a view to raising over $3  billion. Eastern Airlines plans to raise $1 billion to expand  its fleet and obtain other supporting equipment and, at the same  time, is taking advantage of this opportunity to draw on the  management experience of international aviation companies.    In order to standardize the listing of mainland enterprises  in the United States, the mainland's securities authority and  the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission signed a memorandum  on joint monitoring in Beijing in late April this year, laying  the foundation for bilateral cooperation in the securities  industry.    It is reported that around the time this Sino-U.S.  memorandum  was signed, Britain's London Stock Exchange told Chinese  diplomats: "We look forward to assisting Chinese enterprises in  overseas listing." Exchanges in Japan and Singapore also  expressed a wish to have Chinese enterprises listed on their  markets.    At a "Fund-Raising by Chinese and Hong Kong Enterprises in  the United States" seminar held in Hong Kong in mid May, Liu  Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Supervision and  Regulatory Commission, said: The U.S. market is the biggest  international capital market and has the largest transaction  volume and highest mobility of all the stock markets worldwide.  It is under strict supervision and management and its  well-developed laws and regulations and full protection for  investors give it appeal to many investors. Therefore, we have  made an initial decision that five of the 22 Chinese enterprises  in the second batch to be listed overseas will go directly to  the United States to issue shares and seek listings on a trial  basis. This is not only an expansion of the financial market  open to Chinese enterprises, but is also a further development  of economic reform in greater depth.    Liu Hongru also said: The success of Chinese enterprises  issuing H shares in Hong Kong has not only opened up a new  channel for fund-raising, but, more importantly, has indicated  that Chinese enterprises are able to strictly abide by the laws,  regulations, accounting systems, disclosures, and other  requirements of international markets and meet standards set by  international markets on share issues and enterprise listings.  Entering the large and strictly controlled U.S. capital market  will help improve the reputation of Chinese enterprises in  international markets.</p>

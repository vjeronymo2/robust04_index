			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Weak oil price prompts Elf to issue warning Elf Aquitaine, the French oil group scheduled to be the first big privatisation of next year, yesterday warned that 1993 profits would fall to little more than FFr1bn (Pounds 114m) compared with the FFr6.2bn achieved last year. Mr Philippe Jaffre, who took over as chairman in August, blamed the decline on the fall in the oil price, depressed trading conditions, provisions against stakes in other companies and exceptional charges for restructuring. He outlined a strategy of cutting costs, limiting capital expenditure and selling non-core assets to reduce financial charges and improve profitability. Shares in Elf fell by FFr15.8 to FFr416.7 following the announcement. Most industry observers in Paris, however, said the forecast 20 per cent decline in operating profits was largely in line with expectations. The planned exceptional costs reflected Mr Jaffre's desire to clear the decks for privatisation. 'He is getting the bad news out of the way,' said one analyst. 'By taking these losses now Elf is enhancing its recovery prospects for 1994 and 1995.' Mr Jaffre emphasised the strength of the group's core operations and the resilience of its cashflow, and said the dividend would be maintained at FFr13 per share. Most of the blame for the downturn in profits was placed on the effects of depressed demand in Europe and the weak oil price. The decline in the oil price is estimated to have cost the group about FFr1bn in net profits. 'Our core business is in Europe and we are being affected by recession' said Mr Jaffre. He added that recovery would be gradual, and that the group's chemicals operations would probably suffer a loss this year. Exceptional charges, which are expected to reduce net income by about FFr2.2bn for the year, include costs for restructuring, principally in the chemicals operations. Provisions will also be taken against the reduced value of some of Elf's shareholdings in other companies. Elf Sanofi, the group's pharmaceuticals subsidiary, also issued a profits warning. It said net profits this year would be about FFr800m after exceptional charges of FFr350m. Last year, net profits were FFr1.05bn. Clean slate, Page 27</p>

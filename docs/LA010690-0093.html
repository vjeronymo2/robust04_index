			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KILLER SAYS HE'S CHANGED, SEEKS REPRIEVE FROM DEATH  </P> <P> In a legal brief filed Friday, Robert Alton Harris has urged the California  Supreme Court to overturn his death sentence, arguing that he has changed for  the better in prison.  </P> <P> Hoping to avoid becoming the first person to be executed in California since  1967, Harris, convicted of the murders of two San Diego teen-age boys, said it  would be cruel and unusual punishment to kill him after he had changed.  </P> <P> Harris, whose case has progressed furthest through the court system of any of  the more than 200 men on California's Death Row, also contended that the  lengthy delay since he was condemned to die -- nearing 11 years -- has violated  his rights and warrants a new sentence.  </P> <P> Aside from those two claims, the nine other reasons detailed in the 180-page  brief were mostly technical requests for relief, Harris' lead attorney, Charles  Sevilla of San Diego, said Friday. A few, however, were responses to the denial  last September by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco of the  earlier appeal Harris had filed, Sevilla said.  </P> <P> If all of Harris' appeals are rejected, some death penalty experts have said,  there is a chance he could die in San Quentin's gas chamber by the end of the  year.  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court is due to consider this month whether to hear Harris'  earlier appeal, Sevilla said. However, the brief filed Friday will begin yet  another round of appeals for Harris, as the case works its way through the  state and federal courts.  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court already has upheld key parts of Harris' 1979 trial,  making it unlikely that the court will review his case, prosecutors said. The  California Supreme Court, meanwhile, affirmed Harris' death sentence 10 years  ago.  </P> <P> Harris was arrested July 5, 1978, by San Diego Police Officer Steve Baker, who  did not know that earlier in the day Harris had murdered Baker's son, Michael,  and Michael's friend, John Mayeski.  </P> <P> The 16-year-old boys had been eating their lunches in the parking lot of a  Jack-in-the-Box in northern San Diego when Harris kidnaped them at gunpoint in  a scheme to steal their car and use it in a bank robbery.  </P> <P> He ordered them to drive to a canyon near Miramar Reservoir, where he killed  them. Later, he ate their lunches.  </P> <P> In the brief filed Friday, Harris argued that it violated his rights to kill  him when he had become what one regular visitor called an "affable, extremely  friendly and obviously well-liked" prisoner.  </P> <P> Harris included in the brief 21 sworn statements from friends, other inmates  and even guards at San Quentin saying he had mellowed in prison.  </P> <P> Among the other reasons Harris said he should not be put to death was "newly  discovered" evidence of mental disorders that Harris claimed he did not know  about when he was sentenced.  </P> <P> The four alleged disorders -- including a claim of a post-traumatic stress  disorder that does not involve military service -- were not presented at the  trial and require neurological attention, Harris contended.  </P> <P> Sevilla filed the brief Friday with an intermediate state appeal court in San  Diego, under a special rule for the convenience of lawyers that requires the  legal papers to be forwarded immediately to the state Supreme Court office in  San Francisco.  </P></p>

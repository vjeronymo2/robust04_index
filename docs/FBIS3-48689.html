			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan, the United States Urged To Restore Their </F> Coordinating Capabilities To Avert Clash"]    [Text] The Japan-U.S. relations are becoming tense at a  time when Japan is reeling from political upheaval. With the  Japan-U.S. summit talks set to be held on 11 February, no way is  seen to break the deadlock in the Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks which have become a focal point in their relations. The  Clinton administration is increasingly irritated with the  Hosokawa government which has continued to hesitate to cut the  income tax and take measures to stimulate Japan's economy. The  question is that politicians are increasingly looking inward and  failing to feel a sense of crisis despite its existence as  ruling and opposition parties are locked in their negotiations  on a package of political reform bills.    What concerns us the most is that both Japan and the United  States are losing their coordinating capabilities to avert clash  between them. Looking at the profiles of both Japanese and  American delegates to the Japan-U.S. vice ministerial economic  framework talks which are being held in Washington, professional  bureaucrats from the Foreign Ministry, the Finance Ministry, and  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] are  attending the talks as Japanese delegates, while lawyers,  scholars, economists, and former bankers in Wall Street are  attending the talks as the U.S. delegates. It is said that the  U.S. delegates are acting based on their consensus of placing  importance on trade results and speaking in unison at the talks.  The unity of American bureaucrats is more cohesive than that of  their Japanese counterparts.    The U.S. side has repeatedly insisted on setting numerical  targets for the sectors of automobile-auto parts, insurance, and  government procurement. In response, the Japanese side has  continued to refuse to comply with the U.S. insistence, saying,  "Setting such numerical targets will lead to managed trade." The  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks have run into rough sailing  from the start and a way out is not in sight at all.    In Japanese-U.S. relations during the Cold War era, the  coordinating capabilities of the two countries worked on their  own when their negotiations were deadlocked because they were  Western allies who were committed to defending the principle of  free trade. A Japanese negotiator has said that during the Cold  War era, the State Department and the Treasury Department  placated the hard-line U.S. Trade Representative and the  Commerce Department whenever individual trade frictions occurred  between the two countries and the Defense Department came out to  defuse the bilateral trade frictions when they got worse.  Meanwhile, an American negotiator has pointed out that during  the Cold War era, pro-international trade bureaucrats in the  Finance Ministry and MITI worked to persuade hard-liners in  Japan.    The leaders of the two countries should display their  political leadership transcending the bilateral working-level  talks and the argument between the two countries over free trade  and managed trade. This is the only way to break the impasse in  the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks. The Hosokawa  government has been preoccupied with political reform and this  cannot be an excuse for the government to leave the  Japanese-U.S. relations worsened.    Rather than continuing to argue against setting the  numerical  targets, the Japanese side should present the U.S. side with  concrete steps to open the Japanese market in the individual  sector. It goes without saying that the Hosokawa government  needs to speedily take stimulus measures centering on the income  tax reduction to pull Japan out of a prolonged recession. Those  measures also will result in reducing Japan's huge current  account surplus. We hope that Prime Minister Hosokawa will  display his leadership when he makes political decisions as he  said to U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen.    It is said that President Clinton himself is the  hardest-liner toward Japan in his administration. With the  conclusion of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the  multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round of GATT), the  President is now aiming to gain trade results from Japan through  the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The President, however,  should consider that the idea of placing importance on the trade  results may undermine the relations of G-2 (Japan and the United  States) which are in a position to jointly manage the post-Cold  War world economy.    The continuing confrontation between Japan and the United  States at a time when they have to come up with common values  for the post-Cold War world is unfortunate not only for the two  countries, but for the world economy.</p>

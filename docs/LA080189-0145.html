			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FAKES FALL TO NEW COPYRIGHT RULE  </P> <P> Pirated copies of computer software were pulled off store shelves today as a  copyright protection agreement took effect between the United States and  Indonesia.  </P> <P> The price of an edition of Lotus Development Corp. software shot up overnight  from $1.50 for a bogus copy to $422 for the Cambridge, Mass., manufacturer's  original version.  </P> <P> In anticipation of the change, last-minute shoppers packed a central Jakarta  computer store Saturday and Monday, snapping up all pirated software manuals in  stock at unadvertised discounts, the store manager said.  </P> <P> The store was deserted today. Master copies of pirated software were locked  away, "for our collection," he said. Legitimate versions of WordStar 5 and  Lotus 1-2-3, third release, were displayed for sale.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- The Japan Automobile  Manufacturers' Association issued a report Tuesday [28 June]  summing up pending issues in Japan-U.S. automobile trade,  arguing that Japan's auto market is open.    The association said cooperation between Japanese and U.S.  automobile and auto parts industries to enhance bilateral trade  is bearing fruit.    It said the report was compiled on the occasion of the  resumption of Japan-U.S. negotiations for a new bilateral trade  "framework."    The report said Japanese automakers are continuing efforts  to  increase procurement from U.S. auto parts makers.    In referring to a sales drive in Japan by the "big three"  U.S. automakers, General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and  Chrysler Corp., the report said those firms still need to step  up efforts to sell more vehicles.    It said the U.S. automakers have not developed small  vehicles  with an engine capacity of less than 2000 cc which account for  more than 80 percent of the Japanese auto market.    The association said an English version of the report will  be  distributed in the United States later.</p>

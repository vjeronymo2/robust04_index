			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Yen recovers in the UK The yen traded in a fairly narrow range yesterday following a sharp weakening in Asian trading in response to a large stock market sell-off in Japan, writes Philip Gawith. The pound, meanwhile, strengthened across the board as the market took cheer from the Confederation of British Industry's quarterly industrial trends survey, which lent support to the view that a non-inflationary economic recovery is well under way. After falling sharply in Tokyo, the yen picked up yesterday in UK trading to finish at Y111.82 to the dollar, compared to Friday's close of Y111.21. The currency continued to rally in New York, registering a level of Y111.65 at the close. The currency's earlier weakness was prompted by the sharp fall in the Nikkei average of 954 points, or nearly 5 per cent, yesterday, the first trading day since Japanese political reforms were rejected last Friday. Opinion is divided about the short-term outlook for the yen. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, commented: 'The yen finds itself between a rock and a hard place.' On the one hand, US-Japanese trade talks are at a very sensitive stage. Should they fail, this would be positive for the yen. On the other hand, the fall of the stock market and the government's difficulties are negative for the yen. 'The market has not yet made up its mind which way the big break is going to be,' said Mr Hannah. In spite of the government's weak position, some are optimistic that it will still manage to introduce a stimulatory fiscal package. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, said there was an underlying market belief that the government would do a deal to ensure the passage of political reform and a further fiscal package. Mr Chertkow calculates that this fourth such package would be around Y10 trillion (million million), bringing the cumulative stimulus to about Y40trn, or 8 per cent of GDP - 'a huge dose of fiscal medicine'. While market consensus favours a weakening yen, Mr Mark Austin, treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets, said the yen could rise in the near term. He notes that there is 'no sign (other than in market positioning) of the capital outflow that would take the yen lower in the face of a still enormous current account surplus. On the contrary, Japanese investors seem more likely to repatriate funds, especially as many appear to believe that the Japanese equity market represents better value than others in the Far East.' If the government delays fiscal stimulus, the prospect of lower official interest rates becomes more likely. Mr Tony Northfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, notes that with the Japanese discount rate at 1.75 per cent, and some producer prices falling at a rate of 3 per cent, real rates for some companies are still quite high. Sterling rose across the board yesterday after the release of the better than expected CBI survey. Analysts said it indicated a further acceleration in output without any significant increase in inflation. It ended the day at Dollars 1.496 and DM2.6185, compared with Dollars 1.495 and DM2.6122 on Friday. The survey showed that orders and output had risen over the past four months at the strongest rate for nearly five years. Business confidence increased for the fifth quarter in succession while, for the first time since 1989, investment intentions show a positive balance with more firms expecting to increase spending on plant and machinery over the next 12 months. Mr Hannah at IBJ said the report had been quite helpful to the government in providing it with ammunition to deflect some of the criticism it is getting about tax increases. The report, he added, supports the government's argument that the recovery is strong enough to absorb the planned tax rises. The market appeared unmoved by the growing political row surrounding the higher taxes. The D-Mark edged a little lower against other ERM currencies late yesterday amid growing speculation of a German interest rate cut. Besides weakening against the pound, it was also lower against the dollar, which finished at DM1.7504, compared to Friday's close of DM1.7474. The New York trading session ended at DM1.7511. Inflation data from North-Rhine Westphalia, the first state to report January figures, came in at a better than expected 3.3 per cent year-on-year, after 3.5 per cent in December. Analysts said that if this pattern were repeated when other states reported their figures, then there would be increased pressure on the Bundesbank to reduce rates at next week's council meeting. In its money market operations the Bank of England yesterday provided late assistance of around Pounds 680m. After forecasting a liquidity shortage of about Pounds 1bn, the Bank provided the UK money market with Pounds 50m of early assistance. The central bank bought Pounds 50m of bills for resale to the market on February 9 at the established repo rate of 5 13/32 per cent. The Bank provided the money market with a further Pounds 12m of assistance later in the morning and in the afternoon purchased bills totalling Pounds 122m after revising its forecast of the shortage to about Pounds 1.05bn. These operations were at the established rate of 5 3/8 per cent.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / People (Names in the news): Where Haumer will hang his hat It was always clear that ageing wunderkind Hans Haumer would be the first to go no matter how the battle over control of Austria's third largest bank, GiroCredit, was settled, writes Ian Rodger. The question that intrigued Vienna's banking community after Bank Austria finally took over Giro two months ago was where to. Haumer, 57, an accomplished pianist, linguist and economist, came to Giro in 1989 with a mandate to sort out a bizarre problem. Giro's two largest shareholders, Bank Austria and First Austrian, were also two of its largest competitors. However, the chief executive's ideas were too clever by half for most of the modest savings bankers behind Giro, and in the end they disliked him even more than each other. Now he is off to Liechtenstein, as a part-time executive director of the big BIL GT banking group controlled by the principality's royal family. No problem with squabbling shareholders there. He will also teach a monetary policy course at the University of Vienna and is setting up a financial services consultancy - perhaps specialising in how to rub bankers up the wrong way.</p>

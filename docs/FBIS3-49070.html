			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 4th Corps press center] </F>   [Text] Today, at around 1200 the troops of the Croatian  Defense Council [HVO] and the Croatian Army directed fierce  mortar fire at the central parts of the city and the Mostar  district of Madoljice. Three people were seriously injured as a  consequence of the aggressor's activity. Today the Ustashas  used 120-mm mortars to fiercely pound the demarcation lines and  the residential areas in Bilo Polje, while the region of Bijelo  was the target of multiple rocket launchers. The district of  Blagaj was again exposed to artillery attacks perpetrated by the  HVO and Croatian Army troops.    By accusing the [Bosnia-Herzegovina] Army of allegedly  regrouping forces in the region of Blagaj -- as has been  reported by the Croatian media -- the Ustashas are looking for  an alibi for the daily shelling of this district and crimes  committed against the civilian population, as well as for the  attacks that they are obviously preparing to undertake against  the free parts of the territory controlled by the 4th Corps  forces.</p>

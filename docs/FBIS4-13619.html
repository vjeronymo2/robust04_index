			<p>BFN     [Text] If the election for prime minister were held today,  Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu would get 44 percent of the vote  to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's 38 percent, according to  Gallup-Israel. Eighteen percent of the respondents were  undecided.    This is the first time since Netanyahu's election as Likud  party chairman that he topped Rabin. However, in a three-way  race, in which Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan would also be a  candidate, Rabin would receive the largest number of votes -- 34  percent, to Netanyahu's 29 percent and Eytan's 18 percent.    The poll, taken in regular intervals since January, shows a  steady decline in Rabin's popularity, from a peak of 44 percent  in a three-way race on January 31st, and 49 percent against  Netanyahu's 34 percent in a two-way match on that date.    The sample is country-wide, representing 500-600 Hebrew  speaking adults. The margin of error is 4 percent.</p>

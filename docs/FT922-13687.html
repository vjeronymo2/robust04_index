			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Shock waves around the globe: Turmoil in Japanese financial markets could herald uncertainty in the economy as a whole The latest plunge in Japanese equities has produced an unmistakeable sign of panic: top-flight Japanese financial companies have seen an increase in calls from foreign customers inquiring about their soundness. The fall of the Nikkei average to its lowest levels since 1986 has, with good reason, unnerved investors around the world. They are worried about the health of Japanese banks, about the slowdown in the Japanese economy and about the implications for their own countries of the turmoil in Tokyo. 'Japanese stocks are in free fall,' said Mr Takanori Tanabe, vice-president of Tokio Marine MC Asset Management, a fund manager, yesterday after the Nikkei plunged 577.38 points to 16,598.15. For optimists, there is a glimmer of light. The latest decline has been caused almost entirely by a sharp sell-off in bank shares, which have fallen by more than 30 per cent since the beginning of the month, compared with an overall 14 per cent decline in the Nikkei. A few fund managers are buying shares in blue-chip industrial companies, arguing that Japanese equities are now trading at their lowest valuations since 1985. But even these brave souls do not predict a recovery soon. Rather, the turmoil in stocks could herald considerable uncertainty in the financial markets and in the economy as a whole. Few investors would ignore the possibility of further nasty shocks, particularly from the hard-pressed banking system. Mr Tadashi Okuda, the president of Dai Ichi Kangyo Bank, warned yesterday that the sharp falls in stock prices was plunging banks into 'a very difficult situation'. Banks have become the most important victims of the collapse of the speculative boom of the 1980s. Leading banks alone have been left holding an estimated Y20,000bn (Pounds 86.5bn) in bad and doubtful debts which restrict their capacity to make new loans. Because they count some of their stock portfolios as capital, the decline in equities has also eroded their reserves. While the Nikkei index was above 20,000, the ratio of capital to assets of leading Japanese banks stood just above the minimum level of 8 per cent which the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) regards as adequate. Now the figure is about 7.5 per cent. There is, however, little risk that big Japanese banks will collapse. In extremis, banks can expect other members of their corporate families, or Keiretsu, to provide them with new capital. The Bank of Japan has stressed that it will not allow failures. If a leading bank were to run into difficulties, the Bank would organise a merger with a stronger institution, bankers say, before depositors were aware of the gravity of the problem. However, there is a danger that with barely sufficient capital, banks will be increasingly unable to lend. This could make borrowing difficult and expensive, leading to a further slowing of investment and a prolonged contraction of the economy. So far, economists find little evidence of a general credit crunch in Japan. Companies are pulling in their horns and so have less need of loans. The ratio of cash to sales, a measure of liquidity, is down from its peak of 2.0 to 1.7 but is well above its early 1980s average of 1.2. Broad economic statistics do not tell the whole story. Hard-pressed property companies and some small and medium-sized companies face difficulties in refinancing. Some economists worry that credit shortages might spread from the property sector if the economy recovers and loan demand increases. Last year, lending grew by just 4.4 per cent, down from a peak of 12.5 per cent in 1987. This year's figure could be even lower - far too low to sustain annual economic growth at 2 per cent, let alone the government's target of 3.5 per cent. As Mr Yukio Takayama, senior managing director at the Sakura Research Institute, an affiliate of Sakura Bank, says: 'When companies start asking for loans we will need official action to avoid a credit crunch - such as a temporary relaxation of BIS rules.' However, other central banks would probably only acquiesce in any request from the Bank of Japan for such a relaxation of BIS rules if the outlook for Japanese banks threatened to cause a crisis for the world's financial system. With property prices down 30-40 per cent from their peak in Tokyo and Osaka and still weak, the full extent of the damage inflicted by the property crash to banks' capital has yet to emerge. Other pockets of potential bad debt also lurk in the wings - for example, loans to stock speculators such as Mr Mitsuhiro Kotani, head of Koshin, an investment syndicate, who was declared bankrupt this week with debts of Y250bn. Normally banks could raise fresh equity. But this has been impossible since 1989 and is likely to remain so because fund managers are wary of Japanese bank shares. Fortunately, banks have so far managed to juggle their balance sheets to accommodate their loan customers. In the life companies, the biggest group of institutional investors, they have a ready source of subordinated loans, which they are allowed to count as capital rather than debt for BIS purposes. They raised about Y2,000bn in the financial year to March, on top of Y4,000bn the previous year. But there is a limit to what can be raised by subordinated loans, not least because the life companies also lend directly to industrial companies. To make matters worse, the implosion in the stock market has robbed Japanese companies of alternative equity capital. Companies have closed the funding gap by issuing bonds, raising a total of Y12,500bn on capital markets in the year to March. But the cost of debt is above 6 per cent, compared with less than 1 per cent for equity-linked capital in 1989. Such an increase acts as a powerful drag on investment. As for the international impact of Tokyo's plunge, there are three main effects: the retreat of Japanese banks from international markets; the repatriation of capital into Japan; and the loss of confidence in the markets. Japanese banks have cut their assets in overseas markets more than at home. In international markets, the Japanese share of new credits to non-bank companies has fallen from 46 per cent in 1985-89 to 5 per cent in 1989 to mid-1991, according to the BIS. This has less effect than it might seem, because other banks, notably German, have filled the gap left by the Japanese. Banks do not generally raise funds in one industrialised country to lend in another. They operate in the same market, usually borrowing short-term and lending long, acting as intermediaries. Even if there is no overall shortage of credit, some individual borrowers previously favoured by Japanese banks are under pressure. Japanese banks were big lenders to property developers, particularly in the US, to people such as Mr Donald Trump. Given the depressed state of the property market, a developer, even a sound one, might have trouble replacing his Japanese bank. As one Japanese banker says: 'There are plenty of mismatches between lenders and borrowers.' The impact of capital repatriation is more serious. In the late 1980s Japan was the world's biggest capital exporter - investing a net Dollars 136bn overseas in 1987, mostly in securities. Last year the outflow turned to a net inflow of Dollars 36.6bn. Japanese investments in bonds have held up, since foreign yields are mostly higher than Japan's. But investments with higher risks - equities, property and direct investments - have fallen. This mainly reflects the slowing of foreign economies, especially the US. But the slump in the Tokyo markets has cut the outflow further. The effects of the switch in capital flows has yet to become apparent, since the world economy has been in recession since 1989. But when growth recovers, the shortage of Japanese capital could emerge as a brake. This is particularly true for the US, where Japanese companies are most active. Mr Richard Koo, an economist at Nomura Research Institute, an affiliate of Nomura Securities, says: 'Japanese companies paid almost zero for capital in the late 1980s. Now they are in the real world. There are many investments they made then that they would not make now.' As for Japanese consumers, the direct effect of the stock and property price plunges has been to reduce wealth. But this is not a widespread problem - on average, the Japanese keep more than half their financial assets in cash or deposit accounts. For foreign portfolio investors the big question is whether to buy stock, now the Nikkei is 57 per cent off its peak. At current levels, the shares in the Nikkei index trade at about 35 times their earnings for the year to March 1992, down from a peak of 92 in 1987. The last time the ratio was in the mid-30s was in 1985, before the asset price explosion. But given the continuing weakness of the economy, many stockbrokers expect a further decline in corporate profits in 1992-93, of up to 10 per cent. The government and the central bank, the Bank of Japan, are unlikely to come to the rescue. The Bank has cut interest rates over the past year to raise business confidence, but it has yet to commit itself to a whole-hearted boost to the economy. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank, is still haunted by the ghosts of speculative excess. Meanwhile, the government had announced plans to accelerate public spending this year but, torn by scandals, it is too weak to intervene more decisively in the economy. Japanese financiers will have to work out their own salvation. Bankers say it could take three to five years to deal with their biggest problem - clearing the mountain of bad debt. But stock markets tend to anticipate the real economy by up to two years. So at some stage between now and 1997, yesterday's prices may look like a steal - as long as the target company does not go bankrupt in the meantime.</p>

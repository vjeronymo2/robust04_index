			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Lonrho slide expected ANNUAL results from Lonrho were a late shock to the market. The group announced annual profits well below expectations, a reduced dividend and a decision to pass the forthcoming interim dividend. The shares had been firm during the day, bouncing back from the effect of recent bear raids on the stock and buoyed by the news of a disposal. The sale, of a 50 per cent stake in German freight forwarder Kuehne &amp; Nagel, is likely to boost 1992 profits by around Pounds 85m. There was a feeling that Lonrho might have delayed announcing its results until after the market closed because it intended to announce a big South African disposal. At the official close, the shares stood at 164p, up 9 on the day with a hefty 6.3m traded. However, it has come down from 230p in late November and, in after hours trading, the price was marked down sharply, with marketmakers quoting a spread of 118 bid and 123 offer. One observer said a price as low as 110p was quoted. Assuming the shares open at those levels today, the price will leave Lonrho with one of the cheapest market valuations in the FT-SE 100 and put pressure on its future in the Index. At 164p, Lonrho is capitalised at just over Pounds 1bn, while at 120p it is capitalised at Pounds 787.2m. ICI suffer An early fall in ICI was misinterpreted as a sign that Hanson had decided to sell the 2.82 per cent stake it acquired in the company, and the shares tumbled 15 at one stage. In fact the fall was prompted by bearish notes from two securities houses. Smith New Court advised clients to trim holdings of leading chemicals shares because the whole sector is overvalued. The comments were part of a 20-page strategy note which is expected to reach clients on Monday. The house also cut its 1991 forecasts for ICI by Pounds 50m to Pounds 1bn after reducing its estimate by Pounds 150m only a few weeks ago. Meanwhile, the chemicals team at Kleinwort Benson said they have reiterated their view that in spite of the recent move towards cyclical stocks, expectations of a near-term recovery in ICI's bulk chemicals business are premature and the shares should be sold above 1250p. ICI shares closed 2 off at 1250p on turnover of 1.6m. Reuters firm Confidence over its new dealing system and enthusiasm in the US helped Reuters to close as one of the strongest stocks in the FT-SE 100. The shares rose 14 to 1060p. There was a strong belief in the market that dummy runs for Reuters much vaunted automated foreign exchange dealing system Dealing 2000-2 would be held in a number of banks in New York and London from early next week. Mr Brian Newman of securities house Henderson Crosthwaite said yesterday: 'Foreign exchange dealers have indicated that actual trading will begin no more than a week later.' He added that his forecast of Pounds 335m for the 1991 profits expected to be announced on February 12 was beginning to look conservative. Also, Mr Eric Philo of Goldman Sachs, who has had the company on his buy list for some time, was talking about it to US clients yesterday. Predatory talk, combined with a bear squeeze, helped push British Aerospace along in heavy volume of 6.2m. Talk in the market first of all fingered GE of the US as a possible predator, although this was quickly dismissed as politically unacceptable. Attention later switched to GEC as the market continued to focus on BAe's cash-flow problems and perceived lack of direction. The shares finished 14 higher at 298p. Ship builder VSEL is set for stormy waters after losing the Type 23 frigate order to Yarrow. News of the award came to the market late and VSEL was 2 weaker at 431p. Fading speculation over Vicker's sale of its stake in Rolls Royce left the parent company 4 lighter at 181p. Rolls eased a penny to 139p. Small rolling stock producer Waggon added 13 to 373p as a buyer moved into a thin market. A leap in the Hong Kong market sent Cable &amp; Wireless surging 16 to 595p in volume of 2.4m. Around 60 per cent of the telecoms group's income comes from the British colony. Further speculation of the imminent deal between British Airways and the Dutch airline KLM added 7 to BA at 251p. Park Food Group jumped 54 to 483p on a reduction in half-year losses, a sharply increased interim dividend and a confident statement from the chairman. A repetition of a November profits warning prompted Ranks Hovis McDougall to fall 14 to 215p. A strong performance from holiday groups followed Airtours' AGM, in which the company announced a 95 per cent rise in holiday bookings year-on-year. The group also announced a share split. The shares added 7 to 903p. Competitor Owners Abroad saw heavy volume with County NatWest putting through a line of 1m in a total turnover of 3.4m. The shares gained 4 to 107p. There was also heavy turnover of 5.1m in hotel group Queens Moat, the shares nudging forward 3 1/2 to 77 1/2 p. Recent buy notes have added to positive market sentiment. Paul Slattery at Kleinwort said: 'We are strong buyers of Queens Moat - we consider it to be the best hotel recovery stock.' Fisons fell 16 to 336p with 8m traded on concerns that the drugs Opticrom and Imferon, banned last year by the US Food and Drug Administration, would not be back on the US market before the half year, later than previously thought. As a result Hoare Govett revised its 1992 profit forecast to Pounds 230m from Pounds 245m, although remaining a buyer of the stock. Strauss Turnbull cut its 1992 profit forecast to Pounds 220m from Pounds 239m for the same reason. A hefty and positive analysis of the pharmaceuticals stocks from Nikko Securities helped the sector's stars to gain ground. Nikko's Mr Andrew Porter highlighted the high growth rates and the defensive characteristics of drug stocks, and the persistent recession. SmithKline Beecham, which remains one of the house's top eight buys, rose 6 to 891p. Glaxo recovered 12 to 855p. Commercial Union fell 4 to 468p after Barclays de Zoete Wedd recommended a switch out of the insurance company and into Sun Alliance Group, which was unchanged at 292p. According to BZW, Commercial Union has outperformed the market by about 20 per cent since the beginning of December, while Sun Alliance has underperformed by 30 per cent since July. This may give Sun Alliance more room to raise its dividend than Commercial Union. Severe losses in the insurance industry is not the reason to close 39 small UK branches, said Sun Alliance yesterday. It is simply a matter of cost effectiveness, and the company plans to concentrate all non-life business in 50 major branch locations over the next five months. Banks maintained a weak tone, with Barclays losing 5 to 384p and Lloyds 6 to 393p. This followed recent depressing analysis of the sector and expectations of large provisions for bad debts when the big four clearing banks announce their annual results towards the end of February. Analysis by Shearson Lehman Brothers suggests that although 'Lloyds clearly remains the quality stock in the big four', National Westminster, down 3 at 284p yesterday, is the prime recommendation, because of an expected 'substantial loss elimination from its US operations'. In contrast, analysts at County NatWest recently suggested that their parent company has more than its fair share of problems with its balance sheet, and recommended Bank of Scotland, down 3 at 107p, as the best buy in the sector. Water shares rebounded in a technical rally, after recent consistent weakness. In thin trading, Northumbria Water gained 9 to 365p and Thames Water added 6 to 346p. Analyst Dr Angela Whelan at BZW said: 'Because of the recent general climate of uncertainty the shares have become cheap and are now looking quite attractive, The outlook however remains volatile.'

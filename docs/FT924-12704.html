			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Technology: Fewer jobs in the high-tech sector - Technically Speaking High-technology industries are frequently called an 'engine for economic growth'. Many have mistakenly taken this to mean that growth in high-technology industries will lead to rising employment, offsetting the declines in 'maturing' industries. Yet recent trends in the electronics and computer sectors raise serious questions about the presumption that technology will continue to create new jobs. Just this month Compaq Computer cut its workforce, in the US and Scotland, by 1,000 people and Hewlett-Packard announced plans to reduce employment by 2,700 over the next few months. Apple Computer is closing a California plant with the loss of 345 jobs. Amdahl is cutting back by 900, and at Cray Research 650 employees must go. All this comes against the backdrop of 'downsizing' at IBM, which expects to reduce its workforce by 40,000 this year, and at Digital Equipment which is cutting 28,000 jobs. US information-technology industries, far from representing a source of jobs growth, have become significant contributors to rising unemployment. In the US alone, employment in electronics industries has declined by about 10 per cent, or 265,000 jobs, over the past three years, according to data compiled by the American Electronics Association (AEA), a US industry trade group. 'It is rapidly becoming apparent that this pattern (of declining employment) is not of short-term duration and not wholly the result of the recent recessionary period,' Richard Iverson, AEA president and chief executive, has concluded. The AEA and several other industry groups have laid the blame for US job losses on Japan. 'Although the world market for electronics products and services has been expanding, our share of that pie has been shrinking dramatically,' Iverson says. Others have defined the problem in terms of declining international competitiveness, suggesting that the US and European electronics manufacturers are falling behind those of Japan and other Asian countries. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that there is an underlying trend towards lower employment in high-technology industries that has little to do with either global competitiveness or 'closed' markets. Put simply, it takes fewer people to develop, build and sell a computer or a chip or a piece of communications equipment today than it did a few years ago. Hewlett-Packard, for example, has increased its revenue per worker by about 50 per cent over the past four years. Other high-tech companies are making, or striving to make, similar strides in worker productivity. Even at companies that are increasing their share of the world market the workforce is shrinking. High-technology industries are becoming highly automated industries. Computer designers rely increasingly upon computer-aided design systems. Factories that produce semiconductor chips, disk drives and computers are full of robots. PCs are sold over the telephone in minutes. The pace of automation in high-technology industries is currently outstripping market growth. More importantly, few within the industry anticipate a reversal of this trend, even when general economic conditions improve. The drive to raise productivity and thus international competitiveness in high-technology industries is accelerating the trend toward lower employment, rather than alleviating it. Does this mean that governments should no longer support efforts to boost technology leadership? On the contrary, while high-technology industries may no longer be as fertile a source of new jobs in the 1990s as they were in the 1980s, the computers and robots and communications equipment that high-tech companies build have become the essential work tools of all types of enterprise. This makes technology leadership vital to international industrial competitiveness.</p>

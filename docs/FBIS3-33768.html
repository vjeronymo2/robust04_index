			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-SHA'B in Arabic on 21 January  publishes two articles charging government officials of  involvement in illicit dealings involving Fawzi al-Sayyid, a  discredited construction contractor.    The first article, a 300-word report by Mahmud Bakri,  appears  on the front page. Bakri writes: "New scandals are coming to  light with regards to the illicit dealings of Fawzi al-Sayyid,  Madinat al-Nasir multimillionaire. Al-Sayyid's illegal  practices were committed with the help of National Democratic  Party [NDP] officials, police officers, and members of the  People's Assembly and Consultative Council. Al-Sayyid has been  involved in various activities besides construction in the  period 1985-90. Some security officials have concealed a report  prepared by government circles about the multimillionaire's  activities in this regard. In return, these officials accepted  substantial kickbacks from al-Sayyid.    Bakri adds that al-Sayyid transferred a large part of his  financial assets abroad after "his relations with an official in  the Presidential Office deteriorated." The reason for the  strained relations was that the said official, whom Bakri  declines to name, wanted al-Sayyid to foot most of the bill for  land that the official bought in Ismailia and the Red Sea area.    The second article, an 800-word report by 'Imad Mahjub,  appears on the front and seventh pages.    Mahjub begins by reviewing the career of the Presidential  Office's secretary Zakariya 'Azmi and stating that "questions"  remain about 'Azmi's dealings, despite the "smokescreen" he  hoped to raise by filing a complaint against AL-SHA'B with the  Public Prosecution Office. 'Azmi, Mahjub claims, owns a  10-million pound [$3 million] mansion, despite his humble  beginnings as a junior employee in Cairo's municipal service.  The mansion was built "by a certain contractor who has won  other government contracts, including the mansions of ministers  and senior government officials." 'Azmi also acquired various  types of properties in the names of his family members and only  won in the People's Assembly elections because of heavy support  by the government apparatus.    Mahjub then relates the story of a piece of land that ended  up in the hands of Madinat al-Nasr multimillionaire al-Sayyid,  after being owned before by a Greek immigrant and then a drug  dealer. Mahjub claims that "a very senior official" helped  al-Sayyid assume possession of the 6-million pound piece of land.    Mahjub then claims that the government intends to stop  investigations into al-Sayyid's and similar fraud cases "in  order to save the necks of senior officials who are clearly  involved in these cases." Mahjub then describes al-Sayyid's  comfortable confinement in a prison hospital and predicts that  he will be "released on bail in a few days, after which the  storm will blow over and the case will be declared closed for  good."</p>

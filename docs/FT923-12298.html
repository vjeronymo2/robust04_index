			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / International Company News: Reichmann family sells jet for Dollars 7m THE Reichmann family has sold its Gulfstream executive jet to help pay the debt restructuring costs of Olympia &amp; York. The latest report on the ailing developer's finances compiled by auditors Price Waterhouse says the jet, which fetched USDollars 6.8m, was owned by a private Reichmann company outside the court protection order granted to O&amp;Y and its Canadian subsidiaries two months ago. O&amp;Y is restructuring the bulk of its CDollars 13.5bn debt (USDollars 11.4bn). Only its US operations remain outside the protection of bankruptcy courts. Lenders are in the unenviable position of seeing some of the income from O&amp;Y properties previously earmarked for debt-service payments now being funnelled into the company's administrative and restructuring costs. According to the Price Waterhouse report, restructuring costs - consisting mainly of fees to lawyers and accountants - will total CDollars 9.3m in July and August alone. All debt-service payments have been frozen. Price Waterhouse, one of whose partners is acting as O&amp;Y's information officer, projects the developer's Canadian operations will have a cash outflow of CDollars 8.3m in July and another CDollars 5.2m in August. Under a court order granted earlier this month, the shortfall will be funded as far as possible from the sale of unencumbered assets. The information officer said he expected O&amp;Y's first-quarter results, for the three months ended April 30, to be released in early August. The results are likely to include a large writedown on O&amp;Y's investment in the Canary Wharf project in London's Docklands, which is currently valued at CDollars 3.6bn. The Reichmanns' entire equity in O&amp;Y has already been wiped out with writedowns totalling CDollars 1.4bn in the fiscal year to January 31 1992.</p>

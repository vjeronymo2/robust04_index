			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bidder for Continental Airlines withdraws offer ONE OF the potential bidders for Continental Airlines, the US carrier which has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since late 1990, has withdrawn from the running. Benefit Concepts, a New York-based firm which was designing an offer which utilised employee stock ownership plan debt in conjunction with former executives of the airline, said it was abandoning the effort because of Continental's refusal to supply confidential financial information. So far, three outline investment proposals - from Mr Hurwitz's Maxxam group, from Mr Alfredo Brener's Houston Air, and from Air Canada in conjunction with a Texan investment partnership - have met the qualification requirements. A deadline of November 9 was for proposals.</p>

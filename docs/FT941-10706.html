			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Radstone for market via placing - Issue News Radstone Technology, a specialist electronics group which designs and manufactures advanced computer subsystems for industrial and military use, is coming to market through a share placing which is likely to value the Towcester-based company at between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m. The group is the independent market leader in the production of off-the-shelf computer boards for use in severe environments such as factories or weapons systems. Because its subsystems comply with the Versa Module Europe open systems standards it has benefited from the switch away from proprietary systems and from budgetary pressure on defence spending. The group, which also owns Foundation Technology, a specialist surface mount technology board assembler, reported profits before exceptionals of Pounds 985,000 on turnover of Pounds 25.9m in the year to end-March 1993. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.87m. Turnover has grown at a compound rate of 14 per cent a year over the past four years and the group currently has a Pounds 21m forward order book. Radstone's sophisticated electronic products are used in applications ranging from US submarine and Patriot anti-missile missile systems to medical nuclear magnetic resonance scanners, motorway toll collection equipment and North Sea oil rig safety systems. The group has about 500 customers worldwide with its 45 largest customers accounting for 75 per cent of sales. Last year its main customers included Marconi, Lockheed, Siemens, IBM, Thomson and GE. About 70 per cent of its sales are military and a similar proportion of group turnover comes from exports. The placing, sponsored by Beeson Gregory, will raise about Pounds 7m in new funds for the group, of which Pounds 4m will be used to repay convertible stock, leaving the group with a strong balance sheet and no gearing. The prospectus is expected to be launched later this month with trading in the new shares due to start at the beginning of March.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is  leaving his post to run for president. His last act as finance  minister was to present the bills for the new Brazilian  currency, the real, which will take effect in the economic  plan's third stage.    Minister Cardoso today presented to the public the one-,  five-, 10-, 50-, and 100-real bills as well as the one-, five-,  10-, and 50-real cent coins. The Central Bank is coordinating  the printing of 1 billion bills, some of which are being printed  abroad.    During the presentation Minister Cardoso said the new  currency needs credibility, and for this purpose the government  must be austere. It would have been easier, he said, to have  begun the economic plan with the creation of the real, but the  government chose the most difficult path, which was to create  the appropriate conditions by streamlining public accounts.  Minister Cardoso said he left the economic plan ready and that  he is sure it will work:    [Begin Cardoso recording] I am totally sure that the plan is  perfectly established and coordinated and that it will work. It  will not be affected in the least. Brazil has now found its  path, which it must follow. That is also the conviction of the  president. Therefore, I am leaving this ministry with absolute  calm. [end recording]    Minister Cardoso reported that the people must not worry  because the government will announce the measure at least 35  days before the new currency goes into circulation.    During a news conference, Minister Cardoso assessed what has  done so far with the stabilization plan. He expressed thanks for  the economic team's dedication, Congress' cooperation, and  President Itamar Franco's support. He said the president always  encouraged the plan and has been the main pillar of the economic  policy.    Minister Cardoso said it has not been decided yet who will  be  his vice presidential running mate. He said his party, the PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], is open to conversations  with all parties but nothing has been agreed on alliances so far.</p>

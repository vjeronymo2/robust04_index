			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K. K. Katyal: "Protest Over Remarks Conveyed to </F> U.S."; boldface words as published]    [Text] New Delhi. Oct. 29. Taken aback by the stridency of  the latest note struck by Washington on Kashmir -- that it does  not recognise the State's accession to India -- New Delhi today  conveyed its protest and anguish to the U.S. What particularly  upset the Government of India was the attitude on issues with a  close bearing on the territorial integrity of India. The acting  head of the U.S. mission, Mr. Kenneth Brill, who was called to  the Foreign office by the Joint Secretary in charge of America,  Mr. Haridip Puri, was told of India's concern.    In an aide memoire given to the U.S., India took strong  exception to Washington's "studied tilt" towards Pakistan, as  contained in the background briefing of the Assistant Secretary  of State for South Asia, Ms. Robin Raphel to South Asian  journalists based in Washington. The perception in Pakistan of a  considered U.S. tilt, it was pointed out, would not be a helpful  factor for the commencement of a dialogue between New Delhi and  Islamabad, for which the U.S. had been playing a useful and  constructive role.    The backgrounder, official sources said, contained elements  which were most disconcerting because of their fundamental and  direct bearing on India's vital interest. The aide memoire,  according to sources, regretted Ms. Raphel's remark, questioning  the "status" of Jammu and Kashmir, a stand never taken by  Washington in the past.    India drew the U.S. Government's attention to the drastic  legal and political implications of not recognising the  accession of Jammu and Kashmir. Did the U.S. intend to question  the territorial integrity of India and reopen the issue of the  accession of the erstwhile Princely States? Ms. Raphel's  briefing, according to the Indian Government, would certainly be  regarded by the public as biased and tendentious and not in  harmony with the Indo-U.S. relations.    Ill-timed: India's regret was all the greater  because Ms. Raphel's statement came at a time when Jammu and  Kashmir was in the grip of a complicated situation. A delicate  exercise was on to persuade the terrorists to leave the  Hazratbal shrine, and initiatives were on for reopening the  dialogue with Pakistan on all sensitive issues of mutual  concern. Her downplaying of Pakistan's role in instigating  insurgency in Kashmir was also regarded as a matter of concern.  This attitude was seen as running counter to the political  understanding that marked the Indo-U.S. exchanges.    One-sided public statements of the type made by Ms. Raphel,  it was felt, would only encourage obdurate elements. The aide  memoire was believed to have found Ms. Raphel's remark out of  tune with the recent diplomatic exchanges, especially between  the Foreign Secretary, Mr. J. N. Dixit and the U.S. Under  Secretary of Political Affairs, Mr. Tarnoff. Diplomatic circles,  which were agog with the talk on the subject, ascribed her  comments to her inexperience.    Fresh dimension: Two days ago, Ms. Raphel, while  repeating an earlier formulation -- that the entire State of  Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory -- elaborated that the  U.S. did not recognise the State's accession in 1947 and as  such, did not regard it as forever an integral part of India.  This gave a disturbing dimension to what, so far, was  considered, at the most the U.S. adherence to a technicality.    At one stage, when a senior Cabinet Minister conveyed to the  External Affairs Ministry his worry over the U.S. description of  the "entire" State as a disputed territory, he was told that  Pakistan should have a bigger reason to be upset as the areas  controlled by it too were sought to be covered by the "dispute."  Ms. Raphel's comment would strengthen doubts about U.S.  evenhandedness.    Some in the U.S. may well argue that its stand, as spelt out  now, was all along implied in its stated position and, hence,  there was no departure or a new tilt. However, it was one thing  to say that the State or the "entire" State was a disputed  territory or to suggest that its accession to India was not  valid or that it was not to be regarded forever as part of  India. Does it mean that the U.S. now did not see any use for  the ambiguity, consciously maintained in the past for purposes  of diplomatic flexibility?    Doubts over Shimla Pact: Equally surprising now  were the strong doubts over the efficacy of the Shimla Agreement  as an instrument for resolving the Kashmir problem. Three years  ago, the U.S. swore by the Shimla Agreement which, it was  stated, had superceded the U.N. resolutions of 1949 and 1950. Of  late, however, doubts began to be expressed on its efficacy on  the plea that its framework had not been put to use for over 20  years. Simultaneously, the U.S. began to refer to the need for  "taking into account the views of the Kashmiri people." There  was thus, a switch -- from support to bilateralism, incorporated  in the Shimla Agreement to what may be loosely called  trilateralism. Significantly, the U.S. also sought to project  itself as a potential mediator, of course, with one  qualification -- "if that is desired by both sides."    The latest remarks from Washington pointed to a continuing  U.S. interest, though what shape it could take was not clear.  According to Ms. Raphel, the cost of the Kashmir dispute was  "unacceptably high" and "it is time to look at the cost of this  dispute in human terms and in budgetary terms.... in 1993." At  another stage, she said the U.S. would consider a mediating role  if it were requested by all relevant parties, but "we are not  putting ourselves forward at this time as mediators."    The U.S. President, Mr. Clinton's reference to Kashmir, it  was explained, was meant to convey that "we see Kashmir on our  radar screen, along with Yugoslavia, Somalia and parts of the  former Soviet Union where there is a civil conflict." However,  "it was not a signal to suggest a secret U.S. strategy" on  Kashmir.    Gains neutralised?: The U.S. position, as  enunciated by her, now went far beyond what was stated some four  months ago by a visiting official, Mr. John Mallot. His  utterances led to sharp attacks on him, leading him to complain  that the messenger was sought to be shot for the message. Then  followed a conscious bid to undo the resultant damage to the  Indo-U.S. relations. Mr. Dixit went to Washington along with a  group of officials for comprehensive talks. The gains of that  mission may be neutralised now.    Ms. Raphel's comments, ironically, came in the wake of steps  that ought to have met the U.S. concerns -- like the  establishment of the Human Rights Commission, and the Prime  Minister, Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao's offer to talk on all issues,  including those related to Kashmir.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters suggested we mandate State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring be used whenever a facility is undergoing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination or closure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  While we agree with commenters that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installing a State monitor would be appropriate in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination or closure situation, we will not require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States to use this remedy in all such cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.421&blank;Directed Plans of Correction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters wanted us to define a directed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PoC as a facility-initiated PoC which the State or HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> orders the facility to implement. Commenters reasoned that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making this change would allow States to use directed PoC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more efficiently and effectively since facilities' governing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bodies will generally be more capable of drafting viable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans of correction based upon knowledge of facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources. One commenter wanted to amend proposed &sect;488.224  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to read as follows: ``HCFA, or the State (or the temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manager with HCFA or State approval) has the responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to develop a plan of correction *&blank;*&blank;*''. Another commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that when the State or HCFA orders (or directs) a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility to comply with the directed PoC, the State or HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have more authority to require the facility to revise any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aspect of the PoC which is not acceptable. The commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further suggested that the imposition of a governmentally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> created PoC on a facility raises questions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government's and the facility's respective liabilities if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the plan does not correct the deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Defining a directed PoC as a facility-initiated plan which HCFA or the State orders or directs a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility to implement would be virtually identical to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> way we have always defined a traditional PoC. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traditional PoC is a requirement when any deficiency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cited, except for isolated deficiencies where no actual harm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has occurred and there may be potential for minimal harm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exception to this is if a directed PoC is used as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy. The directed PoC can be used by itself for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies which cause no actual harm. We also disagree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a PoC developed by the facility would give the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey agency or HCFA any more authority than one developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the State survey agency, HCFA, or a temporary manager.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do not believe that to say ``HCFA *&blank;*&blank;* has the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility'' adds anything to the meaning of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section. Although it may be true that the facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governing body may be more familiar with a facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources, developing a directed PoC does not rest solely on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this knowledge. For the reasons stated above, we are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accepting these suggestions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the commenter's point that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governmentally-initiated PoC could raise a question about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State's or HCFA's liability if the directed PoC does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correct deficiencies, we do not guarantee that any remedy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will necessarily result in facility compliance. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directed PoC, as well as other remedies prescribed, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed and recommended based on the professional judgment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of State or HCFA staff and their consideration of which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy(ies) would promote prompt achievement of compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a remedy does not result in a facility achieving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance, another remedy may be imposed to safeguard the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health or safety of nursing home residents. This other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy could be an additional remedy from the same category,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or, if the deficiencies have been exacerbated, a remedy or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies from a higher category, including termination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, HCFA and the State will usually impose alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies prior to terminating a facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Other commenters wanted us to amend &sect;488.424  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to specify situations where a directed PoC would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandatory. These commenters asked that a directed PoC be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used when the following deficiencies are identified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Violations of admission requirements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Violations of Sarrassat requirements concerning notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Medicare coverage and rights to demand billing;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Violations of transfer prohibitions and bed hold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;All cases of violations of individual rights; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Care problems of specific, identifiable individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

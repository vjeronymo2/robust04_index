In a speech delivered to businessmen in The Hague, he urged  that countries bound to the EC with association agreements  should be welcomed into the Community as full members. A text  of the speech was distributed here.    Brittan said that the association agreements signed by the  EC  in 1992 with Hungary, Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics,  Romania and Bulgaria would create a free trade area stretching  from the Atlantic Ocean to the Black Sea.    But he said it was crucial that the Community open its  markets wider to East Europe and the countries of the former  Soviet Union to promote economic progress, democracy and  stability there.    "The future of the European Community itself depends on  integrating (East European) countries into a prosperous and  stable common future. It is as much in our interest as theirs,"  Brittan said.    Brittan also called on EC countries to retain faith in their  target of a single currency, to work harder on aligning their  economies, and to lower interest rates to promote economic  recovery.</p>

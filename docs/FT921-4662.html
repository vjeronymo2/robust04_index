			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Shadow boxing: Negative campaigning is the latest fashion We have at last reached the final act. Soon the electorate will have its chance to write the denouement. On Tuesday, Mr Norman Lamont will launch the Conservative election campaign with a tax-cutting Budget. In 48 hours - and quite probably sooner  - Mr John Major, the prime minister, will ask the Queen to dissolve parliament to pave the way for an April 9 election. It will be the first election since the 1970s in which the occupant of Number 10 Downing Street cannot be sure of the outcome. At Westminster this week, fever mingled with farce as the opinion polls fuelled the dangerous uncertainty. The Conservatives and Labour are still neck-and-neck with a fraction less than 40 per cent of the vote. Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats, a couple of points adrift of 20 per cent, at present hold the balance. So Mr Major swapped increasingly angry insults with Mr Neil Kinnock across the Commons despatch box. The government showered marginal constituencies with taxpayers' money and Mr Kenneth Baker bid for the gamblers' vote with plans for a national lottery. Labour paraded disenchanted hospital consultants to support its charge that the health service reforms put cash before care. The Liberal Democrats stole a dubious headline with a public claim to be the party of the pet-owner. On Thursday night in Downing Street, Mr Major was joined by his ministerial 'A' team to put the final touches to a manifesto which insiders say will 'catch the mood of the country'. Thatcherism will survive in plans for tax cuts, in an emphasis on personal choice and incentives to ownership; Majorism will manifest itself in an accent on 'quality of life' issues with a commitment to responsive public services. The 'A' Team stars chosen to sell the package to the voters are Mr Chris Patten, Mr Michael Heseltine, Mr Douglas Hurd and Mr Kenneth Clarke. One of them calls it 'Thatcherism with a human face'. For another insider: 'It has some good new things but it cannot be sold as a 'change the world' manifesto.' Labour too has settled on its message, even if the intricacies of the party's constitution mean that the manifesto cannot formally be written until the election date is announced. Its traditional status as guardian of the welfare state is to be underpinned by the grey-suited sobriety of Mr John Smith's approach to the economy. Investment, skills training and technological advance will pay for better health and education and for a more compassionate approach to the underprivileged. The prospectus will emphasise a consensual, rather than confrontational, approach to economic revival; an overhaul of the nation's crumbling constitutional architecture; an emphasis on the role of society as well as that of the individual. The leading salesmen for this moderate modernism will be Mr Smith, Mr Gordon Brown, Mr Tony Blair and Mr Robin Cook. What they will be selling, one of them says, is 'European social democracy'. The contrasting themes will provide the backdrop for the campaign war but they are unlikely to dominate the headlines. As a Conservative insider puts it, an election more closely fought than any since the 1970s will also be more unpleasantly fought. For all the talk about competing visions of the future, both sides acknowledge that in a phoney war lasting almost a year neither has succeeded in catching the popular imagination. The vogue is negative campaigning. Chatting in the lobby of the House of Commons this week, a senior member of Labour's team explained why he was confident that in a matter of weeks he would be sitting at the cabinet table. There was no mention of the avalanche of policy documents in which his party has set out a more detailed programme than any opposition in living memory. The outcome, he confided, would depend on 'whether the voters' determination to get them out exceeds their desire to keep us out'. After weeks touring marginal constituencies, he was sure that resentment at what he called the Conservatives' mismanagement of the economy outweighed the fear of a Labour government. At the heart of Mr Major's campaign will be an effort to maximise that fear. It will start with the Budget. Framing an electorally attractive package which will leave the government with a still credible claim to be the party of prudence has not been an entirely smooth process. Mr Lamont and Mr Major are said to have exchanged harsh words on how to strike that balance at a Downing Street summit 10 days ago. But they have now agreed on a package combining an immediate cut in income tax - a downpayment for the voters  - with a series of measures signposting more radical reductions across the tax system after the election. So the campaign will start on Conservative ground. Mr Kinnock, who has promised consistently that only the affluent will pay more tax under a Labour government, may be forced to repudiate any Budget tax cuts for those much lower down the income scale. As a senior minister puts it: 'It will define the campaign. If you want more money in your pocket, vote Conservative.' The message will be rammed home with an escalation of the offensive that Mr Patten launched in January against the tax 'bombshell' implied by Labour's commitments to higher public spending. In the marginal constituencies of southern England, voters will be reminded again and again of the opposition's plans to abolish the Pounds 20,000-a-year income ceiling on national insurance contributions. Then there is its proposal to limit other tax allowances and to extend NICs to income from savings. Mr Patten's timetable has this phase of the campaign lasting for a week to 10 days. The aim is to steal an initial march in the opinion polls and to destabilise the opposition before moving on to other Conservative issues such as the trades unions, defence and law and order. Tax and spending are pencilled in again for the last week of the campaign. The plan envisages that for most of the time Mr Major will stand above the fray. His strength lies in his experience in Downing Street and his popularity in the high street. He will be sold as the prime minister who is just as much at home on the doorstep in Bolton as he is striding the international stage with George Bush in Washington or Boris Yeltsin in Moscow. He has proved his worth and now deserves his own mandate. This though will not be the sort of election campaign susceptible to advance scripts. It is too close to be predictable. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have their own competing blueprints. This is the first election since 1974 that Labour is convinced it can win; and the first since the same year in which the third party has a chance of emerging with the balance of power. Mr Kinnock is ready to fight the first week of the campaign on the Budget package: but he will focus on the economy. As the Conservatives seek to scare the voters over tax, Labour intends to fan resentment over the recession. Time for a change is an old slogan but still perhaps Labour's most powerful. The view in the shadow cabinet is that tax cuts have been largely discounted by the electorate. Mr Kinnock is convinced that the elision he has made between lower taxes and higher borrowing has discredited in advance the case for a pre-election give-away. If the voters have learned anything from personal experience during the boom-to-bust of the past five years, it is that after the party comes the hangover. So Labour's pitch will be that anything promised before the election will be taken back afterwards. That its promise to 'build' rather than to 'bribe' offers the only real prospect of sustained economic recovery. So whatever Mr Lamont offers in tax cuts, Mr Smith will pledge to spend on investment and training, the health service and education. Beyond that, the shadow chancellor remains committed to the core of his tax package - abolishing the NICs ceiling and raising the top rate of income tax to 50 per cent - he might yet decide there was scope to phase the increases. Labour will then seek to shift the campaign to its agenda - the health service, education, poverty. For every Conservative horror story about tax, there will be a Labour one about a child denied a hospital bed. As one of Mr Major's strategists put it: 'In the end there will only be two issues: tax and the NHS.' After a year of near-permanent electioneering it is a less than edifying prospect. The Budget looks likely to hand back the initiative to the Conservatives, but the denouement is as easily predicted as the first national lottery winner.</p>

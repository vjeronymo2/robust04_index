			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE MISCONDUCT TERMED 'EPIDEMIC'  </P> <P> Citing their own statistics, several civil liberties groups have alleged that  police misconduct in the city and county of Los Angeles has reached "epidemic  proportions" and have called for formation of citizen review boards,  appointment of special prosecutors and legislative hearings.  </P> <P> Members of a coalition of civil and human rights organizations made the charges  at a press conference in front of Parker Center. The Los Angeles Police  Department quickly responded by saying that there has been a 322% decrease in  complaints of excessive force filed with the department over the last three  years.  </P> <P> That includes 652 complaints filed in 1988 with the Police Misconduct Lawyer  Referral Service, a private nonprofit organization that has staged "sting"  operations aimed at exposing police misconduct. The civil liberties groups said  there was a 198% increase of such complaints against the Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> But Lt. Fred Nixon, an LAPD spokesman, said there were 293 excessive force  complaints filed last year, down from 356 in 1987. "If you compare those  numbers, rather than a dramatic increase, you see an actual decrease of nearly  18%," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Linda Choy in Beijing] </F>   [Text] The first Special Administrative Region (SAR)  government will be set up well before July 1, 1997, if a radical  proposal by a group of NPC delegates is adopted. The motion, if  adopted may produce a Legislative Council with no directly  elected members, according to one of the delegates who supported  the proposal.    Hong Kong NPC delegate Victor Sit Fung-shuen, who supports  the move, said the proposal could demonstrate the determination  of the Chinese Government in setting up the second stove, while  Britain sets out the framework for the pre-1997 Government.    The motion reads: "In view of the lack of cooperation from  the British side and the absence of a through-train arrangement  [the NPC] urges the Preparatory Committee to form the first SAR  government in due course under the principles set out in the  Basic Law so as to facilitate the takeover of Hong Kong on July  1, 1997."    It is expected that the proposal will be raised in the  current session of the NPC to supplement a 1990 resolution on  the formation of the Preparatory Committee as stipulated in the  Basic Law. However, Mr Sit would not reveal the identities of  supporters behind the proposal but said at least 10 delegates  from Hong Kong and Guangdong had given their backing.    Under the Basic Law, the SAR Preparatory Committee is to be  set up in 1996 to prepare for the establishment of the SAR and  the formation of the first post-1997 government. This will  include election of the first chief executive and the so-called  "through-train" arrangement for legislators elected in 1995 to  continue to serve in the first SAR legislature. But, under the  proposal, the Preparatory Committec would be empowered to pick  the first Chief Executive, "elect" the first SAR legislature and  make preparations for the executive authorities well before the  handover.    Under such circumstances, the first SAR may not include any  directly elected legislators, according to Mr Sit. He claimed  the first legislature should not include any directly-elected  members considering the heavy workload of the SAR government  immediately after the sovereignty handover. But he refused to  disclose details of the arrangements.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, January 24 (BTA) -- At its regular meeting  today, the Council of Ministers adopted two decrees related to  the fulfillment in 1994 of the obligations which Bulgaria  assumed under its free trade agreement with the member countries  of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and its interim  trade agreement with the European Union (EU). The adoption of  these decrees expressly introduces into Bulgaria's domestic  legislation the obligation to abolish and reduce customs duties  on certain imports from countries of the two groups. The two  decrees repeat the clauses in the agreement concerning EFTA and  EU imports to Bulgaria. The accord with EFTA entered into force  on July 1, 1993, and the agreement with the EU took effect on  December 31, 1993. The decrees merely reflect the actual state  of affairs, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade Valentin  Karabashev told reporters.    The decrees adopted today abolish import duties and import  taxes on crude oil, oils and natural gas, meat for human  consumption, fish products and canned fish, vegetable oils,  electricity, ores, chemicals, refractory clay, pharmaceuticals,  super phosphate fertilizer and rough timber, newspapers,  dictionaries and books originating from EFTA or EU countries.  Newsprint, however, will not be exempt from customs duty.  Import duties on certain foods subject to import quotas under  the agreements, including citrus fruit, coffee, large cattle,  poultry and dairy products, are reduced under the decrees.    The customs concessions are effective as from January 1,  1994. The two decrees will be updated annually in compliance  with the further liberalization moves provided by the agreements  with EFTA and the EU.</p>

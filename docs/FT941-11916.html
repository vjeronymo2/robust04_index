			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / World Trade News: WWF calls for Gatt green plan TheWWF-World Wide Fund for Nature today wades into the heated debate over Gatt's future work on trade and the environment which threatens to dominate next April'sministerial meeting in Marrakesh to sign the Uruguay Round global trade accords. The Swiss-based environmental organisation calls, in a position paper, for ministers to approve establishment of a permanent committee on trade and theenvironment within the new World Trade Organisation, and to accept that Gatt rules will need changing to meet environmental concerns. These demands are likely to incense many developing countries who regard the enthusiasm of environmentalists for enforcing 'greenery' though trade restrictions as opening wide the door to new forms of protectionism. Rich-country proposals for a trade and environment committee were beaten off during negotiations on the WTO which ended in December. Trade negotiators from the 117 countries taking part in the Uruguay Round did, however, agree to present a trade-environment work programme to ministers in April, and its terms of reference are now the subject of intensive discussion inside and outside Gatt. US and EU trade and environment officials met last weekend in The Hague, together with a number of non-governmental organisations, to discuss what the work programme might look like. EU officials meet their counterparts from the European Free Trade Association in Viennatoday, and a discussion between ministers from rich and poor countries is scheduled for February 17 in Geneva. WWF says Gatt should work alongside United Nations bodies concerned with environment, trade and sustainable development. 'At present, Gatt work fails to address environmental effects of trade and has not tackled the interference of trade rules with environmental policies,' says Mr Charles Arden-Clarke, WWF policy analyst.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: BHP reveals 50% PNG mine stake BROKEN Hill Proprietary, the Australian steel and natural resources group, yesterday confirmed that it now has a stake of more than 50 per cent in Ok Tedi, the large copper and gold mine in Papua New Guinea. The increase in BHP's stake follows the decision by Amoco, the US oil group, to sell its 30 per cent interest in the mine. BHP, which already held a similar 30 per cent interest, is understood to have acquired the Amoco stake and is expected to pass on one-third of this to the Papua New Guinea government. Yesterday's announcement said the government was expected to raise its holding from 20 per cent to 30 per cent, with effect from January 1 1994. Metall Mining Corporation, the Canadian subsidiary of Germany's Metallgesellschaft, has also doubled its interest in the project recently, to 15 per cent, by buying out the 7.5 per cent stake held by Degussa. The remaining 5 per cent interest is held by DEG, the German government's overseas development body. BHP declined to discuss how much it had paid for the stake, or the terms of transaction, saying that discussions over final details of the ownership structure at Ok Tedi were continuing. There has been speculation that BHP would pay less, on a pro rata basis, than the USDollars 35m which MMC paid for the additional 7.5 per cent holding, but would indemnify Amoco against future indemnity claims. The Ok Tedi project was developed at a cost of USDollars 1.4bn in the 1980s. Expected life of the mine is expected to be at least 15 years.</p>

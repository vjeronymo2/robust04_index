			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Search starts for Taurus successor THE BANK of England task force considering a new stock market settlement system for London yesterday focused on a two-tier system which would treat individual investors and big institutions differently. At a two-hour meeting, the 10-member task force agreed to look urgently at using an existing stock exchange system, Talisman, as the basis for a new institutional settlement system. Whatever the outcome there will be wide-ranging consultation before any decision is taken. The task force, drawn together hastily this week, was meeting the morning after the stock exchange scrapped its ill-fated Taurus project and accepted the resignation of Mr Peter Rawlins, chief executive. Talisman was introduced in 1979 as an automated settlement system for marketmakers, who hold shares in what are known as 'Sepon' nominee accounts. One person present at the task force meeting said afterwards: 'The Sepon system is perfectly capable of doing the job. There's no reason why it shouldn't be used for institutional investors.' Similar ideas were expressed widely in the City yesterday by brokers and custodians. However, there were some doubts whether Talisman could be adapted to handle the extra volume of trades. A quick move to Talisman - regarded as possible before the end of this year  -would enable institutional investors to settle transactions soon after they have been carried out, perhaps after only three days. For private investors, the time taken to settle their trades would be longer. Talisman could also be made available to nominee companies which pool the shareholdings of individual investors, the task force member said. This would effectively allow some individuals to settle trades in the same way as institut-ions. Mr David Jones, chief executive of Sharelink, the stockbroking firm which regularly handles up to 10 per cent of the bargains on the stock market, said: 'The banks and the registrars have got to be told that they cannot run this industry for their own interests.'

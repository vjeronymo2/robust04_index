			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Regions stand up to Yeltsin RUSSIA'S regions yesterday issued a powerful challenge to President Boris Yeltsin as the head of the Russian Orthodox Church attempted to broker a peaceful end to the siege of the Russian parliament building. Representatives from 62 of Russia's 88 regions demanded a lifting of the siege, and a reversal of his decree dissolving parliament, threatening 'all necessary measures of economic and political pressure to restore full-blooded constitutional legality' if their demands were not met by midnight last night. Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Shakhrai, who attended the meeting, wrote it off as unrepresentative and therefore illegitimate. But the government is sufficiently concerned about what is happening outside Moscow for three of its senior members to be setting off to the Far East, Siberia, and southern Russia. Potentially more significant than the unrealistic midnight deadline was the regional officials' announcement they planned to form a Federation Council which would supplant a similar body foreseen by Mr Yeltsin as the unelected upper chamber of a new parliament. They reserved for it alone the right to endorse changes to the Soviet-era constitution to organise a new bicameral assembly, and to convene and monitor simultaneous elections of both president and parliament. Formally, they said it would be up to the parliament to agree to its own dissolution and set a date for elections. Holed up inside the White House in Moscow, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliament's speaker, said that 'everything would now be decided by the regions'. It emerged yesterday that Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi had contacted both Aleksy II, the Russian patriarch, and the regional leaders, seeking their mediation. Mr Yeltsin yesterday repeated that he would not repeal his decree but did meet the patriarch, and a close aide, Mr Gennady Burbulis, said all means had to be found to secure a dignified exit from the White House for Mr Khasbulatov and Mr Rutskoi. In an attempt to keep up popular support despite unpopular economic measures such as freeing bread prices, Mr Yeltsin increased social security payments 81 per cent yesterday. Continuing to woo the deputies, he issued instructions guaranteeing each a job in his administration.</p>

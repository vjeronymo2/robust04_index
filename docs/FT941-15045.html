			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Rouble declines to low against Dollars The Russian rouble fell to a low of 1,402 to the dollar yesterday. The latest decline, of 3.5 per cent over last week, was blamed by currency dealers on the resignation of Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister, from his cabinet post. The Russian currency has fallen 12 per cent this year. However, the dealers say much of the fall since the December elections has been prompted by a belief that the relatively tight monetary policy pursued by Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy premier for finance, would be relaxed, and the inflation rate of 12 per cent a month would accelerate. A range of spending decisions - including Dollars 500m on a new parliament building - and a draft agreement to unify the economies of Russia and Belarus point to relaxation of monetary controls. A new US investment fund said yesterday it would go ahead with plans to invest Dollars 340m of capital, put up by the US government in small and medium-sized enterprises in Russia. Mr Gerald Corrigan, chairman of the Russia-American Investment Fund, a former chairman of the New York Federal Reserve and a long-time participant in the Russian reform process, said yesterday that 'irrespective of the political changes, we believe that there is a lot of business here in which profitable investments can be made'. The fund has appointed Mr Robert Towbin, a former managing director of Lehman Brothers in New York, as the fund's chief executive officer. Mr Towbin said yesterday that the fund would concentrate investments in consumer industries, especially food and food processing, furniture and financial and other services. 'This is the area in which I think, on an early view, there will be most opportunities,' Mr Towbin said. 'We will put a lot of work into looking at these companies before we make an investment - and we will make a purely business judgment at the end of the day.' The fund plans to employ more than 30 executives in Moscow, both foreigners and Russian nationals, to investigate investment opportunities in the growing sector of privatised companies. It is a non-profit-making organisation which will invest all profit back in the Russian economy. Mr Corrigan said that 'what falls beneath the cracks in people's view of Moscow is the sheer amount of private activity taking place at the micro level in the economy. My belief is that this means that the GDP of the country is no longer falling (as official figures show) but beginning to rise again'. Reuter adds: Moscow is to charge foreign tourists a daily tariff of one US dollar, payable in hard currency, Itar-Tass news agency said. The agency did not say when or how the tariff would be collected or why it was imposed. Officials at the mayor's office were not immediately available for comment.</p>

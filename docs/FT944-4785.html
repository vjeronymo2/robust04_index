			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Roche to close or sell drug centre A 280-employee drug development centre in Edinburgh is to close or be sold by its new owner, Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company, Daniel Green writes. Roche said yesterday: 'We are in the process of trying to sell it.' A decision would probably be made by the end of January on whether a sale of all or part of the centre was possible or whether it would close. The centre was acquired by Roche in May when it bought Syntex, a Californian drugs company, for Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.23bn). The company has its own research centre in the UK, in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, which employs about 300 people. Roche has said it plans to cut 5,000 jobs worldwide from its pharmaceutical division following the integration of Syntex, including several hundred at its Basle headquarters. Roche retains its Scottish manufacturing plant, at Dalry in Ayrshire, which makes vitamin C.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Charuwan Loetwinyu] </F>   [Text] The Bank of Thailand hopes that higher interest  rates will boost savings and cut spending in the next two months  as part of the process of putting the brakes on inflation,  according to the central bank governor.    Wichit Suphinit said the Bank of Thailand would in July  evaluate all economic indicators for the first half of the year  to determine the need for policy changes.    The bank will also evaluate whether domestic production  capacity will have an effect on long-term inflation. "We have  to see if there is sufficient domestic capacity to meet local  demand."    Inflation has become the bank's priority concern since the  May consumer price index rose to 5.1 per cent compared with the  same period last year.    Increases in crude oil prices, food prices and non-food  items  led by education and recreation costs have contributed to higher  prices. The inflation rate measured on the moving 12-month  average was up 0.2 percentage points in May from April to 3.9  per cent.    Wichit has identified excessive credit extension by  commercial banks as the main cause of higher inflation. Credit  extension by all banks in the first four months of the year grew  24 per cent compared with the target of 21 per cent for the  entire year.    Roengchai Marakanon, deputy central bank governor, has  identified higher spending on personal consumption and  recreation as accounting for about 40 per cent of the higher  inflation rate.    Another 40 per cent was attributable to higher agricultural  prices given the world recovery in commodities. The higher cost  of labour and oil is believed to account for a further 14 per  cent of the increased inflation rate.    Savings during the same period grew less than the target.  The actual growth figure in the first four months was 14 per  cent compared with the target of 19 per cent.    Wichit said the Bank of Thailand has already signalled  commercial banks to raise interest rates which he added would  take two to six months to work through the economy.    He said the central bank will have to wait and see if higher  interest rates would cut consumer spending and boost savings.    But he did not see higher interest rates dampening  investment  given that companies can borrow externally at more favourable  rates.    -- The government is working on a draft "White Paper"  which will serve as the basis for the upcoming 8th National  Plan, Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchapak said  yesterday.    But first it has to analyse the results of the National  Economic and Social Development Board's 7th plan, he said.    Suphachai said the White Paper is scheduled for release in  August and will be used to gauge opinion in the private sector.    The White Paper will cover four major areas:    -- How to increase exports from the present 0.9 per cent  share to 1.8 per cent of world trade.    -- The government's plan to promote research and  development by providing tax and other incentives for foreign  investors wishing to set up R&amp;D divisions in Thailand.    -- Promote industry, and add more industries as  appropriate to the National Plan.    -- Stipulate what the government should do to promote the  economy generally.    Suphachai said the present 15 per cent inflation rate is not  particularly worrisome since the increase was due to the sudden  rise in the cost of food and farm products. The rise is only  temporary, he said.</p>

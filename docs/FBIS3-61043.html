Tokyo  has not experienced such pressure in a long time.    Let us recall that the topic was broached for the first time  at expert level at the end of this summer, after which a U.S.  Deputy Secretary of Defense came to Tokyo to "push" the idea and  was followed by the Secretary himself. The subject has also  been explained to the head of the Japanese cabinet, including at  top-level meetings with the U.S. President. Tokyo is clearly in  no hurry to give a positive reply but the lack of feedback is  simply making the Americans even more persistent -- it has come  to light that the next round of special talks on the missile  project is scheduled for 15 December in Hawaii, and this haste  is due to the Americans' insistence.    The Americans are pressuring Tokyo by consciously fueling  passions over North Korea's missile successes. Indeed, it all  began with those successes. As soon as it became known that the  DPRK had successfully tested its latest ballistic development  [razrabotka] with an operational radius of 1,000 km and can now  potentially "reach" virtually anywhere on Japanese territory,  the U.S. side began actively exploiting Japan's natural concern.  The thesis of the North Korean threat was rapidly fostered in  Japan and many people in the country took fright -- due to  Pyongyang's reputation for unpredictability and the fact that  the Japanese have no effective means of protection against such  weapons. Meanwhile, U.S. sources added new elements to the  story and fanned those fears.    People in Tokyo have begun talking with renewed force about  Pyongyang's military superiority, contrasting this superiority  with Japan's defenselessness against North Korea's missiles.    The U.S. attempts to involve Japan in the development of the  new ABM system is based meanwhile not so much on military  factors as on economic ones -- it will cost at least $12 billion  which, given the present defense spending cuts, does not exist.  There is another factor -- technological questions. The U.S.  side is proposing the Patriot system as the basis of the design  project, a system which must be properly "upgraded" using a  number of Japanese technologies which the Americans do not  possess. Tokyo can easily read between the lines here and see  all this and is determinedly shying away from the U.S.  proposals. It is certainly not a question of money or the  prospect of sharing technological innovations that worry the  Japanese here. Those who know about these things believe that  there are two other factors which are proving the main obstacle  to progress -- first, the implementation of the U.S. proposal  requires substantial adjustments to Japan's defense policy and  objectively necessitates a review of a whole range of related  problems, including the Japanese-U.S. security treaty itself;  second, the Patriot system does not inspire great hopes as a  worthy basis for the design -- during the Persian Gulf war its  effectiveness against Iraq's missiles, whose characteristics are  close to those of North Korea, was lamentably low.    It is noteworthy that recently the Japanese mass media have  been spreading reports on the inadequacies and deficiencies of  the Patriot system and on the vagueness of the very concept  offered by the United States. This counterattack mounted  against the U.S. obsession is gaining momentum at such an  admirable rate that the prospect of the forthcoming talks in  Hawaii is already in doubt -- the Japanese do not intend  "subscribing" to the Pentagon's venture at the moment.</p>

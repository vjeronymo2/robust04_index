			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Kulik under the "Foreign News" rubric: </F> "Iraq Waits for Zero Hour"]    [Text] For the last six months Smolensk Square has been  awash with rumors that Russia will support lifting the embargo  against Iraq. Moscow is concerned for the fate of the $7.5  billion which it has lost owing to the embargo. The United  Nations decided to clarify just what the thinking is on this  score in Moscow, and dispatched Rolf Ekeus, executive chairman  of the special commission for the disarmament of Iraq, to us.    Addressing journalists at a briefing, Mr. Ekeus kept  repeating phrases like "we have destroyed, closed, mothballed,  and dismantled".... Unfortunately, the UN representative  carefully side-stepped the problems of proffering aid to the  impoverished civilian population of Iraq.    "The question of lifting the embargo on Iraq has been  actively whipped up in Russia of late. Have you noticed changes  in the Russian approach to this question?" -- We couldn't stop  ourselves from asking this.    Obviously, the guys in the Kremlin and on Smolensk Square  are  in resolute mood, as, in his reply, Mr. Ekeus merely mentioned  general humanitarian values, saying not a word about Russia's  position.    The situation was clarified by a high-ranking staffer from  the Foreign Ministry. He reported that, in contacts with the  Iraqis, the Russian leadership is demanding a "softening" of  their approach. Moreover, Russia intends to propose that the  United Nations give Iraq a chance in the form of a six-month  trial period. If in this time Baghdad "behaves in a civilized  manner," then matters will move on to lifting the embargo. Nor  can one forget about the ships containing equipment worth tens  of millions of dollars from Russia, destined for Iraq, which, it  emerges, have been moored in the harbors of Persian Gulf states  for three years already, waiting for its hour to come. Judging  by information from Mr. Ekeus and the Foreign Ministry, this  hour may come as early as this year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Ren Kan: "Bank of China To Receive $360m </F> Loan From Japan"]    [Text] The Bank of China (BOC) yesterday signed agreements  with the Export-Import Bank of Japan in Tokyo for a 40 billion  Japanese yen ($360 million) recycling loan.    This is the second time China received a recycling loan from  Japan since 1988 when the BOC received a 30 billion Japanese yen  ($270 million).    A recycling loan is money a country supplies to another to  reduce its huge trade surplus.    China suffered a $7.46-billion trade deficit with Japan last  year, compared with $2 billion in 1992.    The 20-year loan has a favourable interest rate, said an  official with the BOC, the country's major foreign exchange bank.    Although the specific figure is not available, the official  said the annual rate is less than 5 percent.    And Chinese loan recipients are not required to buy Japanese  equipment.    The 40 billion Japanese yen is to be used to support more  than 40 small construction projects in Qingdao, Shandong  Province, and two large projects in Hainan Province, China's  largest special economic zone.    The projects are mainly in the raw material, machinery,  electronics and textile industries, which the country has vowed  to give development priority .    The official said the Hainan Natural Gas Fertilizer Factory  is to be the largest beneficiary, receiving 16.4 billion  Japanese yen ($147 million).    The factory, with total investment of 1.47 billion yuan  ($168.9 million) will be put into operation in 1996.    The Hainan Changjiang Cement Factory also is to receive a  substantial amount.    Analysts believe the construction of the two projects will  ensure a solid industrial base for Hainan.</p>

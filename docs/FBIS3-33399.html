A letter of intent, which represents great prospects for the  possibility of developing cooperation in various areas, was  signed today at the Minrex [Ministry of Foreign Relations] by  Manuel Hermoso Rojas, president of the government of the Canary  Islands, and Jose Ramon Fernandez, vice president of the  Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers.    The agreement provides for the display and trade of products  and for support to Cuba for the development of its activities in  Spain and the European Economic Community. Referring to the  significance of the agreement, Hermoso Rojas said:    [Begin recording] Today we are signing an agreement which  concludes one more of the many talks we have been holding over  the past few days concerning possible cooperation between Cuba  and the Canary Islands. I have to say that every time we had to  discuss a concrete issue, immense possibilities for cooperation  emerged. The great tradition prevailing between the peoples of  Cuba and the Canary Islands has been maintained. The people of  the Canary Islands have been something peculiar to Spain in that  they have been known as the islanders of Cuba [sentence as  heard]. And we islanders have come with the purpose of  cooperating. The agreements are no longer restricted to culture,  but are also extended to the universities, to commercial  relations, and, I hope, they will also be extended to the area  of tourism. [end recording]    Before the signing of the agreement, the president of the  Canary Islands Government held a meeting with Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina, during which they discussed subjects  of mutual interest.</p>

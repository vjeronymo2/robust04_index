			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: When money talks - International bond funds INTERNATIONAL bond funds usually aim for maximum total returns from their investments in government and corporate bonds around the world. Currency gains have led to healthy growth for funds in this sector recently, particularly since sterling left the exchange rate mechanism. But yields generally are lower than for funds invested in UK gilts. Some fund managers now say the time for massive gains from currency plays has passed. 'It is unlikely sterling is going to devalue again,' says Christopher Rothery, manager of Save &amp; Prosper's international bond fund. 'I think the returns we are looking at over the next year are going to be more modest, but you can still say they are attractive.' Currency gains are still possible in some areas, though. 'We believe that the dollar will continue to appreciate against European currencies this year, and the yen is still fundamentally strong,' says Rothery. The S &amp; P fund is weighted heavily in the US and Canada compared with some other funds in this sector, with a total of 42 per cent invested in North America. It has 17 per cent in Japan, about 20 per cent in the UK, and 19 per cent in continental Europe. Letitia Ash-Lameer, who manages Norwich Union's international bond fund, shares a positive view of the US dollar but is weighted less heavily in the US. 'We prefer Canada,' she says. 'We are still looking for rate cuts in Canada, but we are not looking for any more in the US.' The tensions in the ERM also are worrying managers. Ash-Lameer hedges investments in the weaker ERM members - such as Spain, Sweden and Denmark - into US dollars to reduce the risk. Her fund is invested 17 per cent in the UK, 16 per cent in the US and 14.5 per cent in Canada, with smaller amounts in European countries and Australia. Whittingdale's fund in this sector is rather a special case, as it is US dollar-denominated and invests only in short-dated US government bonds. Its performance in sterling terms is determined by the strength of the dollar. 'It is not an ordinary international bond fund,' says Whittingdale's Jeremy Alford. 'The fund is really there for people who either want to match US dollar liabilities, which is not that easy in this country, or who share our view that the dollar is undervalued.' Minimum investment is Dollars 2,000, with an initial charge of 1.25 per cent and an annual charge of 1 per cent. Minimum for the Norwich Union fund is Pounds 500, or Pounds 30 a month with a savings plan. The initial charge is 6 per cent, and 1.25 per cent annual management fee. The initial charge on the S &amp; P fund is 5.5 per cent, with an annual charge of 0.75 per cent. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 35 monthly.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              BEST PERFORMING 10 INTERNATIONAL BOND FUNDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fund                          Size (Pounds m)      Yield (%)     Perf*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Perpetual Global Bond              69.2               6.2        30.9 Norwich Intl Bond                  28.3               5.4        30.4 Whittingdale US Sht Gov             4.6               0.0        30.2 CU PPT Global Bond                  6.3               5.6        30.1 Newton Intl Bond                    2.4               6.5        29.3 S&amp;P Intl Bond                      22.6               5.3        29.2 Legal &amp; Genl Intl Bond              1.3               4.7        28.7 Sun Allnce W'wide Bond              7.4               5.3        27.3 Guinness Flight Glbl               11.1               7.7        26.9 Cannon Intl Curr Bond              25.6               5.1        26.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sector average                     31.5               5.5        25.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Micropal.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- **** As of July 1. *    Offer-to-bid with net income reinvested over year to July 1.

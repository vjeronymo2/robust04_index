			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Technology: Tempted by green gadgetry - Andrew Baxter takes a look at the latest innovations from white goods manufacturers Inside one of Zanussi's new dishwashers is a multiple detergent dispenser - pour in the fluid and there's enough for a month before it needs refilling. It is a simple idea, if less easy to put into practice, says Fulvio Caccio of Electrolux, which owns the newly relaunched Zanussi brand. Making the electrical parts humidity-proof was the main problem. Zanussi and its rival white goods producers were displaying dozens of similar innovations at last month's Domotechnica appliances show in Cologne. The dominant theme of Domotechnica was the environment - from the reduction and phasing out of CFCs in fridges to reducing water consumption of washing machines and dishwashers. But functional innovation was an important accompaniment and the technological challenge for the white goods industry is twofold: to produce worthwhile new features and better environmental performance. A combination of both might just tempt consumers to trade in their old machines before the end of their useful lives - crucial in mature western markets. The Zanussi dishwasher, for example, has an alternate top and bottom spray system to save water. One way to tempt customers is to act on a good idea before the opposition. But intelligent use of electronics is also vital for innovation and enhancing environmental performance without confusing the customer. However, this is where problems can arise. According to a 1991 report by market research company Frost &amp; Sullivan on Europe's white goods industry, 2 per cent of all semiconductors are used in domestic appliances, and this share is rising. 'Microchips have made possible far more sophisticated switching, control and timing devices,' says the report. 'However, many suspect these new 'bells and whistles, knobs and knockers' are only a manifestation of unnecessary gadgetry . . . many doubt whether the typical consumer really wants such frills and actually uses them.' A few, at least, of the most recent functional innovations are not driven by electronics. Electrolux, for example, has introduced a new, low-frost system for chest freezers which cuts out 80 per cent of ice build-up. Freezers warm up and cool down as the compressor switches off and on, but here the dry air normally expelled in the warm-up phase is held in a flexible cavity connected to the inside by a small pipe. When the freezer cools down, dry air is recycled into the freezer rather than humid air which deposits its moisture as ice on the freezer walls. Another simple idea was launched by Whirlpool for its dishwashers - a 'long door' which is counterbalanced to stay open in any position. Most innovations, however, depend substantially on electronics. One of the big issues at Domotechnica was the extent to which western producers would introduce products with 'fuzzy logic' - where a central microchip receives signals from several sensors in the machine and then sends out fresh instructions accordingly. The answer is that western producers are taking a much more selective approach to fuzzy logic than their Japanese counterparts, which market the concept heavily. 'In fridges and laundry products, I see us moving towards fuzzy logic in this decade,' says Ronald Kerber, Whirlpool's chief technology officer. 'Not because there is any desire by consumers to have it, but because of its role in controlling the performance of the machine.' AEG launched a washing machine with fuzzy logic that is due to go on sale in Germany later this spring. The big German producer also enthuses about the 'massive potential' of fuzzy logic for appliance efficiency. The sensor system means, for example, that the machine can ensure exactly the right amount of water is used, making the half-load button redundant. Whirlpool, meanwhile, launched its first fuzzy-logic product, a new 'Sixth Sense' microwave for its top-selling VIP range. This eliminates the guesswork from two common but boring tasks - reheating or defrosting food. The user presses a single button to reheat or defrost and the oven works out the type and weight of the food, then calculates the correct time and power output. The cooking is left to be done manually. The approach to 'interactive' or intelligent cooking is also cautious, although some manufacturers believe the effort is worthwhile for top-range machines. Fagor, the biggest Spanish producer, unveiled its Todo Plus oven which combines traditional heat, circular heat and microwaves and links them to a small screen in the control panel. This can show how to prepare more than 125 recipes, work out quantities and choose the best cooking sequence. AEG unveiled another important new feature, so-called Bio phase programming for dishwashers and washing machines. This is geared to the latest ultra-compact detergents for both types of machines, which include enzymes that work best at low temperatures. In AEG's new washing machine, the water is held at 40'C for 20 minutes to allow the enzymes to work effectively, before it is heated to the set temperature for the rest of the wash. As for genuinely new products, one to watch - especially for microwave producers - was the Jet-Stream Oven from Minnesota-based American Harvest. This uses cyclonic cooking, a patented technology that heats air to 204'C and moves it around the food at 2,200 feet per minute. The result, says the producer, is oven-quality food at microwave speeds.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Water pollution hearing soon Victims of the Camelford water pollution incident have received a High Court date for civil actions claiming their health suffered as a result of events in the Cornish town almost six years ago. The hearing into claims by 11 nominated people will open in May at the Crown Court in Truro before Mr Justice Wright. After about two weeks the hearing is expected to move to London for expert evidence, expected to last a further three weeks. About 139 other claims are likely to depend on the hearing's outcome. Water supplies to 20,000 people were affected in the incident. The pollution happened when a relief lorry driver dumped 20 tonnes of aluminium sulphate into the wrong tank at a South West Water Authority treatment works in July 1988. The actions have been brought against South West Water Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of South West Water which, though it was only created in 1989, assumed civil responsibility from the water authority which it succeeded. The authority was convicted at Exeter in 1991 of causing a public nuisance and was fined Pounds 10,000 with Pounds 25,000 costs. The SWWA was cleared of polluting the river Camel by flushing the mains at midnight on the day of the incident because the judge said it was the only action open to the authority. The claims are for 'chronic and acute injuries arising out of the incident', said Camelford-based solicitor Mr John Whiting, whose firm is representing about 120 claimants. They will allege that the water authority failed to provide wholesome water, was in breach of its statutory duty and was negligent. This led to short and long-term health problems, primarily long-term memory loss. Mr Whiting said there had been 'nominal offers of settlement' in relation to short-term sicknesses but responsibility had not been accepted for the medium and long-term symptoms. South West Water said 75 per cent of all claims, involving several hundred people, had been settled.</p>

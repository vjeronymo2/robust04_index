			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Answering an accusation that in the current budget  there was no increase -- in comparison with previous years -- in  the expenditure on education and the health service, the prime  minister pointed out that this year only 84 percent of the  budget expenditure was available for distribution. The rest  would be swallowed by the servicing of debts -- the internal  debt and the foreign ones.    [Begin Pawlak recording] So if we want to compare budgets,  then we could compare indices in the relative system within the  proportions of the budget but also within the proportions of  that part of the budget which is available for sharing out. And  there is significantly less to be shared out than a year ago --  and practically the whole of the budget deficit at the moment  goes on financing the internal debt.    So if we look at it in this way, then the amounts for  education and the health service are not so bad in comparison  with last year. [end recording]    The fact that on 1 January parishes took over only a part of  the entire number of primary schools, means that the whole  operation of schools being taken over by self-governments had  been badly prepared by the previous government, said Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak and the head of the Council of  Ministers Office, Michal Strak.    [Begin recording] [Pawlak] If one were to --  administratively -- bring about a situation in which the  parishes were to take over the schools then probably today there  would be not so much a row with the teachers as a row with the  parishes -- which did not always have the possibility of  financing these schools, especially in the case of smaller or  weaker parishes.    [Strak] May I just add one more comment regarding the pilot  program: We decided that mayors would decide whether they were  taking over schools or not. I have a set of figures here: There  are 1,015 schools in the towns which were included in the pilot  program, of which 580 have been taken over by the mayors. So  this liberty in decisiontaking is successful -- for mayors and  self-governments carried out investigations and consciously made  up their minds. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARSENIO HALL  </P> <P> Does Johnny Carson sit and ponder over the fact that he may not be reaching a  black audience? I don't think so. So why should Arsenio Hall worry about  mainstream America? There seems to be an unwritten law in Hollywood that if a  black entertainer wants to be truly successful, he or she must have a  significant white following. As long as there is a Johnny, a David and a Pat,  the average white American will be taken care of. We need someone to appeal to  the few of us who cannot relate to the introduction "Here's Johnny!"  </P> <P> PAULA EVANS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

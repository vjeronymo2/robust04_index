			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Arts: Today's Television What do the four main television channels offer for those who spend the evening working and only become free at, say 11.30? Not very much. Today BBC1 will give you two hours of Snooker starting at 11.40 with Alan McManus playing Nigel Bond in the Masters Tournament. On BBC2 The Bestseller Brief fills the Late Show's slot with a discussion from the US about 'the rise of the legal thriller' (11.15 to 11.55). At midnight they switch to the Open University. ITV has another episode of the American action drama Magnum starting at 11.10. That is followed at midnight by The Little Picture Show with gravel voiced Mariella Frostrup going through the new movies. Then, between 1.00 and 2.20 there are two more American shows: Shannon's Deal about lawyer/detective Jack Shannon and Beyond Reality (1.50) which, today, is about tracking down a poltergeist. Channel 4 begins a 100-minute documentary at 11.00, Soil Of Avellaneda about remembering and forgetting in Argentina. That is followed by the ludicrous Australian medical comedy Let The Blood Run Free (12.40).</p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Banks make a charge for small businesses: Competition is growing in the search for new clients WHEN A delegation from the Federation of Small Businesses tells Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, this morning what it wants to see in the Budget the long-term financing of small businesses will be high on the agenda. Traditionally, the banks have been cast as the villains, and the federation's pre-Budget submission to the Treasury still describes some banks as 'fair-weather friends'. But the signs are that the high street banks are intensifying their competition to woo small business clients. Banks say competition has been intense for small-business clients even in the recession, but the arrival of a fragile recovery has clearly concentrated minds. One bank official said: 'Now is the time for investing for the long term, to take on new small businesses.' On Monday Lloyds cut charges for about 350,000 small businesses and announced that from January small-business customers would get a breakdown of transaction charges and debit interest before they were debited from accounts. At the same time, Midland's new advertising campaign - highlighting that it has Pounds 1bn to lend to viable businesses - is the most obvious sign of its aggressive lending policy for small businesses. NatWest's rather sadly timed statement, also this week, of slight increases in its charges to about 1m small-business customers was accompanied by heavy emphasis on a new option of paying charges on a monthly rather than a quarterly basis, in order to help with cashflows. Mr John Harris, federation chairman, who will lead the delegation to the Treasury, welcomed the Lloyds move as 'a gesture in the right direction'. He added: 'We condemn NatWest's move.' However, he agreed to some extent with the banks' argument that the charging structure is not the sole basis on which small businesses should judge them. Ms Jane Bradford, head of NatWest's small business services, said: 'It's important to recognise that less than 50 per cent of all small businesses actually borrow from banks, so we must be competitive in other ways.' Mr Harris's main concern is that increased competition will be focused on winning new business rather than adopting a more helpful attitude towards existing clients. Although it costs banks more to attract new customers than to retain existing ones, once a small business has chosen a bank it tends not to move. Mr Harris highlighted the position of businesses that had survived the recession but now had cashflow problems as orders started to come in. Some were finding it hard to convince bank managers that they were good risks. He said: 'It might be easier for someone with a new idea and a business plan to borrow money. The aggressive competition is to find the 'sure thing'. We would ask banks to look hard at their loyalties.' One bank official said: 'We're obviously going to try to continue to support existing business, but new businesses are starting under more realistic conditions and are more hard-nosed.' While existing customers will benefit from reduced charges, other banks see an emphasis on new customers in the Lloyds price cut. Mr Mike Shaw, head of business banking at Lloyds, said the cut in charges was a 'reward' for existing customers, but Lloyds' rivals saw it as an attempt to win a greater market share. Even if small businesses are not satisfied, fiercer competition is likely to have greater impact on their relationship with banks than either Mr Clarke's inquiry into the availability of funding or the meetings between Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, and senior figures in the clearing banks. Mr David Lavarack, head of small business services at Barclays, is clear that it is competition that is driving the changes. 'It's the marketplace. At the end of the day no discussion with the governor, or Treasury inquiry, is going to affect banks' long-term policy.'</p>

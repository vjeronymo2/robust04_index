			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Rubio may escape jail sentence Spain's economy and finance minister Mr Pedro Solbes indicated yesterday that disgraced former Bank of Spain governor Mariano Rubio could escape a prison sentence in connection with tax evasion. Parliamentary sources said Mr Solbes told a private congress hearing yesterday that Mr Rubio had apparently failed to pay Pta13m (Pounds 62,800) in tax in 1988, a total below the Pta15m threshold which makes evaders liable to a jail term. Mr Rubio, who was released last week on Pta15m bail after a fortnight in prison, allegedly kept secret the profits of a portfolio account managed at the time he was central bank governor by the failed Banco Ibercorp. Mr Solbes told the legislators that an intitial investigation into Ibercorp, a financial group which managed the assets of wealthy and fashionable Spaniards, had uncovered a complicated network of shell companies that masked the identities of its clients and the nature of their investments.</p>

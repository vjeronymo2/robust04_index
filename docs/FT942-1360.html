			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / London and Dublin close to framework Ulster deal Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds were on course last night to agree the framework for a comprehensive political settlement in Northern Ireland by mid-July . As the British and Irish prime ministers prepared for bilateral talks at the European Union summit in Corfu, senior Whitehall officials voiced confidence that they could clear the remaining roadblocks to the agreement before next month's Anglo-Irish summit. There are continuing differences over repeal of Dublin's constitutional claim to Ulster and over the shape and authority of proposed joint boards to enhance cross-border co-operation. However the officials said Mr Major was determined to find a formula to bridge the remaining differences over the 'constitutional balance' of the accord. The escalation of sectarian violence in the province - underlined by last week's murder of six Catholic men in their local bar  - has added further impetus to the search for an accord. Once agreed, the framework document - covering relations between London and Dublin, cross-border co-operation and outline plans for a new assembly in Northern Ireland - will be presented as the basis for renewed talks between the constitutional parties. It is understood that Britain has rejected any suggestion that new north-south institutions could imply 'joint authority' over the province. The Ulster Unionists, whose co-operation is a prerequisite to an eventual settlement, are determined that the Dublin government is not given constitutional authority in the administration of Ulster. But Mr Major is prepared to see cross-border executive boards to oversee a common approach in areas such as transport, energy, agriculture and tourism. The creation of such boards - whose powers would be decided in consultation with the constitutional parties - would acknowledge the two governments had a 'shared interest' in the economic development of the province. The Irish foreign ministry wishes the boards to have 'executive powers', embracing the main areas of mutual economic concern to the two parts of the island. For his part, Mr Reynolds is arguing that a commitment by the Dublin government to amend or repeal articles two and three of the Irish constitution - which encapsulate the republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland - must be contingent on an overall political settlement acceptable to nationalists as well as unionists in Ulster.</p>

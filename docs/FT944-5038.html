			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Councils detect Pounds 9m more fraud Local authorities in England and Wales have detected Pounds 34m worth of fraud in the last financial year - Pounds 9m more than 1992-93, says the Audit Commission, the local government watchdog. Benefit abuse accounted for 98 per cent of cases, with a total value of Pounds 26m, up from Pounds 20m. Most involved people abusing the systems for housing and council tax benefits, and little was committed by councillors or officers. However, the commission refused to speculate on the overall level of fraud, saying that 'by definition you cannot get a handle on it because it is undetected'. It added: 'There are areas of fraud which are growing and authorities need to look out for them.' These included student award fraud, which rose from 228 cases, worth only Pounds 220,000, to 922 cases worth Pounds 2.3m. Most (90 per cent) were in London, where it is relatively easy for students to make multiple applications in different boroughs, and where there are now about 30 higher education institutions. The increased detection rate followed a joint initiative by London councils, which used computers to discover multiple claims. There was also a sharp increase in renovation grant frauds, from Pounds 450,0000 to Pounds 1.1m. The commission said the figures for corruption, involving offences such as bribe-taking by council officers, were encouraging, with only 36 cases reported, compared with 54 the previous year. The commission suggested improving co-ordination between councils and said information technology should be used to uncover multiple claims. In one London borough fraudulent claims of Pounds 300,000 were identified by the London Committee for Action Against Fraud.

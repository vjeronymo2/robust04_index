			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities wanted The utility stocks attracted further interest in the wake of the poor inflation figures, with water shares the best performing sector in the UK market yesterday. Yield and defensive considerations were investors' priorities as water shares surged, with several broker recommendations helping sentiment. Northumbrian jumped 16 to 680p, Southern 15 to 593p and Welsh 12 to 658p. Among the Recs, South West gained 9 to 559p and East Midland 5 to 567p. Kleinwort Benson was among those recommending both stocks. News that Oftel was recommending further liberalising moves in the UK telecoms market added to the attractions of BT's rivals. While BT shares retreated 4 1/2 to 440 1/2 p, Vodafone added 4 to 540 1/2 , Securicor 15 to 770p and Cable and Wireless 16 to 927p.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Beauford finance restructure Beauford, the West Yorkshire-based engineering and ceramics group, yesterday announced it had conditionally agreed a conversion of bank borrowings, a placing and a rights issue. Sir Trevor Holdsworth, chairman, said that without the debt conversion and the cash injection resulting from the placing and rights issue, and in the absence of continuing bank support, directors believed the group would be unable to continue trading. Under the terms of the proposed refinancing, holders of the ordinary shares would receive one new 10p share for every 20 ordinary shares held. In addition, the group's bankers have agreed that Pounds 5m of borrowings owed to them be converted into 10m new preference shares and 10m new convertible preference shares. The banks have also agreed to convert a further Pounds 2m of debt into a Pounds 2m term loan and to provide new committed facilities for the company, subject to the implementation of the proposals. In conjunction with the debt conversion, Beauford proposes to raise some Pounds 4m before expenses by way of a placing of 11.8m new ordinary shares with institutional investors and a fully underwritten rights issue of 8.16m new shares at 20p apiece to shareholders on a 1-for-10 basis. A subdivision of each deferred share into two deferred shares of  1/2 p each and the ordinary shares into one new share of  1/2 p and one deferred share of  1/2 p is also proposed. The new ordinary shares will then be consolidated on the basis of one new ordinary share of 10p for every 20 new  1/2 p shares. The deferred shares, which will have negligible value, will then be cancelled. The net proceeds of the placing and rights issue, amounting to some Pounds 3.3m, will be used to reduce bank borrowings.</p>

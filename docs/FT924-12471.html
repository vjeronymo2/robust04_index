			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / EC's VAT rate agreement wins mixed reception THE formal accord on EC-wide VAT rates and excise duties received a mixed reception yesterday from European business. EC finance ministers agreed a deal late on Monday night in Luxembourg, after clearing the final hurdle to unanimous approval - a dispute between Britain and Spain about the duty applied to sherry in the UK. They had come close to agreement in July, but were thwarted by the objections of some member states to specific aspects of the deal. The package of eight directives will fix a legally binding minimum VAT rate of 15 per cent across the Community until 1996, and minimum duties on a range of other products including tobacco, alcohol and mineral oils. Earlier legislation imposed a new transitional VAT system on the Community which will allow member states to do away with the 60m or so forms filled in annually at borders. Ministers and the European Commission welcomed the accord as a great step towards a border-free single market after January 1 1993, although it will leave rates in Europe virtually unchanged. But Mr Jean-Yves Muylle of Unice, the pan-European employers' confederation, said: 'The agreement is certainly a good thing, but we are still concerned by the system which should come into force on January 1 1993.' Unice believes the transitional system will impose undue administrative burdens on business. Speaking in Edinburgh, Mr Tim Jackson, of the EC Association of Alcohol and Spirit Drinks Producers, said the deal would 'do nothing to harmonise the widely differing excise rates levied on spirits throughout the EC' or to reduce distortion of competition between spirits and other alcoholic drinks, such as beer and wine. Europia, the petroleum industry body, warned that differing excise duties on products such as heating oil might encourage cross-border fraud. 'Legally everything is clear, but fraudsters are very intelligent and (the deal) does offer every opportunity for fraud,' said Mr Gilbert Portal, secretary general of the association.</p>

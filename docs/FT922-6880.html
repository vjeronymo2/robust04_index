			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Filipinos show distaste for graft and patronage: The presidential poll results are demonstrating a break with traditional politics WHOEVER wins the drawn out battle for the Philippines presidency, the result will represent a repudiation of the traditional politics of patronage. Analysts say the cry for a new type of leadership was evident in the heavy turnout in what is regarded as the most peaceful and free election the country has seen, despite complaints of fraud by some candidates. By last night Mr Fidel Ramos, of the Lakas-National Union of Christian Democrats coalition, was still in the lead. With 43 per cent of the 26.7m votes counted, he had 2.56m votes against 1.95m for Mrs Mrs Miriam Defensor Santiago, of the People's Reform Party. Both Mr Ramos and Mrs Santiago had occupied various public offices - he is the former armed forces chief-of-staff and defence secretary, while she used to be a court judge and immigration commissioner. Neither has held any elected position before. Political analysts say the voter acceptance of Mr Ramos and Mrs Santiago represents a rejection of the old-style politics of patronage and largesse that had become fodder for corruption in the bureaucracy. Corruption in government has been tagged as one of the main reasons for the Philippines' inability to improve standards of living - 65 per cent of the 62m Filipinos live below the poverty line - despite its resource-rich economy and a steady flow of foreign aid. Mrs Santiago pegged her campaign on an anti-corruption crusade while Mr Ramos promised 'people empowerment' that will expand citizen participation in government affairs. Their camps projected each candidate as a 'fighter' - Mr Ramos against coup plotters who had repeatedly tried, but failed, to grab power from President Corazon Aquino, and Mrs Santiago against 'the evil' of corruption. In the rest of the field of seven Mr Eduardo Cojuangco of the Nationalist People's Coalition stood third with 1.85m votes. He is viewed largely as a remnant of the autocratic government of deposed dictator Mr Ferdinand Marcos, but has not done as well as foreign observers had expected. Mr Ramon Mitra, of the dominant Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP) party, had been unable to shake off his image as a paragon of traditional politicians, disparagingly referred to as trapos (old rags). He defeated Mr Ramos in an LDP straw vote last November, but Mr Ramos left the party that Mr Mitra helped organise in 1986 after his petitions for an investigation of fraud charges were ignored. Also trampled by the rush against traditional politicians was the career of Mr Jovito Salonga, former Senate president, who stood on a strong nationalist theme. Mr Salonga had topped all senatorial elections that he ran in since the 1970s, but at the age of 71, his appeal to the voters had obviously waned , although he continues to enjoy enormous support from the intellectuals and certain middle-class niches. By demolishing the traditional basis for political alignments, however, the May 11 poll may have also created new elements that could be a drag to the new administration. Mr Joseph Estrada, a film actor who became senator in 1987, appears almost certain to clinch the vice presidency. Mr Estrada was originally one of the eight contenders for president but in late March he joined Mr Cojuangco's camp as the Marcos crony's running mate. Mr Estrada's nationalist beliefs could run into the more cautious approach of Mr Ramos or Mrs Santiago. This fundamental difference could turn him to another 'wallflower' vice president. Most of the country's presidents since the 1950s had little use for their elected vice presidents who belonged to rival political parties. Even In the bicameral congress, the majority most of those winners ing the election are from the LDP. In the race for the 24 seats in the Senate, the latest count showed the LDP winning at least 17. The results for the 200-member House of Representatives will become clear by this weekend, but many of the known LDP stalwarts were reported ahead leading in their constituencies. The bias against traditional politics extended to the voting in the Senate. Another political upstart who originally gained popularity as a movie and television actor, Mr Vicente Sotto III, appears to be headed to become the runaway top-notcher from among the 168 candidates. Analysts see this also as further evidence of voter preference for 'fighters' - as vice-mayor of Quezon City, a Metro-Manila suburb, he led a campaign against drug abuse. Observers are unanimous in crediting the Filipino people who jammed the polling centres as the 'real winners' in the election.</p>

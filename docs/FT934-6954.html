			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Sainsbury's links promotion to Sunday working J. Sainsbury, the supermarket chain, has told its managers promotion prospects may depend on their willingness to work on Sundays if parliament agrees to deregulate weekend trading. The warning appears in a memo to branch managers from Mr Colin Harvey, Sainsbury's retail sales director, a copy of which has been passed to the FT. The memo, which sets out Sainsbury's plans for changes to management contracts, says Sunday working will become 'a way of life' if the government's Sunday trading bill succeeds. Mr Harvey assures staff that reluctance to work on Sundays will not affect the company's assessment of career potential. However, he says exposure to larger stores is important to career development. 'Willingness to work on Sundays will obviously be one, although clearly not the only, factor that we have to take into account when making appointments to such stores.' The issue of employment rights - including promotion prospects - will be crucial to the success of the bill. Ministers say the draft bill protects employees who refuse to work on Sundays from being denied training or promotion. The branch manager who passed the memo to the FT said he wanted to expose concern about Sunday working arrangements among retail managers throughout the industry. 'If this is indicative of the retail trade, then there really is no protection for the family rights of management within this sector,' he said. Mr George Robertson, Sainsbury's solicitor, said the company was committed to continuing the voluntary working arrangements applying in stores which already open on Sundays. 'Good managers are hard to come by. We have to put them in the right place, and whether or not they wish to work on Sundays would be only one of the things that we have to take into account,' he said. However, the memo prompted concern among critics of the bill which offers four options for deregulation, ranging from tight control to a free-for-all. Mr David Alton, a leading Liberal Democrat opponent, said it demonstrated 'the unbearable pressures being placed on employees to work on Sundays.' Ms Joan Ruddock, of Labour's front bench, plans to question Sainsbury's about the memo. 'The question that needs to be asked is whether this means that a manager who is not willing to do Sunday duties cannot have a management role,' she said. Sainsbury's has endorsed a code of practice published by the Shopping Hours Reform Council which gives protection to employees who refuse to work on Sundays. A Sainsbury's briefing document last year also pledged that 'all Sunday working is voluntary'. It continued: 'We are committed to ensuring that staff do not feel pressurised into working on Sundays. There is no discrimination against those staff who do not want to work on Sundays.'</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: French banks face downgrading STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, may lower the ratings of six French banks. The short and long-term debt ratings of Banque Indosuez, Banque Paribas, Banque Worms, Compagnie Bancaire, Compagnie Financiere de CIC et de L'Union Europeenne and Credisuez have been placed on creditwatch with negative implications. S&amp;P cited the increased credit risk facing French banks at a time when their operating margins are near a six-year low. French banks have been hard hit by the problems of small and medium-sized companies, and the decline of the commercial property market, but only began to make significant provisions in 1992, according to the agency. Banque Indosuez has a large exposure to real estate and to the equipment leasing sector through its subsidiary Locafrance. The Paribas group is suffering from an increasing level of non-performing loans and has significant exposure to commercial property. Its subsidiary, Compagnie Bancaire, is exposed to property and equipment finance. The long-term senior debt of both Indosuez and Paribas is currently rated AA-. S&amp;P said that a final decision on the ratings will be made after meeting the senior management of the banks affected.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIBERIAN REBELS ESCORT EMBASSY STAFFS TO BORDER  </P> <P> Rebel fighters escorted staff members and refugees living in the West German,  Moroccan and Egyptian embassies from the battleground of Monrovia Wednesday but  refused to let Guineans evacuate their mission.  </P> <P> The rebels of Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front have accused Guinea of  supporting Liberian President Samuel K. Doe with troops.  </P> <P> Taylor's rebels escorted 11 West Germans, two Moroccan diplomats, the Egyptian  ambassador, 4 Lebanese and 24 Liberians in an 18-vehicle convoy headed for  neighboring Ivory Coast, West German Ambassador Juergen Gehl told reporters as  he departed.  </P> <P> It would take at least 12 hours to reach the northeastern border, traveling  through rebel-held territory.  </P> <P> About 60 Guineans, including the ambassador, were not allowed to join the  convoy, Gehl said.  </P> <P> Rebels attacked the embassies of Guinea and Nigeria last week, forcing more  than 8,000 people sheltered there into the streets, where the rebels were  battling Doe's troops with rockets, anti-aircraft guns and assault rifles.  </P> <P> People at Guinea's mission made their way back to the building rather than risk  passing through numerous rebel check points blocking the route to the border.  </P> <P> Many of those chased from the embassy were Mandingos, a tribe rebels accuse of  supporting Doe's government. People suspected of aiding Doe risk summary  execution.  </P> <P> Taylor's forces have captured at least four Guinean soldiers accused of  fighting with Doe's troops. But one of the prisoners told reporters he was  guarding the embassy when he was taken.  </P> <P> An estimated 1,400 people are still sheltered at the Nigerian Embassy.  </P> <P> In the past, Taylor has said he would allow the Nigerian and Guinean embassies  to evacuate their personnel. But that was before both countries announced they  were sending troops to a six-nation West African task force mobilizing in  neighboring Sierra Leone.  </P> <P> The West African nations sending troops are Ghana, Gambia, Guinea, Nigeria,  Sierra Leone and Togo.  </P> <P> Rebels invaded from Ivory Coast on Dec. 24. In February, rebel commander Prince  Johnson split with Taylor and formed a rival faction that is fighting Doe's  soldiers in central Monrovia and fending off attacks from Taylor's forces.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Taylor said his rebels had killed Johnson in an ambush, but  reporters later interviewed Johnson, who laughed at the claim.  </P></p>

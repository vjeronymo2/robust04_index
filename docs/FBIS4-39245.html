			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Natalya Gorodetskaya report under the "Caucasus" rubric: </F> "Groznyy Accuses Moscow of `Stage-By-Stage' Occupation"]    [Excerpt] Moscow's silence on the repeated statements by  Groznyy officials to the effect that the Chechen-Russian talks  should be held at the foreign ministry level, or -- better -- at  the presidential level, makes leaders of the Chechen Republic  nervous and suspect Russia of nurturing "plans of occupation."    Shortly before a Chechen opposition congress, which was set  for 4 June in Nadterechnyy Rayon, which does not take orders  from the president, the republic's state security department  stated that this congress was prepared by Russia's Foreign  Intelligence Service as yet another stage in the "stage-by-stage  occupation of Chechnya." In Groznyy's view, the preceding stages  included the introduction of a state of emergency on part of  Sunzhenskiy and Malgobekskiy Rayons of Ingushetia, which border  on Chechnya, and the failed attempt on the life of Dzhokhar  Dudayev.    The congress, according to the forecasts of Chechnya's state  security department, was supposed to lend legal status to the  Temporary Council created by the opposition in winter 1994.  This was to be followed by the opposition's appeal to Russia  that it recognize this organ and support it with military force  under any pretext. The "puppet" Temporary Council would then  sign the Federal Treaty of the Russian Federation which would  amount to Chechnya's becoming part of the Russian Federation.  Shortly before the congress, as Chechnya's Foreign Ministry  maintained, Russian troops were brought to the republic's  borders, while on the territory of North Ossetia 26 combat  helicopters with special subunits ready for aggression were on  full combat alert. The opposition congress, however, did not  take place on 4 June "due to the absence of a quorum," according  to a representative of the Chechen Republic president's staff.  [passage omitted]</p>

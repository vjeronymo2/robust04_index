			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Top Colombian drug baron in jail mystery PRESIDENT Cesar Gaviria of Colombia last night admitted that Mr Pablo Escobar, chief of the Medelln cocaine cartel, had not been found since troops stormed the jail where he was being held. The president said it was unlikely, but not impossible, that Mr Escobar had escaped the military forces. The search for him was continuing in and around the prison. After resisting attempts to transfer him to a military jail on Tuesday, Mr Escobar and 13 other prisoners used weapons taken from guards to seize hostages - including Mr Eduardo Mendoza, deputy justice minister, and Colonel Hernando Navas, director-general of prisons. Troops were later sent in and the hostages escaped during the ensuing fight. At least six people were killed and several injured. Mr Gaviria called a national security council session late on Tuesday and postponed his trip to the Ibero-American summit in Madrid. A local radio station reported that Mr Escobar had said on tape he was prepared to resist to the last the authorities' attempts to transfer him to another jail. His nephew had said Mr Escobar and others were in a tunnel under the jail with food to last some time. The government decided to transfer Mr Escobar after he continued 'to be involved in committing crimes directly and personally from inside the jail,' with the complicity of prison guards.</p>

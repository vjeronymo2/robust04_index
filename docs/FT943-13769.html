			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / International Company News: Chinese accounting causes concern Fewer than half of the companies listed on China's nascent stock exchanges are said to have presented acceptable annual reports for 1993, with some submitting inaccurate accounts to regulators, Reuter reports from Beijing. A spokesman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission said only 75 of 169 reports received from listed companies met the commission's standards. Even though the deadline for submitting 1993 accounts was June 30 this year, 14 companies still have not done so and risk punishment, China's official Xinhua news agency reported. The commission warned that companies submitting false accounts could be suspended from doing business. Many foreign investors eager to take part in China's economic boom by buying into listed companies are worried about lax accounting standards that make it difficult to evaluate properly an enterprise's profitability. The commission's report on the companies' annual accounts appeared to bear out the worries. Some of the companies failed to account for funds raised through their public offering, Xinhua said. 'Some public companies' reports lacked important information such as the operation of their capital,' the China Daily newspaper said in a weekend report. Some reports gave no explanation of big gaps between their profit forecast and actual business performance. 'A limited number of companies gave inaccurate statements in their reports,' the newspaper said. 'Some changed their profit forecasts, while others gave deceitful financial indices.' Boards of directors of companies with suspect reports must provide answers to the commission within a set time, Xinhua said. The 14 companies who failed to present reports at all must make public self-criticisms, and may be punished further if they still do not submit accounts.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, another important group of Armed Forces  officers presented a second petition challenging the  constitutionality of the law temporarily suspending their  political party affiliations. Those who signed the petition are  Army lieutenant colonels, majors, captains, first lieutenants,  lieutenants, and sublieutenants.    Court sources reported that the petition was signed by 18  lieutenant colonels, six majors, 31 captains, 42 first  lieutenants, 12 lieutenants, and four sublieutenants.    General Staff spokesmen said that in the next few days Air  Force and Navy officers will join the group who yesterday filed  their petition against the law suspending their affiliation.  <H5>  Same Arguments </H5>   We could not read the document presented in court. We  learned, however, that the lawsuit is based on the same  arguments used by generals and colonels in their lawsuit last  week.    The main arguments used by high-ranking and lower-ranking  Army officers in their lawsuit is that the law affects their  acquired rights, and that its effects cannot be retroactive.  <H5>  "Pancho" de Vargas's Threats </H5>   Military circle spokesmen said that the threats aired by the  Chamber of Deputies President Francisco Jose de Vargas against  those who signed the lawsuit were decisive for many who signed  the document.    Francisco Jose de Vargas suggested he would not approve the  promotion of officers supporting the challenge against the  constitutionality of the law on affiliations at the end of this  year.</p>

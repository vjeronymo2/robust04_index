			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Canadian cement maker bounces back to black St Lawrence Cement, eastern Canada's biggest cement producer, bounced back to profitability in the first nine months on increased volumes and higher prices, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Overheads were kept stable. Net profit was CDollars 8m (USDollars 6m), or 17 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 9.9m, or 24 cents, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 401m, up 10.4 per cent. Third-quarter profit was CDollars 13m, or 29 cents, against CDollars 4m, or 8 cents, on sales of CDollars 197m, up 13.5 per cent. St Lawrence recently sold its investment in Philip Environmental, a fast-growing Ontario industrial waste management firm, for CDollars 24m and a cement terminal and aggregate reserves. Debt has been reduced by 15 per cent. The company, controlled by the Swiss Holderbank group, has five cement plants in Canada and the north-eastern US, as well as a large construction business in Ontario.</p>

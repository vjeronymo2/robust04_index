			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Arts: Celebrating Shelley - the times and the places ENGLAND'S response to the bi-centenary of the birth of one of its greatest poets has been various and disparate - so unlike the official brouhaha that surrounded last year's Rimbaud centenary in France. There have been many lectures and readings up and down the country, some accompanied by music. Oxford's Bodleian Library has been hosting a Shelley bi-centenary exhibition, which runs until August 8. West Sussex County Council declared May 20 a Shelley Vegetarian School Meals Day in commemoration of the poet's vegetarianism. The Council has also published a Shelley Trail Guide, 'pinpointing places of interest in Sussex linked with Shelley and his family.' In April a permanent Shelley Room was opened at Horsham Museum. At Eton, Shelley's old school, speeches were delivered in his honour on April 23. The occasion that Shelley's shade is likely to have enjoyed the most was the Byron Society's dinner in his honour in the House of Lords on March 20, addressed by the Tory Peer Lord Blake; a more kindred spirit can scarcely be imagined. And on the day of the bicentenary itself, August 4, the National Portrait Gallery in London will host a tribute to the poet. Overseas, in April an exhibition of Shelley manuscripts opened at the New York Public Library under the title Shelley: Poet and Legislator, and that continues into September. In May a three-day international conference of Shelley scholars examined the poet's legacy at New York's City University Graduate Center. Celebrations in Rome (where the poet's ashes are buried), many organised by the Keats-Shelley Memorial Association with support from the British Council and Penguin Italia, have included a series of readings, lectures and films, and these will continue throughout the year. In Lerici, the May Poetry festival offered an evening boat trip in his memory - without, on this occasion, significant loss of life. All details of this year's Shelley celebrations world-wide can be obtained (send an SAE) from the Keats-Shelley Memorial Association, Flat 1, 33 Aberdeen Road, London N5 2UG. Publishers have also pulled out a few stops. The Hardy scholar Desmond Hawkins published a biographical account of Shelley's First Love (Margaret Harriet Grove) in May (Kyle Cathie, Pounds 14.99). Those fond of the fictionalised saga might wish to dip into Wild Spirit - the Story of Percy Bysshe Shelley (Hodder, Pounds 15.99); Robert Gittings and Jo Manton have re-assessed the importance of Mary Shelley's step-sister, Claire Clairmont, in Claire Clairmont and the Shelleys (Oxford, Pounds 20), and Judith Chernaik's Mab's Daughters, a fictional re-creation of the diaries of the women in the Shelley circle, is available in paperback (Pan Books, Pounds 5.99).</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Control tests Sir, There is one over-riding reason to support an auditors' review of internal controls in company reporting (Letters October 8). Computerised accounting and management information systems have transferred more control of financial reporting back to companies. As cases against auditors in recent years have revealed, auditors have to rely on these internal systems. Imposing some formal standards for companies to test these assumptions is clearly essential if the circle of assurance for investors and others is to be closed. What still needs to be tested is whether the proposed standard is adequate for this task. James Poole, 18 Canonbury Park South, London N1 2JJ</p>

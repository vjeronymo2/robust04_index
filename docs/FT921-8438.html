			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Somali warlords ignore UN ceasefire THE SOMALIAN capital, Mogadishu, was rocked by street battles and mortar bombardments yesterday despite pledges by rival warlords that they would comply with a United Nations-sponsored ceasefire, relief officials reported, Reuter reports from Nairobi. Clan forces of Mr Mohamed Farah Aideed are apparently trying to surround Mogadishu's northern Karan district where a rival faction leader, Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed, is making a last-ditch stand, according to relief workers who are in contact with the city by radio. For several days fighting has concentrated along a road linking Karan with a vital airstrip and the outside world. 'People are deeply pessimistic whether a ceasefire will work out at all,' one official said. A human rights worker who arrived in the Kenyan capital yesterday after being flown out of Mogadishu said that shelling had been constant. Some 5,000 people are believed to have been killed and a further 12,000 wounded since war erupted on November 17. Late on Sunday, the Aideed faction, which controls most of the city, said it would comply with the UN ceasefire which was agreed at talks in New York last Friday. In a Radio Mogadishu report, monitored by the BBC, Mr Aideed said he was ready to implement the UN resolutions to immediately halt fighting and to sign a formal ceasefire by the end of the month. Relief workers said few medical supplies had reached the district controlled by the Ali Mahdi clan since an International Committee of the Red Cross team of doctors was forced to pull out of a hospital last week. This left an estimated 4,000 wounded in makeshift hospitals without proper treatment. Scores of new casualties are being suffered daily. Aid workers said hospitals in the Aideed faction's part of Mogadishu had been receiving up to 330 casualties a day. The Radio Mogadishu report monitored by the BBC quoted Mr Aideed as saying he was ready to host a peace conference in the capital. He also appealed to international organisations for more aid. After United Somali Congress (USC) fighters ended the 21-year rule of Mr Mohamed Siad Barre just over a year ago, Mr Ali Mahdi - a wealthy hotel owner who had financed the guerrilla group - declared himself interim president. Mr Aideed, who seeks power himself, said the action broke agreements made in exile with other anti-Siad Barre groups from the north and south of the impoverished country.</p>

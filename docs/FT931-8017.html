			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Bad times loom for German carmakers GERMAN CAR makers face at least five bleak and uncertain years ahead, according to Mr David Herman, new chairman of Adam Opel, the local subsidiary of General Motors of the US. Consumer confidence was in free fall, he said at the weekend. Business confidence was still near post-war lows, but the recent plunge in morale had been the steepest in almost 50 years. It would be more than five years before Opel's output returned to the levels of the recent past. Mr Herman's grim forecasts followed news that German car production tumbled 27 per cent in January, while output of commercial vehicles was 57 per cent lower than a year earlier. Meanwhile, Volkswagen, the country's leading volume carmaker, confirmed that it was considering extending short-time working into the second quarter of this year. Opel, No 2 behind VW, has drastically downgraded its expectations. A fresh analysis of the company's medium-term business plans had resulted in forecasts for annual output being cut by an average 7 or 8 per cent, Mr Herman said. The current recession was unusual; a 'normal' slump lasted one or two years and was followed by a reasonably sharp upturn. This time he could see no possibility of such a recovery. Apart from recession the industry had to make allowances for the effects of Bonn's plans to increase oil taxes and levy tolls on motorway users. 'Even now drivers pay twice as much on vehicle and fuel taxes as is paid out for road construction and maintenance,' he claimed. Motor manufacturing was Germany's single most important industry; it was time to consider the effects of higher levies on investment and employment. Mr Herman, speaking at the launch in Seville, Spain, of the company's new Corsa compact car (sold as the Nova in Britain), said production on the new model would rise from 90,000 this year to 100,000 in 1994. Meanwhile, annual capacity would be increased to 400,000, split between the group's plants in Saragossa, Spain, and its new low-cost showpiece works in Eisenach, eastern Germany. Compacts now account for 20 per cent of the German market, where General Motors companies sold 658,000 vehicles last year - 8 per cent fewer than in 1991. Some 40 per cent of all GM's European sales are made in Germany. The nosedive in January output, reported by the VDA industry association, followed the introduction of short-time working in most domestic vehicle plants. Output is being reduced to cope with falls in domestic demand expected to range between 15 and 20 per cent this year. Meanwhile, car exports dropped by an adjusted 12 per cent and truck shipments abroad fell by half, the VDA said. New car registrations in west Germany were down 28 per cent during the month. But the figure was distorted by exceptional demand towards the end of last year, when buyers rushed to avoid the January 1 increase in value added tax.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video on an interview with </F> Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,  with unidentified NHK correspondent on 21 April; place not  given; from the "NHK News" program -- recorded]    [Text] In an NHK interview on 21 April Camdessus, managing  Director of the International Monetary Fund, strongly urged  Japan and the United States to improve their relations, saying  that economic friction between Japan and the United States has  negative impact on the world economy.    [Begin recording] [Camdessus in English, with Japanese  subtitles] The world has nothing to gain from the dispute. We  know that the two countries are responsible countries, and they  will do everything they can to solve this dispute. [end  recording]    Camdessus also stressed that the important thing is for  Japan  and the United States to meet halfway.    Moreover, he said the United States needs to exert efforts  to  reduce its trade deficit, and Japan needs to expand domestic  demand and open its markets.    While asking Japan to continue to introduce economic  stimulus  measures, Camdessus said further appreciation of the yen's value  will hinder economic recovery in Japan. He pointed out the  importance of cooperation among the developed countries for  stability of the foreign exchange market.    A meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the  Group of Seven [G-7] major industrial nations will be held in  Washington on 24 April. It can be said Camdessus, who will act  as referee at the meeting, made the recent remark while feeling  a strong sense of anxiety that Japan-U.S. economic frictions may  weaken the G-7 member nations' conciliatory stand in the fields  of foreign exchange policies and economic measures.</p>

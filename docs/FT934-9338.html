			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Games move by Olympic bidder MANCHESTER yesterday took the first steps towards bidding for the Commonwealth Games in 2002, with the aim of ensuring that a national stadium is built in the city as a springboard for another attempt to host the Olympic Games, this time in 2004. Organisers of the failed bid for the 2000 Olympics have started talks with potential backers and sporting interests. If a consortium can be formed, the Commonwealth Games Federation for England will be asked to make Manchester its candidate.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: A relapse into Eurosclerosis - The European Union needs deregulation and radical public sector reform to avoid becoming an economic backwater A decade ago, Europe was afflicted by a fevered debate on its poor economic performance. The policy doctors decided the correct diagnosis was 'Eurosclerosis'; their cure was completion of the single market, an idea subsequently incorporated into the Single European Act of 1987. For a time that remedy seemed effective. In the event, however, completion of the single market at the end of 1992 coincided with another recession and another bout of Europessimism. This time, the European Union has devised the white paper on growth, competitiveness and employment put forward by the president of the Commission, Jacques Delors, last December. By previous standards, it is a modest document. It eschews Brussels-led legislation in favour of a menu of recommendations for macro-economic stability, modest spending on infrastructure and small dollops of labour market deregulation. In the title of the white paper, 'competitiveness' is inserted between 'growth' and 'employment'. This is a little misleading. Overall, an economy performs, either well or badly: the notion of competitiveness is most relevant to sectors that are exposed to the international market, particularly manufactures. Start then with aggregate performance. Until recently, the Japanese economy grew far faster than those of the US and the EU, whose growth was similar (see chart). By contrast, the overall employment and labour productivity performances of the US and EU presented mirror images of each other: between 1980 and 1992, employment grew by 18 per cent in the US, while labour productivity rose 12 per cent; meanwhile, employment in the EU grew by only 6 per cent, but labour productivity rose by 22 per cent. The EU's superior productivity growth was wasteful, however, since it coincided with rising unemployment. The employment record of EU manufacturing is much the same as that of the US, both showing steep absolute declines. Thus the EU's jobs failure results from relatively poor employment generation in the more sheltered service activities. The central role of services in employment is inescapable, since by 1990 71 per cent of civilian employment in the US was generated by services, up from 56 per cent in 1960, while the proportion in the EU was 61 per cent, up from 39 per cent in 1960. Within advanced economies developments in manufacturing have long had negative effects on employment, for two reasons: the volume of manufactured output has tended to rise no more rapidly than output as a whole; manufacturing also offers exceptionally favourable opportunities for increases in labour productivity. The EU's chief overall failure has, in short, been its inability to create jobs. Economies with greater labour flexibility, such as the US, have generated more service sector jobs, many of them part time and many of them taken by women. Turn next to international competitiveness. Some three-quarters of the total merchandise exports of EU member states consists of manufactures. World trade in commercial services was only Dollars 1,000bn in 1992, as against Dollars 3,640bn of merchandise trade, of which Dollars 2,650bn was in manufactures. Manufacturing activities are, therefore, much the most exposed to the forces of international competition. The output of US manufactures between 1980 and 1992 rose twice as much as that of the EU, while Japan's rose far more. Output per person in EU manufacturing also rose less than in the US and Japan. This does not reflect an even performance throughout the EU. Between 1980 and 1989, according to the OECD, manufactured output per person rose only 15 per cent in West Germany and 29 per cent in France, but by 47 per cent in Italy and more than 50 per cent in the UK. Meanwhile, the share of EU external manufactured exports in world exports shrank from 21.9 per cent in 1980 to 19.4 per cent in 1986 and then 17.6 per cent in 1992. The EU has also become more inward-looking: between 1986 and 1992, the share of its members' exports going to one another rose from 54.1 to 59.7 per cent. One explanation for the poor performance of manufacturing exports must be the EU's relative emphasis on internal rather than external liberalisation. The EU has, in effect, been pursuing an import-substitution strategy, one favouring internal sales over exports. A second explanation would be a mixture of inadequate innovation with an unfavourable industrial structure. Magnus Blomstrom, a Swedish economist, notes that in 1987 the research and development intensity of US exports of manufactures to the EU was almost twice as high as in its imports from the EU. He also labels 51 per cent of US exports of manufactures to the EU in that year 'high technology', 29 per cent 'medium technology' and just 20 per cent 'low technology'. By contrast, he found that 23 per cent of the EU's exports to the US were high technology, 44 per cent were medium technology and 33 per cent were low technology. By specialising in goods that lack dynamic world markets or technological sophistication, European industry would be increasingly exposed to competition based on price. EU production is, in fact, already subject to growing competition from East Asian exporters of labour-intensive, medium- and low-technology manufactures. Thus, between 1981 and 1991 the volume of exports from east Asian developing countries, mainly of manufactures, grew at 10.3 per cent a year, while the EU's grew at only 4.1 per cent. Their pressure can only increase. An American economist, Larry Franko, has shown that between 1980 and 1990 the share of large EU companies improved modestly relative to their peers in the other big advanced economies in production of chemicals, consumer goods, pharmaceuticals and petroleum products. Of these, only pharmaceuticals has been a particularly dynamic industry. By contrast, European companies barely maintained their position in motor vehicles, electrical equipment and electronics, despite protection of the European market. Worse, their share of the world's 12 largest companies' output remained stuck at a negligible 7 per cent in computers and office equipment, the most dynamic of all manufacturing industries. A third explanation for both poor export performance and slow growth of output is the high level and adverse development of EU costs. According to figures from Morgan Stanley and DRI McGraw-Hill, 1993 labour costs per hour in the EU's most important economy, west Germany, were some 50 per cent higher than those of the US and Japan. Even labour costs per hour in east Germany were higher than in the US and Japan, while those of France were close to US and Japanese levels. Yet OECD statistics suggest that productivity per hour in US manufacturing is still about a third higher than in the most advanced economies of continental Europe. In addition, leading European currencies have experienced substantial real appreciations vis a vis the US dollar since the early 1970s. The US dollar's appreciation between 1979 and 1985 was but a blip in this trend. Other European currencies have suffered the same fate as the D-Mark, particularly the pound sterling, whose real appreciation since 1970 has been the biggest of the major European currencies. The last major issue is whether there is a link between the EU's poor overall employment generation, on the one hand, and the weak performance of manufacturing, the sector most exposed to global competition, on the other. There is: high labour costs. If domestic costs are pushed progressively above market-clearing levels, employment will shrink, or at least not rise as fast as could be hoped, since capital will be substituted for labour. In addition, the industries most exposed to international competition should lag behind the rest of the economy, as profits are squeezed. Both have happened in the EU. Between 1980 and 1992 US average real wages (before direct taxes) fell by about 8 per cent. Over the same period, however, British real wages rose by 36 per cent, German by 22 per cent, Italian by 14 per cent and French by 13 per cent. It is easy to see why Americans voted for a candidate who promised them more 'good jobs'. Yet it is also easy to see why the EU has generated few jobs and its internationally competing industries have struggled. Three explanations might be advanced for the EU's high and rising labour costs in the presence of growing unemployment: first, inadequate competition, particularly for the output of its service industries; second, legislation intended to give security to workers, which reduces the competitive pressure from outsiders on insiders; finally, the relatively high burden of taxation and particularly of direct charges on labour, which European workers have been unwilling to absorb in their take home pay. The solution to the twin problems of poor employment creation and inadequate competitiveness lies in greater competition, labour market deregulation and radical reform of the public sector. If such changes are ruled out as politically unrealistic, reality will have its revenge. Eurosclerosis will become permanent and the European Union eventually a backwater in the global economy.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- What the industrialists think  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CARLO DE BENEDETTI Chairman of Italy's Olivetti computer group 'European politicians must make greater efforts to understand where the world is going, rather than just concentrate on their own little gardens. They must recognise the importance of China. They must see that the upturn in many American industries has come not just because of cyclical recovery, but because of deeper structural changes.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SIR DENYS HENDERSON Chairman of Britain's ICI/Zeneca chemicals &amp; pharmaceuticals group 'A general problem is the excess of regulations stultifying industry. If we cannot fight our corner with the US and competitors in the Far East, Europe will be in severe trouble. There has been a steep change recently among companies in continental Europe. They realise they are not competitive when social charges add 80 to 90 per cent to wage costs.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TYLL NECKER Chairman of Hako-Werke &amp; president of Federation of German Industry 'Everywhere - particularly in France and Germany - the public sector's share of the economy is too high. We need further support for innovation: in some fields, such as genetic engineering in Germany, there are still far too many hindrances. We also need to do more in the field of education and a general overhaul of social security systems is what is required.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- EBERHARD VON KOERBER Chairman of European side of Swiss-Swedish ABB engineering group 'We will all have to go through a severe crisis - not so much in the UK, more in places like Spain and Germany. Even with improved economic growth, we will experience higher structural unemployment throughout Europe. Without this pressure of pain, Europe will not react in the correct way. The structural crisis we are facing is in fact a unique opportunity.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- NOEL GOUTARD Chairman of French motor components maker Valeo 'We need to cut interest rates. The French franc's attachment to the D-Mark has caused horrible unemployment. I do not see any usefulness in the idea of monetary union, which is anyway utopian. Europe has to face up to an increasingly hispanic North America, and from countries like China and India that now have freed their reserves of expression and imagination.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: Gatt, OECD, Datastream  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

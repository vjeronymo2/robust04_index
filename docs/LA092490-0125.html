			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> TIRED LEMOND DROPS OUT OF RACE  </P> <P> Fatigue prompted three-time Tour de France winner and hometown favorite Greg  LeMond to withdraw three-quarters of the way through the Du Pont Pro Cycling  Championships race, which was won by Michael Carter of Boulder, Colo.  </P> <P> Carter outraced a field of 55 world-class cyclists from 12 countries Sunday to  take top honors and move into contention for the U.S. Pro Cycling Federation's  national criterium crown.  </P> <P> He seized control of the race in the 15th lap and dominated from then on,  finishing the 52-mile event in 2 hours, 5 minutes, 42 seconds. LeMond, who has  a home in suburban Wayzata, withdrew in the 30th lap of the 40-lap race.  </P> <P> "That was a hard race. I'm so embarrassed," said LeMond, who before the race  accepted a plaque proclaiming Sunday "Greg LeMond Day" in Minnesota. "I knew  I'd feel bad, but not this bad. I've felt lousy all week.  </P> <P> "Before the race started, I debated if I should start it. I should never have  started. If it were a flat course, I wouldn't have had a problem. But on a  course like this, there was no faking today."  </P></p>

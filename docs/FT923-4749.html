			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Early Dow rise lost as jobs data are awaited Wall Street US SHARE prices ended little changed yesterday after coming off early morning highs as traders and investors positioned themselves for today's important jobs data and the approaching Labor Day lengthened weekend, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished just 1.89 up at 3,292.20, after having stood 20 points ahead at the day's peak. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended unchanged at 417.98, although the American SE composite gained a net 2.37 at 385.10 and the Nasdaq composite 3.63 at 574.88. New York SE turnover was fairly heavy at 212.5m shares. The sharp rise in Tokyo stocks overnight and a bright showing on European bourses laid the groundwork for a firm opening in New York. Japanese stocks have now climbed 30 per cent from their recent floor, an indication, said some analysts yesterday, that the prolonged downturn in the Tokyo market may be over. Apart from Tokyo's advance, investors were keeping their eyes firmly on today's employment report for August. The consensus among analysts is that last month's non-farm payrolls rose by 155,000, although most of the increase is expected to have been related to temporary hiring under a federal summer jobs programme. Overall, the picture is expected to remain flat. Citicorp slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 16 1/4 on reports that a study by the Comptroller of the Currency had discovered serious management and credit quality problems in the bank's mortgage business. One of the busiest stocks was Gap Stores, which fell Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 33 1/2 in turnover of 3m shares after the company reported that comparable same-store sales rose 6 per cent in August, a figure that disappointed the market. May Department Stores shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 59 1/4 after announcing that same-store sales were down 1.2 per cent in August. The company blamed the fall on the shift in the Labor Day holiday this year. The repercussions of Hurricane Andrew continued to take their toll. Lennar Homes dropped a further Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 23 1/2 as investors feared that more home owners in south Florida who lost their houses in the hurricane may sue the company for shoddy construction. Lennar says the suit is totally without merit. On the Nasdaq market, larger capitalised technology stocks continued to lead the way with solid gains. Intel rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 62 1/4 , Microsoft Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 76 5/8 , Borland Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 43 3/4 and Sun Microsystems Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 27 5/8 , but Apple eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 47 3/4 . Canada PROGRESS in Canada's constitutional talks helped Toronto stocks withstand the late retreat on Wall Street. Although slipping from its midday high, the TSE 300 index finished 16.5 ahead at 3,453.2 and volume was heavy at 36.5m shares. Advances led declines by 359 to 213. Also adding to the bullish tone on the Toronto market was the stronger US dollar, cuts in leading Canadian banks' prime rates and gains in overseas markets.</p>

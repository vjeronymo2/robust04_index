			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / People: The end of another era at BTP Frank Buckley, who has been the catalyst for change at BTP - once British Tar Products and now a leading maker of lipstick preservatives, beer clarifiers and flame retardants - will, from January 1, drop the chief executive's role. Now 64, he will remain chairman. Steve Hannam, who has headed the chemicals division for 5 1/2 years, will become managing director. Buckley, a smoker of enormous cigars, says he used to be simply 'a good chemist'; working in the US for Allied Chemical Corp, he was in at the birth of chlorofluorocarbons. CFCs are now on the eco-hitlist, but he recalls how their use in the Dollars 99.99 air-conditioning system and refrigerators for the masses in the 1960s was a blessing to the world. He moved to BTP about 25 years ago as a 'consultant local director'. As the tar business dried up, the old tanks were used to store all sorts of other things, churning out the cash that was invested in chemicals. When 'Pen' Lloyd, the sort of man who hunted with his bones in plaster, died suddenly in 1979, Buckley became chairman and chief executive. But the group has maintained some of the traditions of the Lloyd era; it still holds its annual meeting in early August at the Cafe Royal - in time for the glorious dash to Scotland.</p>

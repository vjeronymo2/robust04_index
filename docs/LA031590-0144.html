			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTION '90;  </P> <P> SOMETHING NEW FOR SAN GABRIEL: A TRANQUIL CITY COUNCIL CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> The stunning fact of the current City Council election campaign is the absence  of any obvious rancor in a community once synonymous with down-and-dirty  politics.  </P> <P> So far, not even a public candidates' forum has been scheduled before the April  10 balloting in which incumbents Ted R. Anderson and Sabino M. Cici and  challenger Dominic S. Polimeni are vying for two seats.  </P> <P> Tranquility, however, is a recent phenomenon. In 1987, the electorate, upset by  population growth that was changing the look of the city of 34,000, imposed a  moratorium on residential and commercial construction.  </P> <P> In April, 1988, a slow-growth slate swept three council members and the city  treasurer from office. A fourth council member resigned soon afterward.  </P> <P> Then came a vitriolic and successful recall of one of the newly elected council  members, Frank Blaszcak. After being thrown out of office by a nine-vote margin  in May, he sued those who campaigned against him for libel and slander. The  suit is pending.  </P> <P> The five-member council has imposed a building moratorium to limit growth and  has taken steps to curb the density of residential housing and commercial  development. In addition, the council recently approved an ordinance  prohibiting construction of bulky, two-story houses that would dominate small  lots.  </P> <P> Although the three council candidates say growth and development remain issues,  each stresses maintaining orderliness with the city's governmental affairs.  </P> <P> "We're back on the path of being positive again. It's the makeup of the City  Council that's doing it," said Cici, a 12-year councilman who owns and operates  a local locksmith shop.  </P> <P> "My issue is experience," the 50-year-old Cici said. "I'm the only council  member with more than two years on the council."  </P> <P> Anderson also cites his experience. "People have indicated to me that I was one  of the stabilizing forces on the council," he said. "I have a mission I still  want to accomplish."  </P> <P> Anderson, who was campaign manager for the slow-growth slate that won in 1988  and was appointed to replace the councilwoman who resigned, is an administrator  for the Los Angeles office of the National Council on Aging. He is in his 60s  but won't disclose his age, saying it is irrelevant.  </P> <P> In his first run for office, Polimeni casts himself as not beholden to any  particular political group. Polimeni, a seven-year member of the Parks and  Recreation Commission, says he has been active in community affairs for the  nearly 20 years he has lived here. Since 1975, the 49-year-old Polimeni has  been administrator of Alhambra Municipal Court.  </P> <P> He would apply the same kind of energy to the council post, he says, that he  has in his administrative job, where he has overseen establishment of a new  courthouse child-care facility, a joint effort between the city of Alhambra and  Los Angeles County.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The QM Software Co., Ltd. (Onga-machi, Fukuoka  Pref.; president: Eiji Ishii), a developer of mechatronic  equipment, has developed a low-cost energy-efficient method for  controlling electric vehicles that employs a general-purpose AC  motor (3-phase AC induction motor). The drive units of electric  vehicles are usually DC motors, but QM Software has reportedly  solved the problem of control at low speed that has been  plaguing AC motors, and is now able to use that motor in  electric cars. The company is also looking at the idea of  forming ties with a car manufacturer in order to commercialize  the motor.    In order to test the motor, it outfit an electric car and  golf cart with the motor, a controller, and battery. The motor  used in the electric car had a maximum 10 kW output (15 hp) and  could achieve a maximum speed of 40 km/hr. The motor used in the  golf cart had a 2.2 kW maximum output (3 hp), a maximum 40 km/hr  driving speed, and a hill-climbing ability less than 20 km/hr. A  general-purpose motor is a lot cheaper and more durable than a  DC motor, but at low speeds it is hard to control due to its  rotational unevenness. QM Software, however, has perfected a way  of achieving smooth control at low speeds by a method known as  "vector control," which it has applied to this motor. The  president of QM Software, Eiji Ishii, said that speed variations  per rpm (revolutions per second) in a four-electrode motor were  less than 0.1 percent, which is quite stable. Because the motor  generates strong torque (rotational force) at low speeds, it  enables quick acceleration and is good for climbing hills.    A general-use motor also has the ability to generate  electricity when going downhill or decelerating, so by returning  this electricity to the battery, it is able to conserve large  amounts of energy. Compared to an electric vehicle equipped with  a similar size DC motor and battery, a car outfitted with this  AC motor can travel far greater distances.    In addition to the electric vehicle and golf cart, the  company is also working on a monorail transport vehicle for golf  courses that it plans to outfit with the same motor. Putting the  motor into commercial mass production is beyond their  capability, so it plans to link up with different manufacturers  who have expertise in that area.</p>

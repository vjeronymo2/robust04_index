			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Japan freezes car export quota for US THE Japanese government has decided not to alter the country's voluntary car export quota for the US from last year's level of 1.65m units, claiming that the freeze will 'assist the rehabilitation' of US car makers. Japan had reduced the quota from 2.3m units in 1991, but the US car industry demanded further cuts, arguing that the figure had become meaningless as it did not take into account the US production capacity of Japanese makers. Mr Yoshiro Mori, the minister of international trade and industry, said the freeze would assist one struggling US car maker in particular. Mr Mori did not name the company, but was apparently referring to General Motors, the largest US maker. Voluntary restraint began in 1981, under pressure from the US government, when the quota was set at 1.68m units. It was lifted to 2.3m units from 1985, where it remained until the revision in March,last year. Japan's quota announcement coincided with the release of a US Commerce Department forecast that the US is likely to see a 9.5 per cent increase to Dollars 21.9bn in the deficit this year in car and car parts trade with Japan. The Japanese government argues that US makers are likely to benefit from an increase in consumer demand this year, and the restraint on exports will limit the ability of Japanese to profit from the recovery. 'The US automobile industry now looks like it is recovering but there is still uncertainty over its outlook,' Mr Mori said. Meanwhile, the Japan Automobile Importers' Association said imported vehicle sales fell 7.7 per cent last year to 184,615 units, the second consecutive year of decline. Total sales in the Japanese market fell 7.2 per cent to 5.3m units. Sales of US-made cars rose 23.1 per cent, but the largest increase was in imports of Japanese makers' vehicles. Ford Motor sales rose 15 per cent and Chrysler reported sales 7.4 per cent higher, though GM had a 1.9 per cent decline in sales.</p>

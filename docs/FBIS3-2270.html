			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bangkok, March 8 (XINHUA) -- The ASEAN special  senior officials meeting (SOM) continue its closed-door meeting  today in preparation for the first ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF),  the grouping's new mechanism for security dialog.    A Thai official said to local media Monday [7 March] that  the  foreign ministers' conference would be held on July 23-24, which  would be followed by the first session of the ASEAN Regional  Forum (ARF) on July 25.    The annual post-ministerial conference with seven dialog  partners -- The United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,  South Korea, Japan and the European Union -- is set on July  26-27.    The six-ASEAN member states are also inviting five other  countries -- China, Russia, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea  -- to attend the ARF.    Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pracha Gunakasame  was  quoted by the local media as saying that Monday's meeting  endorsed a related idea -- the proposed establishment of a  regional peace-keeping center.    But it remains to be decided whether the center should  function as a nucleus for training regional peacekeepers or one  for exchanging information.    Monday's gathering also discussed outstanding problems in  the  South China Sea, on the Korean peninsula, and prospects of  setting up a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality (ZOPFAN).    The meeting which began on Monday will end Wednesday.</p>

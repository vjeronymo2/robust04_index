			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH HELD 'ANEMIC' IN S&amp;L CRACKDOWN;  </P> <P> CITIZEN GROUP HITS SLOWNESS TO ACT ON 'BUCCANEER' THRIFTS  </P> <P> A public interest group stoked the political furor over the savings and loan  crisis today, saying the Bush Administration's efforts to crack down on fraud  in the savings and loan industry has been "anemic at best, irresponsible at  worst."  </P> <P> "The original S&amp;L calamity is now being compounded, every day, by the  Administration's failure to bring law and order to the nation's financial  industry," said Michael Waldman, director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch.  </P> <P> The organization, founded by Ralph Nader, released a report detailing the  widespread fraud in the thrift industry and the efforts of the Administration  to bring those responsible to justice.  </P> <P> "Unless a real crackdown begins against these buccaneer bankers, this financial  crime wave will be fully subsidized by average taxpayers," Waldman said.  </P> <P> The collapse of the thrift industry is expected to cost taxpayers anywhere from  $132 billion to $500 billion, making it the worst financial debacle since the  Depression.  </P> <P> "The Bush Administration's efforts to pursue and punish S&amp;L fraud have been  anemic at best, irresponsible at worst," said Sherry Ettleson, a Public Citizen  staff attorney.  </P> <P> The Administration, which launched an ambitious program last year to rescue the  savings industry, has been harshly criticized for the slowness of its efforts.  </P> <P> The White House and Congress aggressively traded charges today over who should  take responsibility for the industry's collapse. Presidential spokesman Marlin  Fitzwater said the Administration is perfectly willing to turn debate over the  crisis into a campaign issue, saying, "We're ready to play."  </P> <P> President Bush is scheduled to give a speech about the savings and loan  industry on Friday at the Justice Department. All 93 U.S. attorneys nationwide  have been summoned to attend by Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh.  </P> <P> The Justice Department has come under criticism for the slow pace of thrift  failure prosecutions and the White House is concerned that the Democrats are  turning the massive taxpayer bailout into a campaign issue.  </P> <P> The U.S. attorneys will have "an ongoing discussion of S&amp;L prosecutions,"  Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian said. They will be "sharing  information, sharing investigative techniques."  </P> <P> Treasury Secretary Nicolas F. Brady also will attend.  </P> <P> The Justice Department is wrestling with a growing backlog of unaddressed  thrift fraud cases. According to the Public Citizen report, the department was  actively pursuing only 891 cases of the nearly 7,000 referrals and complaints  received as of February.  </P></p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Digital shares advance in spite of mounting losses Digital Equipment yesterday reported heavy fourth-quarter and year-end losses as the computer manufacturer continued to struggle to achieve a turnround after four years of losses. Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 1.75bn, or Dollars 12.64 a share, after restructuring charges of Dollars 1.2bn and write-offs of intangible assets valued at Dollars 380m. Losses from operations were Dollars 160m, or Dollars 1.22 per common share, which were above Wall Street projections. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 3.92bn. In the fourth quarter last year Digital recorded net earnings of Dollars 113.2m, or 85 cents, on revenues of Dollars 3.91bn In spite of the heavy losses, its shares rallied to close at Dollars 19 3/4 , up from Monday's close of Dollars 18 3/4 . Analysts were encouraged by higher-than-expected revenues. Orders booked during the quarter increased. 'The fundamentals of our business are showing some positive and encouraging signs,' said Mr Robert Palmer, president and chief execu-tive. However, product gross margin fell sharply to 25 per cent of sales, from 38.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993. The drop reflected a shift toward lower-margin personal computers. PC sales almost doubled in the quarter and represented 39 per cent of Digital's computer revenues, the company said. Other factors reducing product profit margins included price reductions, a shift toward increased use of indirect sales channels via independent resellers and plant closure costs. Sales of Digital's Alpha systems, based on the company's new high performance microprocessor technology, were up 54 per cent from the third quarter and 164 per cent year-over-year. Alpha systems represent 31 per cent of computer revenues. During the fourth quarter Digital cut 9,200 jobs, said Mr Vincent Mullarkey, chief financial officer. Digital was confident it could fund restructuring activities from operations and asset sales, he said. For the fiscal year, Digital suffered a net loss of Dollars 2.2bn, or Dollars 15.80 a share. In addition to the fourth-quarter charges, the year-end figure included a charge for accounting changes of Dollars 51m. Net loss on operations for the year was Dollars 519m, or Dollars 3.86. Revenues declined by 6 per cent to Dollars 13.45bn from Dollars 14.37bn in fiscal 1993 when the company reported net losses of Dollars 251m, or Dollars 1.93.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Troitskiy: "It Was Decided To Save on </F> `Enemies of the People'"]    [Text] Having persuaded the Duma to approve the  annual budget "in the main," the government brought itself to  familiarize deputies with some details, which they did not  surmise.    A few days ago the head of the cabinet appealed to the Duma  to urgently adopt the law "On Changing, Suspending, and  Nullifying Some Legislative Acts." It is proposed that the  operation of a number of articles of 14 laws and 5 decrees  adopted by the Supreme Soviet, which establish numerous  privileges and monetary compensations for various categories of  individuals, that is, tax police workers, judges, procurators,  donors, athletes, servicemen, Chernobyl residents, victims of  illegal repressions, and so forth, be abolished "for the period  until the deficit level reaches 5 percent." For the purpose of  saving budget funds, the government proposes that those that  suffered from the Chernobyl accident be squeezed "with respect  to the receipt of an interest-free loan" and the pardoned  "enemies of the people" be deprived of the "right to free  passage on railroad and city transport and the right to a  50-percent reduction in the amounts of payment for living space  and municipal services."    According to the prime minister's estimates, by abolishing  the indicated privileges and compensations, the state will save  90 trillion rubles, which will greatly improve the financial  situation. Warding off possible suspicions of a negative  attitude toward the acts of the former parliament, the cabinet  of ministers also abolishes 37 of its own decrees, denying tax  indulgences and subsidies to a number of sectors, subjects of  the Federation, and mass information media. Moreover, the  government proposed that 12 presidential edicts, in which the  head of the state promised much to various citizens, sectors,  and regions, be abolished.    Although the prime minister did not spare the pride of both  branches of power, his proposals irritated many Duma members.  Vladimir Isakov announced that "responsibility for the  nonfulfillment of Yeltsin's high-sounding promises made on the  eve of the elections and the referendum on the Constitution is  shifted to the Duma." Fractions of communists and agrarians  became indignant and decided not to support such an  "anti-popular" budget. Nikolay Petrakov, a Yabloko member,  called all this a "farce." Most of all, parliament members were  offended by the fact that, apparently, the government had  already excluded from the draft budget all the expenditures  specified by documents, which were still to be abolished. The  Duma, discussing and approving the budget "in the main,"  naturally, did not know the above.    The Explanatory Note on Expenditures on the Maintenance of  Bodies of Power also surprised deputies. In all, a little over 7  trillion rubles are to be spent on this matter. Out of this sum  154.6 billion are allocated to the Federal Assembly. The  parliament values itself slightly more, in connection with which  the government note states: "According to the data of the  Administration of Affairs of the Russian Federation President,  the implementation of the Law on the Status of a Deputy will  additionally require 172.8 billion rubles," a sum which the  government did not take into account in the draft budget,  because appropriate calculations were late. This explanation did  not comfort deputies at all. Moreover, they noted with malicious  pleasure that the president's Administration of Affairs managed  to assign all 400 billion rubles for its own needs. Individual  Duma members assume that expenditures on one department of the  president's administration cannot exceed twofold expenditures on  both chambers of the federal parliament.    Be that as it may, new circumstances, which have become  known  after the official introduction of the draft budget in the Duma,  threaten to complicate the procedure of its approval. The  process can drag out until the summer, or maybe until the fall.  Next the rejection of the budget by the Federation Council and  even a presidential "veto" are possible, if deputies do not take  all government wishes into account. However, this will only be  good for executive power: All these months the government will  live according to a budget, which it "approved" for itself. At  the end of the year it is too late and pointless to rectify or  refine anything.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Frankfurt - Other markets The Bundesbank Council meets on Thursday but, says James Capel, what little news that has come out since the last meeting is unlikely to prompt any move in rates. The German chemicals companies, reporting this week and next, will conclude the European interim results season. Figures come from BASF on Thursday, followed by Bayer on November 28 and Hoechst on November 30. Hoare Govett says that after a strong set of figures from ICI, DSM, Akzo Nobel and Rhone-Poulenc, it expects a sound improvement in pre-tax profit from the Germans, although reported figures may be tempered by managements' reluctance to reveal the extent of the recovery with wage negotiations pending. The broker adds that BASF and Hoechst will show the strongest improvement from last year's very depressed profits. Commerzbank is expected to start the banks' 10-month reporting season on Wednesday. Merrill Lynch expects operating profits to improve slightly over the first half of the year, but warns that core income may be weakening. The investment bank says the banks appear undervalued in the context of the German market, but fair value in international terms. It also points out that the banks tend to outperform a falling equity market but underperform a rising one. Deutsche Telekom, the state-owned group, is expected today to name the banking consortium that will handle its privatisation, the largest in Germany's post-war history, at the start of 1996.</p>

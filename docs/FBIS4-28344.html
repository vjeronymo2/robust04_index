			<p>BFN     [Text] Discussions on imposing sanctions on the DPRK (North  Korea) over the nuclear arms development issue have suddenly  assumed a realistic edge. On 6 June, Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata stressed once again the government's stand of seeking a  peaceful settlement, saying that "even if the situation becomes  tense, we have to remain calm." But, Japan will have no choice  but to make a political decision if the United States changes  its mind and adopts a hard- line stand. Nevertheless, concerned  ministries and agencies, which are trying to map out concrete  measures to deal with possible scenarios, are hesitating to do  what they have to do because complicated factors are involved in  the issue, including "the Constitution," "human rights," and  "the past." It is possible that depending on how things develop  in the future, the issue may have a serious impact on the  political situation in Japan. Therefore, we can say that the  DPRK issue has reached a delicate stage.    On 6 June, the government was busy dealing the North Korean  issue. In the afternoon of the same day, Deputy Chief Cabinet  Secretary Nobuo Ishihara chaired a "Joint Information Council"  meeting, which was attended by each ministry's responsible  officials, including the International Bureau chief of the  Foreign Ministry and the chief of the Defense Agency's Bureau of  Defense Policy. In the evening, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata,  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, and other officials held a  meeting with the chief of the Foreign Ministry's Diplomatic  Policy Bureau, who returned home after attending a  Japanese-U.S.-ROK meeting in Washington, to talk about  countermeasures to deal with the situation.    The Joint Information Council was formed in 1983 to carry  out  coordination regarding issues that concern each ministry. The  council has been studying countermeasures to deal with the North  Korean issue since last fall. The list of possible "sanctions"  that Japan submitted to the Japanese-U.S.-ROK meeting on 4 June  was based on the outcome of meetings of this council.    The council meeting lasted more than an hour, and those  attending discussed "things that they had never before talked  about" (according to one of those in attendance). After the  meeting, Ishihara and other attendees agreed that they would  remain tight- lipped, saying: "We exchanged unofficial  information.... We will not disclose it at all."    Fundamentally, the government's official stand is "to settle  the issue through discussions" (according to Chief Cabinet  Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai). A government source, in an attempt  not to irritate the DPRK, stressed that "the meeting attended by  the prime minister and other officials was not meant to be a big  event like discussing countermeasures."    On the other hand, the government needs to explain its stand  to the United States. The prime minister clarified last night  the government's stand that Japan will act in concert with the  United States in making a decision on sanctions. This remark  reflects the complicated composition of the relations between  Japan and other countries. A top government official said:  "This is an issue related to Japanese-U.S., Japanese-ROK,  Japanese-Chinese, and Japanese-Russian relations. A change in  our relations with one country will have an impact on our  relations with other countries."    The government has already compiled 10 nonmilitary measures  to be prepared for a possible decision to impose economic  sanctions on the DPRK. Of the 10 items, the Finance Ministry is  worried the most about a ban on capital flows to North Korea. A  senior International Financial Bureau official said: "This is  completely different in terms of the extent of the sanctions  imposed in the past. We hope that we can find a political  settlement, if that is possible."    The United States pointed out that funds from Japan are a  "major source of finances" for the Kim Il-song regime.  Therefore, it is certain that the United States will demand  that Japan strictly check the flow of funds from Japan to North  Korea. However, the government, if it wants to be thorough in  imposing regulations, will have to force North Koreans living in  Japan and others who travel to the DPRK to undergo strict body  and luggage checks at airports and seaports. Some officials are  beginning to express their concerns, saying that "this may  create confusion over the human rights issue and at airports and  seaports."    As for a possible ban on the export of goods to North Korea,  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] is  saying that "We will carry out our duties once the government  decides its policy" (according to a senior MITI official). It  is possible to revise the Foreign Exchange Control Order and the  Export Trade Control Order and to impose a ban within a few day  after notifying the people of such a revision. The MITI has  already taken action in this regard, and it has almost completed  its in-house coordination.    On the other hand, the Defense Agency [DA] is assuming a  situation will develop in which the United Nations will be  forced to impose sanctions on the DPRK by taking military  action, including a naval blockade. Among other things, the  same agency is studying possible legal difficulties involving a  situation in which the Self- Defense Forces are asked to join  and cooperate in logistical support by supplying fuel and food  to the military forces of the United States and other countries.  However, DA Administrative Vice Minister Shigeru Hatakeyama  said: "That will be difficult because, generally speaking, the  Self-Defense Forces are not allowed to carry out such tasks."    It is inevitable that Japan will be faced with the issue of  constitutional interpretations, including exercising the right  of collective self-defense, should the discussions be extended  to such matters as directly participating in a naval blockade.  Many DA officials take a cool view of this and say, "We cannot  possibly hold such discussions" (according to a senior DA  official).</p>

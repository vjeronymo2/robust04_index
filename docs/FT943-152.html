			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Flextech Pounds 9m in loss after 'eventful' half year Flextech, the new media group which has expanded rapidly as a provider and manager of cable and satellite television channels, announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 9m for the six months to June 30. Turnover at the USM-quoted former oil services company amounted to Pounds 7m. The Pounds 9m loss - including start-up costs of new satellite channels  -compares with a Pounds 3.2m deficit, although since then the company has changed beyond recognition. The main developments have included: A majority stake has been taken by TCI of Denver, the largest US cable operator. The programming assets of United Artists European Holdings, a subsidiary of TCI, have been integrated with Flextech's. A 20 per cent stake has been bought in HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the west of England. Flextech has a 30 per cent stake in the Dow Jones plan to launch The European Business Channel early next year. With a touch of understatement, Mr Stanislas Yassukovich, chairman, said that the first half of 1994 had continued to be eventful. The company said yesterday that when The Learning Channel joined the Sky Multi-Channels package on October 1 Flextech would contribute 'eight out of 16 channels marketed as the Sky Multi-Channels Package'. Losses per share amounted to 11.81p (6.68p). The retained loss totalled Pounds 9.6m.</p>

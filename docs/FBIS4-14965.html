			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 5 April, TASS -- The 14th  Russian Army withdrawal from Moldova before settlement of the  Trans-Dniester problem may destabilize regional situation,  deputy 14th Army commander for personnel Colonel Alexandr  Baranov told ITAR-TASS today, commenting on the eighth round of  negotiations on the 14th Army status and term of its Moldovan  stay.    "The Russian military helped to stop the bloodshed inspired  by extremist-minded politicians in summer 1992," said the  colonel. "So, no matter what they say the 14th Army remains a  stabilizing factor in the region and its presence cools hotheads  on both banks of the Dniester River."    In the opinion of Baranov, the troops pullback in 1994, as  it  is suggested by the Moldovan side, is unreal. Re-location of  the Army is difficult and costly. The more so, the  trans-Dniester region is a native land of many officers, many of  them have families, relatives and housing in the region.    "Hasty and poorly-considered decisions on the army pullback  may result in undesirable consequences. I hope this is  understood both in Moscow and Kishinev," stressed the colonel.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (g) Economic impact and effects. What are the suggested escort zone boundaries? How long (time and distance) are the escorted routes? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> What are the costs for escort services (hourly rates for tugs of various sizes)? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Existing vessel traffic services. Is the waterway served by a vessel traffic system? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Are there regulated navigation areas (RNAs), safety zones, or areas to be avoided? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Local practices and customs. Are there existing (or anticipated) escort requirements for the waterway, such as State regulations or local Federal requirements? If so, how do they compare with the 33 CFR part 168 escort regulations? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Are there informal escorting programs already in effect? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Disabled vessel response strategies. What self-help measures could be utilized by a disabled ship (for example, how feasible is anchoring)? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Are escort vessels needed continuously at all points along the waterway, or can a rescue tug be stationed at a strategic point? Is there adequate sea room for a disabled ship to safely drift while waiting for assistance? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> How available are suitable tugs-of-opportunity of various sizes? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) Effectiveness of escort vessels. Can the waterway effectively benefit from vessel escorting? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In constrained or congested waterways, can escort vessels accompany a ship without increasing the risk of collision with other vessels? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Can the escort keep position where it can maneuver and react in time to assist the disabled ship? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Are there other environmental or operating factors which reduce an escort vessel's ability to safely respond? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Graduated requirements. Are graduated requirements appropriate? For example, should escorts only be required for ships that exceed a size threshold, or when sea or weather conditions degrade below a minimum threshold? If so, what are those thresholds? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (m) Other risk management strategies. Are there other ways that collision or grounding risks of a disabled ship can be reduced, such as establishing one-way traffic lanes, designating areas to be avoided, or other measures? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rulemaking issued under PWSA authority must discuss these factors with respect to each affected waterway. Therefore, when waterways are nominated for escorting in the future, the nominations should include information related to these factors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These criteria will be the principle topic at the public meeting. The Coast Guard is seeking comment on the criteria, as well as additional criteria which could be used in evaluating waterways with respect to escorting. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> G.A.

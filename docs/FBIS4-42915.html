			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Philippe Tesson] </F>   [Text] Paradox: It was from the mouth of a foreigner,  namely the President of the United States, that Europe just  heard the mobilizing language which it is so cruelly lacking in  this time of self-doubt. Bill Clinton, whose trip to France  will leave an unexpected mark and who surprised people with his  determination, skill, and charisma, stressed his strength in a  speech before the National Assembly to express his faith in  Europe, to point the way to its future, and to offer it American  support. Would it be an offense to the memory of Kennedy to  speak of a new frontier regarding the grand European design  evoked by Clinton? At the very least, the U.S. President had  pledged he would give impetus to a cause which we wrongly felt  had been relegated to secondary standing on the White House's  list.    Of course, allowances must be made. Clinton could not come  to Europe without boosting Europe. The specific circumstances  of his visit were doubly binding on him. Lastly, his commitment  to Europe was not given free of charge. He is actually  responding to American interests, and it will be no coincidence  if the "Europe according to Clinton" closely follows these  interests. Indeed, such a Europe will not be to the taste of  all the various attitudes found in Europe. He has such a  pragmatic vision that we will grant him the mental reservation  of seeing Europe as the Trojan Horse of American interests  [sentence as received]. Is he not actually preempting this  suspicion by coming out in favor of a European defense identity  and by hoping for a strong Europe alongside a strong America?    It is up to us, Europeans, to assess the common aspects and  overlapping between our interests and those of the United  States. Who would contest Clinton's analysis of the necessary  development of a market economy in the countries of East Europe,  and who would contest that Europe has a dominating role to play  in this strategy? In this respect, Clinton taught us a good  lesson yesterday. Have we not wasted enough time? Similarly,  who would deny that Europe and the United States have a joint  responsibility to export democracy?    Yesterday, Clinton set us back on the track of our European  obligation. We should at least recall this lesson drawn from  encouraging words which -- even if they have some underlying  reservations -- should lead us to overcome our disillusion.</p>

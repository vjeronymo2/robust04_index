			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague/Bratislava, April 13 (CTK) -- "If in the  future Vladimir Meciar ever headed the Slovak government I would  consider it dangerous for Slovakia," Slovak President Michal  Kovac said on Czech television this evening.    If the man ousted from the Slovak premiership by a March  no-confidence vote were to become premier again, it "would only  serve to strengthen Meciar's exceptional, almost superhuman  abilities," Kovac said in an interview on the programme "21".    Meciar's style, methods and means had threatened Slovakia's  interests. He had not managed to solve economic problems which  in normal circumstances could have been solved, Kovac said.    "We were aware citizens were losing faith in politics and  public servants, people's dissatisfaction was growing and ideas  were entering their heads of the need for a strong hand and an  authoritarian regime -- ideas far from the democratic style of  government," he said.    Most of the original supporters of Meciar's party, the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), and many members of  parliament had realized the danger and harmfulness of Meciar's  ways, Kovac said.</p>

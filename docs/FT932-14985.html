			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Anglo-Eastern rises to Pounds 1.32m Anglo-Eastern Plantations continued to progress through the second half and for the full 1992 year achieved a rise in profits from Pounds 471,000 to Pounds 1.32m pre-tax. Having returned to the dividend list at the midway stage the rubber, cocoa and palm oil estates company is now recommending a 1p final for a 1.375p total. Turnover totalled Pounds 4.93m (Pounds 3.73m). Earnings per share rose to 3.4p (1.1p). The directors said the improved results reflected the first full year of operation of the palm oil mill and a strong palm oil price throughout 1992.

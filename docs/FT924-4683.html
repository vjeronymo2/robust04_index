			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Hoskins Brewery moves ahead slightly to Pounds 50,000 MR BARRIE HOAR, chairman of Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based real ale brewer, has thanked the shareholders who backed him and his brother, Robert, against attempts to remove them from the board. He said, when reporting interim pre-tax profits slightly ahead, that 84 per cent of shareholders who voted supported them. He added: 'A great deal of time and money has been spent which will be hard to recoup in these difficult business conditions.' Profits for the USM-quoted company in the six months to September 30 were Pounds 50,000 (Pounds 48,000) on turnover 15 per cent lower at Pounds 812,000 (Pounds 950,000). Earnings per share were 0.87p (0.83p) basic or 0.82p (0.78p) fully diluted. Mr Hoar said that beer consumption was still falling and the company would be monitoring the industry before embarking upon the replacement of its tenanted licensed estate. The profit on the sale of public houses, completed in October, would be taken in the second half. The company now had cash of Pounds 750,000 and no borrowings.</p>

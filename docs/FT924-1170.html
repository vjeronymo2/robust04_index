			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Letter: Less costly treatment of arthritis Sir, I was somewhat puzzled by your editorial, 'Health reforms' (December 15). Your first paragraphs appear to confirm what we know, that people with the severe pain of arthritis have to wait too long for all kinds of treatment. Yet in paragraph four you suddenly conjure up 'excess capacity' in the 'world-famous hospitals' in London] There is no excess capacity for the treatment of arthritis in London or elsewhere; there is only a shortage of money to pay for it. If the needs of people with arthritis for earlier diagnosis and prompt and efficient treatment were met, the results in the long term would be less costly surgery and fewer people with severe, and therefore costly, disabilities. Surely the government and health authorities should be taking a long-term view? R E Gutch, chief executive, Arthritis Care, 18 Stephenson Way, London NW1</p>

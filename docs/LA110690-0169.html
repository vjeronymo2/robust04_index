			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLIPBOARD;  </P> <P> BREEDING BIRD: GREEN-BACKED HERON (BUTORIDES STRIATUS)  </P> <P> Description: Small, stocky heron with short yellow legs (males' legs are bright  orange during high mating plumage); glossy blue-green back; neck is deep  chestnut. The immature heron is browner above, white chest and neck streaked  with brown.  </P> <P> Average length is 18 inches, wing span is 26 inches. Formerly called the Little  Green Heron.  </P> <P> Habitat: Marshes, ponds, wetlands; often perch in tops of eucalyptus trees.  </P> <P> Diet: Fish, insects, snails, crayfish, shrimp and small amphibians.  </P> <P> Displays: Male raises crest and neck plumes, swells throat and calls while  hopping from foot to foot in front of female.  </P> <P> Nest: Woven twigs and branches near or over water.  </P> <P> Eggs: Light green with bluish hue. Length is 1 1/2 inches.  </P> <P> Notes: Green-backed herons have been observed using insects, berries or twigs  (which are often trimmed to size) for bait. After casting the lures onto the  water, the herons crouch and wait for curious or hungry fish to inspect the  bait. This is a rare case of tool use and, especially, tool manufacturing in  ornithology.  </P> <P> Breeding bird atlas: To report bird breeding activity in your neighborhood, or  to get information on the breeding bird atlas, call Sea and Sage Audubon  Society members Sylvia Gallagher, (714) 962-8990, or Nancy Kenyon, (714)  786-3160.  </P> <P> Note: Map is divided into 5-kilometer squares so that Audubon Society  volunteers can more easily survey areas on a regular basis.  </P> <P> Sources: Sea and Sage Audubon Society; "The Birder's Handbook," Ehrlich, Dobkin  and Wheye, Fireside Books (1988); "Field Guide to the Birds of North America,"  National Geographic Society (1987); "Birds of Southern California: Status and  Distribution," Garrett and Dunn, Los Angeles Audubon Society (1981)  </P></p>

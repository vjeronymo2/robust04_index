			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> QUESTIONS ABOUT SCHOOL REFERENCE  </P> <P> It is indeed unfortunate that The Times, even in printing a correction of  previously published misinformation erroneously identifying one of our schools  as the site of a shooting, continues to allude to the involvement of a school  in the tragic death of a child. Your Sept. 13, 1990, "For the Record" article  stated that "the suspect reportedly took the gun to school that day," and also  that "the shooting took place after school," which are unnecessary references  to the school in the reporting of the incident. More appropriately, the time of  the incident should have been specified without a reference to school; and the  alleged report that the gun was on campus is unverified and unnecessary in this  reference by The Times.  </P> <P> GEORGE J. MCKENNA III  </P> <P> Superintendent of schools  </P> <P> Inglewood Unified School District  </P></p>

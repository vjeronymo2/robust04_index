			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Canada): Turbulent week in Toronto THE TORONTO stock exchange proved this week that investors in resource-based markets need iron-clad stomachs, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. The TSE-300 index lurched from a 172-point dive in the first two trading days of the week to a 56-point climb on Thursday. It then fell 7.63 points, or 0.19 per cent, to close at 4001.69 on Friday. The turbulence came just two weeks after the index broke through its August 1987 record, reaching a new all-time high of 4,143 on Sept 1. This week's whipsaw action was most evident in the gold and junior oil and gas sectors, which were the mainsprings of the 24 per cent rise in the TSE-300 in the first eight months of 1993. But the market as a whole has been ripe for a retreat. With the TSE-300 at an average of about 17 times projected earnings, prices have been supported by little more than hopes of improved corporate profits and dividends. The economy shows little signs of life, however. The plunge in the gold price and weakness in metals and forest-products markets has clouded the outlook for big resource companies. Mr Christopher Martin, a director at Cassels Blaikie, a Toronto securities firm, cautions that 'there's still definite over-valuation in the market-place. You have to be very selective.' He notes that, besides weak commodities markets, many of the traditional giants of commerce and industry are still in the midst of restructurings. On the other hand, many money managers continue to insist that they will use any substantial correction as a buying opportunity. While further shocks may be in store, it's difficult to find an analyst who thinks this week's upheavals are the end of the bull market. Interest rates and inflation remain low; and the economy is recovering, more slowly than most expected, but it is recovering.</p>

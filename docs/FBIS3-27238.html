In this month of China's most important holiday, consumers'  strong buying mood is exerting severe pressure on the  government's effort to control inflation, said Wang Shiyuan,  Vice-Minister of the State Commission for Economic Restructuring.    However, Wang noted, "I am still confident that the  government will attain its goal of containing inflation within  10 percent this year."    Despite Wang's confidence, the State Statistics Bureau  reported that in December inflation in the 35 largest cities  rose to a record 23.9 percent.    Some Beijingers doubted the government would be able to cap  inflation at 10 percent.    One resident, Li An, said the government's latest financial  reforms--including the unified exchange rate, the consumption  tax and the new accounting system--might undercut effective  control over the rising cost of living.    Wang Shiyuan said the government has foreseen possible  side-effects of its reform and will take measures to keep  inflation at bay.    The most important step in easing inflationary pressures is  to ensure a general balance between supply and demand of goods,  he added.    The government also intends to restrain economic expansion  this year by keeping growth in the gross domestic product to 9  percent.    In addition. it will strictly supervise bank lending for  investment in fixed assets.    Wang said several factors pose a threat to the government's  efforts to control inflation:    --Production costs for industry and agriculture have risen  over the past few years as a result of government price  increases for various production materials.    --Last year's 19.6 percent rise in the national cost of  living has already created conditions that hamper the  government's campaign against inflation.    --Apart from unifying the dual-rate exchange system, which  effectively raises the cost of imports, the government also  plans to deregulate the prices of other product some time this  year.    Increased financing during the fourth quarter of last year  to  stimulate industrial production has had a notable impact on  production, but also on inflation, Wang added.</p>

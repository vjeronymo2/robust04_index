			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DYING MAN'S FAMILY IN FIGHT WITH AF  </P> <P> The family of an Air Force employee dying of cancer is angry with the  Department of Defense for refusing to fly the man by air ambulance from  Palmdale to Boston so he can spend his last days in the suburb where he grew  up.  </P> <P> Avram Brody, 25, a civilian who worked as an electronics engineer at Edwards  Air Force Base for three years, was diagnosed as having an inoperable brain  tumor last year, officials said. Doctors in July gave him only weeks to live.  </P> <P> Family members say his final wish is to return to his childhood home of  Norwood, Mass. But the cost of providing commercial air ambulance service is  between $5,000 and $10,000, a sum the family cannot afford, said Margaret  Sullivan, an assistant to U.S. Rep. Nicholas Mavroulas (D-Mass.).  </P> <P> Despite requests over the last few days from Mavroulas, U.S. Rep. Joseph  Moakley (D-Mass.) and U.S. Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), Air Force officials  have refused to fly Brody, citing regulations that prohibit the transport of  civilians. Air Force Maj. Fran Tunstall said such trips would cost the  government about $30,000.  </P></p>

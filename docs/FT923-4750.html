			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris takes the lead in the continental rally MILAN missed out on a continental rally, stoked by a firmer dollar, less anxiety over the French referendum, and opening gains in the UK market, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS's futures-driven rally was frustrated by computer problems which closed down trading for several hours. The CAC-40 index ended up 69.05 or 4 per cent to 1,780.46, its highest close in four weeks. Turnover was relatively heavy at FFr2.3bn. Dealers said that cautious optimism about the Maastricht referendum, the rally on the UK stock market and a firmer sterling prompted a flood of buy orders from London and domestic institutions. An absence of poor corporate results and rumours that the German government was considering fiscal advantages to encourage investment in eastern Germany also fuelled the rise in share prices. Among the day's winners were Michelin, up FFr13.80 or 7 per cent to FFr204.40 and Euro Disney, FFr4.90 or 6.4 per cent to FFr81.90. Total bounced back FFr10.40 to FFr205.50 in the wake of its recent losses. Nomura and Merrill Lynch issued 'buy' notes on the oil refiner yesterday. FRANKFURT saw more short-covering, and a rise in sympathy with other markets. The DAX index ended 24.08 higher at 1,530.75; some of this reflected gains reported in Frankfurt's post-bourse on Wednesday, but there was a similar extension of the uptrend yesterday afternoon. Volume rose from DM3.8bn to DM4.3bn. Major blue chip advances included Siemens, up DM10.70 to DM594.50, Bayer's DM4.70 to DM268.50, DM12.30 to DM621.80 for Daimler and DM7.10 to DM319.50 for Volkswagen. Deutsche Bank, too, saw solid interest, gaining DM10.60 to DM612.60. Dealers said that the bank had held an analysts' meeting on Wednesday, which had a broadly neutral impact. MILAN was dragged lower at the opening by heavy selling by one of the larger domestic brokers, and dealers remained pessimistic about the market in spite of a late recovery in prices. The Comit index fell 3.91 to 371.43, a new low for the year, in turnover estimated at more than L100bn after Wednesday's L92.7bn. Rumours of a capital increase dragged the widely-held Mediobanca down by L435 or 4.6 per cent to L9,095. The stock has also been dogged by persistent rumours about its veteran chairman, Mr Enrico Cuccia. Italmobiliare remained on the sellers' list, falling L2,010 or 6.4 per cent to L29,500. Benetton was brought off the day's low of L10,100 by its first-half results which were in line with expectations. The stock closed L150 higher at L10,500. AMSTERDAM rose 1.7 per cent, investors moving in to buy shares as the dollar strengthened. Some relatively good corporate earnings news also helped. The CBS Tendency index added 1.8 to 110.3. ING put on Fl 2.40 or 5.5 per cent on news of a 7 per cent rise in first-half net, while Ahold dipped 40 cents to Fl 75.70 on disappointing first-half profit growth of 6 per cent. MADRID bet on a French Yes vote on Maastricht, the general index rising 6.48, or 3.1 per cent to 216.30. Banks included a Central Hispano rise of Pta230 or 7.7 per cent to Pta3,230, after it talked of reducing the number of its branches by a net 500 to 2,500 next year. Dealers said that this rise was not volume-driven, and that individual gains were erratic. In construction stocks, Uralita, which on Wednesday reported first half profits of Pta14bn after extraordinary profits of Pta21bn, rose Pta69, or 10.7 per cent, to Pta715. STOCKHOLM recovered in moderate trading, supported by falling domestic interest rates and gains in foreign markets. The Affarsvarlden General Index rose 7.5 to 753.9 in turnover of SKr400m after SKr458m. New bankruptcies in the real estate sector continued to plague the banking section, with S-E Banken falling to a year's low of SKr14.5, down SKr0.5. OSLO's recovery, with the all-share index up 1.8 per cent to 313.02, was marred by a NKr7.5 drop to NKr32.5 in Aker, which said that its Norwegian Contractors subsidiary would incur a 1992 loss of NKr400m after miscalculating the costs of installing a concrete platform at the Heidrun gas and oil field. BRUSSELS bounced back from its recent losses, the Bel-20 index ending 20.70 or 2 per cent higher at 1,066.86. Petrofina closed BFr210 or 2.5 per cent higher at BFr8,560.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - SEP 3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1021.33  1023.40  1023.82  1023.62  1026.84  1029.78  1028.19  1031.46  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              Day's High  1031.48    Day's Low  1021.33  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        Sep 2     Sep 1    Aug 28    Aug 27    Aug 26      1011.19   1007.79   1013.54   1017.14    997.98  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / International Company News: Shares in Baltica suspended SHARES in Denmark's biggest insurance group, Baltica Holding, and its insurance arm, Baltica Insurance, were suspended yesterday after the stock plunged from DKr216 to DKr155. The company is negotiating with banks about its financial problems, which may lead to changes in the group's structure. Details of the restructuring will be published 'before the end of March', at the same time as the group's annual accounts. Baltica was rescued last year when Den Danske Bank bought 32 per cent of the shares in Baltica Insurance, a move that relieved Baltica's immediate cash-flow problem. The group said at the time that it expected to make a 1992 group loss of between DKr2.5bn (Dollars 393m) and DKr2.8bn and that its equity capital would be reduced from just over DKr9bn at the end of 1991 to between DKr4.5bn and DKr4.8bn. Some analysts now expect the 1992 loss to exceed DKr3bn. The problems at Baltica are concentrated in the holding company, which was set up in the mid-1980s to enable the insurance company to venture into banking and other non-insurance financial activities. The holding company has had to make large write-offs and provisions on an office complex development project in Gibraltar and on a Danish property business, Sanexco. Baltica is the second big Danish insurer to hit trouble. Last August, Hafnia Holding, Baltica's main domestic rival, suspended payments after its equity capital was wiped out by losses on strategic shareholdings in Baltica and the Swedish insurer, Skandia.</p>

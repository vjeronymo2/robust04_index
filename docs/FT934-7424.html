			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nine-fold advance by Ericsson ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, yesterday unveiled pre-tax profits of SKr569m (Dollars 69m) for the third quarter of 1993, a nine-fold increase from SKr63m in the same 1992 period. Surging sales and intensive cost-cutting lie behind the upturn, which drove up profits for the first nine months to SKr1.86bn from SKr122m. A strong improvement in the company's performance is expected in the final three months, when the impact of the 25 per cent drop in the value of the krona will be felt more strongly as hedging programmes expire. The company expects its 1993 result will be 'somewhat more than double' last year's SKr1.3bn level. However, many analysts had been more bullish, looking for profits of around SKr3.5bn, and they were disappointed by the company's cautious tone. The group's B shares dipped SKr1 to SKr412. Nine-month sales jumped 41 per cent to SKr42.4bn from SKr30.2bn, while orders climbed 30 per cent to SKr49.2bn. The weaker krona accounted for 10 per cent of the orders increase, and 20 per cent of the sales rise.</p>

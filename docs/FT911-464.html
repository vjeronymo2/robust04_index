			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: Craftsman on a knife-edge IT WAS a burning childhood ambition of Bill Galbraith's to have his own clockmaking workshop. This ambition was doubtless fired by the fact that he was bred to clockmaking, but was born not long before his grandfather's clock shop was a casualty of that infamous recession of the early 1930s. On demob from the Second World War, Galbraith headed for London and now has his own business, with workshops in both London and Fowey, Cornwall. It has taken time to get this far, and not without the assistance of Bill's silver tongue to placate the bank manager. The economic climate has not been kind. When he arrived in London, clock and watchmaking concerns abounded, including such old names as Dent, Frodsham, Camerer Cuss, Asprey, Garrard, and others. Of these, only Asprey and Garrard still maintain workshops - the others are all gone. In an unexpected way, Bill has benefited (if not profited) from this trend. Cornwall was originally just for holidays, but one day a gas repair man fell to talking over a job and showed a surprising understanding of the intricacies of rebuilding a clock movement. Not only was the gas man a former clockmaker, but he knew others in Cornwall who were fellow cast-offs from the shrinkage of horological workshops in London. The result is that Bill has set up a second workshop in Fowey, which helps to reduce overall costs as the overheads are lower. Bill's London workshop has provided a sound practical training ground for commercial clockmakers and restorers. Many of his workmen have gone on to set up their own workshops, having benefited from the quality of clocks (many by Knibb and Tompion and Quare) entrusted to his care. Such a grounding in commercial restoration is of inestimable good for the trade as a whole. It cannot be gained at horological college where students, rather than gaining specialist skill experience, are of necessity taught in a somewhat uncommercial and academic environment and trained to cover all three aspects of the modern craft - clocks, mechanical and quartz watches. Bill's first clockmaking experience was gained in polishing nests of bells for musical clocks. Done after school, his father, in true Scottish spirit, paid him sixpence for each set: only recently he discovered his father was actually receiving nine shillings for each set] On arrival in London, an employment bureau got him a job at a small clockshop off Liverpool Street. A rapid move to Bravington's (of 'make sure its a Br-Br-Bravington's' fame) enabled him to cast round for the best workshop to join. Thus Bill came to Camerer Cuss in New Oxford Street, still run by the descendants of a Black Forest clockmaker who emigrated in the 1780s. Terence Camerer Cuss keeps the name going with an antique clock business in St James's. But Bill set up on his own in 1969; fortunately, just before the gaffer died, otherwise he would have felt obliged to stay on and help run the business. By then Bill was workshop manager at Camerer Cuss and had seen the assimilation of the old precision watchmaking firm of Usher &amp; Cole. With them came contracts for maintaining the marine chronometers of shipping lines, so work had been specialist but varied. There were departments for chronometers, cuckoo clocks, a timing division for stopwatches, two separate clockshops and a watchshop. The cuckoo clock produced was a specifically English model in the form of a Tudor house, the first of which went to Prince Charles's nursery. A couple of relocations later, Galbraith's London workshop is in Britton St., Clerkenwell, the heart of the traditional clock and watchmaking quarter. Both these moves were forced on him by developers - the first, working next door, having demolished the party wall, then proceeded to buy the freehold over Bill's head. The next shop was really a stop-gap, but he managed to get the old gas turbine overhead belt-drive for the bench lathes going again. That was a practical move, whereas occasionally using the gas bench lights was less serious. In reality, no-one could see a thing, but what a marvellous draw it made for American owners of clocks that needed working on] Bill was always brought up to believe that a clockmaker should also be capable of attending to clock cases. From this has arisen the fine art division of his business. Freshly washed ormolu and gilt cases once returned to a dealer's shop suddenly showed up all the other stock, which in turn promptly arrived at Galbraith's for cleaning and repair. This side has expanded so that while much is done in-house, some 23 skilled outworkers are also called upon. Singing bird boxes and other automata are specialities. A typical story is of an elaborate early 19th century model tree with a singing bird automaton that was promptly damaged again by its owner while stepping over it on the floor. The decision was made to do extra work that had been held back on first time round, and it's not kept on the floor any more. A recent project has been true to Bill's origins - the production of a series of 12 longcase regulators in fine mahogany cases. It's at moments like this that Bill wishes that he could rip up an uncle's old loft floor back in Glasgow, if it's still there, because the remaining stock of fine Honduran mahogany from his grandfather's clockshop was used up there. Making precision clocks by hand today does not really make economic sense, as the full cost of man hours involved cannot be charged out to the customer. But a clockmaker's lifeblood is not in bread alone. Bill enthuses about the little details that go into making these clocks, like jewelled pivot bearings and a knife-edge suspension for the pendulum. There is not quite the same joy in his face when talking about an alternative but necessary area of clockmaking to keep the coffers from running dry. New clocks for public locations involve such enticing tasks as working from a hoist 45 feet up in the air in a blizzard last winter to link up the drive work behind the clockface for the hands. Public clocks can have a better side, when they are designed, as in a recent clock, to have a triple tiered automaton of medieval soldiers, swans and fish. The mechanism may have to be electric, but the final result is rewarding. Notwithstanding this new work, Bill's workshops hold together eight clockmakers within a staff of 12, split between London and Cornwall. He feels it is a great pity that 95 per cent of business comes from within 25 miles of Clerkenwell(including Heathrow). Where are all those clocks in the West Country?

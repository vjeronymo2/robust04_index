			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities surge on buy order Electricity and water shares surged ahead yesterday on reports of a big buy order from one of the UK's leading investment institutions and optimism over interest rate cuts. While the initial spurt came from hopes of an interest rate reduction in the near term, support was fuelled by talk that Kleinwort Benson Investment Management was a large buyer of the sector on the back of receipts - said to be in the region of Pounds 200m - from its European privatisation trust fund. Dealers said they believed Kleinwort was buying UK utilities as a holding investment ahead of the upcoming privatisation issues. Sentiment was also boosted by the second share buy-back in as many months by Eastern Electricity. The Rec bought a further 500,000 shares at 699p after the market closed on Tuesday, adding to the 1.2m bought at 644p two weeks ago. Eastern has shareholders approval to buy back a further 11.8m shares. Yesterday the stock surged 21 to a record 722p. Elsewhere, Norweb hit a record, 800p, up 24, and Northern reached an all-time high of 781p, a jump of 22. Among the waters, Anglian gained 11 to 579p, Yorkshire 12 to 606p and Severn 13 to 632p.</p>

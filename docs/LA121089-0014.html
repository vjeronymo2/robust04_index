			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: JAZZY JEFF, FRESH PRINCE DELIVER CINEMATIC CLARITY;  </P> <P> DJ JAZZY JEFF &amp; THE FRESH PRINCE "AND IN THIS CORNER . . . ," JIVE ***  </P> <P> Clean-cut and middle-class are not words typically used to describe most young  rappers, but this duo has been saddled with them, thanks to last year's  crossover smash "Parents Just Don't Understand," a comical, adventure-packed  tale about joy-riding in Daddy's Porsche.  </P> <P> The two are back with a slightly more profanity-laced perspective, but their  descriptive powers have the same cinematic clarity -- and something about the  Fresh Prince's rap style still suggests that he was one of those joke-telling,  motor-mouthed kids in high school capable of forcing a teacher into early  retirement.  </P> <P> Whereas most rappers fall into the LL Cool J / Kool Moe Dee mode of proclaiming  how big, bad and infallible they are, Jeff and Prince are just as likely to  come across as a hapless duo who attract bad luck ("All That Glitters"), odd  encounters ("Twilight Zone") and Gucci-clad gold diggers ("You Got It"). Their  saving grace is the wiseacre sense of humor that infuses cuts such as "I Think  I Can Beat Mike Tyson" and "The Men of Your Dreams," in which the Fresh Prince  attempts to woo an older woman by proclaiming, "Any man can look and see where  the curves are / It takes a real man to find where the nerves are."  </P> <P> With "Too Damn Hype," the team closes the album on a dance-oriented, down 'n'  dirty (well, down 'n' slightly disheveled) note. Not a heavyweight effort, but  a smart and funny one.  </P> <P> Albums are rated on a scale of one (poor) to five (a classic) stars.CONNIE  JOHNSON  </P></p>

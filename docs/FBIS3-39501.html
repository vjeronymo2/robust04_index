			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "Jl": "German Exports Have Gained Ground </F> Again"]    [Text] Frankfurt, 16 February -- As a result of the clear  recovery of the global economy, the long stagnation in the  German export sector has also come to an end. The Bundesbank  writes this in its new monthly report. Because of the  continuing weakness in investment and in private consumption,  recessionary trends have not been overcome completely in western  Germany, but, together with a strong recovery in construction at  the end of last year, recovery in the export sector gives  particular reason for confidence. Strong economic growth has  continued in eastern Germany. Now economic expansion is no  longer supported solely by the construction sector, but  increasingly also by the manufacturing industry.    According to the Bundesbank, for the first time in more than  a year, exports clearly increased in the last two months of  1993. In October and November, exports exceeded those of the  two previous months by 5 percent. As a result of the tangible  recovery in export business, the trade balance surplus -- 16  billion German marks -- was twice as high as in August and  September. Foreign orders to the manufacturing industry  continued to rise strongly during the last quarter of 1993; they  were 8.5 percent higher in real terms than during the  corresponding months of the previous year. Growth was  particularly high in automobile industry and in machine building.    According to the Bundesbank, this was due partly to economic  recovery in some European countries and in the United States.  The competitiveness of German companies improved because, among  other things, of the exchange rate against important European  currencies and the U.S. dollar. In the Bundesbank's view, the  German import demand had already reached its low point in the  summer months of 1993.    Regarding domestic demand in western Germany, the  still-existing weaknesses were concentrated on private  consumption and investments. The increases in the income of  private households are more than devoured by price hikes and  higher rates and fees. The inclination toward investments is  hurt by the lower company profits, the still- missing  expectations for the future, and a continuing low capacity  utilization. Even though the downward trend in production has  been stopped, capacity utilization is still low because of the  previous long decline while plans for company expansions are  relegated to the back burner. In total, domestic orders in  investment goods sector were 5 percent lower during the last  quarter of 1993 than during the corresponding period the year  before. The companies' gross fixed investments were about 10  percent lower.    In eastern Germany, indicators have gained in dynamism, the  Bundesbank thinks. This is due, above all, to a steady  expansion of domestic demand, which indicates that industrial  products have become increasingly competitive.</p>

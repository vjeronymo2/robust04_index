			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Letter: Level playing field for all types of investors Sir, The desirability of a level playing field for all classes of investor is raised again by the fall of 17p (4 per cent) in the share price of English China Clays on Wednesday. In Thursday's financial press this was ascribed to the effect of a presentation by the company to 50 fund managers on Tuesday night and it is reasonable to assume that the fall was triggered by action taken as a consequence of what they were told. Then yesterday came the announcement by ECC of a rights issue, a proposed acquisition in the US and a de-merger of its construction materials business. Now, ECC may feel that it did its best to make whatever information it imparted on Tuesday available to a representative audience. However, it was not generally available to the private investor until 24 hours later, by which time the bird had flown the coop. Is there not, please, a clear case for the stock exchange committee to rule that those privy to such briefings should be debarred from acting on them until the information has been published in the press? Indeed, this incident reinforces the stock exchange's own view that information given at such briefings should be simultaneously channelled through the exchange.

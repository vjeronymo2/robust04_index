			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / US Money and Credit: Fixed-income investors pleased by producer prices JUST when it looked as if the US bond market rally had run out of steam, recently-retreating Treasury prices have turned smartly on their heels and are heading back upwards. It was bad inflation news which sparked the March sell-off that pushed bond yields up through 7 per cent so it was no surprise that it was good inflation news which prompted the market's unexpected recovery, and helped bring bond yields down to 6.85 per cent - their lowest in several weeks. The good news came in the form of the producer prices index, which rose 0.4 per cent in March. That figure might have unsettled the market, but for the bulk of the rise being a temporary blip in energy prices. What pleased fixed-income investors was the news that core producer price inflation (PPI)  -the index minus its volatile food and energy components - rose by only 0.1 per cent last month. The PPI numbers pushed the 30-year bond up by more than a full point, and immediately raised hopes that the March consumer prices index (CPI) would be equally positive. The CPI figures proved equally bullish for the market, showing a modest 0.1 per cent increase for the month. Both sets of data came as welcome news after a difficult March, in which inflation jitters had pushed yields higher and threatened to end the bond market rally that had dated back to before President Clinton's inauguration. Yet a brighter inflation outlook is not the only buttress providing support for bond prices. There are other factors. Treasury investors were delighted by the success of Senate Republicans to force President Clinton to compromise on his economic stimulus package. Although lacking the votes to defeat the measures, the Republicans mounted highly effective filibusters to delay the bill. The bond market hopes that pressure from fiscally conservative Congressional opponents will force the White House into scaling down the size of its stimulus package. Such an outcome could limit the inflationary consequences the package might have - if and when it passes through the legislature and finally begins to impact upon the economy. There has been a technical dimension to the rebound. Last week, reports from two respected bond authorities, Goldman Sachs and Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates, addressed the issue of whether the Treasury was planning to change the way the government borrows money. The Goldman report said the Treasury would probably halve the number of 30-year bond issues a year from four to two, and make up the difference by issuing more bills. The McCarthy report went further, and said that a Treasury study had recommended a 50 per cent reduction in the long bond, the elimination of the seven-year note altogether, and a 20 per cent cut in the size of the monthly five-year note issue. The reductions would be offset by increased issues of bills. Of the two reports, only McCarthy's claimed to be based on inside sources, but even so, both moved the market, lifting bond prices in anticipation of some cut in future supply. Yet, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, has consistently denied that there were plans to make changes to the borrowing mix, and no announcement of any move is likely until May at the earliest.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESSES TREAT MARINES' FAMILIES TO SOME R&amp;R  </P> <P> Some were proud. Others, weary or bitter.  </P> <P> But nearly all 750 wives and children of U.S. Marines deployed in the Persian  Gulf appeared grateful Sunday for a day of relaxation and entertainment offered  by a Newport Beach hotel and local businesses.  </P> <P> The wives, mostly married to enlisted men, dined from an elegant buffet and  listened to a celebrity dance band in a ballroom decked out in yellow ribbons,  carnations and balloons.  </P> <P> In another room, their children danced with Hula-Hoops, talked to Santa Claus  and Batman and sent Christmas cards and valentines to their fathers thousands  of miles away.  </P> <P> "This is great," Madeline Harville, 32, told Col. Paul Johnston, commanding  officer of the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station who, at the request of Newport  Marriott management, had invited the spouses of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing,  stationed in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and elsewhere in the gulf.  </P> <P> Half the unit is deployed in the gulf and more are preparing to leave, Johnston  said.  </P> <P> "This is the first support the wives in our squadron have had since (the  deployment) in August," said Harville, whose husband, Top, a master sergeant,  is in Bahrain. He has told her that morale is plummeting in the gulf for a  variety of reasons, including discrepancies in living conditions for officers  and enlisted men.  </P> <P> Harville also said she sent a letter two weeks ago to the Pentagon asking for  more support for spouses, but has not received an answer. "Wives need a whole  lot more" moral support and information, she said. "We need to know we're going  to be OK, what's going on."  </P> <P> Harville came to the free party with her two children, Jeffrey, 12, and Steven,  5.  </P> <P> The children ate hot dogs and mingled with volunteers dressed as a Ninja  Turtle, Batman, Uncle Sam and the Statue of Liberty. Some played war with long  balloons as swords.  </P> <P> Others fashioned valentines out of lace and pipe cleaners. "I Love you Daddy.  Love Rachel," said one decorated with wooden hearts.  </P> <P> The party arrived on the heels of disappointing news for those such as Judi  Burch of Irvine, who had expected her husband, Dave, to return home in a troop  rotation in February. U.S. leaders announced last week that the still growing  number of troops will not return until the crisis is resolved.  </P> <P> "I understand they're doing a good job. I wish they'd come home. They're needed  here too," Burch said.  </P> <P> Her only child, Christopher, 9, has had occasional stress-related breathing  problems since his father, an air traffic controller, left Aug. 18, she said. A  pediatrician told her he will recover when he accepts the situation, Burch  said.  </P> <P> Christopher said his father used to take him snorkeling every night in the  community pool. He misses his father and sends him his schoolwork and talks to  him on the phone.  </P> <P> "I'm proud of him," he said as a peace sign was painted on his face. The boy  also planned to send his father a photo of himself taken at the party as he sat  on Santa's lap and asked for a pair of Roller Blades-style skates.  </P> <P> Former Army Green Beret Gerry Rush, corporate travel director for the hotel,  thought of the idea of the party and enlisted the volunteer services of 200  hotel employees and several local businesses to make it happen. Rush, whose  license plate carries a Vietnam ribbon and the motto "It was always right,"  said he felt it was his job "as an American" to help the families.  </P> <P> He also wanted to help those who have been hurt financially by their husband's  deployment. The event included sign-up for classes on job interviewing skills  and door prizes.  </P> <P> A Marine sergeant earns between $15,000 and $16,000 a year, and many  moonlighted as clerks or security guards to make ends meet, Johnston said.  </P> <P> "Some (wives) lost up to $1,500 a month, easy," Rush said.  </P> <P> About half the families arrived on buses from the air stations at El Toro and  Tustin. The hotel also paid about $800 to keep day-care centers open Sunday at  the bases so that women with very young children could attend the brunch.  </P> <P> The hotel hoisted a 20-by-16-foot yellow ribbon on its facade Sunday, a symbol  that the troops are not forgotten. It will remain up until the end of the  crisis, a workman said.  </P> <P> "Orange County is pretty behind what they're doing," said hotel manager Tom  Limberg. "No matter how you feel politically, their families are a few thousand  miles away. It's nice to give them a happy day."  </P> <P> Some wives, such as Lisa Soto of Irvine, said they were treating the deployment  as any routine rotation. She said her husband, Capt. Alfred Soto, is a career  military officer and is serving "somewhere near a place that begins with a D."  </P> <P> She brought their 4-year-old twins, Amanda and Alicia, to the party. Each had  hearts painted on her cheeks.  </P> <P> "We're tough, right?" she asked. The two nodded pleasantly. "We're Marine Corps  kids, right?" Four hearts bobbed up and down. "We're prepared. Right?" More  nodding.  </P> <P> "They're celebrities at school," the mother said.  </P></p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Brussels in anti-trust move: Guidelines for national courts published THE European Commission yesterday encouraged national courts to handle more Community anti-trust cases, publishing guidelines about how the existing responsibilities of national and central EC authorities could be split. The initiative is part of the Commission's effort to decentralise responsibilities, in the face of accusations that too much power is conferred on the Brussels bureaucracy. However, the Commission continues to exercise substantial powers in the area of competition, as it demonstrated yesterday by publishing nearly 40 anti-trust and state aid decisions, including a hefty Ecu10.1m (Pounds 8.17m) fine on a Belgian-run shipping cartel. The Commission, which will continue to supervise deals with Community-wide significance, said anti-trust action through national courts would almost certainly be quicker than at European level, and would enable successful complainants to receive legal costs or damages, which Brussels cannot award. But most national authorities will still have to consult Brussels before making decisions, in case the rulings conflict with existing Commission decisions. Brussels will also help national authorities by offering advice on EC law and statistical support. The guidelines are part of wide-ranging procedural reforms put forward by Sir Leon Brittan, who will step down as competition commissioner on January 6 when he takes over responsibility for external economic relations. The Commission decided yesterday to fine the Associated Central West Africa Lines shipping conference for allegedly restricting competition in the shipping service between Europe and Zaire and Angola. The bulk of the fine, amounting to some Ecu9.6m, was levied on the quoted Belgian company, CMB, which was the principal member of the conference. CMB will have four years to pay the fine. Separately, the Commission has opened a four-month in-depth inquiry into last month's decision by Siemens of Germany and Philips of the Netherlands to bring their optical fibre and telecommunications cables activities under the control of two new joint companies. The Commission said it was worried about 'the narrow supply structure' created by the deal.</p>

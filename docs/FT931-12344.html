			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Stakis Having sold its nursing homes, Stakis is no longer in need of nursing care. That does not mean a clean bill of health, however. Almost by chance, since its first instinct was to sell its casinos, it is left with a well-balanced business in which the leisure division should provide the cash to help develop hotels. Stakis is well rid of 20 unproductive nursing home sites whose value is falling and which it cannot afford to develop. Still, the extent of the write-down associated with the healthcare sale does not inspire confidence. The hotels are unlikely to suffer quite such pain when they are reviewed at the end of the year, but some downward adjustment is inevitable. True gearing is thus somewhat higher than the new indication of 42 per cent. While interest cover remains tight and room rates depressed Stakis must still count as a convalescent.</p>

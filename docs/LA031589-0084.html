			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL FOCUSES ON ROLES OF BOMB SQUAD OFFICERS IN THEIR OWN DEATHS  </P> <P> The question of whether two Los Angeles police bomb experts caused their own  deaths has emerged as a matter of dispute in the bomb-blast murder trial of a  North Hollywood makeup artist.  </P> <P> The defendant, Donald Lee Morse, is charged with two counts of murder and two  counts of possessing explosives in the officers' deaths, which occurred when  they tried to dismantle a bomb found in Morse's garage.  </P> <P> Killed in the powerful explosion on Feb. 8, 1986, were Detective Arleigh  McCree, 46, commander of the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad, and  Officer Ronald Ball, 43.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Get Life Sentence  </P> <P> If convicted in the San Fernando Superior Court case, which began Monday,  Morse, 39, a film and television makeup specialist, could be sentenced to life  in prison without possibility of parole.  </P> <P> Without the jury present, Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling E. Norris asked Judge  John H. Major to prevent Morse's attorney from suggesting during examination of  witnesses that negligence on the part of the officers contributed to their  deaths.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Bernard J. Rosen insisted that he was "not saying there was  anything negligent that caused the deaths" but added that he planned to  introduce evidence that "other means could have been used" to handle the bomb.  </P> <P> He noted that some experts transport bombs elsewhere, then explode them, and  that others wear protective clothing when working on bombs. Earlier testimony  had indicated that McCree and Ball did not wear special clothing.  </P> <P> Norris contended that although Rosen was not using the word negligence he was  saying the same thing in different words.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Repeats Earlier Ruling  </P> <P> Judge Major reiterated a 1988 ruling that negligence was not a defense, but  said he would rule on evidence as it is presented.  </P> <P> Norris contends that the prosecution need not show that Morse intended to kill  the officers, only that he possessed an illegal deadly weapon that had no use  other than to kill.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police went to Morse's home to search for a pistol that had been  used four days earlier in the shooting of an official of the Makeup Artists and  Hairstylists Union Local 706, of which Morse was a member.  </P> <P> The gun was not found, and Morse was not charged in the shooting.  </P> <P> While searching the house, officers found two pipe bombs and summoned McCree  and Ball. The two dismantled one bomb but were killed while trying to take  apart the second.  </P> <P> Police on Monday testified that Morse denied any knowledge of the bombs when  they were discovered, and said that he had allowed friends to store things in  his garage.  </P> <P> Despite the denials, police witnesses said that inside Morse's house they found  shotgun shells, fishing line, rubber straps and gunpowder, all identical to  contents of the bombs.  </P> <P> In opening arguments, Norris told jurors that he will introduce evidence  showing that 10 days before the blast Morse had threatened his estranged  brother-in-law, saying that he "was going to blow him up in his car."  </P> <P> Rosen pleaded with jurors to "wait patiently" until they hear the defense case  before reaching any conclusions.  </P> <P> Morse has been in County Jail without bail since the officers were killed.  </P></p>

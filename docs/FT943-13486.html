			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers backs Canadian diamond rush De Beers of South Africa yesterday put 'a stamp of approval' on the diamond rush in Canada's Northwest Territories. It agreed to take shareholdings worth a total of CDollars 4m (Pounds 1.86m) in two junior exploration companies and to arrange for up to CDollars 500m of finance for a mine on the Yamba Lake prospect in the Lac de Gras area, centre of the diamond rush, if it proved viable. 'Clearly this is going to be one of the premier diamond-producing areas of the world before the end of the century,' said Mr Nick Fuller, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing. Mr Charles MacDonald, president of Tanqueray Resources, which owns 50 per cent of the Yamba Lake project, said De Beers made the first approach and he believed that it wanted to move ahead as fast as possible. 'We are aligning ourselves with the best group in the (diamond) industry,' he said. CLL's Mr Fuller suggested that, although two other major companies, Broken Hill Proprietary of Australia and the RTZ Corporation of the UK, had about a one-year start, 'De Beers wants to show them that it remains king of the diamond business'. The two Canadian companies - Tanqueray and Mill City Gold  -had extracted good terms and a tight timetable from the South African group. De Beers has 45 days to re-check in South Africa results from exploration at Yamba Lake. If all is well it will subscribe for CDollars 2m of shares in Tanqueray at CDollars 4.40 each and CDollars 2m of shares in Mill City at CDollars 2.20 each. De Beers must evaluate the five 'pipes' so far discovered by September, 1996, complete a feasibility study by the end of 1997, and, if it decides to bring a mine into production, will procure up to CDollars 500m of financing to earn a 51 per cent interest in the project area.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jure Radic, Croatian Democratic Community </F> secretary general, by Ante Gugo; place and date not given:  "There Will Not Be Early Elections"]    [Text] Jure Radic, secretary general of the Croatian  Democratic Community [HDZ], has lately been impossible to reach  for an interview. His excuse was that the time is not right for  giving interviews until the negotiations with the opposition are  over. After much insisting and persuasion, and after saying that  the representatives of the opposition make public appearances  while the other side is silent, Radic agreed to give us an  interview. As practically the second man of the state, Jure  Radic is always an interesting interviewee, but the topic of  this conversation was defined in advance by unsolved personnel  problems in the Assembly. Obviously, this time we are not  talking about mere political haggling, but about a process that  could, in the next couple of years, define important political  processes in the state, so we tried to focus our questions on  that subject and reveal present positions of the ruling party.  It is indeed strange that the HDZ, though it claims it has the  majority, still agrees to make compromises that sometimes grow  into blackmail.    [Gugo] As we speak (Tuesday evening), the media are  revealing the information about new positions in negotiations  between the HDZ and the opposition, which has reiterated the  demand to annul the session of the Chamber of Representatives.  What do you think about that?    [Radic] It is an unreasonable demand. That which is legal  and constitutional, and does not go against the Standing Orders  of the Parliament, cannot be annulled at the request of the  opposition or any other political factor. The Croatian Assembly  is a legislative institution defined by the Constitution and  activities in the Assembly cannot be dealt with as controversial  outside the Assembly. Therefore, the work of the Assembly can  only be discussed by its legal bodies. All proposals of the  opposition are based on the allegation that, for the time being,  there are no other deputies in the Assembly except those  representing the HDZ, which is not true. However, even if it  were true, the work of the Assembly would be legal and  legitimate provided that the HDZ has the majority vote. There is  no reason to question the legality of its work.    [Gugo] If that is so, i.e., if there is a quorum in the  Assembly, why do you persist in reaching an agreement with the  opposition?    [Radic] We showed that the Assembly, in which the HDZ has  the majority in both chambers, must work so as not to threaten  the functioning of any other institution in Croatia. Many  activities are dependent upon the work of the Assembly and we  were aware of that. On the other hand, we wanted to hear out  all proposals and suggestions of other political parties in  order to use everything that might contribute to the general  prosperity and interests of the Republic of Croatia. We do not  want to use the power of majority at all times and work like  that with regard to all activities of the Assembly. We have  been trying to reinstate the opposition in the Assembly, to the  benefit of the Croatian state. Nothing bad will come out of  that. However, we will not do so at all costs. If they will  not accept our good intentions, we are helpless. I am deeply  convinced that the representatives of the opposition have left  the Assembly quite unnecessarily. We are prepared to make  certain compromises, but only provided they do not bring the  essence of the functioning of Croatia into danger. That means  we will not accept that what is legal and legitimate be declared  illegal for the sake of political agreements. We understand and  accept the new situation in the Assembly, and we are prepared to  cooperate in accordance with the new circumstances, but only if  that is politically correct.   <H5>    More In Than Out </H5>   [Gugo] Why is the HDZ against Mr. Mesic and Mr. Manolic as  vice presidents of parliamentary chambers?    [Radic] The Club of the HDZ Deputies gave the freedom of  choice to every deputy to decide as he or she thinks fit. We  did not want to put pressure on anybody. I would not say that  the HDZ does not accept certain individuals, since the HDZ did  not make decisions with regard to individual members of the  opposition. Mr. Mesic and Mr. Manolic were not accepted because  the majority of parliamentary deputies, voting of their own free  will, did not want to elect them. Those people have probably  had their reasons for doing so. I think that the strongest  reason for voting against them was that they left the HDZ, and  turncoats always arouse indignation. The second reason are the  letters written by Manolic and Mesic, which are negative about  Croatia and which were sent abroad.    [Gugo] A couple of days ago, Bozo Kovacevic, secretary  general of the Croatian Social Liberal Party, was the guest star  of an OTV [Youth Television] broadcast. On that occasion, in a  discussion with Drago Krpina [HDZ deputy; currently advisor to  the president on military matters], he gave an example of Stipe  Mesic's unconstitutional behavior when he was the president of  the Assembly. Today, the opposition in which the Liberals are  the strongest party, insist on having Stipe Mesic. Could you  comment on that?    [Radic] I have not seen that program, so I do not know any  details. I am convinced that there were no unconstitutional  procedures in the Assembly, for the proper authorities would  react to that. Personally, I am glad the opposition considers  those two gentlemen their best representatives, for the Croatian  public will be able to see their true colors.    [Gugo] Mladen Vedris has also recently left the party.  Since his function is important for the economy of Croatia,  this could be considered a serious blow to the party in which  you are secretary general. Will that influence the stability of  the HDZ?    [Radic] I was not surprised to see him leave. We were not  weakened by the departure of some ten party members. Today, the  Secretariat sent me new data which say that, in the past couple  of months, 49 members left the party, but 796 new members joined  the party in the same period. I have exact information about  every county and I was particularly pleased to read this  analysis. No member of ours is irreplaceable. We all have our  reasons and those reasons should be dignified, so that we can  realize our political plight, our confrontation of ideas, in a  democratic and civilized manner.    [Gugo] What will happen if the opposition maintains its  demand to trade Manolic and Mesic for the annulment of the  session of the Chamber of Representatives? Will the HDZ manage  to keep the Assembly functioning or will there be early  elections?    [Radic] During those negotiations, an opposition leader  asked us whether we negotiated because we wanted to develop  democracy or whether we acted from the position of being a  parliamentary majority. I said we negotiated from the position  of a party that wanted to develop democracy in Croatia and we  would do everything within limits to achieve that. At the same  time, we are aware that we have the majority in the Assembly.  We will try to reach an agreement with the opposition. Our  concessions will not go below certain minimums which enable the  functioning of the Assembly at present and in the future.    [Gugo] So you are not considering early elections in the  HDZ?    [Radic] There is no reason for that, although I am convinced  that would be beneficial for the HDZ.    [Gugo] Everything that happened in the Assembly boils down  to fighting for power. Some analysts are trying to make it look  like the defeat of the left in the HDZ, i.e., of the state  leadership, and the same sources report that extreme rightists,  who hinder the functioning of the institutions of the political  system, are coming to power. Is there any truth in that?    [Radic] It is true that this is fighting for power.  However, it is not true that this is the victory of the right  wing of the party, i.e., that the HDZ lost its democratic  quality. The latest events contributed to exactly the opposite.  I am aware that we are losing the extreme left wing of the  party, but that is good. At the Second General Assembly of the  HDZ, we determined we wanted to be a firm party of the center  with a very broad program. All those who cannot fit into that  program will drop out. Our presidency and secretariat general  implement this program. This does not mean that there are no  extremes in our midst, but the problem lies in the fact that  those people do not exert much influence on the work of the  party. They act individually, and everyone has the right to do  that. The most important thing is that no one can accuse of  being extreme left or extreme right in our program or  activities. Those events have taught us procedure and  democratic process. On several occasions we confirmed our  democratic orientation, and the presidential candidate for the  Assembly was chosen by a secret ballot. We are aiming toward  building a firmly central democratic orientation.   <H5>    No Conflicts With the Church </H5>   [Gugo] Rumor has it that relations between Church and state  have been strained. Is there any truth in that?    [Radic] No. If each of those two institutions acts within  its competence, there will be no conflict. It is important that  the Church and the state do not interfere in each others'  activity. I have personally witnessed good relations between  the Church and the state and I know there are no conflicts,  although there still is an occasional lack of understanding.  However, that is mostly part of tradition, which can be  transcended if there is a will. The Church and the state are  working together for the benefit of the Croats.    [Gugo] As we speak, Russian envoy Churkin is negotiating  with Martic and Mikelic in Belgrade. Does that mean we are  facing a new round of talks with the authorities in the  temporarily occupied territory?    [Radic] That gentleman will be here any minute now, and it  is a pity that we cannot talk in a couple of hours. Our view is  crystal clear: We do not want and will not delay solving the  problem of our occupied areas. I say with full responsibility  that this is the last mandate of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces]! Our refugees can no longer bear the solution of their  problems being postponed and we must remember that. The state  leadership, considering the international circumstances, has no  right to postpone the solution to those problems. An intensive  diplomatic action is under way and we must explain to important  international factors that this is the time to take concrete  steps to solve the Croatian problem. Furthermore, we are  prepared -- if the international community does not make any  progress -- to start solving the problem with all the means at  the disposal of a rule-of-law state. Those who died for our  freedom oblige us to bring freedom into every Croatian home.  That is our principal task in the following period.</p>

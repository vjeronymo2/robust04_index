			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Tengelmann and Delhaize lead western retailers into Hungary TENGELMANN, the German department store group, and other investors yesterday received the go-ahead to acquire 147 retail outlets in Budapest. The Hungarian government accepted offers of Ft4bn (Dollars 52m) with additional investment commitments of up to Ft1bn, representing the biggest single Hungarian retail privatisation to date. Tengelmann emerged as the main winner in the auction, taking 24 of the larger shops in return for a total investment of about Ft1.5bn. Louis Delhaize Group, the Belgian retailing company, won 10 outlets. Tengelmann and Delhaize already own Hungarian retailing operations and the latest acquisitions will remove a major constraint on their planned expansion. The German group, with its strong emphasis on expansion of department and discount stores in eastern Europe, is the major shareholder in Skala Co-op, the Hungarian department store chain. Delhaize Profi-Duna discount retailing and Duna Fuszert wholesaling businesses helped Hungary contribute 6.4 per cent of group sales in 1991. Discount retailing has proved attractive in Hungary, as declining real incomes have led consumers to economise. Yesterday's transaction is unusual in that the State Property Agency, the privatisation authority, offered the 147 outlets for sale singly although they were grouped until now in 10 state-owned 'Kozert' groups. Generally, the SPA has found it less time-consuming to sell state companies intact even if the proceeds are lower. Another 183 Kozert stores remain to be sold; these, however, are generally smaller and will attract less international interest.</p>

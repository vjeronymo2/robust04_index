			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anna Ostapchuk: "Reintegration as a Higher Stage </F> of Dissolution; Seminar at the Gorbachev Foundation"]    [Text]  <H5>  Expert Opinion </H5>   The Gorbachev Foundation conducted a seminar devoted to an  analysis of the prospects and forms of reintegration processes  in the post-Soviet space. Political scientists from Ukraine,  Russia, and Belarus laid out their vision of reintegration as a  global problem for the countries of the former USSR. Mikhail  Gorbachev himself led the seminar. Aleksandr Tsipko, Igor  Klyamkin, Mikhail Malyutin, Dmitriy Olshanskiy, and others took  part in the discussion.    The concept "reintegration," as the next political craze,  needs interpretation. What is this--a new mythologem that is  being inculcated in the mass conscience by the very same groups  that were inculcating the idea of sovereignization three to five  years ago?. Their aim, moreover, remains what it was  before--holding or seizing power. Or is this a real possibility  of revival? And, if revival, then of what kind of a state or  what kind of a community? And are the costs bearable? Or,  perhaps, integration is one and the other, simply at different  levels? The seminar was quicker to raise questions than to  answer them.    Why did the republics--the inheritors of the Soviet  Union--not move ahead very far in the sphere of economic  reforms? But then "attribution" eclipses all other aspects of  their state construction. The initial cause of such a state of  affairs, analysts believe, is that independence to many of the  republican leaders was by no means happy or desirable news about  liberation, but rather a notice that is delivered to an  addressee regardless of his own wishes. And they were compelled  to "simulate" state construction. That is, sovereignization is  first and foremost a product and the next stage of  disintegration of the Union. And not the opposite, as we got  accustomed to thinking. Mikhail Malyutin expressed this  figuratively: "A knock on the door. Who is there? It is I,  independence. Summary: We are not to blame, it came by itself."    Thus, it (independence) found them (the republics)  unprepared. In a certain sense, some of them were ready  "morally," but no one was prepared "physically." Three years  have not added much orderliness and reasons for their existence.  Judging by the accounts of Ukrainian and Belarusian political  scientists, life in the sovereign states is "apocalypse today."  Thus, the population of Ukraine is convinced that its  politico-economic situation is determined first and foremost by  the mafia, and only after this by the president and Council of  Ministers. But one-third of the population of Belarus thinks  that their state is not independent, and another third leans  toward such an opinion. And Russia is no exception in the parade  of "broken off sovereign pieces," but simply the largest body  with its own specific character. If the new states have been  suffering up until now "with a childhood illness of statehood,"  then Russia, in the opinion of political scientists, has once  again gotten sick with "imperialist tendencies" as a specific  Russian form of capitulation to the difficulties of state  construction. However, does this mean that the results of the  three-year experiment was only a realization of the  impossibility of forming "sovereign" national  self-identifications--be it Russian, Ukrainian, or Belarusian?    All agreed on one thing: Reintegration is not only  necessary,  but it is also inevitable. But whether it should be started  immediately, while institutions have still been retained that  facilitate joining, or in two or three years, when all of the  centripetal tendencies reach their very logical end--this served  as a subject for discussion.    The scheme for integration was considered. Some of the  seminar participants expressed points of view that were not  trivial, that succeeding unions in the post-Soviet space will be  concluded not on principles that are traditional (within the  spirit and framework of the USSR), and even not according to  principles that are exotic (Pan-Slavic, Romantic, Pan-Turkic).  But, for example, on the international principles of a  "technological chain." As Dmitriy Olshanskiy noted, if the  Dniester Region has sales markets and other economic interests  in the "Siberian Agreement," this can be enough of a reason for  the conclusion of an economic union. However, statehood under  conditions of such geopolitical promiscuity will inevitably  begin to melt and will lead to the appearance of a number of  "vague" state formations. However, this is only one of the  possibilities of the self-development of the post-Soviet space.  There is no end to configurations of separate elements that  mutually attract and mutually repel each other.    The necessary element of reintegration is its components.  All  of the speakers noted that the left-wingers and the big power  supporters in the former Slavic republics of the USSR are  calling the loudest for a necessary speedy reunification--each  on the strength of his own ideology. However, the real executor,  as always, will be the "party in power." A very skeptical  interpretation is possible: There was a time when the  newly-fledged bankers created their own first capital on the  breakup of the USSR, and now those are longing for power who  intend to make capital on reintegration. It may be that these  are one and the same people. A pessimistic interpretation is  possible: The new rulers aptly wrote off their shortcomings to  the difficulties of economic reforms, and now a wonderful  opportunity has appeared to justify their mistakes, because of  the burdens of reintegration.    The list of interpretations is open. The myth about the  reunification of the peoples is taking on eschatological  features.</p>

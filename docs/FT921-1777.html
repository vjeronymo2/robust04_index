			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Ready for a dog fight Mr Neil Kinnock must be quaking. After much thought and many strategic meetings the Conservatives have devised a cunning plan to foil his evil designs and stop him from becoming prime minister. They have unleashed the Dogs of Yore. Yesterday we had the toothy snarls of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, a pensioner. In November 1990 her presence was regarded as so damaging to the Tory cause that she had to be put down. She was wonderful in 1979, but is she right for 1992? We also witnessed another lap in the long-distance run of a sleek if aging greyhound, Mr Michael Heseltine. He is still well able to stand on his hind legs, pose as Pointer indicating the Labour quarry, chase the Red Fox, yowl and growl, and perform wondrous tricks. These may not frighten the enemy, but they are painful reminders to Conservatives that if he had become Top Dog Mr Kinnock would have been barked off the premises long ago. Mr Douglas Hurd is also to be let fly to protect the wallets of us highly paid folk from Mr Kinnock and his gang of pickpockets. Oh my wallet] Oh my chequebook] Oh my luxury holiday for two in the villa of my choice] Doomed, doomed, doomed. Mr Hurd has pedigree, breeding, and good Foreign Office training. He is a classy canine. But a Dog of War? The nearest young-ish hound to approach such a definition is Mr Kenneth Clark, a jowly bulldog. He can be tenacious. Yet for some reason that I cannot quite understand he frightens floating voters. That's enough dogs. The truth is that the great Conservative cry that went up towards the end of last week was a yelp of despair. The call was for a tougher brand of rhetoric. To achieve this the party's more forceful speakers were to be asked to speak forcefully. The underlying, hardly spoken, meaning was that Tories were losing confidence in the effectiveness of Mr John Major. I am not so sure. His quiet, patient decency - or his new 'tough' manner - may yet come through, if slowly. The question is, will it make any difference? If Mr Major loses this election it will be because of wrong strategic choices he made in November 1990, when he decided not to risk an immediate contest, and again on several occasions last year, when he missed further auspicious dates. He let his good chances go because, as a man made by the Treasury, he placed his faith in the Treasury and its forecast of better times this spring. If he is now broken, it will be by the Treasury's hand. This is not to say that the prime minister is a strong campaigner. He suffered piteously under the vicious onslaught of Mr Brian Walden on London Weekend Television yesterday. Mr Walden hit him where it hurts most - in his carefully cultivated, and sincerely based, 'caring' image. The interview put Mr Major on the defensive, and kept him there. He defended himself, with good words but poor body-language, against the charge that voters 'don't trust you on the . . . National Health Service . . . '. He recoiled from the assertion that people want all the fruits of growth to go to public services, and none of it to tax cuts. He was obliged to review the unfortunate remark of Mr Norman Lamont that rising unemployment and the recession were a 'price well worth paying' to get inflation down. Mr Walden's techniques are well-known. Mr Major should have been coached in counter-offensive tactics; he might have got in some positive statements about his own party and some negative ones about the opposition. He was too polite. The Walden steamroller flattened him. It was unfair, but if you want to lead a great party to victory you must know how to overcome unfairness. The opposition's superstar, Mr John Smith, is a master of this art. Interviewed more softly by Mr Jonathan Dimbleby on the BBC than was Mr Major by Mr Walden, the shadow chancellor easily maintained his dazzling performance of the previous week. The principal charge against him - that Labour was not as serious as are the Tories about bringing down inflation - was answered in words that fall to pieces when the cold text is deconstructed, but that stood up well as part of his powerful television image. He easily brushed aside a silly intimation by Mr Roy Hattersley - not one of Labour's assets - that the top rate of income tax might be raised even further than Mr Smith's 50 per cent. He was grateful to Roy for trying to give him a little flexibility, but 50 per cent it was, said Mr Smith. Then the St Bernard of the Labour party continued his rounds.</p>

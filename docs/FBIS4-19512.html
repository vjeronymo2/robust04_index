			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ole Mathismoen: "New Report From Bellona: </F> Russian Plans for Nuclear Dumping"]    [Text] Russia is considering whether to dump old submarine  reactors in the ocean in order to solve the waste crisis that  the START II agreement will cause.    This sensational allegation appears in a new Bellona report  published yesterday concerning the nuclear situation in  northwest Russia. The environmental foundation has had access to  hitherto unknown documents showing how and where Russia intends  to dismantle 150 nuclear submarines.    The documents show that all future decommissioning of  nuclear  submarines, including vessels from the Pacific fleet, will take  place in the shipyard city of Severodvinsk on the White Sea,  southeast of the Kola peninsula. According to the START II  agreement, Russia will decommission 150 nuclear submarines  carrying 278 reactors in the next few years.    So far only two nuclear submarines, with four reactors, have  been completely dismantled. The fuel rods have been removed from  another 34 vessels, of which 16 come from the Northern fleet.  According to the Bellona report, nuclear submarines with a total  of 206 nuclear reactors and 45,000 used fuel rods will be  dismantled at Severodvinsk.    In the Bellona report, which is the first comprehensive  report concerning the nuclear situation in the region, a  detailed overview will be published for the first time  describing how the two enormous submarine yards in Severodvinsk  will be upgraded in order to handle the huge dismantling job.  The plan includes, among other things, the building of new dry  docks, a new installation intended for the removal of fuel rods,  improvements of the railroad from Severodvinsk to the nuclear  city of Mayak in Siberia, and the construction of docking  facilities for the storage of nuclear submarines.    "The upgrading of Severodvinsk was to have been carried out  between 1993 and 1998 in order to receive the many submarines  that will be decommissioned. However, several of the projects  that should have been started last year are still in the  planning stage. The uncertainty as to the responsibility and the  financing might result in the postponement of the dismantling  and destruction of the submarines. In the meantime the  submarines are being stored in bays and fjords along the Kola  peninsula, among other places," says the two authors of the  report, Thomas Nilsen and Nils Bohmer.  <H5>  Full Storage Facilities </H5>   The definite plans for the improvement of the Severodvinsk  docks that Bellona has had access to include only pure dock  functions per se and a small increase in the capacity for the  interim storage of nuclear waste. As all storage facilities for  nuclear waste in the Kola region were filled to capacity a long  time ago, new solutions must be found. The used fuel that is  most radioactive will be carried to the nuclear city of Mayak  according to the plan. But there is no place to send the  reactors, the reactor sections and other solid radioactive waste.    "From the documentation we have received and from the talks  we have had with different people, it has become clear that  Russian authorities are considering two alternatives. One is to  dump the waste in the Kara Sea as was done up through 1991. The  other possibility is to build a new regional storage facility  for solid waste," Nilsen and Bohmer say.    The two men express a great deal of worry over the nuclear  situation up north:    "In addition to the 150 nuclear submarines that will be  destroyed in accordance with the START II agreement, it is  assumed that 80 Russian nuclear submarines will be taken out of  operation because of their age over the next 30 to 40 years. As  all storage facilities are full and there is no money to build  an expensive new long-term storage facility, we fear that  dumping will again become the only alternative. Maybe that is  why Russia has refrained from signing the final London  convention against such ocean dumping," Nilsen says.    It can be clearly seen from the Bellona report that the  nuclear waste crisis in northwest Russia in no way has improved  during the last year.    However, Bohmer and Nilsen say that what they fear most is  the social [repercussions of the] nuclear crisis.    "Workers in the shipyard city of Severodvinsk, at the  nuclear  power plant, at Atomflot, and at the military Northern fleet are  paid only rarely. It is not uncommon for them to go three to  four months without being paid. The result is that they are  careless with security. I fear that human error might lead to an  accident long before the technical equipment actually fails,"  Bellona's nuclear physicist Bohmer says. Discarded nuclear  submarines with intact reactors that are stored in the various  fjords around the Kola peninsula need just as careful  maintenance as nuclear submarines that are in operation.  <H5>  [Box, p 3] </H5> <H5>  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Thanks Bellona </H5>   "Bellona has access to channels of communication and  information that we do not have. That is why they compliment our  work," Thorbjorn Norendal, the assistant director of the  Department of Foreign Affairs, says. He is heading the  preparation of a white paper on nuclear safety in northwest  Russia. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has given financial  support to Bellona's work in Russia.    "Bellona's new report is a factual and straightforward  account of the problems," Norendal says.    He thinks that Russia probably will not resume ocean  dumping.  "However, the fact that this is under consideration shows how  urgent the problem is. It is news to us that all dismantling of  old nuclear submarines will take place in Severodvinsk. I fear  that this will mean an accumulation of nuclear waste in the  north. Unlike the United States, the Russians have made no plans  for where to store all the old reactor sections. The thought  that they will be floating in the water at the docks in the  fjords around Kola is a frightening one," Norendal says.    He states that Norway's resources will not reach far in  helping Russia. "However, we are prepared to participate in  creating an international movement in order to help them with  their disarmament, which will be just as expensive as the  [original] armament was."</p>

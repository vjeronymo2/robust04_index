			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES  </P> <P>  Average and median prices of existing San Diego area houses continued to level  off in November, a sign that the overheated local housing market of earlier  this year is cooling off.  </P> <P> According to a survey of its members by the San Diego Board of Realtors, the  average November price of a resold home in the San Diego metropolitan area was  $209,467, a 9% increase from the $191,649 average price in November, 1988.  Since April, however, when the record average price of $217,802 was set, the  average price has essentially remained flat.  </P> <P> The November median price, or price at which half of all existing homes sold  for a higher price and half for less, was $178,500. Since April, median resale  prices have fluctuated between $175,000 and $180,000. The San Diego board  includes member brokers in San Diego, La Mesa, Chula Vista and El Cajon.  </P> <P> The current interest rate on fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages is about 9.75%, said  Rick McGill, residential lending manager at Great American Bank, down about a  quarter percentage point from October. The drop has not sparked a discernible  increase in loan demand however, he said.  </P></p>

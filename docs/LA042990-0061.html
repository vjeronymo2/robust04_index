			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT: TAKE A DOUBLE-DECK BUS THROUGH SOVIET UNION  </P> <P> One of the more interesting ways that students and other young travelers can  visit the now popular Soviet Union is aboard a double-decker bus.  </P> <P> Top Deck, a 17-year-old British company and operator of double-decker bus  tours, is such a company. Its fleet of 50 former London Transport buses is now  a familiar sight on the Asian overland routes. This summer it is also offering  a 29-day "Deckerhome" program starting in London and visiting Holland, Germany,  Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, the Soviet Union and Poland.  </P> <P> Rates $1,048 to $1,138, plus $214 for a communal food fund and $61 for  compulsory visa charges.  </P> <P> Each Deckerhome sleeps 15 to 20 passengers, with bunks and lockers on the upper  level and living and dining areas and fold-down bunks on the lower level.  </P> <P> One of the advantages of traveling with Top Deck is that its programs are  marketed internationally, so American youths get the opportunity to make  friends among people from foreign nations.  </P> <P> In addition to its Deckerhome tours, Top Deck operates coach tour programs,  using camping sites, cabins and hotels in Europe, Southeast Asia and Africa.  </P> <P> Pitching a tent can help stretch funds. Join a 33-day coach-camping program  that travels from London to Holland, Germany, Poland, the Soviet Union,  Romania, Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, returning to London. Price  is $1,269, plus $231 for the food fund and $72 for visas.  </P> <P> If you want a few more comforts there is a 45-day program that incorporates  camping, cabins and hotel accommodations, and travel by coach.  </P> <P> It starts in London and visits Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark,  Sweden, Norway, Finland, Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany and  returns to London. Rates $1,276 to $1,444, plus $324 for the communal food fund  and $61 for visas.  </P> <P> Further details on Top Deck programs are available through travel agents, or  Campus Holidays USA Inc., 242 Bellevue Ave., Upper Montclair, N.J. 07043.  Telephone toll-free (800) 345-2775.  </P> <P> The Scandinavian Student Travel Service has made arrangements with North  American student travel agencies to market its summer tours into the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> The SSTS programs are specifically geared to travelers who are under 35 and  "crave adventure more than luxury and comfort."  </P> <P> An SSTS guide accompanies the international group, and daily programs,  including visits with Soviet students, are arranged by the Soviet Youth Travel  Bureau, Sputnik.  </P> <P> Programs seven to 14 days are priced with and without round-trip air  transportation between Copenhagen and the Soviet Union. Accommodations are in  two- or three-bed rooms, while on trains four-berth compartments are shared.  </P> <P> One of the least expensive SSTS programs is a seven-day tour of Moscow and  Leningrad for $405, or $695 with flights from Copenhagen.  </P> <P> You do not have to be a student to go on SSTS tours. SSTS also offers programs  for traveling the Trans-Siberian railway and for visiting China.  </P> <P> More details on all SSTS programs are available from STA Travel, 7202 Melrose  Ave., Los Angeles 90046, (213) 934-8722.  </P></p>

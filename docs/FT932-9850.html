			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour leader ready to press on electoral reform MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour party leader, is preparing to tell his party that it should back the principle of changing Britain's electoral system - provided reform is supported in a national referendum. He is working on a plan intended to rally the camps opposed to and supporting electoral reform, while leaving Labour, after its autumn conference, with a clear statement on how it would act in government. Deep internal divisions over electoral reform will be highlighted today when Labour MPs debate the report of the party's electoral reform commission under Professor Raymond Plant of Southampton University. Mr Smith will set out his thinking at next Wednesday's meeting of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee. The party leader is also ready for a confrontation with trade union bosses. In spite of opposition from many trade unions, Mr Smith wants this year's conference to end their role in the selection of Labour parliamentary candidates - although he may agree to defer a debate on the mechanics of how the party leader is elected. Mr Smith has told colleagues privately that he might consider breaking links competely with the trade unions if a compromise cannot be reached. Such threats are likely to be regarded as posturing but Mr Smith sees some merit in the argument that a clash with unions could help improve Labour's image. Proposals that Labour should embrace electoral reform have already angered the substantial section of the Labour party - including Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy Labour leader - that wants no change from the current first-past-the-post-system for electing MPs. The Plant commission recommended a French-style 'supplementary vote' system, regarded as a compromise by supporters of proportional representation. Mr Smith is cautious about reform but is understood have to have accepted the case for change - although the extent to which he will back the Plant report's conclusions is unclear. He is expected to reject calling for a Royal Commission to consider electoral reform that would have delayed any decisions. Instead, Mr Smith will aim to appease supporters of first-past-the-post by stressing that no change would be made until after at least one referendum. Mr Smith is seriously considering a scheme proposed by Charter 88, the constitutional reform movement, to the Plant Commission and based on a New Zealand model.</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recovers half of its early losses Wall Street US stocks retrenched yesterday after troubling economic data triggered a sharp sell-off in bonds, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 20.53 lower at 3,933.35, having recovered about half of a 41-point downturn at mid-morning. Though the index's decline was not particularly deep, the NYSE's downturn was broad in scope. Declining issues on the Big Board swamped advances by a two-to-one margin, pushing the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 down 3.62 to 471.19. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite managed to add 0.12 to 459.86, while the Nasdaq composite was off a scant 0.75 at 777.91. The fresh turbulence surfaced on a most inconvenient day, with futures contracts and options on individual stocks and indices set to expire. During such 'triple witching' sessions, the reinvestment activity typically generates crushing volume and volatile trading conditions. Yesterday was no exception, with 390m shares exchanged on the NYSE, compared with 280m the previous session. The opening brought a striking shift in sentiment from the previous day, when the Dow surged by 58 points. The catalyst was the Commerce Department's announcement that capacity utilisation, a keenly watched barometer of producer prices, had climbed to its highest level since 1989. The news, which contradicted Thursday's evidence of moderating economic conditions, set off a stampede of sellers in the inflation-sensitive Treasury market. By late afternoon, the yield on the benchmark 30-year government security was up to 7.70 per cent, a fresh high on the year. But the reaction among equity investors was more measured even during the bleak early hours. The Dow industrials finished at mixed levels, as program-guided trades buffeted share prices in both directions. Among the winners, IBM advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 71 and Alcoa climbed Dollars 1 1/8 . Offsetting the gains, Caterpillar dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 56 3/8 , General Tire Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 33 7/8 and American Express Dollars 1 to Dollars 30 5/8 . The oil sector took a beating, with Atlantic Richfield the hardest hit of the lot. The stock sunk Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 103 3/4 , while Mobil dropped Dollars 1 1/2 and Chevron, a Dow component, lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 42 1/4 . Elsewhere, ITT added Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 82 after confirming earlier reports that it planned to sell some financial services operations as part as a strategic shift. On the Nasdaq, Microsoft appreciated Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 56 7/8 , while Applied Materials added Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 51. Canada Toronto stocks edged higher despite renewed fears of inflation in the US. The TSE-300 composite index was up 18.39 points, or 0.42 per cent, to 4,403.85, with gaining issues outnumbering losing issues 389 to 329. Volume of 70.91m and value of CDollars 1.1bn were up from Thursday's 65.84m and CDollars 923.2m. The TSE opened lower but regained ground throughout the afternoon on the strength of gold, metal and utilities stocks. Brazil Sao Paulo shares closed up 0.1 per cent as concerns about the financial health of some state and small banks, combined with nervousness ahead of the presidential elections, trimmed most of the day's gains. The Bovespa index of the 55 most-active shares ended up 62 at 52,937 points. Turnover was high at RDollars 482m. Analysts fear more small banks could be facing liquidity difficulties following liquidation of Brasbanco bank and its underwriting house.</p>

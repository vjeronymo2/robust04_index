			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with retired Colonel Geraldo Cavagnari, director </F> of strategic studies at the University of Campinhas, who was  chosen by the Workers Party, PT, to outline the party's military  policy for presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva by  Emanuel Neri; place and date not given]    [Text] [Neri] If da Silva is elected, does the PT intend to  enlarge investments in the military area from 0.5 percent to 2  percent of the GDP?    [Cavagnari] The current investment in the military area is  0.5 percent of the GDP, and it is believed that this is not  enough to maintain a military force with satisfactory  operational capabilities. Now that the Armed Forces'  reorganization and the updating of its equipment with new  technology have been proposed, that percentage should be  increased to 2 percent of the GDP if possible. It is made clear,  however, that this gradual increase over five years must not  obstruct social priorities.    [Neri] Does the PT hopes to restart all the military  programs?    [Cavagnari] Of the programs that must be continued, only the  nuclear and the Calha Norte programs are considered  controversial. The first one is controversial by its own nature;  it is the nuclear submarine. The Calha Norte program because it  enlarges the military presence in an area sensitive to  environmentalists. [sentence as published] But the two programs  are necessary for Brazil. I also will propose the continuation  of the space, AMX (aircraft), and Antarctic programs.    [Neri] Why are the nuclear and Calha Norte programs  important?    [Cavagnari] In addition to developing scientific and  technological training, the nuclear program will give the  country the possibility of getting the means (nuclear submarine)  for a more effective defense of the maritime border. The Calha  Norte program will help reinforce the defense of the northern  border region. Currently, both the border region north of  Solimoes-Amazonas and the maritime border are the two most  sensitive areas of the national territory, and are poorly  defended.    [Neri] Does the PT hope to create a defense ministry?    [Cavagnari] Brazil is the only country in the world that  does  not have a defense ministry. Its creation aims to guarantee  unity for carrying out the defense policy by putting aside the  confrontation of the specific interests of each force -- Army,  Navy, and Air Force. It is clear that this initiative also will  contribute to consolidating the Armed Forces' subordination to  the civilian power. There is no doubt that this will contribute  to the rational use of the budget based on a single defense  policy.    [Neri] How are the Armed Forces behaving in the current  political crisis in the country?    [Cavagnari] They have had exemplary behavior. They made an  explicit declaration that they will make the greatest effort not  to run away from democracy.    [Neri] With the end of the national security doctrine and  the  cold war, does the Armed Forces have enemies now?    [Cavagnari] Brazil is a country that has threats, no  question  about it. But the threats are to the environment, to  biodiversity. There is no doubt that the obstructions to Brazil  having access to advanced technology are threats to national  interests. But they are threats that do not justify the use of  force. What happens is that those that threaten have a military  capability so disproportional in relation to us that we cannot  consider it a threat that must be eliminated by force.    [Neri] Do you believe a better use of the Armed Forces could  be made to prevent them from being inactive?    [Cavagnari] The Armed Forces must be used for what they were  created for -- that is, national defense. They must be prepared  and trained for that. This does not prevent them, however, from  cooperating under certain circumstances in other nonmilitary  activities. They can be used at certain times, under certain  critical situations, even in public security. They can be used  in the construction of roads and dams but not as part of their  main activities but as a complement, as simple civil cooperation.    [Neri] What is the current profile of Brazilian officers?    [Cavagnari] In technical terms our officers are well  prepared. Unfortunately, we are experiencing difficulties and  even the development of that training is jeopardized. In terms  of political thoughts, I would say that Brazilian officers are  evolving, maturing. They are losing some authoritarian way of  thinking in Brazil and they already are admitting that Brazil  must be thought of within the framework of democracy.    [Neri] Do you think the officers are currently more  democratic?    [Cavagnari] I would say there are increasingly more officers  who accept democracy. Those who do not accept democracy, those  who are authoritarian by nature, are becoming a minority among  the military.    [Neri] Some Armed Forces members oppose the demarcation of  Indian reserves. What do you think of this?    [Cavagnari] They react because of the size of the land  granted to the Indians. They react because they cannot accept  that Indian lands do not allow a military presence in them. They  cannot accept that national sovereignty cannot be exercised on  these lands. They are right, especially regarding border areas.    [Neri] What do you think must be modified in the  Constitution  regarding the Armed Forces?    [Cavagnari] We must eliminate the words "law and order." The  Armed Forces should only defend the fatherland and the  government powers. In the case of national defense, the objects  of defense are the national territory and interests. Within the  constitutional order the objects of defense are the political  institutions of a democratic state of law. The reference to  order (foreseen in the current Constitution) allows the  government to use the Armed Forces against any law-threatening  movement, sometimes, unjustifiably.    [Neri] Is there less Armed Forces resistance to an eventual  triumph by da Silva? Is there any risk of insubordination?    [Cavagnari] There is no risk of insubordination in case of  his triumph. Da Silva's acceptance rate is increasing while the  rate of rejection is decreasing. He has an acceptance rate  higher than in 1989.    [Neri] Why have you joined the PT?    [Cavagnari] I have been cooperating with the PT since 1987.  In 1989, when da Silva ran in a second round of voting, I was  invited, together with other people, to prepare a draft of the  PT's policy for the military. I maintained that contact. I have  not officially joined any party, but among all the Brazilian  political parties, I prefer the PT. I agree with many of its  policies and disagree with a few others.    [Neri] What are the issues you disagree with?    [Cavagnari] I do not favor nationalizations as much as other  PT groups. I do not defend government monopoly as much as other  PT groups do. As for foreign capital, I am a bit more liberal  than other PT groups.  <H5>  Curriculum Vitae </H5>   Complete name: Geraldo Lesbat Cavagnari Filho    Born: 21 August 1934 in Paranagua, Parana.

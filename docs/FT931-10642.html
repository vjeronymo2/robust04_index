			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Daf demerger plans win support of Dutch ministry DUTCH economic affairs minister Mr Koos Andriessen has expressed his support for plans to unbundle Daf, Europe's sixth-largest truck manufacturer, salvaging the core operations in the Netherlands and transferring UK plants to a separate new unit. Speaking on Dutch television on Saturday Mr Andriessen said he regarded Daf's core operation as a viable long-term business. A broad demerger plan, details of which were being finalised by the company's receivers over the weekend, is 'likely to be implemented', he added. Under the plan, the Dutch government could emerge as a dominant shareholder in the newly-formed Dutch operation after an injection of several hundred million guilders in new liquidity. Dutch banks, including ABN Amro, would also join in the finance operation, with the present Daf group being declared bankrupt perhaps as early as this week. Mr John Talbot, the receiver of Leyland-Daf, the truck and van operations which employ 5,500 in the UK, returned to London after reviewing the future for the UK operations with administrators at Daf's headquarters in Eindhoven. So far, there are understood to be no substantive talks in progress between the UK receiver and rival truckmakers with a possible interest in all or part of the UK operations. Those with a possible but undeclared interest include Daimler-Benz and MAN of Germany, Paccar of the US - which already owns Foden in Britain  - and Hino, the Japanese truckmaker. Daf announced the financial collapse last Tuesday and sought protection from its creditors in the Netherlands, Belgium and the UK after running up losses of more than Fl 800m (Pounds 297m) over the last three years. The new continental company, comprising core medium and heavy truck production units now employing 5,000, would be set up in the Netherlands. The Belgian operation in Westerlo, which produces car and truck axles for the Eindhoven plant and employs 1,500, would be separated into a stand-alone unit owned by Belgium's General de Banque, according to reports. Some workers at Leyland-Daf won a pay rise in January that will raise their pay by 10 per cent by the end of the year if the deal is not scrapped as part of a survival package.

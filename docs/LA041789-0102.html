			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> DIB SUPPORTS BERNARDI IN RUNOFF  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, facing a June 6 runoff against  firefighter Lyle Hall in the northeast San Fernando Valley's 7th District,  picked up a key supporter today: Al Dib, a prominent businessman who finished  third in last week's primary.  </P> <P> The 77-year-old Bernardi, the council dean with 28 years there, also announced  at a City Hall press conference that, if reelected, he will not run for another  term in four years.  </P> <P> Bernardi finished first in the primary with 42% of the vote but fell short of  the 50%-plus-one vote required to avoid a runoff against Hall, who finished  second with 26%. Dib, former president of the Arleta Chamber of Commerce,  received 12% of the vote.  </P> <P> "He said he is not running again after this term, which tells me he will not  owe developers and special interest groups anything," Dib said of Bernardi.  </P> <P> Dib, the only Republican in the nonpartisan race, is expected to sway business  and GOP support to Democrat Bernardi.  </P></p>

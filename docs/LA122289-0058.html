			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : COURT RULES SALON BIASED AGAINST AIDS  PATIENT  </P> <P> The California Court of Appeals, reversing a lower court decision, ruled this  week that Jessica's Nail Clinic discriminated against a West Hollywood man in  1986 when it canceled his pedicure appointment after a manicurist discovered  that the man had AIDS.  </P> <P> In what was widely viewed as a test case, the court on Wednesday also upheld  the validity of a West Hollywood ordinance that protects those with AIDS from  discrimination by businesses.  </P> <P> Attorney Gloria Allred filed suit in 1987 on behalf of Paul Jasperson, who died  this last May of complications from AIDS.  </P> <P> Attorneys for the salon, who won the first round in Superior Court, argued that  sharp instruments used in a pedicure could puncture Jasperson's skin and expose  others to the deadly AIDS virus. Jessica Vartoughian, owner of the salon, had  no comment on the most recent decision.  </P></p>

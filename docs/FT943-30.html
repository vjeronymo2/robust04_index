			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies  -Europe (41): Deficit clouds prospects - Italy / Robert Graham on how the Berlusconi government is tackling problems Italy's huge public sector deficit hangs like a sword of Damocles over every aspect of economic policy of the five-month-old Berlusconi government. The way in which the right wing coalition tackles the debt issue, in the context of a tough 1995 budget and a broader coherent macroeconomic strategy, will be an important factor in determining the durability of this new and inexperienced administration. The stakes are high. If the policies fail to convince the market, this will inevitably lead to a further weakening of the lira, inflationary pressures and a punishing rise in interest rates. This vicious cycle will limit Italy's ability to take advantage of the domestic economic recovery and the generalised recovery among industrialised countries. As it is, the economy is set to grow 1.5 per cent this year and close to 3 per cent in 1995. Exports continue to enjoy an unprecedented boom with the first-half trade surplus of L16,000bn (Dollars 10bn) double that of the same period in 1993. Inflation, helped by low wage demands, is down to an annualised 3.7 per cent, the lowest level since the 1960s. But all these positive elements are dwarfed by the problems of Italy's public finances which in turn limit the country's ability to meet the European Union convergence criteria laid down by the Maastricht treaty. Unfortunately, too, the Berlusconi government has got off to a bad start, unnecessarily alienating the markets by giving the wrong signals. On taking office as premier in May, Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate turned politician, failed to give sufficient priority to tackling the public sector deficit. Instead he appeared more intent on kick-starting the recovery, his first measures being investment, share purchase and job creation incentives. At the same time Mr Berlusconi gave far too little attention to the constraints imposed by the debt, it being close to 125 per cent of GDP - double the limit set down by the Maastricht convergence criteria. These failings were compounded by Mr Berlusconi's visceral distaste for increasing the fiscal pressure after an electoral campaign in which he promised no new taxes and also pledged a progressive reduction of the tax burden. This stance on taxation has tied the hands of the new economic team and complicated their task in finding the large amounts of money necessary to hold down the 1995 budget deficit to below 9 per cent of GDP. The government inherited an overshoot in spending and a shortfall in revenues. This situation was no secret and the outgoing Ciampi administration had made it clear that a mid-year correction was necessary to control the 1994 budget rising L15,000bn above initial provisions. However, Mr Berlusconi has avoided a formal mini-budget. Instead, the new economic team headed by Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister and former director-general of the Bank of Italy, chose to raise the funds through two measures that would also roll over into 1995 - an amnesty for illicit construction (raising funds through property registration fees), and a form of tax pardon allowing quick and favourable settlements to a huge backlog of disputes with the tax authorities. These practical and politically popular measures are expected to raise some L6,000bn this year. Next year they are due to bring in at least L15,000bn. But some economists are concerned that a new government tackling chronic deficit problems should have resorted at the outset to once-off measures - measures which also had a history in Italy of generating less revenue than predicted. The economists also feel that the greater than anticipated 1994 budget deficit (L159,000bn instead L144,000bn) should have been corrected completely and not partially as has been done. In all, the government is pledged to find almost L50,000bn in 1995. This is probably the minimum necessary to convince the markets and it involves continued austerity budgets through 1996 and 1997. Even so, finding such funds is a formidable task and the government is relying essentially on spending cuts and juggling with existing taxes. The full shape of the budget will not be known until the end of this month and it is not clear how the painful spending cuts will fall. Against this uncertain background - and the aggravation of a damaging row between the government and the Bank of Italy over the latter's autonomy - the lira has been weak and government bonds have taken a beating. The lira by the end of July had reached its psychological floor of L1,000 against the D-Mark and by early August had fallen to a historic low of L1030. Not surprisingly, the Bank of Italy was obliged to raise on August 11 its benchmark discount rate by half a percentage point to 7.5 per cent. This was the first such rise since the September 1992 European currency crisis. Bonds are now having to be offered at rates as much as 4.5 percentage points above German interest rates and over the next few months a large stock of bonds are due to mature. Analysts reckon, as a rule of thumb, that a 1 percentage point increase/decrease in interest rates means an additional annual cost/saving of L15,000bn. In other words, virtually a quarter of the new revenues being sought in 1995 could be eaten up by a 1 percentage point rise in interest rates. It also raises the question whether it is realistic to believe the latest forecast that the total of debt as a proportion of GDP will level off in 1995 at 128 per cent The treasury's 1995 document released in July forecast debt service would be L169,000bn. Since 1992, the size of Italy's annual debt service payments has exceeded that of the budget deficit. Italy in fact will run a primary surplus on its budget this year (the difference between revenues and expenditures less interest charges) equivalent to nearly 1 per cent of GDP. The primary surplus in 1995 is expected to rise to 1.7 per cent of GDP and to 2.6 per cent the following year. The 1995 budget itself is predicated on holding the rise in public spending to 2.5 per cent, the rate of projected inflation against a planned 2.7 per cent rise in GDP. This means finding cuts of some L32,000bn.</p>

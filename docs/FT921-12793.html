			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Lonrho cuts dividend as profits fall by a quarter LONRHO, the international trading group, yesterday announced the first cut in its final dividend for a decade as pre-tax profits for the year to the end of September 1991 fell by 24 per cent to Pounds 207m. The final dividend has been cut by 3p to 5p per share. The group also took the unusual step of withholding this year's first interim dividend, which was expected to be 3p. Lonrho was hit by the recession on both sides of the Atlantic and the appreciation of sterling against the currencies of the African states in which it has many of its assets. Mr Tiny Rowland, chief executive, said: 'We want to see how earnings are going before returning to our traditional policy of maximum distribution.' There has been speculation that Lonrho, which has borrowings of just under Pounds 1.1bn, has been under pressure to cut its dividend from its banks, led by Standard Chartered, Barclays and National Westminster and two Swiss banks, Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corporation. But bankers denied this yesterday. Lonrho held a meeting last week with executives of Standard Chartered, which has substantial Far East and African operations. But the dividend was not on the agenda. Although the market had closed when the results were released at 4.30pm, the shares were marked down in after-hours dealing by around 40p. Earlier, they had risen by 9p to close at 163p when the group confirmed the sale of its 50 per cent interest in Kuhne and Nagel, the German freight forwarder, for DM340m (Pounds 118.8m). In a statement released with the results Lonrho said: 'The board and management regret having to present a disap-pointing year's results'. Mr Mike Smith, analyst at Robert Fleming Securities, commented: 'I have never seen the company regret anything in all the years I have followed Lonrho. It is encouraging to see that they have decided to be more open.' Mr Philip Tarsh, Lonrho director, said he could not understand why the results should come as a surprise. 'We were badly hit by the recession. The fall in precious metal prices accounts for nearly half of the reduction in Lonrho's profits in the second six months. Why analysts could not see that is beyond me.' Lonrho had better news to announce from its balance sheet. Although net debt had increased from Pounds 936m to Pounds 1.1bn, this was better than most commentators feared. It represented 73 per cent of shareholders funds of Pounds 1.5bn, including minority interests. Gearing will fall by another 10 per cent after the Kuhne and Nagel disposal is taken into account.

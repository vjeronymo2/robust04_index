			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Brokers hit The withdrawal from the London non-life reinsurance market of NRG, the Dutch insurance group, triggered a late flurry of selling pressure in the two leading insurance brokers, Sedgwick and Willis Corroon, which could be hit by the contraction of the London market. Willis shares fell 5 to 198p on turnover of 1m and Sedgwick 4 to 174p on 605,000 traded. NRG's UK reinsurance arm, Victory, has a big chunk of London's reinsurance market. And there were suggestions that another of the big reinsurance groups may soon pull out of London. Prudential said yesterday that its reinsurance subsidiary is chopping its reinsurance business by 50 per cent this year. 'This will translate into premium rate increases, which should be good for the composites,' said one analyst. 'But is could make life increasingly difficult for the brokers,' he added. In the composites Royal Insurance jumped 11 to 318p. Sun Alliance, however, dropped 6 to 346p after one securities house was said to have adopted a cautious stance. Prudential's preliminary results showed profits at the lower end of expectations but the dividend was a touch better than most forecasts, dealers said. Prudential shares moved up 3 to 329p. Clyde Petroleum's Pounds 34m rights issue, a one-four at 44p, surprised the market but caused little disruption to the Clyde share price which drifted 4 to 51p. The oil team at Hoare Govett, broker to Clyde and underwriter of the rights issue, commented 'The development of Gryphon and adoption of successful efforts accounting underpins future profits growth and a sustainable and progressive dividend.' Lasmo attracted more keen buying in front of this morning's preliminary numbers although many expect them to include a reduction in the final dividend, possibly to 3p. Glaxo returned to favour, the shares climbing 13 to 614p on 4.8m traded. Dealers noted good US support for the shares ahead of the start of clinical trials for the group's 3TC anti-aids drug. Wellcome rose 12 to 910p. Unichem put on 7 1/2 to 243 1/2 p following the 49 per cent increase in profits. Wolseley, the building materials group, raced up to 617p immediately following the much better than expected figures before coming off the top and closing a net 10 higher at 604p. A block of 3m shares was sold into the market at 599p and mostly placed at 600p. Bargain hunters helped engineering group Siebe shrug off recent weakness to advance 5 to 460p. The market was unimpressed by a Pounds 126m rights issue from components group BBA and the shares fell 7 to 170p, in response. Weir Group were wanted ahead of today's figures and put on 4 to 648p. Also in demand was James Wilkes, which added another 2 to 72p, on continued bid speculation. A two way pull was seen in P&amp;O, which reported figures in line with expectations, and the sale of the Sutcliffe catering group to Granada Group. Having jumped 26 to 627p, on the release of the figures, closer examination of them saw the shares come off the top to close a net 2 better at 603p, with turnover reaching 4.6m. Mr Steve Clapham at Credit Lyonnais Laing appreciated the figures but reduced his current year forecast by Pounds 15m to Pounds 295m to take account of the Sutcliffe disposal and higher than expected net debt figure. Results from Iceland Frozen Foods came in line with expectations. Most analysts kept next year forecasts in the Pounds 66-69m range. The shares advanced 9 to 744p. However, one foods specialist warned that the stock's rating was looking high. J Sainsbury slipped 8 to 507p, Kwik Save 14 to 801p and Argyll Group 10 to 343p. Budget changes to FT statistics The Financial Times will implement with effect from April 5th the Budget reduction in the income tax rate applied to dividends to 20 per cent from 25 per cent. This will affect gross dividend yields shown for individual companies in the London Share Service, and those calculated for the FT-SE Actuaries UK Share Indices and the FT-Actuaries World Indices.</p>

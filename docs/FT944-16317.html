			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Balladur boards scandals bandwagon The arrest of Mr Alain Carignon, mayor of Grenoble and a former minister, on a new charge of corruption has set Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and his political rivals vying with each other to be seen cleansing the country's political system. Mr Balladur, who said yesterday France's politico-financial scandals were poisoning its political life, is hoping to avoid new legislation on political funding by getting parties to agree on codes of conduct to reinforce existing laws. His four-point plan includes: Audits of politicians' personal assets. Making bids and awards on public contracts more transparent. A reduction in election spending. An ethics code for senior civil servants joining the private sector. However, Mr Philippe Seguin, the National Assembly president, has convened similar all-party negotiations in the parliament, with the aim of producing legislative proposals by the end of November. Mr Seguin does not share Mr Balladur's view that most of the current scandals stem from the 1980s and can be dealt with by existing legislation, notably the 1990 law on corporate contributions to political parties. The fact that Mr Seguin also *something in here (HP) * chairs a campaign committee for Mr Balladur's presidential rival, Mr Jacques Chirac, does not incline him to minimise the damage to the government. The detention of Mr Carignon marks a new threshold in the crackdown on corruption. It is the first time a big-city mayor and ex-minister has been locked up, even if briefly. Many Grenoble residents expressed shock at their mayor ending up in a Lyons jail. The Socialist opposition weighed in yesterday, claiming that with five of ministers or former ministers under investigation the Balladur government was 'in the process of coming apart'. But the edge of the attack by the Socialists, themselves scarred from numerous scandals while in office, was that the Balladur government had recently eased anti-corruption rules requiring local councils to publish property deals and contract tenders, and that the prime minister was indulging in a hypocritical 'media show'. Mr Balladur is expected soon to have to replace his trade and industry minister, Mr Gerard Longuet, who is expected to come under formal investigation for financial and real estate improprieties. In July, Mr Carignon left the government after being charged with 'receipt of fraud'. The allegations linked Lyonnaise des Eaux's bail-out of a pro-Carignon newspaper and the company's contract to run Grenoble's water supply. The latest charge against Mr Carignon is that of 'passive corruption' - receiving FFr13m (Pounds 1.55m) in corporate gifts, a free Paris apartment and air tickets.</p>

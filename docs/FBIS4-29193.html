			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party  (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social Democratic Party of Japan] will urge  Japan, the United States and China to make efforts to reopen  high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang on North  Korea's suspected nuclear arms development, a party official  said Thursday [16 June].    Kazo Watanabe, director of the second largest opposition  party's General Affairs Bureau, told a news conference at the  Japan National Press Club that Japan and North Korea should also  resume talks as early as possible to establish diplomatic  relations. Officials of the (North) Korean Workers' Party have  told SDP officials in Pyongyang they want to unconditionally  restart normalization talks stalled since November 1992,  Watanabe said.    An SDP delegation headed by Watanabe visited North Korea for  six days up to Wednesday as part of efforts to promote ties with  the North's ruling party. The SDP has traditionally maintained  close relations with the Korean Workers' Party.    Watanabe also said the SDP will oppose the idea of slapping  sanctions on North Korea as a means of ending Pyongyang's  alleged quest for nuclear weapons.    Two legislators of the primary opposition Liberal Democratic  Party are also visiting Pyongyang for talks on North Korea's  nuclear program.</p>

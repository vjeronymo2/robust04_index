			<p>BFN     [Text] AL-MAJD has learned that Iraqi Deputy Prime  Minister Tariq 'Aziz last week extended his visit to Jordan by  24 hours so to meet with King Husayn at the latter's initiative.  The unpublicized session lasted two hours.    According to well-informed sources, speaking to AL-MAJD,  Tariq 'Aziz said at a private meeting with friends in the  Jordanian capital that Baghdad had access to documents showing  that Gulf Arab leaders lavish gifts and bribes on Western  dilomats posted in their countries so that they write back to  their capitals warning about Iraqi potential threats to and  designs on the Gulf states and demanding that the sanctions be  maintained.    Representations of Kurds in northern Iraq, according to  'Aziz, have been visiting Baghdad recently to appeal to the  Iraqi Government to move to rid them of practices by Kurdish  militia chiefs, such as Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani.    The delegations stressed the Kurdish people's adherence to  and support for the Iraqi leadership, according to 'Aziz.    Baghdad recently received numerous signals from Moscow that  the Russian Government was willing to cooperate with Iraq and  reinstate relations on solid foundations, 'Aziz said.    Moscow sent the message that it was anxious to see itself  gradually break free from the grip of the United States and  resume its status on the world stage as a superpower.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow May 21 TASS -- Marshal Yevgeniy  Shaposhnikov, former commander-in-chief of the allied armed  forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States, believes that  the Black Sea Fleet should be divided between all the countries  of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) rather than  between Russia and Ukraine.    Expressing his private opinion in a speech over Russian  television on Saturday, he said that, since Ukraine did not join  the CIS Treaty on Collective Security, it should be given  one-eleventh part of the fleet.    The rest of the fleet should be used to protect the CIS  interests in the Black Sea area.    Shaposhnikov also suggested that if any CIS country is  unable  to finance its part of the fleet, it can hand it over under the  control of any other CIS country and receive for it a  compensation in the form of oil, coal and other minerals.</p>

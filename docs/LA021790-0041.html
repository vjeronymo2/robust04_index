			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> PUNK-ROCK HEAVEN FROM NORTHWEST'S NIRVANA  </P> <P> In his book "Lipstick Traces," semiotician Greil Marcus says something to the  effect that any great punk song can sound like the best song you've heard  before in your life.  </P> <P> At Raji's on Thursday, Nirvana, a noisy power-trio from suburban Washington  State, sounded for the moment at least like the best punk band you've heard in  your life: deep-deep metal riffs repeated as relentlessly as beats on a hip-hop  record, washes of guitar white noise, singer Kurdt Kobain bellowing punk koans  above the din.  </P> <P> Sample lyric: "I'm a negative creep, I'm a negative creep, I'm a negative  creep. . . ." The bottom grabbed your guts in a way you may not have  experienced since the Germs broke up. And some of the crowd was actually  pogoing.  </P> <P> Nirvana, the newest poster boys from Seattle's white-hot Sub Pop Records  stable, are masters of that sort of anarchic hard-rock fullness you might  associate with Jimi Hendrix. That's for half the set. The other half,  neo-psychedelic ditties roughly structured like Seeds songs or something, seems  thrown in the way the Kronos Quartet will toss in some Bartok or a nouvelle  French chef will sometimes serve you a pot-au-feu, just to let you know that  they can work in a classical vein if they want to. But Nirvana doesn't work as  well as adenoidal teen heroes -- you can hear all the words, for one thing.  JONATHAN GOLD  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TEDDY BEARS BRING OUT THE KID IN ADULTS  </P> <P> What hobby brings love, profit and a world of make-believe? Teddy bears.  </P> <P> Teddy collectors make bears, sell bears and save to buy particular bears they  love. One couple paid the biggest price ever -- $86,350 -- for an early 1900  Steiff bear.  </P> <P> Rosemary and Paul Volpp had no idea the bidding would go that high at the 1989  Sotheby auction in London. In celebration of their 42 years of marriage, they  named the precious beauty "Happy Anniversary."  </P> <P> Rosemary says, "Her shining eyes begged me to take her home." Now "Happy" is a  member of the 4,000-bear Volpp collection in Buena Park and will be a featured  model in their beautifully illustrated bear books.  </P> <P> The German-made Steiff, according to collectors, is the Rolls-Royce of bears.  Antiques and some bears created by artists do increase in value, but that's not  the reason most people collect bears. People collect things that bring warm  memories, and bears have an almost human appeal.  </P> <P> The smile can be wimpy, the eyes too close together and the coat matted.  Someone will buy him because "he needs me."  </P> <P> Today bear-mania has touched half a million people, and the hobby ranks fourth  in the United States, after coins, stamps and dolls.  </P> <P> "Bears are not just art, but heart," said Ron Block from Edinburgh Imports in  Calabasas. "They are an extension of yourself, something to love. I know two  women who make bears for handicapped children, furry pets that duplicate the  child's own disability. Policemen, firefighters and doctors use teddy bears to  comfort worried kids."  </P> <P> Block and his German wife, Elke -- a Steiff bear collector -- own a warehouse  filled with glass eyeballs, joints, fur fabrics and anything else you need to  make bears. Their artist customers come from all over the United States.  </P> <P> In 1983, Ann Baxter, a Glendale collector, met with 13 bear lovers and founded  Bear Enthusiast's All 'Round -- B.E.A.R. -- Collectors Club. Now it has more  than 400 members. On the first Wednesday of each month, bear lovers travel from  Santa Barbara, Ventura, Oxnard, Buena Park and other communities for a dinner  meeting in Burbank.  </P> <P> As you walk into the banquet room, the furry stars are everywhere, bedecked in  ruffles, funny hats, a new tuxedo. Most of the owners are adults, and many even  have grown children, perhaps grandchildren. A jovial member admits, "Bears wake  up the little kid in us, and give us a chance to play make-believe."  </P> <P> A hum of voices sounds. "We drove a thousand miles out of our way to find the  Baltimore Bear Shop." . . . "In Vermont the Hugging Bear Inn is having their  annual bear wedding." . . . "What do you think about this panda? Are the  markings right?"  </P> <P> In one corner of the room, bears compete in miniature scenes suiting the theme  of the month. The winner is a rakish fellow in red striped pajamas, waiting  impatiently for a primping cinnamon bride dressed in a silk and lace peignoir.  </P> <P> Monthly raffles support two of the club's favorite charities: Five Acres, a  home for abused children, and Para Los Ninos, a day-care center for Skid Row  children. The ninos have received 85 bears, and at Five Acres a big birthday  Bruin grants wishes for all the children, from ages 2 to 18.  </P> <P> "Bears are the great equalizers," Ann Baxter says. "Housewives, plumbers,  professors, nurses -- we are all alike when we share something we love." Then  she adds more pensively, "People need a time to share happiness."  </P> <P> In spring and fall, B.E.A.R. sponsors a fair at Glendale Civic Auditorium, with  more than 100 booths of bears. Each exhibiting artist has a personal style or  mark. A Steiff bear has a button in the left ear. You can recognize Cindy  Martin's bears because of their long, floppy limbs and high-bridged noses.  </P> <P> Touch the fur. Is it real mink? It could be mohair. Most bear makers choose  from furs and a variety of synthetics. Clothes, furniture, even toys for bears  can be found at the fair.  </P> <P> One client, a businessman from New York, bought "Poinsettia" from Carol  Jarosik, a bear artist from Agoura Hills. The white ultra-plush bear with her  red satin bow was packed in a plastic bag. The red-flowered paw pads poked out  of the handles, and bright gray eyes peered over the top.  </P> <P> "Don't cover her face," instructed Carol gently. "She doesn't like it."  </P> <P> "No need to worry." The man's bald head bent over the little bear. He gave her  a gentle pat. "I have 600 more at home. Bears cover every baseboard in my  house."  </P> <P> Carol understood. Her own house is one big hug of bears, not only those she has  made, with hand-painted paw pads, but hundreds she and her husband, Tony, have  collected. Bears peek around the stair rails or ride in a tall pram with  lavender velvet cushions. Mabel -- a rotund beige softy -- languishes in the  family rocker.  </P> <P> "She came to visit and decided to stay." Carol nods lovingly at the bear, whose  blue satin pillbox hat is held by a tiny hatpin. A crocheted collar protects  her shoulders, and a satin evening bag dangles from one paw.  </P> <P> Mabel watches a frisky polar bear peeking out from under a wagon and listens to  the bear-buzz about "Killer," a hunched brown husky in black leather vest and  cap.  </P> <P> "He's really a marshmallow," confides Carol. "Even the skull on his jacket has  a silly grin." She adds, " 'Killer' won a blue ribbon at the fair in Nevada  City, and the funniest thing happened. A woman passed my booth several times,  then stopped and said, 'He looks exactly like my husband!' "  </P> <P> The buyer continued, "My husband is a woodcarver. He'll love this bear." A few  weeks later she mailed pictures of Killer astride his own hand-carved  motorcycle, complete with spike wheels and travel pack.  </P> <P> The Jarosiks and other bear lovers follow the state and national fairs. The  biggest bear conclave is at Disney World. Last year those attending built  "Yankee Doodle," the world's largest bear -- 24 feet high, seated. The 1990  Walt Disney World Teddy Bear and Doll Show Nov. 29 to Dec. 2 attracted Raikes,  Steiff and other well-known artists who designed bears for the event and sold  replicas and copies of "Happy Anniversary," with part of the proceeds  designated for children's hospitals.  </P> <P> Like the Jarosiks, thousands of other bear-lovers who attended left their bears  behind but camehome bringing, guess what -- more bears.  </P> <P>  The B.E.A.R. Club meets the first Wednesday of every month for dinner at  Pickwick Banquet and Entertainment Center, 1001 Riverside Drive, Burbank.  Guests are welcome; $17, including dinner. Members, $15. For reservations, call  (818) 994-7845.  </P></p>

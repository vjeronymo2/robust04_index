			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Figures signal end to job slide in manufacturing The first signs that the 25-year decline in manufacturing employment may be ending have been detected by the Department of Employment Official figures yesterday showed a rise in manufacturing employment in May for the second consecutive month. The news accompanied a fall in unemployment figures in June for the fifth consecutive month in all regions - except Northern Ireland - to a seasonally adjusted 2.64m. Manufacturing employment rose 2,000 in May. It has risen in seven of the past 12 months. Manufacturing jobs fell 17,000 in the year to May, but Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said yesterday that there were hopes that a 'turning point has been reached'. Officials said although it was too early to be confident of strong employment growth in manufacturing, there was at least a levelling off. The biggest increases in manufacturing employment occurred in the paper and printing sector, where jobs rose 3,000 in May and 16,000 over the past year. Job increases were seen in the metal-goods sector and in mechanical engineering, which each took on another 1,000 employees in May. This was offset by the chemical and fibre sector, which lost 5,000 jobs in May - the fifth consecutive monthly fall. The rise in manufacturing jobs was welcomed in the City yesterday, although analysts admitted that they remained sceptical about the unemployment data. They pointed out that although unemployment had fallen by 148,300 since the start of this year, there was still little evidence of a corresponding growth in employment levels. Meanwhile, they suggested, the rate of the monthly fall in unemployment slowed last month, which might indicate that the decline was bottoming out. Unemployment fell 18,800 last month, compared with monthly declines of about 35,000 in the spring. A further cause for concern was that the number of actual hours worked in manufacturing fell last month in spite of the increase in manufacturing jobs. The index of average hours was 96.7 in May, its lowest level for more than a decade. The number of overtime hours in manufacturing fell to 8.6m in May, its lowest level since April last year, and the third-lowest rate ever recorded. On the positive side, the stock of vacancies in Jobcentres rose 5,000 to 152,800, and new vacancies rose to 209,600, the highest for four years. Productivity growth slipped, however. Productivity in May was 2.3 per cent higher than last May, compared with an annual growth rate of 3.7 per cent in April and 2.9 per cent in January.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: Wary eyes focus on bullish Asian markets - The Emerging Investor Almost anybody who invested in emerging markets in 1993 will not be regretting the decision. Spectacular increases in many markets were well in excess of gains to be found in most developed countries. The combination of rapidly growing economies, solid earnings growth, and weight of new money was extraordinarily powerful. But as the new year gets under way with a bang - eight Asian markets hit new records yesterday - investors may ask how long the good times can go on. Aren't emerging markets just a fad? Won't they soon come crashing down? Old Asia hands might say that the only new factor in their region has been the attention suddenly paid by foreign fund managers: dependably rapid development has been under way in Asia for a long time - even China, of which everybody wants to get a piece, has been reforming for over 15 years now. The suspicion that it's just a game to the fickle foreigners was fuelled in 1993 by pronouncements about China from Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank. First it extolled China as the place to be (via Hong Kong). But a few weeks later the portfolio weighting was reduced to below the level of before the bullish remarks. What had appeared an important strategic statement turned out to be a short-term, profitable play. Apart from underlying fear that international cash will flow on into the next investment wave, leaving emerging markets behind, there are signs causing concern in some markets - such as an abnormally high level of retail activity. Alarm bells should start ringing when brokers' analysis argues, however plausibly, that normal standards for price/earnings ratios do not apply because of the peculiarities of a particular market. Remember Japan? How then should the investor approach emerging markets? A few points are worth bearing in mind by the investor who wants to be sure of making a strategic decision intended to bring benefits over the long term. The first is that, as the word 'emerging' implies, the markets are not fully developed and are thus more risky than those in the industrialised world. This does not necessarily mean that the economic and political risks are greater, though they may be. The markets are smaller, less liquid, more volatile. They may be lacking in key areas of infrastructure: management of the stock exchange and its settlement mechanisms, standards of regulation and disclosure, transparency of corporate accounts, development of associated financial markets, restrictions on foreign investors, and the taxation system. Part of the investor's bet is that these handicaps will be removed over time. Second, the term 'emerging markets' covers a wide range of economies and political systems. No two countries can be regarded as essentially the same, even neighbours. Knowledge of individual countries - and of the companies within them - is vital. So is an ability to step back and examine the wider picture, analysing potential returns compared with other emerging as well as developed markets. Like the markets themselves, the information flow about emerging markets is still very much in the development stage. The message from these points is that the ride is likely to be long and bumpy. In exchange for greater risk and need for costly specialist expertise, investors naturally expect a higher, sustained return. Rapid rates of economic growth maintained over many years will help to provide that. But the effect of capital flows cannot be ignored. The plain fact is that, until now, sharp price gains have been seen partly because the amounts of foreign money, though perhaps quite small to the owners, are large for the markets into which they have been flowing. Baring Securities estimates that a net Dollars 38bn (Pounds 26bn) was invested by foreigners in 1993 in the Pacific Rim (excluding Japan) and Latin America, double the amount in 1992. It expects a modest increase to Dollars 45bn in 1994. Even although it expects a tightening of US monetary policy eventually to trigger a scaling back of US investment abroad, it still forecasts that US investors will put Dollars 15-Dollars 20bn into emerging markets this year. Nevertheless, it warns that 'it is prudent to scale down exposure to those markets which have been fuelled exclusively by foreign money of late.' Salomon Brothers argues that pension funds, which it classifies as 'patient' investors in contrast to those with 'hot' or 'momentum' money, are likely to allocate a growing proportion of their growing pool to Asia. It says that this new money is unlikely to be removed quickly and 'is a meaningful proportion of the current free float of these markets and could rise to a substantial percentage of the available equity.' While this would aid confidence if it proved true, it still means that the foreign investor who is in emerging markets for the long term has a problem. The impact of the capital flow to which he is contributing is an important factor in the strong performance of his portfolio. Only continued development of emerging economies and markets can correct the imbalance. But governments can help by allowing markets and the surrounding infrastructure to develop so that foreign investors, with better information and security, are less likely to pile out as quickly as they have piled in.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Friday  Week on week  change Stock                         Country      close     Dollars         %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Tapei Business Bank           Taiwan        4.56        1.13     32.94 China Trust                   Taiwan        2.97        0.73     32.92 China Development             Taiwan        4.62        1.07     30.31 Chang Kwa bank                Taiwan        7.06        1.60     29.36 Hua Nan Commercial Bank       Taiwan        8.11        1.73     27.20 First bank                    Taiwan        8.11        1.70     26.46 United Microelectronics       Taiwan        3.51        0.75     26.32 Finance One                   Thailand     18.63        3.87     26.20 Cathay Life                   Taiwan        9.09        1.77     24.24 Advanced Info Services        Thailand     44.09        8.27     23.08  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Surplus cash: whose money is it anyway?: Norma Cohen looks at the vexed issue of excess investment assets WHEN a pension fund has more money than it needs to pay benefits to members, just whose money is it? Is a surplus the property of pensioners, employees, former employees or the employer? Until now, the courts have taken the view that the owner of a pension fund's deficit also owns its surplus. Because employers have a nominal obligation to make good shortfalls, there have been no legal barriers to their use of surpluses for their own benefit. But in the aftermath of the Maxwell pension-fund scandal, in which more than Pounds 400m went missing from funds controlled by Robert Maxwell, that view looks increasingly unfair, or indeed, less sensible. The 100 Group of Finance Directors, representing Britain's largest companies, has just completed a review of pension issues, thus providing the first glimpse of the industry's response to some of the proposals to reform pensions law. Not surprisingly, the group opposes any attempt to yield pension-fund surpluses to members, saying that attempts to do so will only encourage employers to cut contributions and margins of cover available to meet pension liabilities. According to Caps, the pension-fund performance measurement service, more than two thirds of companies were taking pensions holidays last year  - enjoying the use of surpluses built up in prior years and making no contributions towards their workers' retirement. The pensions fund industry had a net cash outflow of Pounds 2.5bn because investment income, rather than company contributions, was used to cover payments to beneficiaries last year. Two recent events have raised the temperature of the debate over who owns a pension fund's surplus. The first was a ruling by the European Court in May 1990 that, in establishing the need to set equal retirement ages for men and women, said that a pension was in effect deferred pay  - and by extension, the property of employees. The second was the Maxwell saga itself. In the course of hearings conducted by the Commons social security committee, it emerged that Robert Maxwell was legally able to strip out millions of pounds of pension-fund surplus from companies he acquired  - more in fact, than he paid to acquire them, according to evidence. The committee called for a royal commission to study the subject as part of a wider review of pensions law. Mr Frank Field, the committee's Labour chairman, said: 'My own view is that pensions are deferred pay. But that then raises serious questions about how they should be taxed.' Pension contributions of companies and workers are exempt from taxation, as are the income and capital gains of pension fund investments. Pensions industry professionals remain sceptical of industry threats to suspend or reduce benefits to workers if companies are forbidden to use surpluses themselves. Mr Alan Jenkinson, policy director at Noble Lowndes, an actuarial and pension fund consultancy, dismisses such threats as 'propaganda'. Mr Jenkinson believes there is little political support for allowing either employers or employees to secure the benefit solely for their own purposes. There is general agreement that surpluses should be shared, he said. Employers have argued their right to secure the surplus for their exclusive use on grounds that the surplus arose because they had contributed too generously in early years. Actuaries take issue with that, pointing out that surpluses arise for several reasons, including better-than-expected investment returns or failure to grant departing workers their fair share of pension assets. Mr Stewart Ritchie, pensions manager at Scottish Equitable, says: 'For many schemes, surpluses have arisen because the scheme has not kept pace with inflation. They have been relatively stingy with benefits while investment returns have soared.' Employers also argue that because they have ultimate obligation to make good a scheme's shortfall, they should also own the surplus. That view, too, is disputed. The Institute for Public Policy Studies, the leftwing think tank, has argued that employers can too easily evade their obligation to make up a shortfall by simply winding up a scheme. Mr Jenkinson says that has happened in relatively few cases. However, the plight of more than 4,000 Maxwell retired employees whose pensions disappeared overnight has heightened public concern about the strength of employers' promises to make good shortfalls. THE COURTS and politicians are increasingly challenging companies' rights to appropriate pension-fund surpluses for their own benefit, a leading pensions lawyer said yesterday. Mr John Cunliffe, a partner at McKenna and Company, called for clearer laws to end ambiguities over the ownership of surpluses at the conference. He said that until the question of surplus ownership was settled it would be impossible to draft legislation to safeguard pension-fund assets. Mr Cunliffe said politicians appeared increasingly to hold the view that pension-fund surpluses belonged to members, not the company. The courts, he said, had recently ruled that while members had no right to participate directly in a surplus, they had the right to be considered in relation to its use. 'All this comes pretty near to saying that surplus belongs to members,' he said.</p>

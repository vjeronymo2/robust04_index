			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Monitoring of radioactive discharges Sir, I was concerned that Mr G A H Watts letter (November 27/28) and indeed its headline - 'The unmeasured threat from nuclear power station emissions'  -may have misled your readers. Monitoring of radioactive discharges from all Nuclear Electric's power stations is of course continuous, 24 hours a day. Wide-ranging environmental sampling and measurement checks demonstrate the negligible effects of our discharges, as our area medical officer confirmed to Mr Watts in previous correspondence. All monitoring results are published - both Nuclear Electric's and those of independent regulatory agencies. They confirm that there has been no build up of radioactivity in the environment around our power stations. I am sorry that Mr Watts has developed such a serious illness. Thirty years of detailed environmental monitoring both in the vicinity of our power stations and around Mr Watts's home, strongly suggest, however, that he should look elsewhere for the cause. Bryan Edmondson, director of health and safety, Nuclear Electric, Barnett Way, Barnwood, Gloucester GL4 7RS</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chevron pours oil on troubled waters - As the Angolan ceasefire approaches, Julian Ozanne looks at the oil sector's prospects BOW-LEGGED Americans in jeans, cowboy boots, and shiny rodeo belt buckles stand around the air-conditioned pool hall in Chevron's Malongo camp, sipping Budweiser, Miller Lite and US-imported Coke Classic. Outside in the steamy equatorial heat, helicopters flown by Vietnam veterans ferry oilmen between the offshore rigs and platforms to the camp, passing over a well-watered nine-hole golf course, astro-turf greens, tennis courts and the steady flow of Ford and Chevrolet pick-ups along a network of immaculate tarmac roads. Malongo camp, on the sweltering central African coast, is the base of operations for the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (Cabgoc), a successful and productive joint venture oil company in which the Angolan state oil company, Sonangol, has a majority 51 per cent shareholding. Operated by Chevron, the largest private shareholder, the camp is more like Texas than Angola. It is one of the reasons why the war-torn and economically crippled country has become one of the fastest-growing oil producers in Africa and the second largest after Nigeria. A huge influx of foreign investment and expertise in the early 1980s has laid the basis for a doubling of Angola's production in the last six years from 232,000 barrels per day in 1985 to 476,000 bpd last year. Cabgoc's Cabinda offshore concession contributed about 45-50 per cent of national production in 1990. Proven reserves last year stood at 2.34bn barrels, the equivalent of nearly 14 years of production at current levels. The oil industry has played a vital role in the Angolan economy, plagued by 16 years of destructive civil war and inefficient socialist central planning. The sector earned Angola Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.56bn) in 1989, accounting for about 91 per cent of export earnings, 57 per cent of real GDP and 62 per cent of fiscal revenues. Investment in exploration and development in the Angolan oil industry in the last three years is estimated at about Dollars 2-2.5bn, largely due to big discoveries and development in Block 3, a production-sharing agreement operated by Elf Aquitaine - Angola's second largest producer  - and continued development in the Cabinda offshore concession, including the recent construction of two new production platforms and a water injection platform. According to Mr Joao Lourenco Landoite, Angola's petroleum minister, the pace of investment and development will pick up dramatically over the next five years. Bidding is due to open for five of 16 new deep water concessions ranging from 500-2000 feet. A model contract has already been drawn up setting out the number of wells to be drilled, the minimum expenditure and the signature bonus. Preliminary talks have already been held with several interested oil companies, including British Petroleum and Shell, which are not currently operating in Angola. 'We want to get more foreign companies coming into Angola for oil exploration, and if they are British companies they are welcome,' said Mr Landoite, who visited London in March. 'We need new experience, new money and we want to better understand the international oil industry.' In addition to the new deeper water blocks, significant investment is expected in exploration activity in several new areas recently awarded or under negotiation, including an onshore concession at Cabinda with BP and other shallow water offshore concessions with Unocal, Conoco, Elf, Total and Texaco. Mr Landoite is also currently tying up a Dollars 120m financing package to allow Sonangol to act as operator for the first time with technical assistance from Range Oil in Block 4. Further exploration, development and recovery in the Cabinda offshore fields, where four rigs are currently active, is expected to boost Cabgoc's production to 325,000-350,000 b/d in 1994. The Ministry of Petroleum projects total national production in 1994 from existing producing concessions at 611,000 b/d. With a ceasefire in the 16-year civil war now agreed for May 15, Mr Landoite is also optimistic about the development of other onshore concessions and the five southernmost shallow water offshore concessions - blocks 9-13 - whose prospects have been hindered because of insecurity and the threat of rebel attack. Peace will also dramatically reduce the huge foreign exchange costs of transport, insurance and importing all goods, even basic foodstuffs and beverages. While the enclave offshore oil sector has been largely insulated from the civil war, isolated attacks did create problems. In February, 120 foreigners working for Conoco had to be evacuated from Ambriz after rebels besieged the town. Foreign companies have found the investment climate favourable in Angola. The oil industry operates outside of the administrative and foreign exchange controls imposed on the rest of the economy. Profitability has been high as a result of low costs of production, the high exploration success rate and the government's flexible policy on fiscal matters. Foreign investors have also been attracted to Angola because crude production is not limited by quotas imposed by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Domestic distribution of petroleum products is currently carried out exclusively by Sonangol, but Mr Landoite says the government will privatise distribution this year. 'It has been a mistake. We must open the market to privately owned local and foreign companies. There is no way of going on as we are now,' he said. While most industry analysts foresee a healthy and exciting future ahead for the Angolan oil sector, some doubts remain over the operations of Sonangol, allegations of high-level government corruption and the real net inflow into the country of oil earnings. In an otherwise candid interview, Mr Landoite excused himself from addressing the question of the net inflow of earnings, confirming suspicions that a controversy is raging in government about the huge outflows from the oil sector in expatriate salaries, dividends, transport, insurance and oil-industry imports. Maximising the benefits of the oil sector for the domestic Angolan economy will be a pressing task as the oil industry continues to expand rapidly in the coming years.</p>

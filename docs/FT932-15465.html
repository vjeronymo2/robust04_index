			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Economics Notebook: Darker mood casts a cloud over Austria Austria provides a fresh and depressing case study of how hard times can breed unpleasant politics. For most of last year, the Austrian economy was the envy of Europe, defying the entrenched or deepening recessionary tendencies elsewhere. As late as September, economists were still predicting GDP growth of 2.5 per cent for the year, and Mrs Maria Schaumayer, president of the Austrian central bank, was assuring visitors that the country would not even have to face a soft landing in 1993. Against this buoyant background, most Austrians displayed an admirable tolerance for the flood of immigrants and cheap goods pouring in from eastern Europe. While ugly anti-immigrant riots were breaking out in neighbouring Germany, Austria was quietly absorbing well over 100,000 new arrivals, some 60,000 refugees from Bosnia alone. There were problems, of course. Petty crime rates went up and some Vienna neighbourhoods became unacceptably overcrowded with immigrants, leading to demands from Viennese parents that quotas be set on non-German speaking children in their primary schools. And some industrialists, notably those in textiles, cement and fertilisers, complained of unfair competition from low-cost eastern European producers and demanded protection. Austrians were at an unfair disadvantage, they claimed, because they had to invest heavily in environmental protection systems and pay full market prices for energy whereas eastern Europeans did not. But Austrian political and business leaders, magnanimous in their prosperity, were confident that the social problems could be solved and seemed ready to accept that some basic industries would have to be ceded gradually to lower-cost producers in the east. After all, one of the reasons the economy was doing so well was because of bubbling exports to eastern Europe. Moreover, the country's leaders were optimistic that renewed ties with eastern Europe would bring new vitality to the economy in the medium term. 'It is hard for us to do anything to help these hurt sectors because we are doing so well overall,' Mr Johann Farnleitner, deputy director of the powerful federal Chamber of Commerce, said in September. But in the past few months, the country has plunged suddenly into economic stagnation. Its future economic growth may come from cultivating links with eastern Europe, but at present it is still heavily dependent on Germany. Nearly 40 per cent of Austria's total exports go to its giant neighbour, so it was inevitable that the slumping demand in Germany would spill over. It hit particularly hard in the fourth quarter. Austrian manufacturers' export orders dried up and industrial output tumbled. In December alone, industrial production dropped 8 per cent. GDP growth last year was up only 1.5 per cent and economists have repeatedly revised down their forecasts for the current year. The latest estimates from the authoritative Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), published a few days ago, call for zero growth, the worst performance since 1981. Private sector economists fear it could be worse still, especially if the German economy continues to weaken. The amount of money owed by failed Austrian companies doubled in the first quarter to Sch8.8bn (Pounds 510m), and business leaders have been warning of some big headline cases still to come. Unemployment is rising towards 7 per cent, a level not seen since the 1950s. In this suddenly darker climate, tolerance has equally suddenly given way to a narrower view of self interest. In January, Mr Jorg Haider, the populist leader of the right-wing Freedom Party, launched an inflammatory petition campaign aimed at curbing immigration and immigrants' rights. The petition itself was a flop, but only because of massive campaigning against it by all other political parties, the churches and most of the media. But its message was heard. Last month, Mr Franz Loschnak, the interior minister, announced that Austria would not accept any more refugees from Bosnia. Also last month, quotas were introduced on cement imports from eastern Europe. Last week saw the beginning of restrictions on fertiliser imports. Industrialists in several other sectors are clamouring for protection and they are now likely to be heard. They have a new and unexpected champion in the person of Mr Franz Vranitzky, the normally unflappable and business-like chancellor. Last autumn Mr Vranitzky shrugged off the pressure on some Austrian industries from eastern Europe as an inevitable micro-economic cost in a macro-economic success story. But today, with the economy in trouble and an election only a year away, he is more strident. 'If cheap imports are threatening Austrian industries, because the reforming countries do not have environmental standards and because energy costs are massively subsidised - in other words there is no fair competition - then it is legitimate to take measures to protect domestic companies, at least temporarily,' he told a symposium on Austrian industry last month. It would be unjust to be too critical of these trends. Austria's responses to its slump are not noticeably different from - and in many instances are less severe than - those of other western European countries. Compare Britain's niggardly response to the Bosnian refugee crisis, or the draconian measures taken by the European Commission in recent months to keep out low-cost imports from eastern European countries. But the distressing thing is that they are all pointing in the same sterile direction. 'The iron curtain is closing again, but this time we are the ones who are closing it,' an Austrian diplomat observed glumly a few weeks ago. At the time, the remark struck me as a gross overstatement. Now I am not so sure.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON INSIGHT  </P> <P> BUSH BLITZ READIED: President Bush is planning a last-minute campaign blitz to  help GOP candidates just before the Nov. 6 election. The White House has  reserved the last five days before the balloting for political travel by the  President, but will not decide which states he will visit until almost the last  minute. Poll-watchers will be sifting through the data to see where Bush can  help most.  </P> <P> High on Bush's likely list are two races for governor -- the Pete Wilson-Dianne  Feinstein campaign in California , which polls show is a dead heat, and the  Lawton Chiles-Bob Martinez contest in Florida, where Republican Martinez, the  incumbent, is believed to be catching up with Chiles, a former Democratic  senator.  </P> <P> A WHITE HOUSE DIVIDED?: John H. Sununu's unspoken prohibition against public  backbiting by staffers in the executive mansion may be about to backfire -- on  the President's chief of staff himself. There's growing resentment among White  House staffers that the former New Hampshire governor didn't warn Bush in  advance about the likely unpopularity of the budget summit agreement that he  and Budget Director Richard G. Darman negotiated. Critics say the  often-irascible chief of staff -- himself sold on the merits of the agreement  -- kept opposing views away from the President. Sununu has publicly rejected  such charges, blaming Congress for shying away from a meritorious package. And  Bush has expressed confidence in his staff chief. But restoring the  once-vaunted harmony in the staff will be a difficult task.  </P> <P> GOLDEN VIC: Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento) has had a change of heart and will  accept a job as head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee after  the November election, Capitol insiders say. Fazio, the respected vice chairman  of the party's House caucus, initially had forsworn any interest in the post,  but sources said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) has persuaded him to  reconsider. The stakes are high as the party approaches the redrawing of new  congressional districts after the 1990 census.  </P> <P> Fazio is the Democratic point man on reapportionment. As such, his political  action committee, IMPAC 2000, has raised millions of dollars to assist party  candidates nationwide and defeat redistricting initiatives in California that  were anathema to Democrats. "You need a prolific fund-raiser, an expert on  redistricting and somebody with some stature," says a Hill staffer familiar  with the behind-the-scenes machinations. "Vic is golden."  </P> <P> JAPAN REPORTEDLY IRKED: Japan is said to be fuming because President Bush has  appointed Vice President Dan Quayle to be the head of the U.S. delegation  attending the coronation of Emperor Akihito in mid-November. Although Quayle  technically has sufficient rank, Tokyo had been hoping for someone more  "substantial" -- such as Secretary of State James A. Baker III -- Japanese  sources say.  </P> <P> EVENHANDED: Newly installed Supreme Court Associate Justice David H. Souter  sends senators shaking their heads in wonder by visiting each member of the  Senate Judiciary Committee -- even those who opposed his nomination -- to thank  them for considering him. Souter tells former adversaries that he hopes to earn  their confidence in the months ahead.  </P></p>

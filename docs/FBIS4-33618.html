			<p>BFN     [Text] Peruvian Air Force [FAP] spokesmen have asserted  that there is no express ban on U.S. Air Force "AWACS" and  "Orion" planes overflying Peruvian territory, as was stated in  U.S. press reports.    The reports state that the alleged measure is a Peruvian  "reprisal" to the U.S. decision to suspend the supply of  information collected by these aircraft which is very necessary  for the FAP to intercept traffickers' planes.    The consulted sources stated that the problem is simply that  the U.S. South Command has not requested permission to enter  Peruvian airspace.    Under international laws, no country can prohibit air  traffic  over its territory. All that is necessary is to request a permit  and to state the route that will be followed.    The sources stated that the antinarcotic agreement, the part  concerning the FAP, is still in force and this is why the radar  sent by the Panama-based U.S. South Command is still in  Yurimaguas. Although this radar is obsolete, whenever it is not  out of order it is of some help to the Tucano aircraft in  intercepting traffickers' planes.    FAP spokesmen admitted that the "electronic intelligence"  supplied by U.S. "AWACS" and "Orion" is of vital importance for  the interdiction operations against traffickers' planes and  without their participation the Air Force's operations would not  be as effective.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's proposal also provides certain exemptions to the restrictions on importing nonconforming small SI engines. These include exemptions for repairs and alterations, testing, precertification, display, national security, hardship, small SI engines greater than 20 original production years old, and certain small SI engines proven to be identical, in all material respects, to their corresponding United States certified versions. These exemptions would also include the exclusion of nonconforming engines used solely in competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is not proposing to include provisions for a catalyst control program for small SI engines. The catalyst control program for motor vehicles consists of a special provision for catalyst-equipped vehicles to be operated in countries where the catalyst may be poisoned by the use of leaded fuel. In the on-highway catalyst control program, owners may either have the catalyst removed while the vehicle is operated outside of the United States or, if the vehicle is driven only in countries that have a wide availability of unleaded gasoline, demonstrate by using a plumbtesmo test that the vehicle was not operated on leaded fuel. EPA is not proposing a catalyst control program for small SI engines because EPA does not expect that U.S. certified small SI engines equipped with catalysts will be used in countries that do not have a wide availability of unleaded fuel and then imported into the United States. Additionally, EPA has no knowledge of the extent to which catalysts will be used on Phase 1 small SI engines. EPA requests comments on the absence of a catalyst control program and the need for such a program for Phase 1 engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, EPA is not proposing to include a provision for small SI engine Designated Canadian Importer (DCI). EPA's motor vehicle import program has a special provision in which DCIs may import and sell Canadian vehicles that were manufactured to be identical in all material respects to U.S. certified counterparts. Because EPA has no indication that Canada will adopt EPA's Phase 1 small SI engine standards, engines imported from Canada into the United States will likely be nonconforming engines and thus would not be eligible to be imported by a small SI engine DCI. Consequently, EPA expects that provisions for small SI engine DCI are unnecessary. EPA requests comment on the absence of a DCI program and the need for such a program for Phase 1 engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Importation regulations are joint regulations between EPA and the United States Department of the Treasury (Customs Service). The citation for United States Customs Service, Department of Treasury regulations governing import requirements is reserved. The citation will be inserted upon promulgation by the United States Customs Service of the applicable regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 21. Defect Reporting and Voluntary Recall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing that a manufacturer of small SI engines file a defect information report whenever a manufacturer identifies the existence of a specific emission-related defect in 25 or more engines in a single engine family manufactured in the same model year. However, no report would need to be filed if the defect was corrected prior to the sale of the affected engines to the ultimate purchaser. These proposed reporting requirements are similar to the requirements found in the on-highway program. EPA is currently revising the on-highway reporting program and new regulations will shortly be proposed. The new regulations may encompass both on-highway and the nonroad sector.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also proposing that individual manufacturers establish, when appropriate, voluntary recall programs. EPA is proposing limited guidelines which engine manufacturers would follow when undertaking such a program. EPA invites comments on how such a voluntary program might be effectively structured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 22. Emission Defect Warranty Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing that engine manufacturers provide an emission warranty for the first two years of engine use. The two-year warranty period was adopted from California's lawn and garden regulations to reduce the burden on manufacturers of administering two different warranty programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

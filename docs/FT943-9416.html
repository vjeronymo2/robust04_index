			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Further rises for Esab shares Shares in Esab yesterday rose further ahead of Charter's bid price amid speculation that the UK industrial group would raise its offer. Esab B shares rose SKr5 to SKr360. Senior Charter executives yesterday met Swedish shareholders whose rejection of the offer has derailed the UK group's intention to take complete control. 'There is still room for us to get a better price and for them to get a good deal,' said one shareholder. The deadline for the offer is Friday.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Jump in Brazilian inflation Brazil's inflation rate has risen alarmingly, leading to calls for government action before the country's new currency, the Real, is tainted like its many predecessors by spiralling price rises. The private FIPE institute said yesterday that prices rose 3.17 per cent in October, compared to only 0.82 per cent in September. The acceleration in inflation was blamed on higher rent, food and beverage prices. Inflation is expected to continue at about 3 per cent in November as companies raise prices ahead of Christmas and in response to a drought. Some economists fear that at these levels of inflation, companies and consumers will revert to monthly price rises to keep up, a practice the Real currency was designed to curb. Monthly inflation reached 50 per cent before the Real was launched in July.</p>

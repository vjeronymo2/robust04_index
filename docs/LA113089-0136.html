			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES;  </P> <P> PLANS TO CUT DOWN REDWOODS PROTESTED  </P> <P> Environmental activists and sympathetic politicians rallied to criticize a Los  Angeles-based company's plans to cut down the world's largest remaining  privately owned virgin redwood forest. Several dozen demonstrators gathered at  the Westwood headquarters of Maxxam Corp., which was criticized for  over-harvesting redwood forests to pay off debt incurred during its hostile  1986 takeover of the Pacific Lumber Co. At issue is a Humboldt County redwood  grove known as the Headwaters Forest. The Natural Resources Defense Council,  Sierra Club, and Assemblymen Tom Hayden (D-West Los Angeles) and Byron D. Sher  (D-Palo Alto) said Pacific Lumber Co. has accelerated plans to fell that stand  and others to avoid restrictions proposed in an initiative they are trying to  qualify for the November, 1990, ballot. The initiative, called the California  Environmental Protection Act of 1990, will be the subject of a  petition-gathering drive starting next week.  </P></p>

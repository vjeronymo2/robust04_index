			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Higher education quality 'at risk' HIGHER education expansion has not been fully funded and educational quality is at risk, says a report published today by university vice-chancellors. Government policy has increased the number of students in higher education by 46 per cent in the past four years. Universities have taken measures to increase their income; funds raised from industry for research have risen by 70 per cent in real terms over the past seven years. But the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals, publishing its annual statistics, said other figures showed that funding was inadequate. Libraries have suffered a 16 per cent spending cut in real terms over the last seven years, and there are now 28,000 too few library study spaces. Even if student intake stays at its present level, another 55,000 library spaces will be needed in the next two years. Several universities have also endured sharp drops in liquidity. According to the most reliable measure, Exeter University's total liquid assets would only pay for total expenditure for two days, while Keele could continue for four. St David's in Lampeter, Dyfed, and Heriot-Watt, Glasgow, are shown as having negative liquid assets. The London School of Economics, which earlier this year suggested that funding cuts might force it to raise 'top-up' fees from students, has seen its liquid reserves fall from 111 days of expenditure in 1989-90 to only 17 days in 1991-92. The figures also confirm a rise in graduate unemployment and a slight increase in the proportion of students completing their degrees, from 86.9 per cent to 87.1 per cent. Unemployment rates were lowest for medicine (0.2 per cent), and highest for librarianship (28.9 per cent) and architecture (23.1 per cent). Once the mix of subjects was taken into account, Birkbeck College, London, had the lowest rate of unemployment, followed by Oxford. Eleven universities had a lower rate of unemployment than Cambridge, including Belfast, Lancaster, Hull, Nottingham and York.

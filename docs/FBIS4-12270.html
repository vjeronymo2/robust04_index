			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Sever Plotzker: "There Will No War Over </F> Water"]    [Text] Once again they threaten us with war over the  Middle East water. This time the threats are made by  entrepreneurs who wish to set up a project for desalinizing  water in Israel. According to them, the project would cost some  $3 billion, and apparently not less than $5 billion.    The project may well be very profitable, but please, stop  scaring us by saying that a water shortage would lead to war.  Economists are not familiar with the term shortage separated  from the notion of price. Shortage, they say, is always  relative -- it is related to the price of the commodity in  question. For example, when the price of gold was $12 an ounce,  there was a terrible shortage of it on the world markets. At  $660 an ounce, there was an enormous oversupply. Eventually, the  forces of the market created a balance.    The same holds true for any commodity: gold, water, or oil.  The oil lesson is the most studied and the most outstanding  example. In the spring of 1981, an oil barrel went for $60 (in  1994 prices) on the free market. Since then, the price of oil  dropped by 75 percent. Today you can buy a barrel for $14.  What happened?    The high prices of oil led to worldwide searches for it,  from  the North Sea to the China Sea, not to mention the oil drills on  the Tel Aviv stock exchange. Worldwide proven oil reserves have  doubled (!) despite pumping and consumption.    The high prices motivated oil consumers and energy producers  to save by any possible means. Energy conservation was  discovered as a new source of wealth for the nations.    New free markets of all types of oil were created. OPEC, the  oil producers cartel, began losing its power. Oil-producing  countries started cheating, producing and selling more than they  had agreed to. They discovered the appealing charm of the free  market, where you are king if you sell your oil at $.001 less  than the agreed-upon price.    And we have not yet mentioned the secret oil treasures of  Russia, the Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan, only a little  of which has been uncovered.    The case of the oil shortage is important for us to  understand that there is no such thing as "water shortage," just  as there never was an oil shortage. Furthermore, unlike oil,  water can be recycled.    The real economic question, therefore, is whether it would  be  possible in the future to supply most of the amount of water in  demand while maintaining a "reasonable" price -- that is, a  price that would not cause entire production fields to collapse,  would preserve a good public health system, and would not  financially devastate the poor water consumers. The answer to  all of the above is positive.    Water conservation in our region has enormous potential.  Just by preventing waste, promoting efficient use, and  improving water pipes, we could reduce all types of water  consumption by 30-40 percent without seriously harming anything.    Water desalination could prove very profitable. Desalination  techniques are constantly improving and production costs keep  falling; hence, water prices will constantly drop. Small- and  medium-size desalination plants are profitable already at this  time.    Consumption of purified water -- which is cheap and has  almost unlimited sources -- is expected to rise. Here too,  technologies constantly improve.    There will be no "war over water" in the Middle East, and  peace between us and our neighbors will not rise or fall over  the water issue, which is economic and technical.    The problem of water shortage will be solved if it is dealt  with by economic experts and engineers, and not by politicians  and lobbyists.</p>

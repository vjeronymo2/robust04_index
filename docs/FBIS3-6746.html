Recalling that the puppets mercilessly cracked down upon the  struggle of students affiliated with the Eastern Seoul district  Federation of General Student Councils including Hanyang and  Konkuk Universities against agricultural market opening and the  anti-American struggle of students under the Pusan-South  Kyongsang Provincial Federation of General Student Councils, the  analyst of the paper says:    This clearly shows once again the vicious and treacherous  nature of the "civilian"-veiled Kim Yong-sam puppet clique.    The anti-American struggle of students is an eruption of  their resolute will not to tolerate the U.S. moves of aggression  and war which are becoming all the more unscrupulous and  virulent with the passage of times.    The righteous struggle of students that must be praised as  patriotic is suppressed by the Kim Yong-sam group which styles  itself "civilian". Such thing can be committed only by the  despicable pro-American flunkeyist traitors who are prolonging  their days by clinging to the coattail of the United States,  their master.    Kim Yong-sam is a rank traitor who has served the United  States like his "grandfather" and took the "presidential" seat  with the U.S. approval. So, he is wielding the sword at the  patriotic movement for national independence and unhesitatingly  committed such anti-national crimes as desperately opposing the  principle of national independence at the working contact for  the exchange of special envoys and leading it to a rupture.    If a disaster is to be avoided, the "civilian" poodle, the  guide to the robber, must be removed together with the intruder.</p>

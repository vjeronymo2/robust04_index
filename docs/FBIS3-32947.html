			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vanessa Rios from Santa Fe de Bogota; from the </F> "Global TV News" newscast]    [Text] Upon arrival at Catam Air Force Base in Santa Fe de  Bogota, President Alberto Fujimori was greeted at Narino Palace  by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria. The welcome ceremony was  held in the main courtyard of the presidential palace.  Fujimori's accompanying delegation is headed by Alfonso  Bustamante, president of the Council of Ministers and industry,  foreign trade, tourism, and integration minister, three  additional ministers, and members of the Democratic Constituent  Congress. During a news conference held after the welcoming  ceremony, Fujimori answered questions for Colombian reporters on  the antidrug-trafficking struggle, violence, and human rights in  Peru.    [Begin recording] [Fujimori] We are waging a battle against  terrorism from which we cannot withdraw. Despite certain  isolated incidents--as a matter of fact, very condemnable  incidents in which members of the Armed Forces are involved--we  cannot risk our antiterrorist strategy or Armed Forces; that is  basic. Furthermore, those who have expressed their differences  or disagreement with this law are those who have participated in  former governments in which flagrant cases were also handled by  military courts. The best example of this would be the killings  in the jails when approximately 300 prisoners were shot in the  temple and killed. This matter was handled by a military court.    There were also cases involving the killing of peasants  during the early eighties; a military court also handled these  cases. One of the few cases handled by a civilian court was the  case of General Noel [not further identified]. It took 10 years  for the civilian court to hand down a sentence in this case--10  years. I am sure the deep-rooted goal is to punish those  responsible for this horrible crime, and I know they will be  punished. The people want this, and this will happen in a few  weeks.    [Unidentified reporter] Your justice minister has said in  Geneva 95 percent of the terrorist leaders are in jail. Is it  true the other 5 percent want to sit down and talk to you to end  terrorism in your country? What would you tell former Peruvian  President Alan Garcia if you were to meet him here in Colombia?  What would you tell him on behalf of the people and government  of Peru?    [Fujimori] There has been no contact with that 5 percent of  the terrorist leaders who are at large. Our intelligence  organizations will make these contacts, which will be aimed at  capturing them, not talking with them.    Regarding your second question, I will refrain from  answering. I am more concerned about helping Peru out of its  situation of underdevelopment and economic crisis.    [Reporter] How does it feel to be the initiator, at the  world  level, of the word Fujimori-style coup [Fujimorazo] as an  unconventional procedure to defend democracy?    [Fujimori] I do not know [chuckles] what I feel, but I am  sure I did something that was necessary for Peru and for  regional security. Perhaps the process is not called a  Fujimori-style coup, of Fujimorifazo, as the Brazilians say, but  it is a process in which the people express their discontent for  the inefficiency of the political systems that have led most of  the people to poverty, underdevelopment, and misery. [end  recording]    During the afternoon, President Fujimori was greeted by the  diplomatic corps at the Foreign Ministry, located in the San  Carlos Palace, which once had been Simon Bolivar's home.  Fujimori also placed a wreath at Simon Bolivar's monument and  received the keys to the city from the mayor of Santa Fe de  Bogota.</p>

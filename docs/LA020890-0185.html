			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FLORES OPENS CAMPAIGN FOR SECRETARY OF STATE  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who recently helped sink a key  provision in the city's proposed ethics-in-government code, said Wednesday that  she is running for secretary of state to promote election and political reform.  </P> <P> "The secretary of state is our state's chief elections officer, and because of  a lack of state leadership, California has the most confusing patchwork of  campaign election laws anywhere in the nation," the three-term councilwoman  said at a news conference outside City Hall.  </P> <P> Flores, 53, a Republican who represents the city's 15th Council District, said  she decided early this week to run after receiving encouragement from  supporters, including Republican gubernatorial candidate Sen. Pete Wilson. She  accused Democratic incumbent Secretary of State March Fong Eu of having created  "a vacuum of leadership in this office."  </P></p>

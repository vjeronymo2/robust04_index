			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Vakhrin report: "Will There Nonetheless Be a </F> Referendum?"]    [Text] Kostroma -- Kostroma's "Greens" are stepping up  their onslaught on the local administration. They have held a  rally demanding that a precise date be set for a referendum on  the future of construction work on the Kostroma AES [nuclear  electric power station].    A year ago local opponents of the construction near the city  of Buy collected the number of signatures needed to demand a  referendum in the oblast. But the leaders of the government  ignored it and they are today pretending that "nothing of the  kind is happening." That is understandable since the local  authorities are pininng their hopes of major financial  injections in the oblast's economy on the construction work. At  any rate that is what the Ministry of Atomic Energy has  promised. But the oblast environmental movement "Life" has no  intention of backing down, and Oblast Governor Valeriy Arbuzov  will evidently have to go to court in the near future as  defendant in a case brought by the "Greens," who are charging  him with opposing the holding of a referendum.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- The Central Standing  Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyon) sent an appeal to the compatriots affiliated  with the "ROK Residents Association in Japan" (Mindan) on May  12, urging it to promote national unity for defense of national  dignity and vital rights of the Koreans in Japan.    Noting that the persecution and suppression of Koreans in  Japan and Chongnyon organisations by the Japanese reactionaries  today are by no means confined to Chongnyon, the appeal says:    Militarism does not distinguish between Chongnyon and  "Mindan" and between the North and the South of Korea. We  cannot and must not allow the past history of humiliation and  shame to be repeated, falling a prey to the malicious scheme of  the Japanese militarist forces to sow discord within our nation.    There is only one way for the Korean nationals in Japan to  survive, defending national dignity and rights--a close unity of  the nation.    We are sending this appeal to you, loudly asserting that it  is high time all the Koreans in Japan closely united, sharply  watching the heinous militarist ambition of the Japanese  reactionary forces against Korea and their possible nation  alienating maneuvers.    Let us all unite as fellow countrymen, irrespective of isms  and views and affiliation, defend the dignity of the nation and  the vital rights of the compatriots in Japan and guarantee the  future of our dear younger generations.    Let us achieve national reunification in the 1990s without  fail by uniting as fellow countrymen of the same ancestry,  priding ourselves on our long history spanning 50 centuries.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Three reports in Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ and  one in Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 20 January carry  data presented by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] on the number  of incidents and casualties during military activity in 1993.    A report from the Knesset by Gid'on Alon and Tzvi Zrahya on  page A6 of HA'ARETZ cites a report presented yesterday to the  Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee by Major General  Yoram Ya'ir, head of the IDF Personnel Branch. According to the  report, "45 IDF soldiers were killed in enemy activity last  year; 26 of them were killed in the security zone in south  Lebanon and 19 were killed in the territories of Judaea,  Samaria, and the Gaza Strip." The figures indicate a  "significant rise in the number of IDF casualties from enemy  activity; 24 soldiers were killed in 1992, and 11 in 1991."    Gen. Ya'ir further reports that, compared to 37 fatalities  due to accidents in 1992, 17 IDF soldiers were killed in  accidents in 1993, according to the following breakdown: seven  soldiers were killed in military traffic accidents, five in  operational accidents, three in gun and ammunition accidents,  one in a labor accident, and one other was electrocuted. "Gen.  Ya'ir noted with satisfaction that not a single soldier was  killed in training accidents last year (as compared to 10  fatalities in 1992)." The report cites Gen. Ya'ir as saying  that "despite the efforts the IDF has made to prevent suicides,  38 soldiers committed suicide last year (31 standing Army, four  career soldiers, and three reservists)." Ya'ir notes that in  only two of the cases, a direct link was established between the  suicide and the soldier's military service.    Knesset correspondent Gabi Bron and military correspondent  Arye Kiesel write on page 13 of YEDI'OT AHARONOT: "In 1993,  there was a dramatic rise in reports of 'near casualty' in IDF  accidents: 1,080, as compared to several hundred in 1992." The  report further says that "in 1993, there was a dramatic drop in  the number of aerial accidents in the IDF, when compared to the  dozens of such accidents in the 1970's and 1980's. The damage  caused by fatal aerial accidents last year stands at $14  million, as compared with $170 million in damages by the end of  the 1970's."    Citing data presented by "officers at the Central Command  summing up last year's statistics," HA'ARETZ military  correspondent Eytan Rabin writes on page A5: "In 1993, there  was a rise in the number of armed terror attacks against Israeli  targets in the territories. At the same time, there was a  48-percent drop in the total number of terror attacks, as  compared to 1992." Rabin says that "the majority of terror  attacks in the territories in 1993 was directed against the  Jewish settlers, and 15 of the 20 military and civilian  fatalities were killed in armed attacks." The report cites the  following figures for last year: there were 994 attacks against  IDF troops and collaborators, as compared with 1,917 in 1992;  16,253 stone-throwing incidents and riots were registered in  1993, compared with 19,627 in 1992; and in 1993, the IDF  arrested 4,410 Palestinian residents.    The correspondent adds that, leading last year's armed  terror  attacks, were fugitives from the various terror organizations.  He adds that the security forces managed to foil "a large  number of attacks by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. The  number of these attacks rose after the closure was imposed on  the territories." The report adds that most of the Hamas  fugitives were killed in IDF operations or suicide attacks last  year. The report adds that "153 incidents in which settlers  rioted were registered in 1993. Of them, seven included the use  of fire arms, and damage was caused to 34 cars and 10 houses."    Eytan Rabin cites another IDF document on page A1 of  HA'ARETZ, which says that in 1993, 400 Palestinians were hurt in  the West Bank; 64 of them were killed, 50 were seriously  injured, and 286 were lightly to moderately injured. "The  document indicates that between July and December 1993, eight  Palestinian children under 10 years of age were shot by IDF  troops, and at least two of them were killed." "An internal  Central Command document" adds the following breakdown of  Palestinian casualties of IDF fire: "21 aged between 11 and 16;  49 aged between 17 and 22; 30 aged between 23 and 35; and 23  were over 35 years old; at least two were over 80."    "IDF data for 1993 indicates that 13 Israeli civilians were  killed in shooting incidents in the territories, three were  seriously injured, five were moderately wounded, and 19 suffered  light injuries."</p>

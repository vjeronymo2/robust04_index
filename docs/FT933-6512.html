			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Patten rejects fears of university shortages THE number of school leavers unable to find university places is likely to be much lower than feared, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, forecast yesterday. Mr Patten, who has returned to work after a six-week illness, said the outlook was 'going to be nothing like as gloomy as some people have predicted'. Commentators have suggested that thousands of students will fail to win places on arts courses because of a 30 per cent cut imposed by the government in tuition funding Mr Patten said many universities still had vacancies on arts courses, including English places at 27 universities and geography at 26 universities. He also advised students to consider attending one of the 350 colleges of further education, 131 of which offered degree courses. He defended the funding cut, which was intended to encourage students to switch from arts to science courses. Speaking on BBC radio he said: 'Can we afford to be a country which has too few people going into science? That strikes me as the major problem at the moment.' He was concerned that only 64,000 students took mathematics at A-level - the main examination for 18-year-olds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - this year, compared to 82,000 in 1989. Only 34,000 took physics at A-level, compared to 47,000 in 1989. Mr Patten said: 'That is a pretty substantial problem. It's not purely a political problem, it is a marketing problem - trying to persuade children that science is interesting and rewarding.' He rejected suggestions that his political credibility had been damaged by a series of retreats on policy issues following protests from teachers. He said his strategy had received full support in the recent report by Sir Ron Dearing, who heads the government's review of the national curriculum. Following the report the government abandoned detailed curriculums for most subjects and withdrew plans to publish league tables of schools based on pupils' performance. Mr Patten congratulated pupils and teachers on a record number of high grades in GCSE passes - in contrast to his suggestion last year that improved results were a reflection of lower standards. Examination results released yesterday showed that more than half the 5m entrants in England, Wales and Northern Ireland achieved A, B or C grades. The percentage of these grades - the equivalent of the former O-level pass - rose by 1.1 per cent to 52.4 per cent. Mr Patten said pupils and teachers could 'take particular pride in the fact that this year's papers have been marked against the much more stringent standards laid down in the code of practice for the examining boards which I announced last January'.</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOWN HALL MEETING FOR LIGHT RAIL PLAN  </P> <P> It must be very clear by now that Westsiders and other Los Angeles citizens are  keenly interested in the purchase of the rail lines currently for sale to local  counties surrounding Southern California. From all the letters written recently  in response to the grossly slanted Rancho Park "community meeting" in  September, we can see it is necessary to hold more forums on the subject. It is  especially important that these forums present both sides of the issue.  </P> <P> As suggested in an earlier letter, just such a town hall meeting will be held  at the Palms Junior High School auditorium on the evening of Nov. 16. The  meeting will host a panel of five people representing both pro and con on light  rail for Los Angeles. I suggest that the many hundreds of concerned people who  care about this issue attend. The event is sponsored and endorsed by homeowners  groups, senior citizens and environmentalists, to mention but a few. At this  meeting half the evening will be devoted to dialogue between those attending  and the panelists. Any other experts who wish to attend and act as resource  people are encouraged to contact the Westside Greens at (213) 31G-reens.  </P> <P> LILLIAN LASKIN  </P> <P> West Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ole Magnus Rapp report: "Russian-Norwegian Railway Being </F> Considered"]    [Text] Tromso -- A railroad between Murmansk and Kirkenes  will be discussed when Russia's and Norway's foreign ministers  meet today.    A railroad is now high on the list of wants of Norwegian and  Russian industry and commerce. From the terminus in Nikel it is  only a few kilometers to Kirkenes. Industry and commerce also  want there to be more that is concrete to emerge from all the  fine-sounding solemn speeches. There has been a good increase  in trading cooperation since the establishment of the Barents  Sea region.    "We fully agree that the time for talking is now over. Now  the concrete results are starting to come," said Knut Eirik  Olsen, head of information at the Barents Sea Region Secretariat.    The cooperation between the various regions involved takes  place on several levels, from ministerial to shopkeeper level.  In 1993, 134 million kroner of the Foreign Ministry's East  European package totaling 416 million kroner was used to  stimulate cooperation between Norway and northwestern Russia.  The largest part of this money went to industrial cooperation,  infrastructure projects, and environmental protection. The  Foreign Ministry is intent on continuing major economic  investment in regional cooperation.    Kvaerner Kimek A/S, a ship repair company in Kirkenes, was  an  early player in the field and is among those companies that have  made the most progress. Russian ships want Western maintenance  and at present the company is investing 300 million kroner in a  new covered shipyard installation. The company now has plans  for a shipyard in Murmansk for breaking up ships and military  installations.    The Telecommunications Authority has also paved the way for  3,500 Norwegian telephone lines to both Murmansk and Arkhangelsk  provinces. Russian companies, which want closer contacts with  the West are now acquiring such links.    The Russian banking system is unable to keep up with  developments. A money transfer between East and West can take  months, and this creates major problems for industrial  cooperation. Den norske Bank and Sparebanken Nord-Norge are  helping their Russian colleagues with the introduction of  Western banking systems.    Norwegian entrepreneurs see a possible market on the Kola  Peninsula and have received project support from the Foreign  Ministry. Possibilities are also seen by Agricultural  Cooperation in Northern Norway, the National Association of  Norwegian Reindeer-Farming Lapps, the Sea Research Institute,  the State Data Processing Center, Tromso University, and many  others.    So far, cooperation in the field of fisheries has had the  greatest volume. Half the fish landed in Finnmark in 1993 was  delivered by Russian vessels. A number of fish industry  companies in Tromso and Finnmark are currently becoming  dependent on Russian raw materials, at the same time as Russian  fishing boat operators are dependent on access to Western  currency.    "Everything is changing very quickly, and industrial leaders  in Russia have had to adapt themselves in a relatively short  period of time from communist rule to market forces," consultant  Roald Johansen of Business Competence in Hammerfest said. The  organization helps Norwegian industry to find cooperation  partners in the East, and to avoid the worst traps: "The  Russians think that the Norwegians are not concrete enough.  They want quick decisions and as few solemn speeches as  possible."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Likud Knesset Member Ari'el Sharon urges  Hebron's Jewish settlers and their supporters to conduct a  quiet, nonviolent, and unarmed struggle to secure their  residence in Hebron, if the government decides to evacuate them.  He was interviewed by our party affairs correspondent Menashe  Raz:    [Begin recording] [Sharon] I think every effort should be  made to avert an evacuation. I would like to urge all Israelis  to engage in passive resistance to the evacuation. I am against  harming IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers or the security  forces in any way. I am speaking about passive resistance by  tens of thousands of people, who should come empty-handed -- I  stress, empty-handed, without any weapons whatsoever, because  provocation of any kind should be prevented -- people who should  persistently engage in resistance. If, God forbid, they manage  to evacuate a certain place, tens of thousands of people should  return there and resist the evacuation in a passive manner. In  my view, right now this is the only, the ultimate move that can  be undertaken against the insane actions of the government which  is surrendering to PLO dictums -- although it says the decision  was its own -- by evacuating Jews. [passage omitted]    [Raz] Will you be there yourself, when the time comes?    [Sharon] I will be there in person. [end recording]</p>

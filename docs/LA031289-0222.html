			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REPRODUCTIVE CURBS  </P> <P> Similar to the child who cannot come to grips with a difficult problem, our  government and its people sidestep the major issue behind the minor ones. Lost  in an ever-mounting sea of bureaucracy, we try to solve problems like  pollution, traffic congestion, housing shortages, crime and drug abuse. These  problems can never be properly dealt with until we the people elect public  officials who have the intestinal fortitude to deal with the crisis situation  of overpopulation.  </P> <P> Why can't we face the fact that we must control our reproductive urges? We had  better take responsible action to slow the inevitable decline of the United  States. As a starter, we could try tax incentives for the childless wage  earner.  </P> <P> CRAIG EYERICK  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

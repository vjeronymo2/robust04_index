About  3,000 students demanded an audience with President Nicephore  Soglo to present their grievances, an AFP correspondent said.    At least one student was wounded during the clashes and two  demonstrators were arrested. An earlier demonstration took  place on 17 March when 3,000 students joined the march in the  center of Cotonou.    Beninese students are demanding the doubling of their  current  scholarships in order to cushion the impact of the devaluation  of the CFA franc that took place on 11 January. They are also  protesting the expulsion of two of their comrades who are union  leaders from the university accused of triggering disturbances  on the Calavi Campus (15 km north-east of Cotonou) at the  beginning of last month. Since then, the teachers of the  National University of Benin had embarked on a strike to demand  the reinforcement of security on the campus.</p>

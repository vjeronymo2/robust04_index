Translated into the  language of specific action, this means an immediate cease-fire  without prior conditions, guaranteeing the safety of the  civilian population of Nagorno-Karabakh, and deciding at the  negotiating table who is to repay debts, to whom, how much, and  how.    President Levon Ter-Petrosyan is right to believe that he  has  the support of all Armenia on this issue. The republic, cut off  from the outside world by a long-standing blockade, is barely  able to keep its economy afloat. The war in Karabakh has in one  way or another affected the well-being of every Armenian family,  and people realize that it cannot go on endlessly.    "We have managed to strike off the agenda the status of  Nagorno-Karabakh and focus entirely on the main problem: How  can peace be achieved?", Aram Abramyan, the Armenian president's  press secretary, told IZVESTIYA. "The two ways proposed by the  CSCE and Russia are equally acceptable to us. The advantage of  the Russian scenario is that it contains a specific mechanism to  prevent the resumption of hostilities -- to whit, the  introduction of internationally-mandated peacekeeping forces  into the conflict zone. Both plans of action proposed to the  warring parties have won the approval of Stepanakert and  Yerevan, but they were rejected by Azerbaijan. The conflict in  Nagorno-Karabakh has today reached the stage where its peaceful  resolution depends not only on the will of the warring parties,  but also on that of the world community."    Armenia's political parties are unhappy that Yerevan has not  made up its mind to recognize the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic  [NKR]. Armenia's influential "Ramkavar-Azatakan"  Liberal-Democratic Party is in favor of recognizing the NKR as  an independent sovereign state. In the opinion of party leader  Ruben Mirzakhanyan, this step would make it possible to unravel  one of the tightest knots of the conflict. It is a question of  the decision of the then Armenian SSR [Soviet Socialist  Republic] Supreme Soviet of 1 December 1989 declaring  Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast [NKAO] an inalienable part of  Armenia.    It was clear at the time that this decision was as futile as  the Azerbaijani authorities' ensuing decision to dissolve the  NKAO. However, having effectively changed nothing, both  documents are still formally in force to this day. Yerevan's  official recognition of the NKR would, in Ruben Mirzkhanyan's  opinion, remove the problem.    "We do not believe that the process of settling the conflict  is becoming more productive as the group of international  mediators expands," he said. In his opinion, this group should  be confined to the warring parties' immediate neighbors --  Turkey, Iran, and, undoubtedly, Russia.    "We have very serious disagreements with the authorities in  our approach to the Nagorno-Karabakh problem," Vagan Oganesyan,  one of the leaders of the "Dashnaktsutyun" opposition party,  told IZVESTIYA. "We cannot in particular see whether we are  complying with the Supreme Soviet decision for Nagorno-Karabakh  to accede to Armenia or whether we agree with its proclaiming  itself the NKR? If Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh are in actual  fact a single state, Azerbaijan is in effect at war with  Armenia, whereas the latter does not acknowledge itself to be a  state at war. "If we consider the NKR a separate state  formation, why do we not recognize the republic de jure?"  [quotation marks as published] Vagan Oganesyan wonders.    Vagan Oganesyan believes that Russia will play a crucial  role  in resolving the conflict and its participation in these affairs  is therefore far more preferable to mediation by any other  country or international organization.</p>

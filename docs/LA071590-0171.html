			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: FED MAY BE POISED TO EASE, BUT FOR THE WRONG REASONS  </P> <P> Nearly a quarter of a century ago, when it was becoming increasingly obvious  that the United States was slowly sinking into the quagmire of Vietnam, Sen.  George Aiken (R-Vt.) came up with an interesting idea that, if used at the  time, might have saved many lives -- not to mention millions of dollars. In a  speech on the Senate floor in October, 1966, he said we should declare that we  won the war and go home.  </P> <P> Today, a situation exists that calls for a similar recommendation. After years  of Federal Reserve battling against inflation, it appears that the economy is  in danger of sinking into recession.  </P> <P> Considering that the only inflation left is in services, because prices of most  consumer goods are actually falling, Aiken's suggestion seems to be applicable  to Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues at the Fed: Declare victory  over inflation, ease up on money and credit and let interest rates decline.  </P> <P> True, Greenspan acknowledged Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee that  the Fed is poised to ease interest rates. But he said such a move -- if it  comes -- would be in response to signs of a credit crunch among banks.  Greenspan said he didn't see any weakness in the economy that alone would  justify easing rates.  </P> <P> Such a view flies in the face of considerable evidence.  </P> <P> An easier money policy would seem to be especially needed now, because it  appears that there will be a tightening in fiscal policy related to a budgetary  accommodation. The accommodation is more likely in view of President Bush's  willingness to accept a tax increase.  </P> <P> Fiscal policy aside, it is clear that the Fed has won the war against the  portion of inflation it is capable of beating -- prices of goods -- and that it  has done so at the expense of knocking the goods sector flat on its back.  </P> <P> Prices of goods that we consumers pay fell in April, compared to March, after  the usual seasonal adjustments. And it fell again in May, compared to April.  That means in the last three months, consumer-goods inflation has been stopped  dead in its tracks.  </P> <P> If you want more evidence, look at the producer price index. Prices of raw  materials, excluding food and energy, are actually down over the past 12  months; they've been falling year-over-year since fall, 1989. And prices of  intermediate goods, the next stage of production, have been flat,  year-over-year, since the beginning of 1990.  </P> <P> It's not difficult to see why. Goods sales are falling. Retail sales declined  three months in a row, before rising slightly in June, the first time that has  happened since the last recession. Personal spending on goods very likely fell  in the second quarter, compared to a year ago. Only twice in the past 45 years  has such a drop not led to a recession.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, goods payrolls are down, with the decline in the past three  months one of the biggest for any three-month period since the last recession.  And while fewer people are engaged in production of goods than 10 years ago, at  the start of the 1980s, most of the recent downtrend reflects a slowdown in  output as goods producers seek to avoid a costly buildup of unwanted  inventories.  </P> <P> Construction is gasping for air. Home building is at its lowest rate since the  recession -- and a full 25% below the pace recorded 30 years ago. Meanwhile,  business spending on structures is no higher today than 16 years ago.  </P> <P> Even export growth, the bright spot in the economy, is beginning to dim. After  logging year-over-year gains of as much as 30% in early 1988, export growth has  throttled back to less than 5%.  </P> <P> On the other hand, service prices continue to rise at an annual rate of 5% --  the pace they've been clocked at since the beginning of the current expansion  nearly eight years ago. Looking at the reasons why provides additional  ammunition for those who feel that easier money is appropriate.  </P> <P> For one thing, services are labor-intensive. With unit labor costs climbing at  least 5% a year in this sector, it's hard for service industries to avoid  raising prices.  </P> <P> The hikes tend to stick because, unlike many goods, services tend to be  necessities. Consumers have little or no choice when it comes to paying the  tab.  </P> <P> Two good examples are the cost of medical care and education. For nearly 30  years, medical services have been rising twice as fast as the consumer price  index. In the past dozen years, the cost of education has ratcheted up 50%  faster than the CPI.  </P> <P> It seems obvious that for doctors and hospitals to stop raising fees and for  colleges to stop increasing tuition, the Fed would have to become so tight that  the weakness in the goods sector would spread -- and the entire economy would  sink into recession.  </P> <P> Not that the Fed isn't tight already. Bank reserves, the raw material that  banks use to make loans and investments, have risen only 2% the past three  years. This is the slowest 36-month rise since the three years ended February,  1958 (when the economy was in a recession), and compares to an average 36-month  rise of nearly 15% the past 43 years.  </P> <P> The broadest measure of the money supply, M3, is growing at its slowest  12-month pace in 20 years. For their part, real interest rates (rates adjusted  for inflation) remain well above what consumers and businesses can pay with  comfort.  </P> <P> Corporate profits are tumbling because most businesses can't raise prices  enough to cover rising costs in a weak economy. As a consequence, profit  margins are the lowest they've been since the last recession. And with dividend  payouts historically high relative to after-tax earnings, most firms have  little cash left to service their gigantic debt loads.  </P> <P> Since price-earnings ratios are already a third above average and interest  rates are high enough to be drawing money into banks, any widespread cuts in  dividends would seem to put stocks at risk of a substantial decline.  </P> <P> When Fed Chairman Greenspan was President Gerald R. Ford's chief economic  adviser, he started a campaign to Whip Inflation Now, and handed out WIN  buttons.  </P> <P> Maybe it's time for the Fed to realize it's time to move from WIN to LOSE (Lift  Our Sluggish Economy) so we can have a DRAW (Deliberate Recovery At Work).  </P></p>

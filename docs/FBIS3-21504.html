			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Arif Pasalic, Brigadier-General of the Army of </F> the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina: "Aerosol Carries Death"]    [Text] The aggressor has several times, through its  official representatives, announced the use of a new weapon that  was supposed to speed up the achievement of the set military  goal of the war. These announcements (the aim of which was to  frighten) have practically been actualized already.    The enemy started using the new weapon late last month. It  is an aerosol-type missile. The remains of such missiles were  found above the village of Buca Potok.    The analysis of the position of the missile parts, the  location of the strike, in the ballistic sense, has shown that  the missile was fired from Krivoglavci.    Considering that this is a new weapon in this war, we are  obliged to provide the public with specific information on what  kind of weapon is in question. Aerosol explosives were first  mentioned in literature as early as in 1960, and from 1966 there  were practical applications of aerosol explosives in the form of  bombs dropped from planes and helicopters. The term "aerosol"  means a heterogeneous mixture of air and solid or liquid  particles.    An aerosol explosive, in fact a mixture of volatile  hydrocarbons (ethylene-oxide and propylene-oxide), and aluminum  nitrate -- aluminum powder -- is already used in practice.  Soaps are used as cohesion material. As opposed to classical  solid explosives, the aerosol explosive has greater energy,  chemical reactions occur more easily during the explosion  process, the shock wave speed is greater, it has a lower level  of super-pressure, and it has a longer-lasting effect.    These explosion characteristics allow for a greater  destructive potential. During the explosion, the aerosol  explosion cloud enters every gap (above the shelter, below the  shelter, trees, and the shelter areas), and then explodes, the  explosion being powerful and long -- the wave is most frequently  lethal. The shock wave destroys lungs, pierces eardrums and  other organs, and the air bubbles often enter the circulatory  system (stopping in the heart or brain), which causes a quick  death. The shock wave of the explosion of a 200-kg aerosol  warhead causes death within a 60-meter diameter.    This kind of weapon is known to be possessed by the United  States (who used it in the Vietnam war), Russia, France, and  Israel, and it is very likely that China has also produced them.  The former JNA [Yugoslav National Army] was interested in  acquiring and producing this kind of weapon, but, despite  research conducted in the institutes (Vinca), it was not  possible to fully master the technology and production.  Considering the most abusive way of using such explosives, in  air bombs and missiles (the "FRY" has had difficulties with the  production of missile fuel), it may be concluded that the  weapons used did not originate, nor were they produced, on the  territory of the "FRY."    To launch an aerosol-type warhead, the Serb-Chetnik  aggressor  forces use the Grad missile system (produced in Russia -- the  Soviet Union). The analysis of the remains of the missile  showed that it had been produced very recently in the factories  and institutes of Russia, which indicates a specific breaking of  the embargo by the "FRY" and Russia. So far, some 10 such  missiles have been used on the frontlines in the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Judging from an analysis of past use of this weapon by the  Chetnik aggressors, it is likely that they will continue to use  the Grad missiles with aerosol warheads, and write primitive  messages on them, as is characteristic of them, and typical of  their senses and their fascist ideology ("We will fuck your  mothers, you Turks").</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Markets: Racy ratings in niche market - The Bottom Line Capita Group, the UK's largest provider of management services to the public sector, this week announced a streamlining of its structure. The group's market value has increased tenfold to Pounds 105m since flotation in 1989. It said the changes were designed to maximise the opportunities offered by the trend for local authorities and central government to privatise or 'outsource' an increasing number of functions. Capita - which started as a buy-out from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy - first offered consultancy and computer services and also collects council tax and business rates for some councils and pays benefit on their behalf. The group has decided to merge three subsidiaries, Telecom Capita, an information technology services company; Capita Managed Services, which offers finance outsourcing; and Capita Management, a 50-per-cent-owned joint venture with Serco, another contract management company. Capita Management uses computerised telephone systems to deal with sales and inquiries for personalised number plates on behalf of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. Since starting in October 1990, it has sold more than 200,000 number plates and raised more than Pounds 100m for the Treasury. Capita is paying a nominal sum for its partner's share in the joint venture, but will continue to share profits with Serco, which was floated in 1988. Its market value has since increased more than seven-fold to Pounds 148m. Serco was established in 1929 by RCA to service the US group's British cinemas, and was the subject of a management buy-out in 1987. This technical background is reflected in the group's current diverse range of activities, some 40 per cent of which is defence-related. Since 1964, Serco has operated the RAF's Fylingdales missile early-warning station in north Yorkshire, and the group is also involved in traffic management and air traffic control. Both Capita and Serco wish to avoid the fiercely competitive sectors, such as cleaning or security, which have been the target of other private contractors. The poor profit margins and low barriers to entry in these sectors have also proved difficult for BET, the business services group. Capita has been more successful in this respect, since most of its employees are white-collar and are involved in revenue-generating activities for which it can charge good rates. Serco's profit margin is more modest, at just over 5 per cent, reflecting its involvement in less specialist activities, such as maintaining buildings and sports complexes. This disparity is reflected in the relative performance of the two groups, although - as the chart shows - both have massively outperformed the market since flotation. The extent of the outperformance - particularly in the last two years - is perhaps the best reason for counselling caution to any prospective small investor at these share price levels. Both groups have a large and growing market, as outsourcing spreads from local authorities to the NHS and into the heart of central government. Both welcomed last month's announcement that most of the 144 government executive agencies will be opened up to private sector bids. The catch is that there are few quoted companies through which investment institutions can invest in this growing area, and the share price of both groups reflects the relative scarcity of the stock. Capita's shares are selling on a multiple of 35 times historic earnings, while Serco's are on more than 30 times. Such sky-high ratings leave little margin for disappointment. Both companies have achieved the high growth targets which they have set themselves, but the tender system means contracts have to be competed for again at regular intervals. Fund managers will be glad to have such potentially interesting small companies in their portfolios, but it would be a brave small investor who climbed aboard the bandwagon.</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOROLA FACES SALES BAN ON MICROCHIP  </P> <P> Motorola faces an immediate ban on its ability to sell its most popular  computer chip, the 68030 microprocessor, under a tentative ruling handed down  late Monday in the acrimonious patent infringement lawsuits between the U.S.  firm and Japan's Hitachi Ltd.  </P> <P> Three months ago, U.S. District Judge Lucius D. Bunton in Austin, Tex., ordered  Motorola to stop selling its flagship microprocessor as long as it infringed on  Hitachi's patent. However, Bunton immediately stayed the effect of his ruling  to allow for appeals.  </P> <P> On Monday, Bunton signaled his intention to lift the stay in a formal decision  expected today. That would effectively prevent Motorola from selling the chip  until the suits over the chip's patents are resolved. Analysts have said that  Bunton, who has publicly reprimanded both parties for failing to settle their  dispute out of court, has used his rulings to spur a speedier agreement over  the conflicting patents.  </P> <P> The 68030 microprocessor is the brains of many of Apple's Macintosh personal  computers, as well as systems made by Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard. An  Apple spokesman said late Monday that it was too early to know how the latest  development would affect its operations. Other companies could not be reached  for comment.  </P> <P> Although Motorola does not release sales figures for individual products,  analysts have said that the 68030 is probably its largest single source of  semiconductor revenue, contributing about $100 million in annual sales.  </P> <P> A Motorola spokesman said late Monday that the company intends to immediately  appeal the latest decision and seek a new delay of its effect. "We are dismayed  that Judge Bunton made this decision knowing full well that the two parties  have been engaged in earnest attempts to settle this matter," the company said  in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> The legal wrangling started in January, 1989, when Motorola sued Hitachi,  claiming that the Japanese company was using Motorola secrets in developing a  series of chips. Hitachi countersued, claiming that Motorola infringed on some  of its patents in the design for the 68030 microprocessor.  </P> <P> In his initial ruling in March, Bunton ruled that both parties had infringed on  the other's patents and levied fines against both. Bunton also ordered the  companies to stop selling the offending chips. Later he stayed the effect of  the ruling.  </P></p>

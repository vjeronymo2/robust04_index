			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Nigerian oil strike strengthens as senior staff stop work Senior staff in Nigeria's oil industry yesterday joined a week-long strike by junior workers as international oil companies struggled to maintain crude oil production, which averages about 2m barrels a day. Many members of Pengassan, the 12,000-strong union for senior employees, stayed away from work in the head offices of oil companies in Lagos and at the oilfields in the Niger delta. 'It is just a matter of time before production is affected,' said an official for one of the big oil producers yesterday. 'We cannot produce as normal if both Pengassan and Nupeng (the blue collar workers' union) are on strike,' he added. 'The longer the strike goes on the more our production will drop. Some of the routine work and maintenance requires Pengassan.' Shell, which produces half of Nigeria's oil, said: 'It certainly has had an impact but it is too early to say how much. There is no immediate drop in liftings of crude oil.' Fears that the strike could seriously disrupt Nigerian exports caused world oil prices to strengthen yesterday. The price of the benchmark Brent Blend reached a 13-month high, with oil for September delivery quoted at just under Dollars 18 a barrel in late London trading yesterday, up from Monday's close of Dollars 17.45. The markets are particularly sensitive to any loss of Nigerian production because most of its exports are destined for the US, where oil demand is high because of the strong economy. Members of Pengassan occupy administrative positions in the oil joint ventures which are majority-owned by the Nigerian government. Staff who have walked out at the state's management company, Napims, and at the oil ministry, provide export clearance for the operators. Oil executives said the closure of one refinery, the Warri facility in the south, would inevitably affect Kaduna refinery in the north as crude oil is normally pumped from Warri to Kaduna for pro-cessing. Nupeng's strike has already halted distribution of fuel to filling stations in the main cities, which a military taskforce has done little to improve. The strikers are demanding that General Sani Abacha's government 'resolve urgently the political crisis' by upholding the result of last year's presidential election which was won by Mr Moshood Abiola, who is on trial for treason. Pengassan is also protesting against the loss of 3,000 members' jobs in the first half of this year, which it blames on the government's failure to fund its 60 per cent share of the oil joint ventures. Oil exports account for more than 90 per cent of Nigeria's foreign exchange income, which was about Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) last year.</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS PULSE: A SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> RETIREMENT;  </P> <P> FOR SOME, LIFE OF RETIREMENT ISN'T NIRVANA  </P> <P> After "a lot of personal soul-searching" and with no firm plan for the future,  Pacific Bell manager Evelyn Augustus decided to accept the phone company's  offer to take early retirement in 1988.  </P> <P> "It was a good offer," said Augustus, 56, who during a 20-year career with  Pacific Bell worked her way up from an operator to manager of municipal and  emergency 911 installations in Orange County.  </P> <P> "I had kind of reached the peak of management level that I could go," she said.  "With the downsizing of the company, the opportunities to move into the second  tier of management were not good."  </P> <P> Augustus got the chance to do what many of us spend years daydreaming about:  grabbing the good life after waving goodby to our employers. We think about  playing golf every morning, crisscrossing the country by motor home or retiring  to a quaint seaside village in Spain.  </P> <P> Indeed, many of us think we would like to retire early if we could. According  to The Times Orange County Poll, 55% of employed county residents would like to  retire when they reach age 55, if not sooner. And that sentiment is even  stronger among those who are in their early careers or mid-careers, with about  two-thirds hoping for an early retirement.  </P> <P> The Times Poll also showed, however, that those who are nearing retirement age  are far less likely than their younger colleagues to want to retire early. One  in three who are in the advanced states of their career want to retire at age  66 or older, and 20% want to keep working past age 70.  </P> <P> But while many of us may think we want to retire early, employment specialists  said that many people soon discover that a life of leisure isn't all it's  cracked up to be.  </P> <P> A recent study by Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, a Chicago-based  international outplacement consulting firm, found that about half of early  retirees want to return to work after three months in retirement.  </P> <P> "Some people go out and travel for a year, and others go play golf for a year,"  said John A. Challenger, vice president of Challenger, Gray. "They realize that  what was once play loses its charm when it becomes their full-time activity."  </P> <P> But restlessness or boredom aren't the only reasons people decide to come out  of retirement.  </P> <P> Some retirees find that they miss longtime friends at work and the office  camaraderie. Others feel that retirement doesn't offer them the sense of  purpose and self-accomplishment that their jobs did. This latter feeling,  employment experts said, is particularly true among corporate executives  accustomed to a fast-paced, decision-making environment.  </P> <P> Edgar S. Brower is one such executive. Six years ago, at age 53, Brower took  early retirement from Allied Signal Corp., where he was president of the firm's  $1-billion electronic components division. He walked away with a lucrative  severance package -- a so-called golden parachute -- that left him financially  set for life.  </P> <P> He spent the next three years playing golf and tennis, watching over his  investments and "just kind of putzing around." But after a while, he said, "you  suddenly realize that there are a whole bunch of hours in the day that you  can't fill. You're kind of out of the club now. I didn't miss the limousines  and helicopters and private jets. It was strictly the need to get those  creative juices flowing again."  </P> <P> Brower, a former U.S. assistant postmaster general, went back to work in 1985  as president and chief executive of Pacific Scientific Co., a Newport Beach  aerospace and industrial products manufacturer.  </P> <P> "I'm not even thinking about retirement now," he said.  </P> <P> But many early retirees face a much different financial picture. Although the  lump-sum payments and sweetened pension packages that companies often offer to  early retirees may look attractive at first, people often find that retirement  living is more expensive than they expected. Some discover that they are just  not ready to live a more frugal lifestyle.  </P> <P> Early retirement "is a big financial planning task, and trying to figure out  what to do is very difficult," said Brian Mittman, a Rand Corp. analyst who is  studying early retirement trends. "The normal worker is not equipped to make  these type of decisions."  </P> <P> Pacific Bell's Augustus discovered that very thing. Augustus was one of  thousands of Pacific Bell employees struggling with the question of early  retirement when the company's parent company, Pacific Telesis Group, was trying  to cut costs to keep up with increasingly tough competition in the  telecommunications industry.  </P> <P> To help nudge workers out the door, the company offered an attractive severance  package: an extra five years tacked on to workers' age and length of service.  Augustus took the bait.  </P> <P> And after leaving the phone company, she enjoyed herself by redecorating her  condominium in Orange and helping her son, Morgan, set up a Southwestern-style  furniture store in Irvine. But eight months later, reality kicked in.  </P> <P> "Financially, I wasn't prepared for full retirement," she said. "The pension  check would not have allowed me to keep up my lifestyle, at least not until I  was eligible for Social Security."  </P> <P> So Augustus has gone back to work as manager of telecommunications for Colonial  Insurance Co. of California in Orange. "There are a lot of new challenges, and  this job has really stimulated my mind," she said. "It's like a whole new  career."  </P> <P> Employment specialists said, however, that Augustus is more fortunate than some  early retirees who decided to go back to work. She worked in an industry with a  strong demand for experienced professionals -- and she didn't stay out of the  work force too long.  </P> <P> "The longer they (retirees) are out of the workplace, the less desirable they  become in the market," Challenger said. "Hiring companies wonder about their  motivation, the currency of their skills and why other companies have not hired  them."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- Press Secretary of the  Russian president Vyacheslav Kostikov explained the technical  mistake in the document that allegedly makes possible the  deployment of a military base in Latvia with a language  confusion.    Kostikov told a briefing here today that the military  sometimes call a base an object. Thus, the Skrunda Radar  Station was named a base by mistake instead of an object.    "None has planned to build a military base, and the Latvian  leadership was presented apologies in connection with the  technical mistake," he said.    As for military bases in Commonwealth States, the Russian  military presence there is intiated by the Commonwealth States  themselves, stressed the presidential press secretary.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lev Kamanin, candidate of technical sciences: "A </F> Single Step From Cosmic to Comical. Curious End to Discredited  Offspring of the Cold War Era"]    [Text] Five years have elapsed since the day of the first  Buran flight. And the last: all work on the ill-fated shuttle  has ceased and one of its three copies has been delivered to  Gorkiy Culture Park where in the spring of the coming year the  presentation of a new space attraction should occur. This  mind-boggling stunt puts an end to 20 years of efforts of  several hundred enterprises of the military-industrial complex  in creating an aerospace complex costing the state over 20  million rubles in the old preinflation prices. There's no doubt  about it: the Buran, as the world's most expensive attraction,  was guaranteed entry into the Guinness Book of Records. It  appears that it is but a single step from cosmic to comical...    Is such a curious end legitimate? How could it happen that  the work of hundreds of thousands of highly skilled designers,  engineers and workers was necessary to no one and will go only  to please the unexacting tastes of latter-day multimillionaires  seeking "nonterrestrial sensations?"    Many responsible leaders of our rocket-space industry even  today assert that the Energiya-Buran complex is a major  scientific-technical achievement and the discontinuation of its  further development was caused only by financial difficulties  arising with the onset of the changeover to a market economy in  the country. But if the Buran is so good as it has been made out  to be, why was it impossible for it to replace the Soyuz ship  already created in the 1960's?    It is time to acknowledge that the Buran, only once flying  into space in an automatic mode on 15 November 1988, is a  discredited offspring of the cold war era when the Soviet  government allocated the lion's share of the state budget to  direct and indirect military expenditures, being guided by the  principle: "We will spare no cost..."    This same principle was naturally followed by the creators  of  our first aerospace complex supposedly with multiple  reusability. By order of the Ministry of Defense they designed  and constructed an orbital glider (on the Buran there is no  propulsion engine, in contrast to the Shuttle -- the American  orbital aircraft). But a glider, as is well known, cannot take  off by itself. And then it was decided that the putting of the  Buran into orbit would be delegated to the superpowerful and  ultraexpensive Energiya booster, both stages of which tumble to  the ground in heaps of scrap metal several minutes after the  launch.    The result was astounding: the cost of one flight of the  multireusable shuttle was ten times greater than the  expenditures on launching of the single-use Soyuz. Moreover,  even prior to the Buran flight it had become clear that in the  foreseeable future there would be no call for its 30- ton  payload capacity. For regular communications with the Mir  station and even for the construction of an orbital station of a  new generation it is entirely adequate to have a ship with a  load-carrying capacity not greater than 10 tons.    In the history of national cosmonautics the undertaking with  the Buran enters as a very important engineering blunder -- the  second after the failure with the sorrowfully remembered N-1  lunar rocket, all four experimental launches of which ended with  enormous explosions. It is important not to allow new  miscalculations in the stage of conceptual designing of  aerospace systems of the future. Unfortunately, the  prerequisites for such miscalculations are already in place.    The MAKS project was developed at the very same NPO Molniya  where the Buran was constructed: it is proposed that this sort  of "Little Buran" orbital aircraft, three times smaller in size  and mass, be sent into space from aboard the giant Mriya  transport aircraft. One has to ask: is the game worth the  candle? Indeed, the speed to which the Mriya will be able to  propel the orbital aircraft does not exceed 3% of first  cosmic  velocity.    Whereas the MAKS is oriented on the use of a two-stage  complex, which although low velocity is an already existing  entity, as the first stage, in a number of other projects  reliance is on accelerating aircraft, which for the time being  still remain mythical. From time to time even completely  irresponsible calls are made to proceed to the technical  designing and construction of an experimental copy of a  single-stage spaceplane not having any parts separable in flight.    In such projects, whose first variants were proposed about  30  years ago, provision is made for a too light-weight approach to  the problem of creating highly efficient and reliable hypersonic  air-jet engines, involving primarily the development of  adjustable hypersonic air intakes and ensuring a stable process  of hydrogen combustion in a supersonic air flow. For the time  being it has not been possible to solve this problem fully, even  theoretically. But from the practical point of view it must be  admitted that air-jet engines, capable of reliably operating  under the enormous thermal and mechanical loads of hypersonic  flight, can be created only on the basis of 21st-century  materials and technologies.    As indicated by experience in aircraft construction in our  country and abroad, from 8 to 15 years will be spent on the  designing, construction and testing of an aircraft engine -- two  or three times greater than on the development of a new  aircraft. Therefore, one should not think in terms of  realization of projects for a two-stage (much less a  single-stage) spaceplane in the years immediately ahead.    The multiply reusable aerospace system most promising with  respect to the possibilities of its embodiment in metal with the  use of already mastered technologies must be considered a  two-stage complex whose first stage is a rocket plane, that is  an aircraft carrier with liquid-propellant jet engines. In such  a system a vertically launched rocket plane carrying an orbital  aircraft (second stage) is propelled to estimated hypersonic  velocity, after which it descends in a gliding flight and makes  a landing like an aircraft at a stipulated airfield, whereas an  orbital aircraft outfitted like the Shuttle has its own  liquid-propellant jet engine and is prepropelled to first cosmic  velocity. Performing its assigned task in orbit, the orbital  aircraft returns to the place of landing of the rocket plane for  preparation for a repeated flight.    A reasonable question may arise: do we have to be concerned  at all with aerospace systems during such difficult times?    We will not delve into profound reasonings on the subject of  the irreversibility of scientific-technical progress. We will  simply recall how the cosmonauts returning from a regular  expedition to the Mir station were retrieved from the Soyuz  ship. Over the landed ship the search team set up a step ladder  with a block and tackle, by means of which the cosmonauts were  extracted through the narrow hatch. Debilitated in the course of  the Soyuz descent by the operation of 8-g acceleration after  prolonged exposure to weightlessness, with forced smiles on  their faces they sat down in the seats prepared for them...    But now the astronauts flying in the Shuttles in all flight  stages need not experience accelerations greater than 3 g. And  it must be surmised that they leave their ship after landing  almost with the same ease with which passengers of a modern  airliner descend along the stairs. They are to be envied!</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Tsukhlo, head of the Market Survey Laboratory </F> of the Institute of Economic Problems of the Transitional  Period: "Effective Demand Remains the Most Painful Problem for  Industrial Workers"]    [Text] According to the assessment of enterprise  directors polled, the April slump in industrial production  slowed things down a bit.    The market surveys made by the Institute of Economic  Problems  of the Transitional Period are conducted regularly among the  directors of industrial enterprises, and pursue the goal of  revealing their general ideas on future economic trends. It is  worth noting that the opinions of these respondents are more  than just opinions, since they can in themselves have a  substantial influence on the development of the situation, as  feedback.  <H8>  Evaluation of the Current Situation </H8>   Essentially, the expectation of a further drop has been  losing its keenness lately. This was recorded in machine  building and the construction industry, while reports of an  increase in the scale of output cutback came from enterprises of  the woodworking and light sectors. In April, 28 percent of the  enterprises rated production stabilization as "normal"; this  situation did not suit 72 percent of the respondents, who had  retained their output volume.    The general slowdown in the recession led to a reduction in  the proportion of "below normal" evaluations of the current  production volume. Nevertheless, 90 percent of the enterprises  in the machine building and light industry were dissatisfied  with their output volumes. The answers of "normal" were  significant (30-40 percent) in 1994 only in the woodworking and  food sectors. Of the enterprises considering their production  volume normal, only 42 percent evaluate the demand as the same;  for the rest of the respondents from this group, the demand was  insufficient.    In the 1st quarter of 1994, the demand for industrial goods  continued to decrease. The balance remained at the level of the  4th quarter of 1993 (-60 percent). A year ago this indicator was  zero, which attested to the stabilization of the demand in the  1st quarter of 1993. The strongest reduction in demand is now  noted in machine building and woodworking.    Evaluations of the demand during the four months of 1994  remained at an extremely low level: 84-87 percent of the  enterprises considered the demand for their products to be  unsatisfactory. A critical situation has formed in the machine  building plants -- 99 percent of them assessed the amount of  demand as "below normal." The maximum proportion of the "normal"  answers were obtained in the woodworking industry (15 percent,  March -- 23 percent).    The reaction to the poor demand was more coincident in  April:  56 percent of the enterprises with unsatisfactory demand were  prepared to lower production (March -- 50 percent), and 26  percent were prepared to not raise prices (March -- 10 percent).    In the 1st quarter of 1994, the enterprises' provision with  raw material and materials dropped. In general, this process  took place in the light (76 percent of the answers -- "below  normal"), woodworking (69 percent) and machine building (68  percent) sectors. In the food industry, 60 percent of the  enterprises considered their raw material reserves normal.    In April, the poll recorded a small drop in surplus reserves  of finished products -- the proportion of "above normal" answers  dropped from 59 to 51 percent. The most substantial reduction  occurred in the machine building (balance was 39 percent, March  -- 49 percent), woodworking (29 percent, March -- 38 percent)  and light (61 percent, March -- 73 percent) sectors of industry.  Surplus reserves of finished products force 58 percent of the  enterprises to decrease production and 33 percent -- to not  raise prices.    The load of the production capacities on the whole for  industry was 54 percent in April (56 percent in January 1994). A  reduction in this indicator occurred only in machine building  (46 percent, January-- 51 percent) and the light industry (47  percent, January -- 59 percent).    Provision with orders for the year, on the average for  industry, was cut in half and constituted 4.4 months in April  1994. The maximum reduction took place in the woodworking (from  7.6 to 2 months), light (from 7.3 to 2.2) and machine building  (from 8.8 to 3.6) sectors. The enterprises of the petrochemical  and food industries reported approximately the same provision as  the year before. An increase in the indicator was recorded only  in the construction industry (from 5.2 to 5.4 months).    Some 54 percent of the enterprises reported surplus  production capacities in April 1994 (April 1993 -- 29 percent).  Most of these evaluations were obtained in machine building (58  percent, April 1993 --35 percent) and light industry (57  percent, April 1993 -- 27 percent).    Effective demand still remains the most painful problem for  industry --80 percent of the enterprises indicated it as a  restraining factor (January 1994 -- 78 percent). In second place  -- a shortage of working capital (61 percent, January -- 62  percent). A shortage of skilled personnel holds a distant third  place (17 percent, January -- 19 percent).  <H8>  Predictions and Expectations </H8>   An increase in expectations of a production slump continued  at the enterprises in April: the proportion of "will drop"  answers reached 54 percent (March -- 49 percent); given the  retaining of predictions of a production increase for 10 percent  of the enterprises the balance was -44 percent. Increases in the  scope of the recession are anticipated at the enterprises of the  light (-71 percent, -40 percent in March), woodworking (-54  percent, -8 percent in March) and machine building (-54 percent,  -46 percent in March) sectors. The probability of an increase is  retained only in the construction industry.    The price predictions of the enterprises changed  substantially in April. The proportion of producers not  intending to raise prices rose to 26 percent (March -- 8  percent). Anti-inflationary intentions of this sort have not  been recorded since July 1992. The minimum inclination toward  raising prices is shown by the enterprises of the light and food  sectors (balances were respectively +48 percent and +60  percent). In machine building, this indicator dropped to +79  percent (+89 percent in March), and in the woodworking sector --  to +69 percent (+92 percent in March).    Predictions of a reduction in employment were recorded in  April 1994 among 62 percent of the enterprises (April 1993 -- 30  percent). The greatest cutbacks are likely in the machine  building (balance equals -73 percent, -57 percent in the 1st  quarter), light (-71 percent, -14 in the 1st quarter) and  woodworking (-69 percent, -20 percent in the 1st quarter)  sectors of industry.   <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-061-33A>      Expected Changes in Production Volume </FIG>      --72 percent of the enterprises are not satisfied with the  stabilization of their production.    --Demand continues to drop at the former rate.    --99 percent of the machine building plants do not have  sufficient demand for their products.&lt;/graphic&gt;    <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-061-34A>      Expected Changes in Prices </FIG>     -  The enterprises of the food industry are the best  provided with raw material.    -  Effective demand holds back the production of 80 percent of  the  industrial enterprises.    -  Over half of the enterprises expect a cut in their output in  the next few months.    -  No intention to raise prices was recorded for 26 percent of  the  enterprises in April (March -- 8 percent).  &lt;/graphic&gt;</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Anger over curb on council report The Labour party yesterday blamed the decision not to publish a report into alleged electoral manipulation by Conservative-controlled Westminster City Council on 'bullying' by lawyers acting for Dame Shirley Porter, the council's former leader. The government yesterday rejected Labour's calls for publication of the report. Mr John Magill, the district auditor, announced earlier this week that his full report, due for release today, would not be published 'for legal reasons'. Circulation will be restricted to 12 ratepayers who triggered the inquiry and about 30 respondents. Other interested parties will receive asummary. Mr Jack Straw, Labour environment spokesman, contrasted the suppression with the full publication of district auditors' reports into alleged misuse of funds by Labour-controlled councils. Mr Straw said the government should table the report in the Commons to allow discussion and comment under the protection of parliamentary privilege. Mr David Curry, local government minister, said publication by the government would be a misuse of ministerial powers which would amount to putting pressure on the auditor. The government is braced for bad news from the report, which will focus on allegations that the council sold flats in marginal wards to Tory supporters for political reasons.</p>

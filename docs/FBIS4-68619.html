			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Economic Sciences Yelena Shkanova </F> and Yuriy Nikolayev, associates of the Management small research  and implementation enterprise, under the rubric "The Trade  Sector: Across the Borders": "Ukraine: The Exchange Is Like a  Barge--It Will Drift Somewhere"]    [Text] According to data from the Ministry of Statistics of  Ukraine, the number of exchanges fell by 20 percent in 1993. At  present, there are 72 of them, but only 41 exchanges are  actually in operation. The number of brokerage offices also  diminished. At the beginning of the year, 90 brokerage offices  were registered at each exchange on the average whereas by the  end of the year--only 60.    Based on the results of the [as published] nine months of  1993, the volume of transactions concluded on the exchanges of  Ukraine exceeded 300 billion karbovantsy. Products, goods,  services, and real estate worth 6.8 trillion karbovantsy were  put up for sale. The liquidity coefficient came to 4.6 percent  during this period.    If we characterize the structure of the exchange trade in  the  republic, real estate, transportation vehicles, quotas  (licenses) to export products out of Ukraine, and fuel accounted  for the largest proportion. The growth of the volume of  transactions involving transportation vehicles was due to the  fact that the exchanges were granted the right to sell the  assets of state enterprises, including used motor vehicles. For  this reason, transportation vehicles worth a total of 46 billion  karbovantsy were sold through the exchanges in the third quarter  alone.    A fuel shortage and the regulatory influence of the  government caused a change in the dynamics of transactions  involving these products. In the first quarter, the greatest  volume of transactions was effected--approximately 30 billion  karbovantsy worth. In the second quarter, virtually no fuel was  sold because of rigid restrictions on its exportation beyond the  borders of Ukraine and a sharp rise in wholesale prices for  energy resources in May. In the third quarter, the sale of fuel  through the exchanges went down by a factor of five (in value  terms) compared to the first quarter. In 1993, 10 times less  coal than during the corresponding period of 1992 was sold on  one of the largest exchanges of Ukraine, the Donetsk "South"  Regional Commodity, Raw-Material, and Fuel Exchange.    In the third quarter, the volume of transactions on the  Ukrainian exchanges increased by a factor of 2.8 compared to the  first quarter. In particular, 22 times more transportation  vehicles (in value terms), 17 times more chemicals, seven times  more construction materials, four times more metal and metal  products, two times more nonferrous metals, 3.5 times more real  estate, and three times more consumer goods were sold. Yet, 40  percent fewer transactions involving credit resources were  concluded. However, does this indicate a pickup in exchange  trading? Of course, it does not. The point is that this is due  solely to an increase in the exchange prices for products. By  the end of the year, prices had increased by a factor of 12 for  a comparable assortment of 42 key exchange-traded goods. The  volume of exchanges in natural units declined several fold  compared to 1992. In the immediate future, an increase in the  volume of sales may apparently be expected only in the cases of  the sale of real estate and state enterprise property. The  exchanges have selected real estate as the main area of their  specialization in the environment of hyperinflation, proceeding  from the desire of the population and commercial structures to  invest monetary funds in real estate.    Exchanges operate in virtually all oblasts of Ukraine, with  the exception of Zhytomir and Sumy Oblasts. However, the bulk of  the transactions are concluded on the exchanges of Kiev (69  percent), Poltava (10.7 percent), Kharkov (6.5 percent), Donetsk  (4.6 percent), and Dnepropetrovsk (2.2 percent) Oblasts. Trading  on other exchanges is not large and accounts for 7 percent of  the entire volume. The exchanges of Kiev are mostly geared  toward noncommodity transactions. Thus, between 87 and 100  percent of transactions involving credit resources, quotas  (licenses), real estate, and securities are concluded on the  exchanges of Kiev. Transactions involving nonferrous metals, the  volume of which ranges between 72 and 75 percent of the volume  of exchange transactions in the republic, are the exception. At  the same time, 93 percent of transactions involving foodstuffs,  67 percent of transactions involving computer and office  equipment, and 50 percent of transactions involving cable  products are effected on the exchanges in Donetsk Oblast.    Few exchanges facilitating an increase in the turnaround of  merchandise remain in Ukraine. As a rule, an overwhelming  majority of companies trade in real estate and other  noncommodity stocks--quotas, licenses, credit resources,  securities. This is a direct consequence of hyperinflation. The  current status of exchange trading reflects the overall  situation in the economy of Ukraine: Markets for sales are being  lost; enterprises have excessive inventories; the payment and  energy crises are not dying down. Under the circumstances, only  a few exchanges can retain the specialization they selected.</p>

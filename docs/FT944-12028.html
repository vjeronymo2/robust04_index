			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Information dazzle at the Bank The danger of trying to look at too many signposts at the same time is that the driver will be dazzled. This seems to have happened with Tuesday's Bank of England Inflation Report. The headline news about lower inflation, actual and expected, gave one message to the markets. The warnings of the concluding section on the upward risks to the forecast, which the Bank in the end decided to stress, gave another. So the financial markets did not immediately realise the Bank was trying to signal the need for a bias towards higher interest rates, whether or not implemented this month. These misunderstandings came from an attempt to be too pragmatic and flood us all with information, which is valuable for the record, but needs to be co-ordinated by a central vision. The source of the confusion is that the upward pressures on both economic activity and prices have increased. But they are being imposed on an economy operating at a lower rate of inflation than anyone had dared to hope. Thus the aircraft is quite likely to be buffeted by upward moving air currents; but it is starting from much nearer the ground than the navigator previously realised. The Bank's most favoured underlying measure of inflation, known in the trade as RPIY, excludes indirect tax increases as well as mortgage interest payments. On this basis inflation has been running at a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of 1.7 per cent over the last three months. There are other underlying indicators which give still more favourable results. The risk of future upward inflation movements comes from the pressure of output on productive capacity. One attempt to measure this pressure is to look at the deviation of output from its trend, starting from the bottom of the recession. The Bank's chart (not reproduced here) shows that, although there is more unused capacity than at the corresponding period in the early 1980s, it is still being rapidly eroded. The Bank estimates that nominal GDP is now rising by 5 per cent per annum, as I suggested on Monday. This is the appropriate rate at which to aim, but not a basis for complacency when subject to upward pressures coming especially from the prices component. The crucial point is that the pressures on capacity are not confined to the UK. They are being felt worldwide, outside Japan. One main channel of transmission is through rising international commodity prices, which have had the effect of boosting UK 'imported inflation' to 6 per cent per annum. This is one reason why the balance of firms in CBI surveys expecting to raise prices has reached 22 per cent, seasonally adjusted, the highest since 1990. Another factor insufficiently stressed by the Bank is that, under the influence of strengthening world markets and a highly competitive pound, British producers are beginning to summon up the courage to pass on cost increases in factory gate prices. There is no need to gaze at the crystal ball. The chart shows that producer prices, excluding the food group, are already rising at an annualised rate of 3.6 per cent. So far, the upward forces at the producer level have been held at bay by intense competition in UK retail markets. The Bank agonises over how long this countervailing pressure will continue. But even if there has been a structural change in the retail trade, the squeeze on margins is essentially a one- off event which cannot be relied upon to hold down inflation in future. The Bank, which will have seen the Treasury's pre-Budget forecast, expects the rise in output to slow down. It also emphasises the current near-zero increases in unit wage costs. But the latter are already coming under threat from the tightening labour markets and the tendency of productivity increases to slow down as full capacity operation is approached. Above all the Bank needs to put more emphasis on the interrelation between unexpectedly rapid growth rates in different parts of the world. These are understated by the overseas chapter in the November Bulletin, which does not go beyond the inevitably dated official figures for countries outside the UK. The Inflation Report talks of the risk of inflation 'in two years' time' going above its central forecast of 2 1/2 per cent. If this means a few decimal points above, and that were to be the peak, no sensible chancellor need lose sleep. The real risk is of a cumulative upward movement going much higher and extending much longer. Then why not say so directly - instead of in casuistical terms which can be easily demolished by the soft money brigade, as the Bank was by The Times leader yesterday? The fragile nature of the present low-inflation achievement is evident in the obstinate belief of most wage earners that inflation will be stuck at 4 per cent for the foreseeable future. * * * International Black Holes One disadvantage of making the Inflation Report into a separate publication is that it detracts attention from the Bank's Quarterly Bulletin, which appears on the same day and often has fascinating information buried within it. One example is the table showing how loose is the connection between the current balance of payments, about which some people fret so much, and the net asset position of UK residents. In both 1992 and 1993 the UK had an estimated current payments deficit averaging Pounds 10bn per annum. Yet the net overseas assets of the UK rose in value by slightly more than these sums. The same pattern has appeared so far in 1994 although with a much lower deficit. In 1990 on the other hand there was a drop in identified net assets three times as large as the payments deficit. The main reason for these discrepancies is 'revaluations'. If there is a rise in Wall Street, British holders of US securities will obviously gain. A more paradoxical effect arises from currency changes. The UK had a very large net gain in 1992 when sterling was devalued following its departure from the ERM. The reason is that assets denominated in foreign currencies then showed a large appreciation when converted into sterling. The balance sheet benefits from devaluation are counter-intuitive. The only way to get around them is to express net assets in a single external currency such as dollars or as a proportion of GDP. In addition very long averages need to be taken to smoothe out extremely large, erratic swings. If this is done we see that the UK built up a modest overseas net asset position during the years of large oil surplus, which was subsequently run down, but is still on average slightly positive. The big change in the last decade is in the US, which has apparently moved from positive net overseas assets of nearly Dollars 400bn to a substantial negative asset position. Many US business economists are highly suspicious of this supposed deterioration because they believe that the estimates undervalue American direct investment abroad. The Bank of England Bulletin also shows how both the US balance of payments deficit and Japanese surplus are offset for the time being by short-term rather than long-term capital flows. But the writer goes out of his way to stress this change does not necessarily make the imbalances 'any less sustainable'. The deeper truth is that entities such as countries do not have either surpluses and deficits or positive or negative net assets. These belong to individuals, corporations and other organisations including governments. The international payments figures are only useful if this health warning is always borne in mind.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK PAYING WAY WITH PAYMENTS DEFICIT (POUNDS BN)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Average                       1982-89    1990    1991    1992    1993    1994 H1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A Current balance        -4.1   -19.0    -8.2    -9.8   -10.3    -2.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- B Identified capital     flows (inflows -)    -1.9   -18.2    -8.6    -3.4    -8.3    -1.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- C Revaluations   of which:   Exchange rates                -20.8    10.3    45.6     4.0     1.8     Portfolio investment        -19.0     3.2    27.7     0.2     1.0     Direct investment           -14.2     6.4    27.6     3.0     2.7     Other net assets             12.4     0.7    -9.7     0.8    -1.9   Securities price effect       -14.1     9.9   -13.3    12.7    23.7   Other                          -6.5    -8.7   -16.5     1.3   -19.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- D Change in identified     assets                2.8   -59.6     2.9    12.3     9.6     4.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- E Net asset level        55.0    -4.6    -1.7    10.6    20.3    25.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- F Balancing items (B-A)   2.3     0.8    -0.4     6.5     2.0     1.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Bank of England  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

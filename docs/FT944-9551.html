			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Associates' turnround buoys British Steel A much bigger than expected turnround at associated companies, combined with more than trebled trading profits from its own business, helped British Steel to announce its best interim results since the 1990-91 year. Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 1 rose from Pounds 27m to Pounds 159m, on turnover ahead from Pounds 1.97bn to Pounds 2.2bn. Earnings per share jumped from 1p to 6.49p and the interim dividend is raised from 0.5p to 2p. In its trading statement, the company highlighted the 'major improvement' in the results from its main associated undertakings. These include Avesta Sheffield, the Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer, and UES Holdings, the UK engineering steels and forgings concern. Analysts had been pencilling in a contribution of about Pounds 20m from associates, against a loss of Pounds 8m in the previous first half. In the event, they contributed Pounds 41m, a performance which reflected rationalisation and cost reductions. Avesta Sheffield, in particular, was spurred by increased demand and selling prices. It now appeared well positioned to benefit from the current improved trading conditions, the company said. In September, British Steel paid Pounds 85m to increase its stake in the company from 40 per cent to 49.9 per cent. It had previously spent Pounds 20m taking up its share of an Avesta rights issue. The recovery at Rotherham-based UES, in which British Steel has a 60.9 per cent stake, was less marked. It lost Pounds 48.1m before tax in 1993, but has since been trading profitably. GKN, which owns the other 39.1 per cent, has made it clear that it does not consider the company to be a core business. Mr Brian Moffat, British Steel's chairman and chief executive, said his company was a long-term investor in UES. He added, however, that the company was still 'not as efficient as we would like it to be'. On British Steel's own trading position, Mr Moffat said the improvement in UK demand in the latter part of its last financial year had continued into the first half. The emerging recovery in mainland Europe had also strengthened. As a result, sales volumes had increased by 6 per cent to 5.9m tonnes, selling prices had continued upwards, and trading profit had jumped from Pounds 38m last time to Pounds 120m. Capital spending in the first half rose by Pounds 1m to Pounds 43m. Net debt was Pounds 4m at the end of the period, after the additional Pounds 105m investment in Avesta Sheffield. This compares with net funds of Pounds 37m at the end of fiscal 1994. The effective tax rate for the half year fell from 22 per cent to 17 per cent, following the writeback of ACT previously written off, and, in associates, the utilisation of tax losses brought forward.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Fifth installment of the "basic content" of the Hanoi 20-25 </F> January Mid-Term Party National Conference Resolution]    [Text] 3. To uniformly build a market mechanism managed  by the state in accordance with socialism:    We will continue to build a new and uniformed economic  policy, persist in the transformation to the market mechanism in  parallel with the consolidation of an effective state  management, and continue to perfect all mechanisms and policies  so that the market mechanism can operate effectively:    -- To ensure the independence of all business entities.  State agencies will only manage state-related domains and will  not directly control business activities.    -- Prices are to be determined by the market.    -- Lawful and healthy competition will be encouraged, while  monopolies will be avoided.    -- Businessmen are entitled to profit as long as they  operate within the laws.    -- The state will fix and subsidize the prices of certain  merchandise that are vital socioeconomically within the scope of  the market mechanism.    -- The state encourages the uniformed establishment of  various markets: merchandise, services, labor, capital,  technology, real estate, and so forth.    Which principles should a socialism-oriented state  management  apply?    -- The state should manage the whole economy and all  economic sectors, not limit itself to the state-owned sector.    -- The centralization and unification of the government in  macro-economic management should be strengthened in parallel  with the expansion of responsibility and authority of sectors  and localities in areas that they can manage more efficiently,  while always respecting the independence of business enterprises.    -- The relevant ministries should strive to satisfactorily  formulate development strategies, plans, and policies for their  sectors; guide, support, inspect, and control all business  establishments of various economic sectors in the localities in  accordance with the state economic-technical management function.    -- The comprehensive inter-sectorial management of  government ministries should be consolidated, so that all  socioeconomic activities are put under the state's effective  macro-management.    -- State authorities at all levels should carry out state  management duties in their respective areas in all business  establishments regardless of them being centrally- or  locally-owned.    For the management task to be effective, we must:    -- Complete the legal system and resolutely enforce the  laws.    -- Consolidate and develop the supervisory role the staff  in planning agencies to strengthen planning for development.    -- Continue with the comprehensive and profound reforms of  the financial and monetary systems.    4. To Take Care of Cultural and Social Issues:    The most thorough guiding concept of our party reflected in  all cultural and social lines and policies is to care, nurture,  and develop the human factor, which is both a motive and an aim  of the revolution. The important issues in these domains at  present are employment, social equity, level of public  knowledge, a healthy and clean society, the development of  national culture, and health care and protection.    -- What are the most important ways to create employment?    All people will cooperate with the state to invest more  savings to accelerate industrialization and modernization, thus  creating more jobs.    All citizens and economic elements, domestic and overseas  investors alike, are to be encouraged to develop their business  activities and expand their external relations, as development  will help solve the employment issue.    -- On what basis do we set up our social equality policies?    Economic growth must relate closely to social progress and  equality at each stage of its development.    Social equality is seen in the reasonable distribution of  production resources and products of the economy, as well as in  opportunities for development of each individual.    We will apply the principle that allows higher income for  those who are produce and contribute more, and vice versa.  Distribution is based mainly on labor and on capital  contributed to business and production activities. Talents and  skills are to be encouraged and valued.    The lawful accumulation of wealth should be encouraged,  while  programs to eradicate hunger and reduce poverty should be  developed. We should see a growing number of people getting rich  before others as a positive indication of development.    We will carry out suitable policies in credit, tax, and  career training to create conditions for the poor to improve  their chances of making ends meet and becoming better off. We  should also motivate the richer sections of society to help the  state assist those who are poorer with capital, production  resources, experience, and advice for their own businesses.    The richer, developed regions should help the state assist  poorer, and slower-developing ones. The state will have  suitable policies to reserve investment subsidies for poorer  regions, and will assign the richer regions the responsibility  of supporting poorer ones.    The state should also have suitable policies and special aid  for regions with unique difficulties and disadvantages in  comparison to others. These include mountainous and remote  regions, ethnic minority regions, and former revolutionary  bases. On the other hand, these localities also have to help  themselves by developing their potential and using subsidized  capital efficiently. (To be continued)</p>

A. Maltsev; UDC 621.396.96] </F>   [Abstract]An experiment is conducted to determine the  directions from which broad band signals arrive when the data  recording time is short in duration. It was shown that when the  number of affecting sources is exceeded by the dimensions of the  signal subspace, this leads to a significant deterioration of  resolution of the signal group classification method. An  efficient procedure of direction finding is proposed for the  indicated conditions. 3 figures and 3 references</p>

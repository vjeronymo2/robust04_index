			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 INDOOR RECORDS SET AT BUDAPEST  </P> <P> The World Indoor Track and Field Championships had a dazzling day as four world  indoor records were broken Saturday.  </P> <P> High jumper Javier Sotomayor of Cuba, 800-meter runner Paul Ereng of Kenya,  women's 3,000-meter runner Elly Van Hulst of the Netherlands and women's  3,000-meter walker Kerry Saxby of Australia had record-setting performances.  </P> <P> Sotomayor, the world outdoor record-holder, matched his outdoor world record  with a leap of 7 feet, 11 1/2 inches on his first attempt.  </P> <P> Ereng, the gold medal winner at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, surprised himself with  a sizzling finish in overtaking Jose Luis Barbosa of Brazil and winning the 800  in 1 minute 44.84 seconds. Ereng, a University of Virginia sophomore, erased  the record of 1:44.91 set by Britain's Sebastian Coe in 1983.  </P> <P> Van Hulst trimmed nearly six seconds off the women's 3,000 mark with a time of  8:33.82. The previous record of 8:39.79 was set in 1986 by Zola Budd.  </P> <P> Saxby won the women's walk in 12:01.65.  </P> <P> Sotomayor cleared 7-11 1/2 outdoors last September in Spain, nine days before  the start of the Olympics, but Cuba joined North Korea in boycotting the Games.  </P> <P> So, even though he was ranked No. 1 in the world for 1988, Saturday was his  first opportunity since the Games to prove that he could beat the world's best  jumpers.  </P> <P> "I wanted this world record very much, just as much as I wanted to win,"  Sotomayor said.  </P> <P> The world records were only part of Saturday's outstanding performances.  </P> <P> Merlene Ottey of Jamaica ran the second-fastest women's 200 with a time of  22.34. She might have surpassed the world record of 22.27 set by East German  Heike Drechsler in the 1987 world championships had she been seriously  challenged.  </P> <P> The expected showdown in the men's shotput between Olympic champion Ulf  Timmermann of East Germany and world record-holder Randy Barnes never  materialized, although they finished in the same order as at Seoul.  </P> <P> Timmermann led all the way to win his second consecutive world indoor title at  71-4 1/4. Barnes had a poor series except for his final throw of 69-9 3/4 to  finish second. Barnes set the world mark of 74-4 1/4 this season.  </P> <P> Soviets Rodion Gataullin and Yevgeny Egorov, the Olympic silver and bronze  medalists in the pole vault, finished first and second. Gataullin clinched the  gold medal with a vault of 19-2 1/4, matching the meet record set by world  record-holder and Olympic champion Sergei Bubka, also of the Soviet Union.  Gataullin then missed three times at a world-record 19-9 3/4.  </P> <P> In other finals, Romanian Doina Melinte repeated as women's 800-meter champion  in a meet-record 2:04.79; West German Helga Arendt won the women's 400 in  51.52, also a meet record, as Diane Dixon finished second in 51.77, breaking  her U.S. record, and outdoor world record-holder Galina Chistyakova of the  Soviet Union won the women's long jump at 22-10 3/4.  </P> <P> The meets ends today with 11 finals.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 19 (CNS) -- The State Statistical  Bureau and the Ministry of Supervision have joined forces to  fight against false reports on industrial output value. The two  departments have since the beginning of this year dispatched  investigative teams to several areas to look into allegations  relating to violations of the regulations on statistics mainly  due to individual interest sought by some leading cadres and  officials. It was found that such infringements were quite  serious and covered a wide area.    Some party and government leaders exaggerated their  achievements and made false reports on industrial output value.  Local statistical bureaus under pressures from their leading  organs could not help but follow instructions from the local  leadership in making false reports on industrial output value in  breach of regulations on statistics. Some local party and  government organs comparing themselves with other regions in  terms of success achieved in industrial production were to blame  for false reports on industrial output value made by some towns  and enterprises.    Some regions changed the unified statistical practice  available nationwide causing false statistics on industrial  output value.    A circular issued by the two departments pointed out that  infringement of the regulations on statistics and making false  reports on statistical work ran counter to the spirit of seeking  truth from facts required of the party. As a result the state  loses reliable scientific data and information for  macro-economic regulation. Wrong decisions mainly due to wrong  information have caused the state serious economic damage.</p>

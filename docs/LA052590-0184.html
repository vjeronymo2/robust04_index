			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 1ST-QUARTER U.S. TRADE DEFICIT HITS 6-YEAR LOW;  </P> <P> FIRST-QUARTER TRADE DEFICIT HITS 6-YEAR LOW  </P> <P> The U.S. trade deficit fell to $26.4 billion from January through March, the  lowest quarterly imbalance in more than six years, the government reported  today.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said the 8.2% improvement from a $28.7-billion  fourth-quarter deficit resulted from a record level of U.S. sales abroad  offsetting the highest volume of oil imports in more than 12 years.  </P> <P> For the first quarter, U.S. exports rose 4.7% to an all-time high of $96.04  billion. Imports also were at a record level, based on a surge in oil demand,  climbing 1.6% to $122.4 billion. The trade deficit is the difference between  imports and exports.  </P> <P> Today's report on merchandise trade as calculated on a balance-of-payments  basis confirmed trends already noted in the department's monthly merchandise  trade reports. They showed a first-quarter deficit of $23.9 billion.  </P> <P> The disparity in the two figures comes from the fact that today's report  excludes military sales by the U.S. government and makes other minor  adjustments to the monthly figures.  </P> <P> Analysts were generally heartened by the new figures despite the surge in oil  imports. They noted that U.S. export sales remain at strong levels. Since  growth in exports has fueled a large portion of U.S. economic growth over the  last three years, the continuation of this trend is seen as a promising sign  for the future.  </P> <P> The first-quarter deficit was the smallest since a $21.7-billion shortfall in  the fourth quarter of 1983.  </P></p>

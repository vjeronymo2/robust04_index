			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (31): Reality is unreal (official) GLIMPSES OF HEAVEN, VISIONS OF HELL by Barrie Sherman and Phil Judkins Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 12.99, 224 pages VIRTUAL WORLDS: A JOURNEY IN HYPE AND HYPER-REALITY by Benjamin Woolley Blackwell Pounds 16.95, 274 pages JUST BEFORE Samuel Taylor Coleridge fell asleep to create the Kubla Khan, he was browsing in a devotional book, Purchas his Pilgrimage. He read: 'What if a man should sleep, and in that sleep should dream, and in that dream should go to paradise. And what if he should be given a flower as a token that he had really been there? And what if he should wake with that flower in his hand? Aye, and what then?' Two hundred years on, the answer is Virtual Reality - the potential to create any world while staying in this one. John Walker, founder of Autodesk, the Californian software company, puts it succinctly: 'When you are interacting with a computer, you are not conversing with another person. You are exploring another world.' This other world, Virtual Reality (VR), comes from a computer-based technology which gives the illusion of immersion in an artificial world, or of presence in a remote location in the physical world. State-of-the-art VR enables you to move around in the computer-generated environment and interact with it. It is interactive, intensive, immersive, illustrative and intuitive. VR became commercially available in March 1991 before being academically understood. The machine evolved faster than the legal or moral concepts it required. It has spawned a clutch of histories and interpretations, the film Lawnmower Man (March 1992) and Howard Rheingold's fine book Virtual Reality (1991) prominent among them. Now two books, Glimpses of Heaven, Visions of Hell: Virtual Reality and its Implications, and Virtual Worlds, show a broadening response to VR. The former is as bullish as the latter bearish. But both agree that VR is morally and legally still unhatched; that technologically it is a fledgling; and that, commercially, it is ready to leave the nest. Morally, VR offers the difficulty of what appears to be another consciousness, created at will, out of our own, which interacts with ours. What happens now, when consciousness is no longer an inward domain but out there, made palpable? Technologically, the three essentials are already in place. To create the virtual world visually, you need either a stereographic helmet containing miniature televisions sending images to each eye, or stereo cameras, or a wrap-around screen. To instruct the computer, you need a 'dataglove', joystick or 'mouse' that allows the computer to plot your position and respond when you grasp a virtual object in the virtual world. To run the whole 'reality engine', you need a string of computers. Commercially, there are five players in the VR game: manufacturers (VPL Research); industry users (Boeing, British Aerospace); researchers (the University of North Carolina, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Salford); arcade games and software companies (W Industries); and assorted lawyers, artists and philosophers. But the rush for market share is just starting. Glimpses of Heaven is a brisk, positive book, chancily argued but written with brio and excitement. There is a dodgy chapter on why women, heretofore supposed to be incompatible with computers, will fare better in an intuitive and metaphoric world, a kind of computemancipation, and some airy social theory on VR re-entry problems, underclasses, and new forms of labour. But the book's strength is its free play of intelligence. It asks simple questions. Is it a bad thing to get what you want, albeit virtually? If this is bad, do legislators have the right to prevent others from having it? What happens when VR crosses national boundaries? Who owns the 'virtual space' between people immersed in the technology? In contrast, Virtual Worlds finds a scepticism born of Woolley's long contact with the hypes and hopes of VR. This is a serious collection of stimulating essays on the philosophical questions raised by VR. If Galileo was right to see the universe as a book written in mathematics, Woolley asks, what can be reduced to maths? Of that, what is computable? There is a wonderful chapter on parallel universes. Here, we do not know which one of an infinity of universes we might be in until it happens. Then you discover you are in the 'my bridesmaid/girlfriend has run off with the best man' world, and no other. AT the moment, VR is still crude in effect. The last thing you think of during VR immersion is reality. But virtual realities are real in our reaction with them, not in what they are. Computer guru Jaron Lanier believes it is not the idea of artificial reality that is strange but the idea of reality itself. Coleridge should be told there is now a VR-related project called Xanadu. He would turn in his sleep.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Letter: Stability is what large section of business wants from politicians Sir, British business overwhelmingly desires a Conservative victory, you say in your leading article ('Weakness at the Tory heart', April 1). If your measure is financial clout, that's doubtless true, but if you mean head count (which wins elections), I wonder. I attended a west Midlands Confederation of British Industry evening seminar on 'partnership supply' this week. The first half hour was largely devoted to a panegyric by Sir John Banham, the CBI director-general, on industry's achievements over 'the last 13 years' - a thinly-veiled plea to vote Conservative and hardly bearing on the topic for which the attendees had paid Pounds 50. At the supper which followed, a straw poll among the eight apparently 'random' delegates with whom l found myself yielded only two who claimed to be Tory voters. No doubt 'City-based' commerce, with its emphasis on buying and selling companies rather than goods, is solidly Conservative and no doubt the recipients of salaries of a third of a million pounds and upwards (who write to The Times and appoint director-generals of the CBI) also see their best interests served by Conservatives. But what the thousands of people who manage medium-sized enterprises or own small ones - and who in an uncertain world are judged by their ability to deliver what they forecast - really want is stability. No-one enjoys paying tax, but higher on most people's wish list is to do one's job in an environment of reasonably stable exchange rates, interest rates and legislative environment and to be able to recruit staff who can read and write. The worst scenario is regular about-turns. Whether that resolves itself into voting Conservative or into a push for the constitutional changes favoured by the Liberal Democrats remains to be seen. The latter might have more durable results. Gordon Brace, Burmans Farmhouse, Cottage Lane, Shottery, Stratford upon Avon, Warwickshire CV37 9HH</p>

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Try the Ecu for a good return - Dryden Gilling-Smith suggests using cash funds to benefit from higher interest rates WHERE can you get 11 per cent interest with instant access and limited downside risk at a time when you might be lucky to get 6 per cent on UK sterling bank deposits? Some pundits are saying that you have to start investing in long UK gilts, or getting into equities, but there are big question marks about both these markets. Many commentators consider that UK equities are expensive in terms of expected dividend flows, while investors may incur losses in the gilt market as the government floods it with new issues to meet its Pounds 44bn public borrowing requirement. In any case, many people want to hold considerable sums in cash, or its equivalent. UK pension funds, for example, have been holding substantial sums in cash while interest rates have been good. This applies particularly to small self-administered pension schemes (SSASs) where cash may be piling up for older members near retirement to pay out the tax-free lump sums and purchase annuities. European Currency Unit cash funds may provide the answer to higher returns. The Ecu was developed as an accounting convenience for EC member governments and its value is calculated on the basis of a basket of currencies. Some 42 per cent of the Ecu's value is accounted for by the heavyweight currencies - the Deutschmark and the guilder - and another 42 per cent by sterling and the French and Belgian francs. So, you do not have to worry too much about the high-risk currencies such as the lira, peseta, escudo and drachma which account for only a minute proportion of the basket. Even a change in a major currency, such as the French franc, is not likely to have an impact on the overall exchange rate of the Ecu any more than the sterling change did in September. The Ecu is used extensively by governments and companies raising money, and by corporate investors, and can also be used by private investors and pension funds. The fact that there are no Ecu coins or notes does not make it any less useful as an investment currency. You should treat Ecus as the equivalent of a currency unit trust, allowing you to spread your investment over a portfolio of currencies without the bother, costs and risks of buying each currency yourself. An Ecu fund also enables you to get higher interest rates. While you can get around 8.25 per cent on Deutschmarks and guilders, you can get up to 11 per cent on Ecu units. You can, of course, get 10.5 per cent from French francs at present, 15 per cent on pesetas and 20 per cent on escudos. The high interest rate obtainable on these currencies involves the sterling investor in an exchange rate risk (although because the Ecu is a basket of currencies, this risk is reduced). If the pound rises against the Ecu, then your Ecu deposit will fall in value in sterling terms. For much of the past 10 years, the pound has actually been falling against the Ecu - it has dropped 40 per cent since the start of 1982. But there have been periods when the pound has risen: it jumped 15 per cent against the Ecu between January 1987 and January 1989, which would have wiped out any interest rate gains in that period. If the UK pulls out of recession faster than its EC partners, the pound could strengthen against the Ecu, and investors would need to switch into a sterling fund. The present big interest differential results from the fact that, since Britain left the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), the UK has made economic recovery its number one priority and is, belatedly, following the US low interest rate approach. Most of the other EC governments are still pinning their faith on maintaining parity with the DM, even if it means continued high interest rates - and all the human misery this entails. This could, in due course, set off political explosions in the countries concerned, bringing down interest rates. So, what is the best way to benefit from these higher Ecu interest rates? Just over a year ago, I invested part of my own company's pension fund in a Guernsey-based Ecu cash roll-up fund run by my own bank (Lloyds). Over the 12-month period, it gave me a net return in Ecus of 9.95 per cent; but when we added the cumulative appreciation of the Ecu against sterling in the same period, our effective yield was 24.57 per cent. There are other Ecu funds operating both in the Channel Islands and in Luxembourg (although the Lloyds Bank Luxembourg fund seems to have been averaging 1 per cent less per annum than the Guernsey fund). The latest unit values and interest rates are shown daily in the offshore and overseas section of the FT Managed Funds Service. Interest accrues gross, which means that pension funds do not have to reclaim tax deducted at source (although private investors are liable for tax when they cash their units). This tax deferment factor can be a worthwhile advantage for someone whose marginal tax rate has dropped by the time he cashes in - possibly in retirement. There is, of course, another point: money that otherwise would be paid away in tax remains in the fund earning interest. And if you want the interest as income, you can achieve this by cashing so many units each year. Other organisations offering Ecu cash roll-up funds, and which are listed in the offshore and overseas columns of the FT Managed Funds Service - where you can check latest unit values and interest rates - include Fidelity; Rothschild Asset Management (CI) Ltd, Guernsey; Capital House Fund Managers (CI) Ltd; and Lloyds Bank Luxembourg. Other banks, such as Credit Suisse (Luxembourg), have their Ecu funds listed but do not show the latest interest rate. Interest rates do change each day, and it is simple to check them when you invest. The Lloyds International Money Market Fund Ltd has no initial charge and there is no bid/offer spread. At present, the manager levies a daily fee at a rate of 0.75 per cent per annum of the net assets, and the custodian fee is 0.2 per cent per annum. There is a free switching facility between sterling and Ecu funds. These fees, and the usual auditing and printing expenses, are effectively allowed for in the unit prices and interest rates quoted. You should check the minimum investments and transactions allowed. For the Lloyds fund, the minimum investment in any of the currencies is Dollars 10,000, which at present exchange rates is around Pounds 6,500. The minimum transaction amount is Dollars 2,000 (about Pounds 1,300). Dryden Gilling-Smith is managing director of Employee Benefit Services.</p>

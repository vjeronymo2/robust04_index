			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> MCCULLOCH STANDS FIRM AT THE EMBASSY  </P> <P> Quick as some of the tempos tended to be, Ian McCulloch was the very model of  immobility for most of his show on Friday at the Embassy Theatre -- both hands  on the mike stand, both feet planted squarely at its base, eyes closed,  overhead lighting illuminating his inverted pyramid of poufy hair but hardly  ever his apparently expressionless face. He's like a very shy and/or very  drowsy Jim Morrison.  </P> <P> McCulloch's introversion actually serves him well on record. His first solo  album since quitting Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, "Candleland," is frequently  touching even in its vaguest moments, with emotions of despair and honest  contrition that ring deep, dark, true and occasionally even optimistic.  </P> <P> But the record's resurrectional potential seemed lost in this downcast Good  Friday concert -- its uneven musical textures reduced to a jangly Euro-rock  blur, the thematically obscure lyrics rendered sonically obscure as well,  leaving only the much hook-ier handful of Bunnymen hits that were brought back  from the grave to make much impression. His very private vision is best  experienced at home. CHRIS WILLMAN  </P></p>

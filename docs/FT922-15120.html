			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Lonrho investors seek debt details - Share price collapse prompts disquiet among large shareholders In an interview on BBC Radio's The Financial World Tonight, Mr Spicer was asked if Mr Tiny Rowland, chief executive, wanted to take Lonrho private. Mr Spicer said: 'I've heard him say that it would be a fascinating thing to do.' And on the question of whether the board would agree to Mr Rowland taking it private, Mr Spicer said: 'At those sort of prices (more than Pounds 1bn), it would be very interesting indeed,' adding, 'One advantage would be that it would take us out of the public limelight.' LONRHO, the international trading group, is being pressed by some of its largest UK institutional shareholders to divulge information over debt and banking covenants in the wake of the collapse of its share price. Directors will be asked to reveal the amount of debt and in which countries it has been taken out. Mr Rene Leclezio, chairman, told shareholders at last month's annual general meeting that net debt stood at Pounds 850m. In particular shareholders want to know whether this figure was calculated before or after the payment of Pounds 177m by the Libyan Arab Investment Company for the one third stake in the Metropole Hotels chain. Lonrho will also be pressed to give details of its banking covenants or conditions. Only if covenants are breached, can a bank apply the threat that a loan should be repaid immediately. Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho deputy chairman, refused to comment on the relationship between Lonrho and its institutional shareholders, but added: 'There is nothing to be concerned about. Our debt is easily explained and is being reduced.' Lonrho's shares yesterday recovered a little to close at 71p, following Tuesday's fall to 65 1/2 p, an eight-year low. Last November the shares were worth about 250p. Bankers said yesterday that they were more than a little concerned about Lonrho's falling share price. However, they are unable to apply much pressure on the company to provide them with more information.</p>

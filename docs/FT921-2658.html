			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Aslef halts campaign on sell-off ASLEF, the train drivers' union, yesterday postponed a campaign against rail privatisation after legal advisers said that it should not go ahead during the election campaign, Michael Smith writes. The union was told that it could be open to a challenge that it was providing hidden finance for the Labour party, which opposes privatisation. The Trades Union Congress is also advising unions that local Labour party agents must be consulted on anything that promotes the party and its candidates. Aslef did not have time to contact them before today's scheduled launch.</p>

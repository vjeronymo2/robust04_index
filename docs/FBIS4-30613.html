			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- Vice Trade Minister Hideaki  Kumano called Monday [27 June] for joint action by  industrialized nations to stem the yen's rise against the  dollar, calling the strong yen abnormal and detrimental to the  global economy.    Kumano told a news conference the yen's sharp appreciation  against the U.S. dollar does not reflect the fundamental factors  of the Japanese economy and the government is concerned about it.    The yen closed at a postwar high of 99.93 yen against the  dollar in Tokyo on Monday.    Kumano disagreed that the dollar's weakness against the  German mark and other European currencies reflects the loss of  confidence in the U.S. economy and added the dollar's decline is  not desirable for the U.S. economy.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Takeover Panel chief expresses fears over European Directive SIR DAVID CALCUTT, chairman of the Takeover Panel, fears that the European Takeover Directive could mean the UK losing the advantages of a flexible and speedy response during takeovers and lead to tactical litigation during bids. Sir David used his chairman's statement in the Panel's annual report to attack the directive, which requires a statutory body to regulate takeovers and mergers. The directive has been under discussion since 1987. The Panel is a non-statutory body. It claims to 'avoid over-rigid rules' and 'the risk of takeovers becoming delayed by litigation of a tactical nature, which may frustrate the ability of shareholders to decide the outcome of an offer'. If the directive came into effect, said Sir David, 'the tried and tested attributes of the Panel - the facility of advance consultation, flexibility of approach, speed of response and a decision on which practitioners can rely - may be lost or rendered less potent'. The annual report showed a sharp drop in the Panel's income, from Pounds 6.38m to Pounds 4.73m, largely because of a fall in contract note levy income from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 3.29m and a drop in document fees from Pounds 2.26m to Pounds 1.4m. Even so income exceeded expenditure, which fell by Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 4m, and with interest receivable of Pounds 85,000 (Pounds 63,000) the Panel's surplus after tax was Pounds 748,000, down from Pounds 2.32m. At the year end the Panel had cash of Pounds 1.68m (Pounds 889,000). Mrs Frances Heaton, the director general, said the Panel 'has decided not to make any changes to the basis or level of its charges'.</p>

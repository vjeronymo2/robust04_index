Pujol said in  reply to the minister that this meeting is not opportune right  now, and told him that he deems it essential first to restore  cohesion within CiU [Convergence and Union]. The brief  conversation between the two political leaders took place in a  room at the Ritz Hotel in Madrid, where the Generalitat premier  had just presented the Blanquerna Prize to Fernando Lazaro  Carreter.  <H5>  Political Asset </H5>   Rubalcaba was present at the ceremony with the aim of  conveying to Pujol the idea that the government acknowledges his  full authority as interlocutor on behalf of the Catalan  nationalist coalition. In short, this is a gesture aimed at the  Generalitat chairman not with a formal or institutional purpose  but in order to intimate to him that the government regards his  leadership of CiU as a political asset to be preserved.    In fact, Pujol took it this way, and, according to his  colleagues, felt pleased at the explicit support given to him by  the government as an interlocutor overall, and especially on  such an essential point in his political program as be believes  linguistic normalization to be. In this connection, the Catalan  premier viewed the presence of two ministers -- Rubalcaba  himself and Education Minister Gonzalo Suarez Pertierra -- at  the Blanquerna Prize presentation ceremony also as an expression  of support against those who criticize his conduct in the  matter, so that, in the opinion of those close to him, "he felt  bolstered in the sense that the presence of the government  representatives and of other officials, such as Congress [of  Deputies] Speaker Felix Pons, represented support for not  allowing himself to be intimidated by those who question the  Generalitat's linguistic policy."    In government circles it is believed that the meeting will  take place soon, despite Pujol's reservations about meeting with  the prime minister now because of the tensions in CiU. In any  event, the same circles respect the strategy which the Catalan  nationalist coalition leader wishes to employ in order to  reestablish his authority: Hence Rubalcaba's "when he wishes,"  uttered in the double sense that Pujol could go to the Moncloa  Palace tomorrow or postpone it until he sees fit. The  hypothesis mooted in CiU circles is that the meeting could take  place at the beginning of February, by which time it is believed  that the coalition will have fully recovered its internal  cohesion -- something that could be resolved this very week --  although the Generalitat premier's wish is to hold the meeting  with the utmost discretion in order to avoid the external  pressure which would otherwise be applied to his negotiating  process with Gonzalez.    In addition, the government wishes to act cautiously in  CiU's  crisis, without doing anything that could add further elements  of tension. In this connection, Democratic Union of Catalonia  has proof that, during the budget debate, the government tried  to meet its demands without jeopardizing the overall dialogue  with the coalition, and its aim now is also that relations with  CiU should operate very smoothly again.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The residents of N'Dalatando, capital of Cuanza  Norte Province, are still crying for their beloved relatives who  are being killed daily by Engineer Jose Eduardo dos Santos'  criminal aircraft. Reports from Firmino Lukamba, Voice of  Resistance of the Black Cockerel's correspondent in that city,  say that people are crying everywhere.    Yet another father, a mother, a grandfather, or son dies.  Yesterday the Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] aircraft once again carried out  another heavy air raid against positions on the outskirts of  N'Dalatando. The raids were carried out by 3 Su-25 aircraft and  5 PC-7 aircraft which dropped highly potent toxic bombs over  villages, districts, and communes, resulting in considerable  human and material losses. Firmino Lukamba says that the  democratic world should persuade Luanda to stop such operations.  He said that there is authentic genocide in N'Dalatando, and  the international community is silent about the issue.</p>

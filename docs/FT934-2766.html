			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Budget turns CGT into a minefield - Scheherazade Daneshkhu plots a watchful path through the maze Investors calculating their capital gains tax bills since the Budget change need to be both intrepid and patient since they face formidable calculations. The withdrawal of indexation to increase or create losses took effect from the beginning of Budget day and some readers have asked how to deal with 'pooled' shares - those in the same company bought at different dates. CGT is complicated partly because the legislation has evolved piecemeal. The tax was introduced in 1965 but indexation was not implemented - initially, in a limited way - until April 6 1982 and was extended to losses by chancellor Nigel Lawson in 1985. With 1982 as the dividing line, shares bought after April 5 that year are lumped together in one category while those bought in previous tax years are treated separately. If you bought several lots of shares in the same company after April 5 1982, the cost of each share for CGT purposes is the average cost of acquiring the shares in the pool (except shares sold within 10 days of acquisition). The cost of shares bought before 1982 is put at their market value on March 31 1982, if you have elected to ignore the original cost of all assets held on that day. You have a separate pool for each company and for each class of share. You must keep tally of the actual spending and indexed spending of your pool each time there is a sale or purchase. The indexation allowance is then the difference between the indexed spending and the actual unindexed spending. What is the effect of the Budget change on the calculations? The following examples are provided by chartered accountant Touche Ross. Pooled shares bought after April 5 1982 Suppose you bought 1,000 shares in April 1982 (after April 5) for Pounds 2,000 and another 1,000 in the same company in September 1991 for Pounds 7,000. You sold 1,000 shares on November 29 for Pounds 4,000 and the remaining 1,000 shares on Budget day for Pounds 4,000 as well. You have made an overall (unindexed) loss of Pounds 1,000, since you paid a total of Pounds 9,000 for the shares but sold them for Pounds 8,000. Using the indexation factors released by the Inland Revenue, and published each month in the Weekend FT, the indexed cost of the April 1982 batch of shares, up to the purchase of the second batch, is Pounds 3,322 (Pounds 2,000 x 1.661 - the indexation factor from April 1982 to September 1991). Add to this the spending on the second batch to get Pounds 10,322. You sold shares on November 29. The new indexed cost is Pounds 10,870 (Pounds 10,332 x 1.053 - the indexation factor from September 1991 to October 1993, the last month for which figures are available). Since half the shares were sold on November 29, the indexed cost of the 1,000 shares sold on that day is half the total indexed cost, namely Pounds 5,435 (Pounds 10,870 / 2). The proceeds from the sale were Pounds 4,000, leaving you with an allowable loss of Pounds 1,435 (Pounds 5,435-Pounds 4,000). The situation for the shares sold on Budget day is very different. The proceeds must be deducted from the unindexed cost of Pounds 4,500 (half the Pounds 9,000 for which the two batches of shares were bought), leaving you with an allowable loss of only Pounds 500. If you had sold all the shares on November 29, your allowable loss would have been Pounds 2,870, instead of Pounds 1,935 as a result of postponing the sale of half of them until Budget day. Pooled shares bought both before and after 1982 Suppose you held 1,000 shares on April 5 1982 with a March 31 1982 value of Pounds 2,000. You bought another 1,000 shares in the same company in June 1986 for Pounds 7,000 and you sold the whole lot for Pounds 8,000 last month. If you sold them before Budget day, your allowable loss is Pounds 5,720. This is arrived at by multiplying the price paid for the shares by the relevant indexation factors to obtain the indexed cost of the shares. The indexed March 31 1982 value of the first 1,000 shares is Pounds 3,570 (Pounds 2,000 x 1.785). The indexed cost of the second 1,000 shares is Pounds 10,150 (Pounds 7,000 x 1.450). The proceeds of Pounds 8,000 must be subtracted from the sum of these two indexed costs, leaving you with an allowable loss of Pounds 5,720 (Pounds 13,720-Pounds 8,000). If, however, you sold the shares on Budget day, your allowable loss would be much less. The deemed cost of the March 31 1982 shares is still indexed to Pounds 3,570 (because that is less than the Pounds 4,000 proceeds); but the second 1,000 shares, which you bought for Pounds 7,000, cannot be indexed since that is more than the Pounds 4,000 proceeds. Adding the two figures together and subtracting the total proceeds of Pounds 8,000 leaves you with an allowable loss of only Pounds 2,570 (Pounds 10,570 - Pounds 8,000).</p>

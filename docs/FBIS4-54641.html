			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fahrudin Becic from Gorazde] </F>   [Text] The situation in Gorazde remains unchanged. The  chances of the aggressor moving outside the 3-km zone on the  right bank of the Drina River are slim. UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] has not set its points in that area again today.  Instead of performing the duties for which they have been sent,  the UN soldiers are often guzzling with the chetniks. Twelve  thousand people are still waiting for things to move from the  standstill and to at least move from the 3-km zone to their  burned homes.</p>

According to the joint statement, a delegation of the  Communist Party of Uruguay composed of Executive Secretary  General Petro Balbi and the executive member and international  secretary of the Central Committee of the Party visited the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea from Feb. 11 to 17, 1994,  on the invitation of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party  of Korea.    During its stay in Korea, talks were held between the  delegations of the two parties, at which the sides informed each  other of their conditions and activities and exchanged views on  a series of matters of common concern about the present  international situation and reached a consensus on the  fundamental matters discussed.    The WPK expressed firm solidarity with the CPU in its  efforts  to develop the party on the principle of Marxism-Leninism and  its struggle against the "neo-liberalistic" strategy of the  imperialists, after it reaffirmed the continued maintenance of  the socialist idea and its working-class nature.    The CPU noted with high appreciation that the Korean people  singleheartedly united around the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, are  confidently defending and advancing the socialist cause under  difficult conditions in which the imperialists are persisting in  their anti-socialist, anti-DPRK moves, and expressed full  support and solidarity for it.    It also manifested full support to the struggle of the  Workers' Party and people of Korea to achieve the reunification  of the country in the form of confederation based on one nation,  one state, two systems and two governments on the basis of the  three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and  great national unity laid down by Comrade Kim Il-song.    The sides shared the view that an immediate end must be put  to the unwarrantable acts of the western powers, particularly,  the United States, in violating the inviolable principles of  self-determination of peoples and non-interference in the  internal affairs of each country, exercising privileges in the  international arena.    They expressed their willingness to make joint efforts to  destroy all the old international political and economic orders  of domination and subjugation and establish new orders based on  equality, justice and social progress.</p>

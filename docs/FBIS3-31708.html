Amendments to the Citizenship Law have been passed, too.  Vesna Burnik reports:    [Begin Burnik recording] [passage omitted] Let us now  concentrate on the most important decisions of today which will  also have political consequences.    The funds for education are known -- 27.5 billion tolars  will  be spent over the next six years on educational buildings,  improvement of computer literacy, textbooks, school food, and  foreign languages. [passage omitted]    The State Chamber has irrevocably ruled that not more than  76.6 billion tolars will be spent on investments in defense over  the next 10 years. It was also decided that the Defense  Ministry will be allowed to spend a maximum of 8.8. billion  tolars per year. This decision was supported by present  deputies of the United List, the Liberal Democratic Party, the  Democratic Party, and the Ecological Party, who also opposed the  government proposal of defense funds which would amount to  slightly less than 85 billion tolars that will be mostly spent  over five years. The government coalition has again split on  this issue, as the Christian Democrats and Jansa's Social  Democrats voted in favor of the government proposal and against  the lower sum.

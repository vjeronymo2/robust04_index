			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / OECD Economic Outlook: Inflation unlikely to trouble UK - Slack in markets expected to restrain price and wage rises THE UK economy is suffering from so much slack that inflation is unlikely to be a problem in the foreseeable future, according to the OECD. The organisation envisages a weak recovery next year, with the economy expanding by 1.3 per cent after a 1 per cent decline this year. In 1994, output growth is expected to be higher, at 2.4 per cent. The pound's devaluation and the three percentage point cut in interest rates since September 'have removed some obstacles for recovery' but the outlook is clouded by an unusually high degree of uncertainty, the report says. Real output is expected to grow 'modestly' in the first half of next year, reflecting a slow recovery in demand by consumers as the decline in house prices starts to ease and people gain the benefits from lower borrowing costs. After mid-1993 a broadly based expansion in the economy can be expected, as 'confidence improves, the drop in consumer durables spending bottoms out, the savings rate falls, destocking ends and the measures announced in (last month's Treasury) Autumn Statement (to boost output) take effect'. Although the pound's devaluation since Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism three months ago will push up inflation through higher import prices, the effects of the devaluation on domestic price and wage setting 'are expected to be damped by considerable labour and product market slack'. The OECD expects inflation as measured by the deflator in growth of nominal GDP to be 5.4 per cent this year, falling to 5 per cent next year and 4.1 per cent in 1994. The OECD outlook for the UK assumes that the government maintains a firm policy on trying to damp price rises and maintains the credibility of financial markets. Unemployment is expected to rise from 10.1 per cent of the labour force this year to 10.8 per cent next year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------                        BRITAIN'S ECONOMY  ----------------------------------------------------------------                                        1991      1992      1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Gross domestic product                 -2.2      -1.0       1.3 Domestic demand                        -2.6      -0.6       0.6 Private consumption                    -2.1      -0.3       0.7 Govt consumption                        2.8       0.8       1.4 Gross fixed investment                 -9.9      -3.0      -0.6 Exports                                 0.3       3.2       5.8 Imports                                -3.1       6.2       4.0 Industrial production                  -5.3      -0.9       1.0 Current account deficit (Dollars bn)   11.1      22.0      24.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------- All figures are %.

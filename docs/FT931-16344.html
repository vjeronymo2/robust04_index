			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Chesterfield reduces debt after Pounds 85m sale CHESTERFIELD Properties, a UK property company, yesterday announced the sale of a building in London's Oxford Street for Pounds 85m to an overseas investor. The deal was the latest in a series of large acquisitions by foreign buyers, which have given new momentum to the depressed London commercial property market. The deal, which sent Chesterfield's share price up 32p to 230p, will reduce its net debt by Pounds 66m and nearly halve its gearing, which previously stood at 200 per cent. The sale price is 18 per cent less than the building's book value at the end of 1991, but compares with a purchase price of Pounds 47m in 1987. The buyer was Arrowhead Properties, a Jersey-registered private company owned by an unnamed overseas investor. The sale was made by Anfield Properties, which is 60 per cent owned by Chesterfield and 40 per cent owned by Capital &amp; City Holdings, another property company. Mr Mark Houslop of Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnock, Arrowfield's property adviser, said its client was attracted by the high yield of just over 10 per cent and its long leases, which do not expire for another 20 years. The high yield reflects poor prospects for rental growth. The rent paid on the offices are between Pounds 40 and Pounds 43 per sq ft, which is roughly double the rent a new tenant would pay. The building, called United Kingdom House, has four shops and 160,000 sq ft of offices.</p>

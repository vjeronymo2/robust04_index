			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Survey of Malaysia (7): For Proton, a brother - The motor industry Malaysia's car industry is a symbol of the country's ambition to join the league of developed nations. It is also the foundation of the country's industrialisation programme, writes Kieran Cooke. The first car to be manufactured in Malaysia, the Proton, rolled off the assembly line in 1985. Last year Proton produced a record 116,611 cars at its plant outside Kuala Lumpur. The Proton, made in co-operation with Mitsubishi of Japan, now has a a more than 70 per cent share of the domestic car market. Last year more than 17,000 Protons were exported - the bulk of them to Britain. Proton is now making plans for marketing a left hand drive version of its cars in continental Europe. It is also expanding its presence in the region: more than 2,000 Protons are likely to be exported to Indonesia over the next year in exchange for Malaysian purchases of Indonesian made aircraft. Plans are well advanced for a joint venture Proton assembly plant in the Philippines. Malaysia and Vietnam have signed preliminary agreements for cooperation in setting up a Vietnamese car industry. In May, Malaysia, Japan and China signed a memorandum of understanding for the manufacture and distribution of car components in China. Encouraged by the success of Proton, Malaysia is now embarking on its second national car project. In July this year Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua, or Perodua, rolled out its first four seater 660cc passenger car. The Kancil, or Mouse Deer, is being produced in co-operation with Daihatsu and is modelled on the Japanese group's Mira car. Perodua says that 100 Kancils per day will be produced by the end of the year: production will eventually rise to 45,000 annually. There are plans to export the Kancil in the near future. From the beginning, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has been the driving force behind the growth of the country's car industry. Dr Mahathir sees the car sector as the catalyst for industrialisation: industries will grow to service the car sector and eventually diversify into other activities. This has been happening. More than 70 per cent of the Proton is now sourced in Malaysia. In an important step toward more self sufficiency Proton is now beginning to cast its own engine blocks. A widespread network of industries and vendors have become involved in the car manufacturing process. However the Proton's core technology and high value items, including much of the transmission system, are still imported from Japan. Dr Mahathir has criticised the Japanese for not transferring technology fast enough. 'We have to learn from the Japanese,' says Dr Mahathir. 'But at the end of the day we have to be independent, in the sense that we can develop our own car. We have to try to get the technology from somewhere, somehow ..the Japanese step by step philosophy is fine, but the steps are being taken too slowly.' The Japanese say that Malaysia still lacks some essential skills and must invest more in training and R&amp;D. The formation of a national car industry has been a costly exercise with millions of dollars of public funds poured into Proton. Despite a 35 per cent increase in turnover last year Proton's pre tax profits dropped 9.3 per cent to MDollars 282m. Much of the profit drop was attributed to the rise in the value of the yen and the consequent increase in import costs. Mr Nadzmi Mohamed Salleh, a Malaysian who last year replaced a Mitsubishi executive as Proton's managing director, says that Proton does not have sufficient economies of scale to make 100 per cent local content a realistic proposition. 'The costs would be too high,' says Mr Nadzmi. 'Instead Proton may well opt for global sourcing.' That appears to be already under way. In mid year Dr Mahathir made a trip to the Peugeot Citroen works in France. Latest reports are that Citroen will soon begin supplying engines for a variation of the Proton. Proton is believed to have also investigated parts supply from Mercedes Benz in Germany and General Motors and Ford in the US. Rover was also apparently thought of as a supplier but dropped due to the ban on giving government contracts to UK companies. Some feel that Malaysia is being overly ambitious in embarking on a second car project. Part of Proton's success in the domestic market has been due to high duties placed on the import of other cars. The new Kancil will be considerably cheaper than the Proton and Malaysia's premier car maker could see its market share decline. Proton admits that with the domestic market at near saturation point, it has to export to survive. However, Proton's Japanese partners are unhappy at the prospect of the Malaysian car competing with their own makes in markets such as Indonesia. In Britain, one of the main attractions of the Proton is its price. The UK prices of Protons start at about MDollars 27,600 (Pounds 6,990). In Malaysia the cheapest Proton costs more than MDollars 30,000. Under the European Community's generalised system of preferences (Gsp), Proton has full exemption from UK import duties. Continued Gsp exemption is vital for UK sales. If Proton starts making significant inroads into the car market on the continent, Europe's motor manufacturers might argue for a revision of Malaysia's Gsp status or demand the removal of Malaysia's protective import duties. Malaysia's car industry has travelled a long way in the last 10 years. Progress could be slower in the years ahead.</p>

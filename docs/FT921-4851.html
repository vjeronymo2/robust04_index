			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Trust merger proposals withdrawn Jupiter Tyndall Group announced that the proposals for the merger of CST Emerging Asia Trust and Pacific Horizon Investment Trust, both managed by Jupiter, have been withdrawn. The board of CST, which has been advised by Robert Fleming, rejected the draft merger proposals for three principal reasons: The value realisable by CST's shareholders as a result of the proposals was uncertain and unlikely to exceed 85 per cent of net asset value; PHIT's portfolio and performance, in terms of the decline in net assets per share since launch, provided no grounds for selecting PHIT as a merger partner; And the cost of the proposals would be excessive and significant in relation to the assets of CST and PHIT.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Vilnius, Jan 14, BNS -- Mykolas Burokevicius,  former leader of the pro-Moscow Lithuanian Communist Party, has  addressed the Lithuanian government with suggestions "on ways of  getting the Republic out of a crisis."    The communist party has been outlawed in Lithuania and its  former leader is listed among the 30 believed organizers and  executors of the failed Soviet coup attempt in 1991. Some of  them currently hide in Russia, and, according to some sources,  in the neighboring Belarus. Lithuania has demanded several times  to extradite the alleged state criminals, but without any  success so far.    In a letter addressed to Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius  and received on the eve of the third anniversary of the Jan. 13,  1991 bloodshed, the central committee of the so called  Lithuanian Communist Party points out "the need to restore the  political power of the working people." Burokevicius also  demands to legalize the communist party in Lithuania and to stop  its legal persecution, the LIETUVOS RYTAS newspaper said.  [passage omitted]</p>

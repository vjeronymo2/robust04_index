Prof Seftel said he had been authorised to release limited  details on Mr Mandela's medical condition.    Mr Mandela's "sore throat" had correctly been diagnosed as  laryngitis and the laryngitis had responded to treatment.    Prof Seftel had seen Mr Mandela about 3PM Monday and also  gave him a general examination.    The ANC leader was generally "in good physical shape --  particularly taking into account his age and punishing schedule".    Mr Mandela had also appeared "very calm" in the face of the  violence that broke out in Johannesburg on Monday, the professor  said.</p>

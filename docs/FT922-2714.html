			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Woman wins Pounds 6,500 in discrimination case A WOMAN who was asked if she expected to be married with 'two-point-whatever children' during a job interview has won her case at an industrial tribunal. The tribunal in Aberdeen awarded Ms Vicky Allison, then 26, more than Pounds 6,500 compensation for hurt feelings and loss of earnings. It heard that the year-long appointment as a technical officer in Grampian Regional Council's water department went to a 17-year-old youth with less experience. Mr Robert Aitchison, the assistant manager who interviewed Ms Allison, admitted he also asked her how she would cope with the lack of toilet facilities during the mainly physical field work. He asked her how she felt about the prospect of working all day with a man and expressed surprise at the number of women applicants - four out of a total of 15. The council was held to have unlawfully sexually discriminated against Ms Allison by allowing untrained staff to conduct an interview without regard to the statutory equal opportunities code and in breach of its own policy. Grampian Regional Council refused to comment.</p>

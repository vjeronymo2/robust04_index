			<p>BFN     [Text] The mayor of St. Petersburg has sent a letter to the  government chairman, Viktor Chernomyrdin, which reports the  critical situation of financing the city economy. Revenues in  the first months of this year as compared to December last year  have fallen by 40 percent. Today the debt owed by the mayor's  office to budget-funded organizations is 110.607 billion rubles.  To prevent the further development of critical phenomena in the  city, Anatoliy Sobchak is asking the Russian Government to  allocate a grant of 40 billion, provide compensation for the  expenditure on increasing wages for workers in budget-funded  organizations, and to preserve the amount allocated to the city  budget from VAT at the 1993 level. In accordance with a  presidential decree the tax was reduced from 50 percent last  year to 25 percent this year.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / TV bidder plans to make few programmes THE David Frost and Richard Branson consortium that is preparing bids for two leading commercial television franchises in south-east England plans to make very few programmes. The CPV-TV consortium, which will almost certainly bid for the franchises held by Thames Television and TVS Entertainment, would act mainly as a publisher rather than a producer, commissioning nearly all of its programmes apart from regional news. It has not yet decided which franchise will be its first preference CPV-TV, which includes Charterhouse, the merchant bank, would have a very small central staff and only one studio for its regional programming. Thames Television has a production staff of 1,500 and six studios. If the consortium wins Thames's weekday London franchise, a significant loss of jobs at Thames, the largest ITV company, would be inevitable. Other jobs would, however, be created in the independent production sector. Mr John Gau, a former chairman of the Independent Programme Producers Association, who will be director of programmes at CPV-TV, is believed to have lined up several leading independent television producers. The cost structure of such a bid would be lower than that of a company such as Thames, with its large commitment to producing programmes for the national network. TV-AM, THE breakfast television company, plans to explore links with Sky News, the 24-hour satellite news channel, when the current franchise bids finish. Talks have already taken place between Mr Bruce Gyngell, TV-am managing director, and Mr Sam Chisholm, managing director of British Sky Broadcasting, on potential co-operation. Both see opportunities for economies of scale in their UK television news operations.</p>

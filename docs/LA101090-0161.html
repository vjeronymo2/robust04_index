			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DECLINE IN PRECIOUS METALS DRAGS SILVER TO 13-YEAR LOW  </P> <P> Silver, the Cinderella of the precious metals markets, fell today to a 13-year  low in early London trading, dragged down by a decline in other precious  metals.  </P> <P> Silver fell 6 cents to $4.62 an ounce, its lowest since September, 1977, and  off from Tuesday's close of $4.68.  </P> <P> Dealers said the drop was caused largely by gold, which weakened with the  latest surge in oil prices.  </P> <P> Gold opened in London at $391.55 an ounce, off from the previous close of  $396.15. Gold has recently tracked oil prices but fell despite oil's sharp rise  on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Platinum, also losing its shine, was about $5 an ounce lower at $444.50 an  ounce.  </P> <P> "Gold is in the driving seat but silver is not very attractive to investors  anyway at present," said an analyst with a large bullion dealing company in  London. "Silver has been fairly dead in the water . . . it is too industrial a  metal," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Democratic rivals begin to fear Tsongas: Lionel Barber sees the Massachusetts long shot on the New Hampshire campaign trail THE PALACE Theatre was packed with students, anti-nuclear activists, a woman in a Spitting Image mask of Margaret Thatcher, and a cross-section of the earnest, well-informed voters of New Hampshire. The candidate, a slightly built man who turns 51 this week, shuffled on stage to a huge burst of applause. Former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts is enjoying his 15 minutes of fame in the Democratic presidential campaign. With less than a week remaining until next Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, Mr Tsongas, the long shot, has drawn level with Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early favourite dogged by accusations of adultery and draft-dodging during the Vietnam war. 'When I entered the race 10 months ago, George Bush stood at 91 per cent in the polls. Today he is in the mid-40s. I have done one hell of a job for this country,' says Mr Tsongas, the candidate whom Richard Nixon describes as 'too responsible' to become the Democratic nominee. The rise of Mr Tsongas, the self-styled pro-business liberal, is one of the more improbable stories of the 1992 election campaign. A Greek American from Massachusetts, he is a cancer survivor who cannot raise money, a candidate who three months ago stood at barely 2 per cent in the national opinion polls, the man who has turned dourness into a political virtue. 'For most political analysts, I don't compute,' he says, showing the self-deprecating humour which has become his trademark. 'But I know what it will take to turn this economy round. I am not afraid to tell the truth.' More than 450 people gathered at the Palace Theatre on Monday night to listen to Mr Tsongas. He cast himself as the man who can make America competitive in the international market, restore manufacturing and create new jobs. In New Hampshire, which has suffered more than most states during the recession, this is the message which sells. The gospel according to Paul is one of economic austerity. He dismisses the middle-class tax cut favoured by other Democratic candidates as a gimmick; he wants to reduce the Dollars 400bn (Pounds 220.9bn) federal budget deficit (although he is vague on how he would cut spending); he supports a capital gains tax cut and relaxing anti-trust laws to make US corporations more competitive with Japanese and German counterparts. He is unashamedly in favour of free trade. Asked to condemn the Bush administration's proposed North American free-trade pact with Mexico on the grounds that American jobs 'will go south', Mr Tsongas says: 'I don't wish to compete with Mexico, Thailand and Indonesia. I want to compete with Japan and Germany. I want high wages and high value-added products.' President Tsongas - which almost sounds as remote a prospect as President Dukakis, his fellow Greek American from Massachusetts defeated by George Bush in 1988 - would spend most of his time running USA Inc. 'My job is to figure out what works, how do you compete?' he says. It is a narrow vision of the presidency which reduces the world to one long economic struggle; it offers little clue as to how he would handle, say, the role of commander-in-chief. Recognising this, Mr Tsongas tried on Monday night to spell out a more expansive vision. In a moving speech about his battle with cancer, during which he suffered radiation equivalent to being within a mile of Hiroshima, Mr Tsongas spoke of the strength of purpose and obligation which it has brought to his life. It was an effective performance. Still, large questions loom over the Tsongas candidacy. By his own admission, he is desperately short of cash. He may not be able to withstand the rigours of a long campaign, although a recent television advert shows him swimming vigorously to underline his physical recovery. More important, his appeal outside his home base in the north-east looks limited. These weaknesses suggest it is too early to write off Mr Clinton, who raised more than Dollars 500,000 at a New York dinner on Monday night, despite lingering suspicions that he has been badly wounded by the 'character issue'. His supporters insist that Mr Clinton does not need to win New Hampshire to remain a viable candidate, but they have yet to find a way to inoculate him against further allegations of marital infidelity. And other Democratic candidates have begun to smell blood. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, the Vietnam war hero whose campaign remains stalled in third place behind Mr Tsongas and Mr Clinton, said on Monday: 'One of the worst attributes of politicians is when they begin to feel sorry for themselves.' The latest opinion polls suggest that one in two voters in New Hampshire remain undecided. So far Mr Tsongas has escaped attack; but now he is jockeying with Mr Clinton at the head of the Democratic pack, it is only a matter of time before he comes under the same scrutiny as Mr Clinton.</p>

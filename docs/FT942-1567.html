			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Treasury prices recover ground as dollar firms US Treasury bonds made up lost ground yesterday, prodded by a steadier dollar and softer commodity prices. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  31/32 higher at 86 1/4 . The yield eased to 7.40 per cent, well below the 7.50 per cent barrier breached the previous session. At the short end, the two-year note was  1/16 better at 100 1/32 , to yield 5.966 per cent. The improvement followed a firming trend by the US currency, which had fallen to a post-war low against the yen during Tuesday's trading session. Modest gains by the dollar yesterday allowed traders to take advantage of bond prices driven lower in recent days by fears of an imminent tightening of monetary policy. The market's attention was focused on Capitol Hill, where the Federal Reserve chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, testified before the House banking committee. However, fixed-rate investors searched in vain for meaningful clues about the timing of the central bank's next rate increase, or about the implications of the dollar's weakness. Meanwhile, commodity prices were co-operating again, with gold and the Commodity Research Bureau's 21-product index both extending their recent string of declines. The surprising level of demand which surfaced for Wednesday's Treasury auction of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes was a second source of strength. Bond prices across the board extended their earlier gains during the afternoon, amid retail buying and short-covering by traders who had bet the market would have difficulty absorbing the fresh supply. The European rally, which came late in the afternoon, saw German government bonds rise by about one point. It followed an earlier technical squeeze upwards in most European markets, as traders moved to cover short positions. 'The rebound was largely technical, and a result of the largely bullish noises coming from the US,' said Mr Ian Shepherdson, economist at Midland Global Markets in London. 'There was nothing new from the Fed, but in a bear market where people are expecting only bad news, reassurance that what the Fed is doing is moving monetary policy into neutral to combat inflation is welcome,' he said. German government bonds moved higher in response to Mr Greenspan's comments, and as a result of the slightly firmer tone to the dollar. The market moved higher in early trading, as investors moved to cover short positions. 'It broke through important technical levels around 90.65 and found support to move higher from there,' said one trader in Frankfurt. Analysts said attention would be on today's Bundesbank meeting at Potsdam, near Berlin, after which there will be a press conference. They will be keen to hear the Bundesbank's latest views on inflation and M3 money supply growth. Also of interest is US durable goods data published today. The Bundesbank yesterday allowed the repo rate to fall 5 basis points to 5 per cent. This was in line with expectations and had little impact on the market. The September bund contract was up 1.93 points at 92.29 in late trading. UK government bonds moved higher, taking heart from Mr Greenspan's remarks and the fact that the published minutes of the May 4 meeting between the UK chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England showed no immediate inclination to raise interest rates. 'There was some relief, especially for the short-end of the market, that a rate rise was not considered and, after Mr Greenspan side-stepped the issue of the recent dollar weakness, fears of an imminent rise in US rates (were allayed),' said one analyst. The long gilt future was up 1 27/32 points in late trading at 100 1/16 . The French and Italian government bond market moved higher in line with the rest of Europe. Italy in particular performed well, buoyed by remarks from Treasury and Bank of Italy officials concerning the need to control the Italian budget deficit. The September notional French bond futures contract on Matif closed at 113.44, up 1.14 points on the day. The Italian September BTP futures contract on Liffe was up 2.50 points at 103.85 in late trading.</p>

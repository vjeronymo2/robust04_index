			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Supermarket price war hits Jeyes Jeyes Group shares plunged 11 per cent yesterday to 335p as the household products manufacturer warned shareholders that the supermarket price war in the UK was taking a toll on first half profits. The warning comes less than a week household products group Reckitt &amp; Colman issued its own grim trading statement. It is also Jeyes's second warning in less than a year, following the gloomy statement in June which wiped 28 per cent off the group's market value. Mr Jimmy Moir, chief executive, said the UK business had been particularly affected by increased demand for generic products and aggressive discounting. Britain represents some 50 per cent of Jeyes profits. Margins are estimated to have fallen from between 8 and 10 per cent to about 6 to 8 per cent. Jeyes's cost-cutting programme has also been more expensive and slower to implement than had previously been expected, Mr Moir said. The benefits would not now feed through until the second half. Globol in Germany and the other international businesses were trading according to expectations, the group said.</p>

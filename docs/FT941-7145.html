			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (10): The lion curbs its restless tail - Robin Allen studies the challenges facing the 35 year-old Kuwait Investment Authority Many of the recommendations to be made this month on improving the Kuwait Investment Authority's management structure and investment policy are already being implemented. The proposals, by the KIA's strategy and planning task force, largely follow the guidelines introduced more than 30 years ago. The investment losses incurred in recent years would never have occurred if senior managers had stuck to the authority's basic principles worked out since 1959. In spite of the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, the collapse of an unofficial stock market, incipient and actual financial scandals at home and overseas, they enabled an initial sum of Pounds 150m (Dollars 225m) to appreciate to some Dollars 95bn by August 1, 1990. Then came the Iraqi invasion and Operation Desert Storm which threatened to bring the whole edifice down. But it survived, so that the state now has almost Dollars 50bn in first-class liquid reserves. Few other countries - and no other Arab country - have as much. At a time when the ruling Al-Sabah family face a lot of criticism, Kuwaitis can reflect that the man who put in the nuts and bolts was their own head of state, the Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah. In 1959, he was appointed head of the investment office in Kuwait's department of finance. After independence in 1960 Sheikh Jaber became finance minister, and stayed in the post until 1975 when he became prime minister. He succeeded as head of state in 1977. In the 1950s, Kuwait was still part of the sterling area. The main objective of the investment office within the finance department was simply to keep the country's oil revenue in Kuwait's sterling account in London and to transfer whatever was needed to Kuwait for essential expenditures. The surplus was re-invested. In the early 1950s this meant little more than putting money on deposit with the Bank of England, which continued for many years to act as custodian as well as adviser. By the late 1950s the investment office had become more sophisticated. It was already planning how best to convert the surplus oil and budget revenues into long-term assets to guarantee future security. Until 1963 Kuwait's investments were made through British representatives on the London-based Kuwait Investment Board, which after 1959 was increasingly supervised by Mr Khalid Abu Su'ud, a Jerusalem-born Palestinian, under the authority of Sheikh Jaber. Mr Abu Su'ud is still the Emir's investment adviser. Kuwait left the sterling area after independence. Its currency was changed from the Indian rupee to the Kuwaiti dinar, and in 1963 the investment board was replaced by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) chaired by the Kuwaiti ambassador in London, Mr Khalid Jaffar. The KIO's first general manager was Mr Bader Bazi until Sheikh Fahad al-Sabah took over in 1967, bringing Mr Fouad Jaffer as his deputy. They remained at the top of KIO until 1992. By 1963 the investment department of the finance ministry was becoming more experienced, but it kept its conservative bias. Assets were no longer restricted to the UK. The enactment of the Kuwaiti companies' law and the commercial code enabled part of the state's reserves to be used to develop Kuwait's economy through shareholding companies such as Kuwait Investment Company; Kuwait Foreign Trading, Contracting &amp; Investment Company; Kuwait Transport Company; Kuwait Airways Corporation; Kuwait Savings Bank. There was also the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, which became the financial arm of Kuwait's foreign policy. In 1963, Sheikh Jaber set up an international advisory committee, whose members were drawn from captains of western industry and finance. Until the 1970s BP, together with the US's Gulf Oil, remained pivotal in Kuwait's upstream and downstream petroleum industry. Sheikh Jaber delegated Mr Abu Su'ud, by now the director of the investment department at the finance ministry, to run the state's investment portfolio. For most of the 1960s the volume of investments was counted in hundreds of millions of pounds sterling rather than in billions. But as the assets grew, so investments diversified: fixed interest securities or floating rate notes or other negotiable instruments; first-class listed equity; feasible long-term projects including direct investments and real estate. In the 1970s the geographical spread started to include Japan for medium-term investments. Investments started also to be made in Hongkong, Taiwan, South Korea, and Australia, often through the London market, still regarded as the world's financial centre, but many also through the Hongkong stock exchange. Direct investments, including real estate holdings, were never allowed to account for more than 5-6 per cent of the total portfolio. This contrasts with the existing 30 per cent balance (23 per cent if Spain is excluded), after the excesses of the late 1980s and the early 1990s. The combination of writing off the Dollars 5bn Spanish fiasco and guidelines implemented under the present management will bring the proportion of direct investments down to 10 per cent of the total. But the intention is to bring them down still further to the 5-6 per cent fixed by Sheikh Jaber in the 1960s. How the Spanish connection careered out of control is a separate story now the subject of court proceedings in London and Spain. The bulk of the direct and property investments were initiated after the first oil price rises in 1973-74; in Britain through St Martins Holding Company - property, manufacturing, health-care and foodstuffs: in the US through Foster Lane. Both have had mixed fortunes, though despite everything Foster Lane is still reported to have assets of some Dollars 3bn. The West German investments were the direct result of the presence on the KIA's advisory committee of Dr Hermann Abs, former head of the Deutsche Bank (who died this month). Daimler-Benz was the first of many; Hoechst and Metallgesellschaft followed. In normal times the size of these individual holdings would have exceeded the six per cent limit. But in the mid-1970s the volume of funds accruing to the Kuwait Investment Office's account were anything but normal. Kuwait's reserves were growing at an unprecedented rate; the investments were long-term in companies whose shares were considered blue-chips. Prior to 1976 all of Kuwait's surplus was in the General Reserve Fund (GRF). In that year the Reserve Fund for Future Generations (RFFG) was created, and into it was put half of the total assets - and all of the quality assets - of the GRF. In addition, the RFFG was henceforth to receive each year 10 per cent of the state's oil revenue. Today the RFFG includes all the liquid assets plus Kuwait's quota to the IMF and the Arab Monetary Fund, the World Bank and its affiliate, the International Finance Corporation. By contrast the GRF has the rump of unproductive assets; loan assets on the books of the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development including loans to such countries as Sudan, Iraq and other previous beneficiaries now bankrupt; the capital of Kuwait's own Central Bank and Kuwait Petroleum Corporation which by definition cannot be touched; plus government holdings in 63 local companies of which 42 are listed on the Kuwait stock exchange. Theoretically, these last have a capitalisation of KD800m-KD1bn, representing an average holding of between 20-25 per cent of all quoted companies. If both confidence and opportunities returned, the government could over time sell these assets to a rejuvenated private sector, but today they are worthless. In 1981, the investment department at the finance ministry was superseded by the KIA as a separate sovereign entity. This was at the height of the second oil boom when Mr Abdel-Latif Yousef al-Hamad was finance minister. He has many supporters who claim that had he been left in charge the country would have been spared the worst of its financial troubles. Tough, extremely able and of unquestioned integrity, Mr al-Hamad would in time have ensured that the authority of the KIA imposed itself on the KIO. But his recipe for dealing with the fall-out from the Souk al-Manakh disaster was politically too drastic for the government of the day. His departure meant the finance ministry reverted to Sheikh Ali al-Khalifah al-Sabah, who was already the oil minister; and the managing directorship of the KIA went in 1984 to a relatively unknown Kuwait university economics professor, Dr Fahd al-Rashid. Sheikh Ali remained finance and oil minister until 1985 when he ceded the former role to Mr Jassem al-Khorafi, a prominent businessman. As a result of all these changes the KIO in London became stronger than its parent, a classic example of the tail wagging the dog. But the implications of all these developments were already blurred, not only by the general paralysis in the financial community caused by the crash of the Souk al-Manakh, but also because, by the end of 1983, income from overseas assets was equal to the country's income from oil. So who was to complain at the time if the KIO made all the running? As far as most people could see it was delivering the goods; and Sheikh Jaber's original guidelines were still largely in place. Among these was the stipulation that, direct investments apart, the KIA/KIO should not take more than one per cent in any one company. If for example KIA invested Dollars 1bn in the US equity market, the investment was spread among 400 companies. The conservatism of Kuwait's investment policy unexpectedly came to light in 1985 when a disgruntled former employee of Chase Manhattan in New York leaked Chase's Kuwait portfolio to the press. Its structure and balance reflected the sound nature of a cross-section of Kuwait's overseas portfolio. Most blue-chip stocks were represented; the structure was exactly what would have been expected from cautious trustees of any large family trust. The year 1985 saw another landmark: the dissolution of the national assembly amid clear signs that it intended to take a much tougher line on the issue of public accountability. It had already forced the resignation of the-then justice minister, Sheikh Salman al-Duaij al-Sabah. But even without the benefit of a suspicious parliament, the authorities by 1989 were sufficiently concerned about the direction of KIO's operations for a new executive and supervisory board to be set up. Its work however was interrupted by the August 1990 Iraqi invasion and occupation. In fact, no audit of the KIO was done between 1990-1992. The pre-war executive and supervisory board was disbanded after liberation, and a new one appointed. This consists of the KIA's managing director Mr Ali Rashaid al-Bader; Mr Abdul Abu Hasan, an ex-chairman of Burgan Bank and former deputy-governor of the Central Bank; Mr Bader Mokhaizum, chairman of Kuwait Finance House, and Mr Abu Su'ud. The soundness of the original guidelines laid down by Sheikh Jaber was evident when the crunch came in August 1990. Within months Kuwait was obliged to fund the war effort. Some Dollars 30bn was liquidated at short notice with healthy capital gains intact. In less than a year, a second tranche of almost the same amount had to be found. Altogether 60 per cent of Kuwait's overseas assets were sold - discreetly, without moving or affecting the market, and realising all their capital gains. It was masterful. The Dollars 5bn loss in Spain has been more than made up by an appreciation in the last year of the overall portfolio of some 40 per cent on the approximate Dollars 35bn which remained intact after the sell-offs. These gains will more than cover the projected 1993-94 budget deficit of Dollars 5bn - plus if necessary off-budget defence commitments as well. The strategy now is to have not more than 20 per cent of the total portfolio in any one country or market or sector. Existing distribution reflects a rough balance between the five main investment areas: North America; the UK; Europe; Japan; and south-east Asia. The proportion of direct investments, including property, to the portfolio as a whole will be reduced to 10 per cent, with the longer-term aim to bring them back down to 5-6 per cent of the total. The strategy allows for KIA to take over a company, but the acquisition of any company has to keep within these renewed guidelines. Existing exposure in direct investments excluding Spain is 23 per cent of the total; including Spain they amount to some 30 per cent. Offices are to be opened in all the principal locations, with outside investment managers in charge of day-to-day operations for individual portfolios. So in spite of war, invasion, past mismanagement and scandals, Kuwait's overseas assets, possibly the lifeblood of the next generation, have survived to grow again. The foundations laid 35 years ago have stood the test of time.</p>

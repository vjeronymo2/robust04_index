			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / International Company News: Second trader dismissed by Kidder Kidder, Peabody, the Wall Street investment bank which fired its top bond trader a week ago for faking Dollars 350m in profits, has dismissed a second trader for concealing about Dollars 10m in losses from derivatives trades. Although the firm said the two episodes were not related, the firing of Mr Neil Margolin, a trader on Kidder's interest rate swaps desk, is a further embarrassment for the firm. It raises fresh questions about the effectiveness of the firm's systems for monitoring the activities of its traders. Kidder is reviewing those systems in the wake of the first incident. Mr Margolin's hidden losses were not discovered by Kidder - he was dismissed after telling the firm about the losses. He had been at Kidder since 1986. The firm said the roughly Dollars 10m shortfall run up by Mr Margolin did not affect Kidder's customers or trading counterparties. The losses would be covered by the firm's operating reserves. The incident will have no impact on the earnings of Kidder's parent, General Electric. Last week, GE was forced to take a Dollars 210m charge against its first-quarter earnings to cover the Dollars 350m in fake profits reported by Kidder in previous terms because of an illicit 'phantom' trading scheme run by Mr Joseph Jett, head of the government bond trading desk. Mr Jett was dismissed when the fake profits were uncovered, and six other employees were suspended pending an investigation.</p>

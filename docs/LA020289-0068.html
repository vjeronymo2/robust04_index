			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW YORK OFFERS PRINCESS DIANA BOTH PROTOCOL, PROTESTS  </P> <P> Hours before the Princess of Wales stepped off the British Concorde at Kennedy  Airport on Wednesday, one of her spokesmen tried to give an etiquette lesson to  New York's hyper-aggressive press corps.  </P> <P> "The Princess of Wales doesn't operate in every way like a President of the  United States or like a senior political figure," Francis Cornish of the  British Information Service, explained.  </P> <P> "If people think it would be a good idea to shout questions, I can tell you  here and now that you won't get an answer. Frankly, you're more likely to get  the back of her head," he warned. "She will not give any interviews."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Koch Pledges Politeness  </P> <P> New York's normally outspoken Mayor Edward I. Koch pledged, meanwhile, that he  would be polite and "not rain on her parade."  </P> <P> "This is a young woman who has nothing to do but represent the royal family in  a royal way," Koch said. The mayor said that, above all, he would not bring up  the touchy subject of Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to do that," Koch told reporters. "I don't happen to agree with  the British government's position with respect to Northern Ireland. I believe  that the phrase 'Brits out of Ireland' still applies. But I'm not going to  insult this young woman."  </P> <P> Welcome to the Big Apple, Lady Di.  </P> <P> The princess' three-day, high-profile visit is designed to stress social causes  and to push British products ranging from cashmere sweaters to a toy called  Thomas the Tank Engine -- a railroad locomotive with a happy smiling face.  </P> <P> Irish-American foes of British rule in Northern Ireland promised to protest the  visit, especially when the 27-year-old princess attends the Welsh Opera's  American premiere, a performance of "Falstaff" tonight at the Brooklyn Academy  of Music. After the final curtain and a backstage visit with the cast, she is  to be the honored guest at a lavish dinner in the soaring glass and steel  Winter Garden at the World Financial Center in Lower Manhattan.  </P> <P> During her visit to New York, Diana is staying in a flower-filled  $1,800-a-night deluxe duplex hotel suite with deep red walls with its own  solarium and terrace -- but without Prince Charles, who remains at home to hand  out awards to a variety of Britons, including dairy farmers.  </P> <P> "The prince and princess receive several thousands of invitations a year in the  U.K. and abroad," explained Dickie Arbiter, assistant press secretary to the  queen. "In order to satisfy the thousands of requests that come in, they have  to split their resources."  </P> <P> Just before dinner time, smiling and looking radiant in a royal blue wool coat  and a string of pearls, Diana arrived amid heavy security at Kennedy Airport  and rushed off to her first stop, a reception hosted by a firm that produces  Scottish cashmere.  </P> <P> She also will promote British toy manufacturers by visiting FAO Schwarz, the  huge 5th Avenue toy store.  </P> <P> The trip will also stress social problems. Diana will tour the Henry Street  Settlement's Urban Family Center in Lower Manhattan, a pioneering program  serving as an alternative to welfare hotels for homeless families, and Harlem  Hospital's pediatric AIDS unit.  </P> <P> "I think the people are pretty excited," said Fred Winters, a hospital  spokesman. "I think all Americans are excited when they meet royalty."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the princess said that her visits to Harlem Hospital and the  Henry Street shelter were designed to follow up some of her own social  interests in England.  </P> <P> "She is aware these are problems that loom large on the New York scene," he  said.  </P> <P> When Prince Charles visited New York some years ago, he was picketed heavily by  Irish-Americans protesting British rule in Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> Nassau County Comptroller Peter King, chairman of the Committee for Legal  Justice in Northern Ireland, said he would lead similar protests outside the  Brooklyn Academy of Music.  </P></p>

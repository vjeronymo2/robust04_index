			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUGMON DOESN'T MIND PLAYING A LOW-PROFILE ROLE FOR UNLV  </P> <P> There was a time was when Stacey Augmon was Nevada Las Vegas' go-to guy -- for  offense, for defense, for radio interviews, television interviews and newspaper  interviews.  </P> <P> He was an Olympian two years ago, player of the year in the Big West Conference  last season.  </P> <P> Then came Larry Johnson, and Augmon became just another guy. Johnson became the  only first-team All-American UNLV has had, and Augmon became honorable mention  all-conference, not even in the top 10.  </P> <P> Johnson is Augmon's close friend and roommate on the road, and Augmon said  Johnson is welcome to the role of team spokesman.  </P> <P> "He took a lot of the attention, which is what I wanted, as far as everyone not  coming to me," Augmon said.  </P> <P> But even Augmon has taken note of the reviews of his performance this season,  pinning this headline from the Las Vegas Sun to the wall of his room: Stacey  Augmon Isn't Living Up to His Expectations.  </P> <P> "That's their opinion," he said. "It doesn't bother me too much. . . . I know  my potential. I know what I can do."  </P> <P> Augmon struggled in the early games of the season when he was forced to play  three different positions in the absence of center David Butler, who was  academically ineligible for the first six games.  </P> <P> But one of his best games came against Temple, when he was forced to defend  against guard Mark Macon because Anderson Hunt was ineligible for the game.  Macon scored only 11 points.  </P> <P> At other times, Augmon's defensive reputation has been sullied. Oklahoma  State's Byron Houston scored 27 points off him. Arizona's Jud Buechler scored  21. And more than once, Coach Jerry Tarkanian took Augmon off an opponent's top  player, in one case putting Butler on Cal State Fullerton's Cedric Ceballos.  </P> <P> But when the Big West tournament came around last week, so did Augmon.  </P> <P> The Rebels got into position to be seeded No. 1 in the West in part by sweeping  through the Big West tournament, winning by an average of 22 points a game.  Augmon had some of his best games of the season, averaging 18 points in the  tournament, five points a game better than his average.  </P> <P> "It was the tournament, and we had to win to get the top seed," Augmon said.  </P> <P> Said Tarkanian: "I think he is one of the keys to how we do in this (NCAA)  tournament."  </P> <P> The season of little renown has not bothered Augmon, but what would bother him  is falling short of the NCAA championship. UNLV is playing with four starters  who made it to the final eight last season, plus Johnson.  </P> <P> "I feel great about the whole situation," said Augmon, whose team plays  Arkansas Little Rock (20-9) in a West Regional first-round game today. "My team  is in position."  </P> <P> UNLV lost to Seton Hall in the West Regional final last season. Augmon says the  team was tired last year, and that this year they are fresh, and ready.  </P> <P> "It's now tournament time, like everyone says, 'March Madness,' " Augmon said.  "I want to take the team up a notch. If we do well, we can help Dave (Butler)  in the (NBA) draft. If we win it all, we can get him in the first round, and  get Larry (Johnson) player of the year."  </P> <P> And what would be in it for Augmon?  </P> <P> "Oh, I don't know," Augmon said. "Honorable mention?"  </P> <P> West Regional Notes  </P> <P> Arkansas Little Rock does not want for tournament experience. In 1986, the  Trojans upset Notre Dame, then lost to North Carolina State in double overtime.  Last season, they lost to Louisville by five points in the first round. . . .  Arkansas Little Rock played Oklahoma this season, losing, 134-81. UNLV lost to  Oklahoma, 89-81. . . . UNLV has added a coaching consultant for the tournament:  Ron Adams, the Fresno State coach who resigned near the end of the season when  he learned his contract would not be renewed. Adams, a master of the matchup  zone, was with the team at practice this week but did not travel with the team.  </P> <P> Oregon State (22-6) will be making its 16th NCAA appearance when it plays Ball  State (24-6) today. The Beavers are making their third consecutive trip, and  have a record of 12-18 in NCAA games. They reached the Final Four twice, in  1949 and 1963. Other games today: Louisville (26-7) vs. Idaho (25-5), Ohio  State (16-12) vs. Providence (17-11).  </P></p>

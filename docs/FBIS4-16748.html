			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ukrainian Navy Commander, Vice Admiral Volodymyr  Bezkorovaynyy, has urged the republic's sailors to refrain from  actions that lead to confrontation and agitation. In a message  to the Ukrainian navy personnel on Monday, he calls for  preparing within 10 days a new round of talks on naval problems.    In his opinion, what happened in Odessa has been settled for  good, and neither Ukraine nor Russia should refocus on it. He  also called for displaying restraint, standing firm against  provocations, and disturbing actions that might complicate  relations between the Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's Navy.    On the same day, Bezkorovaynyy sent a letter to the Mayor of  Sevastopol in connection with the city council's plan to discuss  what happened between the Black Sea Fleet and Ukrainian seamen  in Odessa on 8-9 April at an emergency session. The message  blames the incident "on the gross violation of the Ukrainian  Constitution and laws by some Black Sea Fleet officials."    In this connection, Bezkorovaynyy suggested that the council  consider the expediency of holding an emergency session or of  postponing it for a later date.    In his opinion, by declaring its allegiance to the  presidents  of Ukraine and Russia, the Black Sea Fleet has virtually gone  out of the Ukrainian leadership's control and become subordinate  to the Russian military alone. All this leads to arbitrariness  and impunity, he said.    According to the agreement signed in Zavidovo in 1992, the  Black Sea Navy Commander is subordinate to the presidents of  Ukraine and Russia alone.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ONE WOMAN'S CHOICE -- PREGNANCY SERVES AS TEST  </P> <P> I'm getting sick and tired of hearing about pro-choice and all these women who  are for abortion. Today's article (Dec. 3) by Dianne Klein was such a warm,  touching, positive story, it left me with tears on my cheeks.  </P> <P> Thank God this lady had the courage and faith in Jesus to keep this child,  knowing that the odds of abnormality were high.  </P> <P> Thank God she went by the hospital to visit the baby and felt that tugging in  her heart to take her baby home instead of put him up for adoption.  </P> <P> Thank God the father was a mature, kind and loving man to marry this woman and  to care for this child when it would have been easier to run the other way.  </P> <P> Thank God this mother was brave enough to share her story that will make a  difference in this world.  </P> <P> Thank God there are people who value life even when it starts at conception.  </P> <P> SHELLEY E. HULSIZER  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

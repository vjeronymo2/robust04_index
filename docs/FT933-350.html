			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: MoDo warns of second-half deficit MODO, a leading Swedish forestry group, said yesterday it would make a loss in the second half of this year. However, it would not exceed the SKr353m (Dollars 44m) deficit it posted in the first half. MoDo, which will launch a SKr1.7bn rights issue this week, said last month it believed the long-running recession in the European pulp and paper markets had touched bottom. It then announced plans for a one-for-two issue to help it take advantage of an upturn. A full-year loss of SKr700m or less would represent a sharp improvement over last year, when MoDo reported a SKr1.7bn shortfall. In the first half this year, operating profits leapt to SKr346m from SKr59m in the 1992 period. However MoDo warned its estimate for the second half was based on 'several uncertain economic and sectoral factors' outside its control. It is anxious that the Swedish krona remains at its present low levels, having benefited from the 25 per cent fall in its value since last year. It is also depending on no further fall in prices for its main products. The company will publish its prospectus for the new issue tomorrow. The issue, for existing holders of ordinary shares and convertible participating notes, will be priced at SKr120 per share, compared with a current price on the Stockholm stock exchange of around SKr210 for its most-traded B shares.</p>

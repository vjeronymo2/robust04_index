			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Property: Long faces on the moor GROUSE-shooting started two days ago, but there is not the usual joy. Bookings have been slow, sporting agents report, reflecting Lloyd's losses and general anxiety. A tale of woe? Not necessarily. The English and southern Scottish moors will bounce back in a year as nature corrects itself. In the Highlands, many owners will wait till next month to start regular shoots. An unusual season will thus run into October and may end not so badly after all. If 1993 is a late year, it will still be expensive as prices for shooting have not fallen. Regardless of the sport, owners have costs, and a large moor needs three or four keepers. Few owners can afford to run their moors for themselves and friends. The usual system now is to let off days of shooting with a contract specifying an agreed number of birds. The price in the Highlands is Pounds 80-Pounds 85 a brace (plus VAT) for driven grouse, when beaters drive the birds towards the guns. A typical contract for eight guns will specify 60 brace. In northern England the price may be Pounds 60 a brace, for 200 pairs. The resulting bills easily reach Pounds 500 a gun a day in Scotland and Pounds 1,000 in England. Let shooting may still be available this season. London agents such as Strutt &amp; Parker or Egerton can arrange it, taking a 7.5 per cent commission from the tenant. Or there are small local firms such as Macsport. The grand alternative to renting by the day or week is to buy a sporting estate. But few are for sale. It is partly a side-effect of conditions in the property market this year. Buyers are willing but vendors have held back. In 1992 prices of the few estates that were sold were at about half their peaks of the late 1980s, Guy Galbraith of Savills' Edinburgh office, reports, working out at around Pounds 2,000 a brace of grouse, Pounds 15,000-Pounds 17,000 per stag, and Pounds 8,000 per salmon (based on average catches over the previous five years). Prices may have improved slightly this year but the market is still stagnant. It need not be. Owners and factors (managers) are gloomy, Galbraith finds, but there is some optimism where it matters - among the keepers. Clegg Kennedy Drew offers a driven grouse moor with a cottage at Auchenleck Hill in Dumfriesshire for Pounds 180,000 (averaging 56.5 brace). If you prefer pheasant shooting, Brodies is selling Drumlamford at Barrhill in Ayrshire, an 1830 house with 771 acres in the main lot as well as holiday cottages, at over Pounds 550,000. Stenton, near Dunkeld, in Perthshire, is a grander house (agent: Knight Frank &amp; Rutley). The price of Pounds 1.2m reflects its fishing on the Tay more than its small family shoot. Outside Scotland, Plas Llechylched has 72 acres on the Isle of Anglesey with shooting rights over a further 811 acres for geese, woodcock, snipe and duck, from Denton Clark and Clegg Kennedy Drew at Pounds 450,000. In Cornwall, Colquite, near Bodmin, has a pheasant shoot (8,235 birds in 1991-92), plus a shooting lodge, two cottages, barn, land and fishing on the River Camel. On offer last September at over Pounds 2m, it is now priced at Pounds 1.65m (Jackson-Stops). To shoot near London, the 196-acre Skeete estate at Lyminge in Kent could attract at Pounds 550,000 (Egerton). There is over a year to prepare its small, private shoot for continental guests emerging from the Channel Tunnel for the 1994-95 season (but leaving their dogs behind).

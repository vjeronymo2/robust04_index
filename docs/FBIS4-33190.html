			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] On Monday night, Carlos Almada, director of the  Federal Voter Registry [Registro Federal de Electores -- RFE]  and Samuel del Villar, representative of the PRD [Party of the  Democratic Revolution] to the Federal Electoral Institute [IFE],  held a 45-minute debate on the electoral registry. The central  topic of debate was the mechanisms used to certify the  trustworthiness of the electoral registry. Here is a report by  Francisco Rubio:    [Begin recording] [Rubio] On one side was a PRD alternate  representative, who aggressively made charges of alleged  irregularities in the electoral registry, and on the other side  was the RFE executive director, who one by one rebutted the  attacks with answers backed by the figures that have already  been released to the public. Samuel del Villar, alternate PRD  representative to the IFE, said the irregularities detected by  the PRD members in the electoral registry are the result of the  connection between the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party],  IFE, and Salinas de Gortari.    [Del Villar] We began by confirming the Salinas-PRI-IFE-RFE  connection with regard to the authority to grant voting cards  and to make registrations in the list of voters.    [Rubio] The response was not long in coming. Regarding  charges about close links between former IFE officials and now  state authorities, RFE Executive Director Carlos Almada said  personal biographies were not the issue.    [Almada] I categorically reject the conclusions and the  analyses of Dr. del Villar this evening. They simply do not  coincide with reality.    [Rubio] Amid countless technical explanations that diverted  viewers' attention for several moments, Carlos Almada reiterated  that of the 50 million Mexicans [eligible to vote], 47 million  are registered in the electoral registry. He said 44 million  have voting cards that have their photographs. Therefore, they  will appear in the voters' list. In other words, 95 percent of  Mexicans [eligible to vote] can cast their vote. He ruled out  that there are ghost voters.    [Almada] The ghosts are of flesh and blood. We find them in  Tabasco. We find them in the Federal District. We can go see  them whenever you want.    [Rubio] Nevertheless, there was no clear explanation by the  RFE executive director about the high cost of the external audit  of the electoral register by eight private companies, one of  them the Mackinsey firm which, according to Samuel del Villar,  is also linked to the PRI.    [Almada] As for the sum for Mackinsey, the accountants will  see to it and will resolve it.    [Rubio] During the televised debate between Samuel del  Villar  and Carlos Almada, there were no winners or losers, only a  society more informed about the environment that will prevail  during the 21 August elections.

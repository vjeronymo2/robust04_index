			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / World Trade News: EC-Japan row over car imports likely - Drive to agree market forecast fails JAPAN and the European Community have failed to agree a forecast for the evolution of the EC car market in 1993, increasing the possibility of a damaging dispute between the two partners over Japanese car imports. Officials met last week to discuss the outlook for 1993, but broke up inconclusively. In November, the Japanese suggested EC sales might increase during 1993. Since then, they have conceded that the outlook is more pessimistic, but EC officials said yesterday the two sides were still far apart. The officials will meet again in Tokyo early next month for further discussions. Under the 1991 EC-Japan agreement on car imports, agreed forecasts form the basis for Japan to 'monitor' its exports to the EC. The monitoring is part of a deal to open the EC market gradually to full competition from Japan by the end of the century. European Commission officials said yesterday they hoped a delay of about a month would allow them to collect more data on the first weeks of 1993. Neither the Commission nor the Japanese would indicate how much they expected EC car sales to decrease this year, but European manufacturers expect them to decline by as much as 7.5 per cent. According to the European industry, January sales dropped sharply compared with 1992, partly because people bought new cars in December, to avoid January tax increases in some EC countries. Germany's sales last month fell by 30 per cent compared with the equivalent period in 1992, French sales slipped by 37 per cent, Italian by 15 per cent and Spanish by 50 per cent; British sales increased by 8 per cent. But even if the two sides can agree on a 1993 forecast next month they are still likely to argue about what action should be taken. Tokyo has always disputed the EC's interpretation that in a shrinking market Japan should absorb three-quarters of the reduction, by limiting exports. A year ago, the two sides agreed there would be a slight decline in EC sales during 1992 and Japanese imports were held back in line with EC wishes. In the event, the December surge meant slightly more cars were sold in the EC during 1992 than in 1991.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Sky expands satellite horizon MR RUPERT Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, yesterday formally launched Sky Multi-Channels with the help of a live boa constrictor, a Humphrey Bogart lookalike and hordes of children. Beneath the inevitable razzmatazz as the 18 channels in the new Sky Television package were announced is one fundamental fact. More channels are being offered to viewers but fewer are 'free'. Satellite television, at least from British Sky Broadcasting (in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake) will from now on be essentially a subscription service paid for monthly. Of the original six Sky Television channels only Sky News will be freely available across Europe. Without a subscription viewers will no longer be able to see Sky One, the most popular Sky channel. For the consumer, the new arithmetic of subscription television costs Pounds 6.99 a month - Pounds 3.99 a month until the end of the year. Viewers will be able to get a 12-channel package ranging from Sky One (general entertainment) and Discovery (documentaries), to Country Music Television, UK Living (aimed at women) and Nickelodeon, a channel aimed at children. Within this package of channels, and apart from Sky News, only MTV, the music video channel, will be available without subscription. Buy one of the premium services such as Sky Sports or Sky Movies and the monthly bill rises to Pounds 11.99. The entire package will cost Pounds 19.99 a month. The broadcasters such as Viacom and United Artists Programming of the US, who have joined the package, will get 15p a subscriber each month. The move to subscription represents both a considerable risk and a considerable opportunity for Mr Murdoch. If the UK public was to decide that it did not want to pay more for extra channels of television, Sky could run into increasing opposition. But if more viewers can be persuaded to pay for extra television then an increasingly powerful stream of revenue could be generated which could make BSkyB and its affiliated channels one of the most powerful forces in British broadcasting. As Sky launched a Pounds 15m advertising campaign yesterday the signs were that the gamble would pay off. Sky said that on Tuesday alone its customer centre at Livingston, in Lothian, received more than 65,000 calls - most of them inquiring about signing up for the new package. Sky said that new dish sales were running at about 20,000 a week, the highest for a long time, although the total growth this year, which is estimated between 700,000 and 800,000, compares with about 1m last year. Mr Murdoch will face new competition in October from Mr Ted Turner, who plans to launch two new channels in the UK - TNT, a channel which includes films, and the Cartoon Network. These are in addition to his existing Cable News Network. All three will be available without subscription and could form the nucleus of a collection of channels funded by advertising. Mr Murdoch yesterday took credit for the push that has taken satellite television from four channels to 32 in four years - although many of the channels are German. 'It was our marketing drive that got the dishes on the roofs so that the new multi-channel signals could be received,' he said. The launch coincided with a forecast by stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite that there could be 800,000 subscribers to the new basic package by the end of the year and that BSkyB would make a pre-tax profit of Pounds 68m next year. The stockbroker puts a value of Pounds 2.5bn on BSkyB. Whether that turns out to be true will depend on viewers.</p>

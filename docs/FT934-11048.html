			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / Salinas calls for civility in elections PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas yesterday called on all Mexico's political parties to sign a pact of civility to ensure 'transparent and exemplary' presidential elections next August. In his annual state of the nation address, President Salinas promised the contenders 'full respect, abiding by the terms of the law, and proper conditions for them to present their options to Mexicans in full freedom'. Mexico's 1988 presidential election, which brought Mr Salinas to power, was widely held by observers to have been marred by ballot-rigging. Mr Salinas's government has recently passed new democratic reforms, but they have been dismissed as inadequate by the main opposition candidate, Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, and some foreign and domestic observers. Despite the call for an electoral pact, Mr Salinas suggested there would no more significant concessions to the opposition. The president appeared to rule out the possibility of foreign observers participating in the electoral process, saying 'only Mexicans' would be the guardians of 'our' democracy. The president announced that Mexico's reserves rose to Dollars 23.017bn at the end of October, from Dollars 22.597bn. The high level of reserves seems to dispel fears that there has been an outflow of capital provoked by uncertainties over the North American Free Trade Agreement. The executive branch is due soon to send the Mexican Congress legislation that will make the central bank independent. The legislation may be in place, and possibly the head of the bank named, before the vote on Nafta expected on November 17 in the US Congress.</p>

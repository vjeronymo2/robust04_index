			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOLPHIN DEFENSE SACKS JETS IN 17-3 VICTORY;  </P> <P> AFC: THE NFL'S STINGIEST TEAM GIVES UP ONLY 154 YARDS AND HAS FIVE SACKS TO  INCREASE ITS LEAGUE-LEADING TOTAL TO 35.  </P> <P> The Miami Dolphins' defense continues to dominate.  </P> <P> The Dolphins limited the New York Jets to 154 yards and extended their winning  streak to six games Sunday with a 17-3 victory.  </P> <P> The Dolphins (8-1), who are off to their best start since 1984, have not given  up a touchdown in four consecutive games and have not yielded a rushing  touchdown in 24 quarters.  </P> <P> Miami sacked Ken O'Brien five times -- increasing the Dolphins' league-leading  total to 35 -- and intercepted two of his passes.  </P> <P> "Our defense makes one big play after another," said Dolphin Coach Don Shula,  whose team is tied with Buffalo for first place in the AFC East. "Those five  sacks kept the Jets from moving."  </P> <P> The score was 3-3 after a first half that was played in 25 m.p.h winds.  </P> <P> Then, on the first series of the third quarter, a towering punt by Miami's  Reggie Roby hit New York's James Hasty and was recovered by Greg Baty at the  Jet six.  </P> <P> One play later, Dan Marino connected with Tony Paige on a four-yard touchdown  pass play.  </P> <P> Later in the quarter, Dolphin kicker Pete Stoyanovich missed a 53-yard  field-goal attempt, his first miss in 14 tries dating back to last year.  </P> <P> On the next play, Tim McKyer intercepted a pass by O'Brien and returned it 15  yards to the Jet 34, losing the ball as he stepped out of bounds. The ball  stayed in bounds and Johnny Hector of the Jets fell on it.  </P> <P> The officials first gave the ball to the Dolphins, then replay official Bill  Swanson reversed that call and gave the ball to the Jets (4-6).  </P> <P> However, after another huddle on the field, the ball was awarded to the  Dolphins when referee Dick Hantak said "an inadvertent whistle" had stopped the  play when McKyer went out of bounds.  </P> <P> "I don't know what happened," McKyer said. "I might have stepped out. I heard a  whistle. When I saw all the huddling, I didn't know what the deal was."  </P> <P> Six plays later, Marc Logan scored on a one-yard run to make the score 17-3  with 12:47 left in the game.  </P> <P> Overall, Miami's two touchdown drives covered 40 yards.  </P> <P> "You like to think you can capitalize when you get the opportunity and not make  mistakes yourself," Shula said. "We managed to do that, but I never felt safe.  We were never comfortable."  </P> <P> Marino completed 21 of 36 passes for 192 yards.  </P> <P> Troy Stradford had seven receptions for 53 yards and also gained 46 yards in  eight carries for the Dolphins. Sammie Smith gained 70 yards in 11 carries.  </P> <P> O'Brien completed 12 of 25 passes for 106 yards.  </P> <P> Al Toon of the Jets caught three passes for 40 yards, the 72nd consecutive game  in which he has caught at least one pass.  </P> <P> Dolphin receiver Mark Clayton had one reception for 11 yards, extending his  streak to 61 games.  </P></p>

The CSU no longer rules out its withdrawal from the Bonn  coalition and its republic-wide expansion following the 1994  Bundestag elections. Such a step would also spell an end to the  community of the two parties in Bonn, something the CSU had  decided before, on 19 November 1976, under its former chairman,  Franz-Josef Strauss, and had rescinded on 12 December of the  same year.    Following the three-day meeting, CSU Land Group Chairman  Michael Glos said in Munich on 8 January that the closed CSU  meeting in the Upper Bavarian spa of Kreuth also discussed such  options in the event of a grand coalition in Bonn.    Glos called upon the CDU to demonstrate more willingness to  fight. The larger sister party had to learn from the CSU "that  elections can only be won in unity." He said that, being a  realist, he advocated another coalition with the liberals  following the 1994 Bundestag elections. This would, however,  not be a "love match," but a deliberate marriage in which the  accounts "match."    An internal strategy paper of the land group chairman that  WELT AM SONNTAG has obtained shows that the CSU considers the  CDU situation to be "alarming." The sister party seems to be  "torn by inner conflicts." The CSU is above all anticipating  "with concern" the results for the CDU in the first Landtag  elections this year, in Lower Saxony on 13 March. The party  will "greatly suffer" from the fact that the attacks against  former CDU/CSU presidential candidate Steffen Heitmann, who has  since meanwhile resigned from his candidacy, were above all  conducted from Lower Saxony.    Following the recent differences between CSU Chief Theo  Waigel and Bavarian CSU Minister President Edmund Stoiber, Glos  admitted that the CSU has also made mistakes in European policy.  For instance, the Maastricht Treaties appeared to have been  approved too rapidly, without having first been sufficiently  discussed with the citizens. Glos confirmed, however, that "all  differences on crucial matters" between Waigel and Stoiber were  settled at the closed meeting.    A heated dispute also broke out in the meeting on 8 January  over the presentation of Roman Herzog, the new CDU/CSU  presidential candidate, and on the CDU's election strategy in  the new laender.    WELT AM SONNTAG learned from the Chancellor's Office that  CDU  Chairman Helmut Kohl was not happy with the fact that Waigel  announced the basic agreement on Herzog as a joint candidate  prematurely and on his own on 6 January.    CDU Secretary General Peter Hintze stressed: "We have  different ideas on how to deal with such a candidacy  appropriately." Glos rejected such criticism. "Mr. Hintze  should look at himself first. We do not need any advice on how  to handle such a thing," he told WELT AM SONNTAG.    CSU Secretary General Erwin Huber also accused the CDU of  "serious strategic mistakes" regarding the struggle for voters  in the new laender. Huber told WELT AM SONNTAG that the party  "failed to challenge the Party of Democratic Socialism, the  successor of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, as would have  been necessary."</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> HIGH STYLE;  </P> <P> BOLD BOLIDIST  </P> <P> MASSIMO IOSA-GHINI, based in Bologna, Italy, helped write a manifesto in 1982  that exhorted designers to "break the reign of the angular line" and "find once  more the sinuous curve." Bolidismo is derived from bolide, the Italian word for  a fast-moving object (such as a speeding bullet), or an object whose appearance  implies speed.  </P> <P> Iosa-Ghini followed up his Bolidist manifesto with an appealing series of  chairs, cabinets and table-top accessories for such marques as Memphis and  Moroso. The pieces combine the exuberance of his early work as a set designer  and cartoonist with a smiling look back at 20th-Century design influences --  including futurism (the avant-garde movement preceding World War I that  romanced the wind-swept, streamlined look of ships, bridges and airplanes);  Buck Rogers ('30s and '40s science fiction), and '50s moderne (furniture with  skinny, pointy legs). On an architectural scale, he created Bolido, a New York  nightclub and restaurant that boasts sweeping stair rails, murals of spaceships  (or are they ocean liners?) and a bar seemingly poised for takeoff.  </P> <P> Iosa-Ghini's Collezione Bolidista furniture for Moroso includes the Curva  pullup chair (about $600), the big upholstered Balzo armchair (about $2,500)  and the Plana bench (about $1,600).  </P> <P> Collezione Bolidista furniture is available at Palazzetti, 9008 Beverly Blvd.,  Los Angeles; (213) 273-2225.DAVID LASKER  </P></p>

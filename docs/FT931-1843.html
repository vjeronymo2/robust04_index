			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / BA holds back on fresh peace talks BRITISH AIRWAYS has made no new approach to Virgin Atlantic to resolve their 'dirty tricks' dispute since the smaller airline broke off peace talks last Friday. Asked at a news conference in Birmingham yesterday whether BA would take fresh steps to prevent a long legal battle between the two airlines, Sir Colin Marshall, BA chairman, said: 'Not at the present time'. Following the collapse of the talks Mr Richard Branson, the Virgin chairman, has threatened to take his case with new evidence to courts in the UK, the US and the European Community. Virgin officials said yesterday that they had heard nothing from BA. They added that the airline's lawyers were considering the order in which they would file legal action against BA. Sir Colin, making his first public statement on the issue since the talks collapsed, appeared to be keeping the door open for further talks. 'We've made it clear all along we're prepared to sit down and talk,' he said.</p>

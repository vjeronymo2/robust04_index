			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / East London Labour split may aid BNP Prospects of the far-right British National party strengthening its position in May's London council elections have been increased by divisions among Labour councillors in Tower Hamlets. In September the BNP took its first local authority seat by winning a Tower Hamlets council by-election. It won one of the three seats in Millwall ward from Labour after fighting its campaign on a platform of 'rights for whites'. Mr Ted Johns, a Labour councillor in Millwall, last week resigned the Labour whip and announced his intention to stand as a candidate for the newly formed East London People's Alliance in the May elections. The alliance, which has the support of Labour members unhappy about the party's performance in the wake of the BNP by-election victory, plans to field candidates elsewhere in Tower Hamlets. Anti-racist organisations expect the BNP to contest about 12 of the 50 Tower Hamlets council seats in May. The party, which has been campaigning hard in the borough since its victory in September, stands to benefit if the new alliance causes the Labour and Liberal Democrat votes to be spread more thinly. If a split in the Labour vote caused by Mr Johns's resignation enabled the BNP to win all three Millwall seats it would, under Tower Hamlets' devolved structure, control the Isle of Dogs Neighbourhood, which provides the council's services in the south of the borough. Mr Johns said yesterday he had been warned by colleagues that the East London People's Alliance risked splitting the vote and strengthening the BNP. However, he blamed in-fighting in both the Labour party and the council's controlling Liberal Democrat group since the BNP victory for causing disillusion among electors and assisting the BNP's cause. Mr Johns said: 'I will support whatever group has the best chance of defeating the BNP. 'I believe the new alliance has a good chance of top-slicing support across the parties.' An inquiry after the by-election by Lord Lester QC, a Liberal Democrat peer, found that leaflets produced by some of the Liberal Democrat party's activists had pandered to racist prejudice. Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrats accepted the findings of the inquiry earlier this month only after being threatened with suspension from the national party. September's by-election took place against a background of severe racial tension in Tower Hamlets, and community leaders say attacks on members of the Asian community and other racially motivated incidents have increased since then.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Sport: Lured by wild Irish trout - Fishing A LITTLE way out of Cahir, in the green and glorious county of Tipperary, I spotted a fine mansion standing in rolling parkland. It was, I was told, a place of refuge for priests to fight the grip of the demon drink. Innocently, I asked if it was full. 'They say they're building an extension,' my informant said with a laugh. Doubtless this was no more than just another impious calumny against the Roman Catholic church. But it occurred to me that if I needed to flee the noisome world to grapple with temptation, a grand house overlooking the finest trout river in Ireland would be no bad place for it. The river is the Suir, which rises in the Devilsbit mountains north of Thurles, flows south to the feet of the Knockmealdown mountains (what wonderful names the Irish give their gentle hills), then forges east to Waterford and the sea. Although I have fished no more than four or five of its 115 miles - with precious little to show for it - it fascinates me more than any river I have known. This is partly on account of its scale. It is, for the most part, wide, deep and powerful: it is essential to wear chest waders to fish it properly. Even more potent is the Suir's wonderful vitality, its abundance of life, which has survived innumerable atrocious incidents of pollution. It is thick with weed, bursting with insects, teeming with incredible numbers of trout. It took a master angler of a bygone era, Sir Edward Grey, to discover the Suir's fabulous potential as a dry fly river. Grey had learned the art on the exacting waters of the Itchen at Winchester, but he found the trout of the Suir almost uncatchable, even though they had at that time (around 1880) never seen a dry fly. Being a master, he kept at them. He found that if he kept low in the water and delivered the fly over the fish without drag or showing the cast, they would take. On his best day he caught 11, the two biggest each over 2 3/4 lbs. Now, I will never be a master. When I first went to the Suir, seven or eight years ago, I was mindful of Sir Edward's words, and kept at it. The difference was that in two days of the most intensive effort I did not rise a fish, let alone catch one. They fed all around me, continuously, and I cast at them. But they were contemptuous of my hamfisted pretences, and I left much subdued. A humiliation like that lingers in a chap's mind. Wherever else I caught trout, I remembered how the Suir had trounced me. Last summer I went back. I am older and wiser, I told myself, whereas the trout cannot grow wiser. This time it would be different. They were two wild days. On the first, we were at Suir Mount, downstream from Ardfinnan, where the record Irish salmon of 57 lbs was caught a long time ago. A furious wind howled upriver, making casting a dangerous farce. It quietened in the evening, giving promise of a compensatory evening rise. The promise was illusory. Next morning we went to Swiss Cottage, a magnificent stretch below the town of Cahir which is controlled by the local angling club. Here the wind was roaring upstream, unleashing frequent icy downpours and making life very unpleasant. But as we cowered in the lea of some shuddering willows, we witnessed a marvellous sight: great clouds of olive flies hatching and being hurled this way and that by the gale. The trout began feasting, and we rushed forth. Casting was a soul-destroying business, as the wind kept whipping the fly off the water or lashing the cast down on the surface like a snapped hawser. Yet every now and then providence permitted a fish to be covered properly, and then it might take. I duped two, my friend Niall three. A couple of hours of this buffeting was as much as we could stand. Local opinion suggested that shelter from the blast might be found at Ballycarron, upstream from Cahir. So it proved, and there was enough fly still hatching to keep the trout interested. I found a queue of them rising in an even-flowing run between high banks. I slithered down, balanced on a tree stump, and attacked them in a calculated, level-headed, panic-free manner. Two hours passed in a flash before the hatch petered out. By then I had caught two. If you wish to test yourself as a fly fisher, try the Suir. It and its tributaries offer an inexhaustible amount of fishing, most of which is available to the visitor at extremely modest cost. The Southern regional fisheries board has published a guide with enough information to enrich several lifetimes. There are innumerable places to stay: as good as any is Mrs Ryan's at Clonanav Farmhouse, Ballymacarbry, Clonmel, which specialises in fishing. But a word to the wise. Those who normally fish for the fat, pellet-fed, half-witted stocked trout of over-manicured English chalkstreams should be prepared for a shock. One wild Suir one-pounder will demand more of you than any of your flabby four-pounders from the Test. This fishing is more difficult than anything you have imagined. Be prepared to eat of the pie of humility.</p>

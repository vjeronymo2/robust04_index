			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: FDA should accept performance pay Sir, While welcoming the Treasury's offer to extend performance pay rather than automatic annual increments to First Division Association (FDA) civil servants, we were astonished to see the association claiming that actual pay rises for their members would be 1.25 per cent as increments were self-financing. In a recession, when recruitment is reduced and promotion delayed, incremental salary systems are bound to add a higher than normal percentage to payroll costs. It is partly for this reason that our hospital clients are examining alternatives to the Whitley Council scales, which have resulted in 4 per cent increases in payroll costs in a year with a 1.5 per cent pay limit. Only the 1.5 per cent is taken into account when health authorities and others are negotiating treatment rates, which may help to explain the financing crisis in so many hospitals. Although easy to operate, incremental systems have had their day through their automatic awards for long service but often marginal performance. I hope the FDA will not only accept the Treasury's offer but champion, more actively, reward systems that allow the opportunity to earn higher discretionary rewards. The recent Top Salaries Review Body Report highlights the increasing and serious differential between top public and private pay. If automatic increments were dropped in favour of evaluated performance increases the nation could probably be much more willing to accept a significant increase in top civil servants, judges, and, incidentally, MPs' basic pay.

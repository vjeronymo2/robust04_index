			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Observer: Listening? The surprise retirement of Midland Bank chief executive Brian Pearse once again raises the longer-term question of who will take over from Sir William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, Midland's parent. Sir William, who will be 62 this month, is well past his bank's normal retirement age and is also, incidentally, almost two years older than Pearse. Sir William is expected to soldier on for another two to three years and, on past form, John Bond, HSBC's group chief executive, would seem his logical successor. However, HSBC is a very different animal from what it was when Sir William inherited the helm from the maverick Sir Michael Sandberg in 1986. For a start, its stock market capitalisation is twice as big as that of Barclays and NatWest combined and yet it still seems to be run rather autocratically. There is a majority of non-executive directors on the HSBC board but it can hardly be described as a strong one. The loss of an independent spirit like Brian Pearse means that there will be one fewer HSBC director who is prepared to stand up and challenge Sir William's vision of the natural management succession at what is Britain's fourth biggest company.</p>

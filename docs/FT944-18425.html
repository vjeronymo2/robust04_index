			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Row erupts over digital TV code A row has broken out over a new code of conduct designed to prevent abuse of industrial power in the new age of digital television. All the UK's terrestrial broadcasters - ITV, backed by the Independent Television Commission, the BBC and Channel 4 - voted against the code at a meeting of the steering board of the European Digital Video Broadcasting project in Geneva last week. The DVB brings together 145 organisations with an interest in setting standards for the launch of digital television which should be able to offer many more channels than the analogue system. The traditional broadcasters, who hope eventually to enter digital services, fear potential abuses if a single organisation is allowed to own a proprietary 'smart card' or conditional access system while owning a subscriber management system and broadcast channels. Such vertical integration is permitted under the new code of conduct although the DVB board recommended that there should be a common scrambling system and interface so that the owner of DVB receiving equipment anywhere in Europe should be able to receive all programmes available through a single receiver. The board decided, however, that everything apart from the common scrambling system can be proprietary and subject to a licensing regime. Manufacturers will be free to include a common interface or different conditional access systems in a receiver. For ITV, the issue is whether there is one slot for a single smart card in a receiver or more than one to permit competing services. It fears that a single 'gatekeeper' could operate a monopoly against the public interest. The code specifies that, where licensing occurs 'it should be on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory grounds'. Twelve out of 17 broadcasters voted against the code although the majority in favour rose to 75 per cent when all the industrial interests were included. ITV believes the code is full of legal loopholes, and is inadequately defined and incapable of enforcement. UK broadcasters plan to campaign for further scrutiny by the European parliament - certainly in discussions on a draft directive on television signal standards and possibly through competition law.

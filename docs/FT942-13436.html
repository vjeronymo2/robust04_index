			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / IRI head ignites debate on sell-offs Mr Romano Prodi, chairman of IRI, Italy's state holding company, has accused the treasury and the industry ministry of allowing Mediobanca, the secretive Milan merchant bank, and its allies to establish a dominant position at the centre of newly privatised companies. Mr Prodi's accusations - in a letter to La Stampa, the Turin-based daily newspaper - coincided with the first shareholder assembly of Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) since the bank's privatisation in February, at which a board of directors with strong links to Mediobanca was elected. Mr Prodi pointed to a similar outcome at the previous Saturday's meeting of shareholders in Credito Italiano, the other newly privatised bank, at which 'the role of the small shareholder was all but irrelevant'. There was surprise and consternation among the BCI shareholders on Saturday when it was revealed Mr Sergio Siglienti, the respected chairman of the bank, was not on the proposed list of directors. Mr Siglienti, 67, who helped pilot BCI to the market, asked shareholders not to propose his name separately. Yesterday there was speculation that Mr Siglienti was going because he had refused to kow-tow to Mediobanca and its allies. The shareholder meetings and the Prodi letter have re- ignited debate about how Italian industry should be privatised. A new Italian government will soon have to decide the rules for selling off INA, the state insurance company, and Stet, the telecoms group. Mr Prodi's own position could be under threat from the new government. Mr Prodi said the industry ministry and the treasury had failed to put in place rules which would guarantee that privatisation produced genuine 'public companies', with a role for the small shareholder. Published alongside Mr Prodi's comments was a letter from Mr Paolo Savona, the outgoing industry minister, accusing Mr Prodi of having been 'an obstacle to the rapid progress of privatisation'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Chernov report: "Will Peacemakers Go Into Abkhazia?"] </F>   [Excerpts] Sochi -- Late last week the first subunits of  the airborne assault units that are to be introduced into  Abkhazia as peacemaking forces were dispatched to the Russian  military airfield at Gudauta. According to Abkhazian sources,  the airborne troops come from the Leningrad and Volga Military  Districts. If they take up positions along the Inguri River and  in the Kodor Gorge, the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict will shift  to the stage of purely political confrontation. Needless to  say, the peacemakers will not resolve the problems that caused  the war, but they will be able to prevent armed clashes from  flaring up again. [passage omitted]    Representatives of the Georgian and Abkhazian military  departments spent all last week at work in Moscow. With the  mediation and participation of Russian Defense Ministry officers  they drafted a schedule and plan for disengagement and for the  introduction of peacemaking forces. Official Tbilisi was  acquainted with the plan at the weekend. Russian Defense  Ministry experts confirmed the previous dates for the  introduction of the peacemakers -- 10 through 15 June.    At the moment the following can be said about the impending  disengagement of the adversaries: They will pull back 12 km  into their territory from the contact line along the Inguri  River. "Blue helmets" will take up positions in the resulting  corridor. Something similar will also happen on the second  Abkhazian front -- in the Kodor Gorge, where serious fighting  started this spring. According to experts, once the peacemaking  forces have been deployed the conflicting parties will no longer  be able to launch full-scale combat operations.    Regrettably, I cannot avoid using the word "if" in this  commentary because today there is still no 100-percent  confidence that the peacemakers really will be brought into  Abkhazia. Events show that the good intentions could be  frustrated. [passage omitted]    Who stands to gain from provocations on the eve of the  peacemaking forces' introduction? Presumably not the  Abkhazians. The accords that have been secured satisfy the  Sukhumi leadership on the whole. The peacemakers will, after  all, be introduced in the way the Abkhazians planned -- between  the enemies' troops, and not throughout the republic's territory  as the Georgians demanded. The peacemaking forces' presence will  put the conflict on ice indefinitely and, as I have already  pointed out, will rule out the possibility of the problem of  Abkhazian separatism being resolved by military means. It is  also important for the Abkhazians that it is Russian airborne  troops being brought into the republic, rather than the  international forces for which Eduard Shevardnadze  unsuccessfully appealed for so long. On the whole people in  Abkhazia note some warming on Russia's part: The Russian  Government has allocated 2 billion rubles in aid, the republic  has been admitted as an associate member to the Association for  Socioeconomic Cooperation Between the Republics, Krays, and  Oblasts of the Russian Federation's North Caucasus Region, and  members of the association have asked the Russian Government to  lift economic sanctions.    However, there are forces in Georgia that categorically  oppose the proposed scenario for settling the conflict. I am  talking about the Union for the Liberation of Abkhazia led by  Boris Kakubava, a member of the Georgian parliament. The Union  comprises Georgian refugees from Abkhazia, mainly active  participants in the combat operations on the republic's  territory. They sharply criticize Eduard Shevardnadze's policy,  saying that he is mainly to blame for the lost battles and  calling for the war to be prosecuted to a victorious conclusion.  By all accounts, Kakubava also has supporters in the Georgian  Army units opposing the Abkhazian Armed Forces. It is quite  possible that they will take some action to wreck the  disengagement plan in the time remaining until the peacemaking  forces are introduced.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Fashion: Versatility is the key to winter coats - Heath Brown chooses some hard-working classics When a businessman buys an overcoat its suitability for work is a priority - which usually means a degree of sobriety; cloth that is dark, lines that are tailored in classic style. Once acquired this is often the only serious coat he owns - for weekends and off-duty hours pseudo-mountaineering styles and faux country looks take over and he usually dons an anorak or, possibly, a waxed jacket. But the formal weekday mantle need not be banished to the closet on Friday nights. Classically traditional overcoats can be made to work a seven-day week if you choose carefully. Today's eclectic fashion mood means a well-chosen greatcoat can be sharp and effective when arriving at a high-powered meeting, yet stylish and relaxed if teamed with a heavy fisherman's sweater and a pair of corduroy jeans. It would work equally well with layers of unstructured shirts and tops. David Mullane, the buyer for the high fashion emporium, Warehouse, in Glasgow, says: 'The more classic the coat, the more suitable it is to be worn casually as well.' Indeed, the better fashion designers have realised this and are producing more classic coats that can happily cross the divide between office and home, from city to country, and become one of the most versatile garments in a man's wardrobe. Traditional city looks have been plagiarised and adapted to mix and mismatch in looks from designers such as Katharine Hamnett, Giorgio Armani and Paul Smith. They have brought traditional coat styles, such as the velvet-collared Chesterfield and the double-breasted paddock coat, up on to the catwalk. British and Italian designers are pilfering the traditional city wardrobe and creating new classics from old. Dolce e Gabbana, the Italian design duo, are leaders in this post-modernist design ethic, gleaning trends from the well-groomed commuter and marrying oversize Crombies and double-breasted woollen car coats with sporty leggings and corduroy. The real appeal of these coats is that they offer high quality and high style and long-term value. A beautifully-made garment in an avant-garde style may be a thrilling fashion statement but it is far too frivolous for many to contemplate. Money spent on a long-lasting classic, that can be worn in many different ways, makes a lot of sense. Today's male customer is much more interested in fashion and design than his father. He wants fabulous clothes that are well-made, recognised and admired by others, and yet are not too showy or aggressively fashion-conscious. Adrian Clark, fashion editor of Fashion Weekly, welcomes a return to traditional tailoring and classic coats. But he reminds us that too casual a look does not look right in the city. 'The ridiculous trend for wearing waxed jackets over pinstripe suits on the city commuter circuit should be put away once and for all. By all means wear your city coat to the country pub but never be tempted to add rural charm to your nine-to-five two-piece. Versatility works in only one direction - from smart to relaxed,' he says. To create the relaxed look with the overcoat, soft layers and chunky knits loosen the rigidity of the tailoring. Be careful or you may end up looking like a first-year arts student. Match your clothes to the quality of your coat (which ought to be the best you can afford). Heavy boots and textured trousers, such as cord or moleskin, can complement weightier woollen coats and contribute to an overall image that is robust, modern and manly. When choosing this most important of garments these basic points must be considered. Make sure that there is enough room for your suit underneath to allow you to move freely. Always wear your suit when choosing and buying and do not be embarrassed to wave your arms about to make sure it is roomy enough. Go for the best quality wools and natural fibres or, if possible, cashmere or microfibres for a less heavy, easier wearability. If you are short, opt for knee-length, single-breasted styles. If you are taller, choose longer, calf-length styles that are perhaps double-breasted or belted. Choose plain, dark colours or fine, woven feint-banded browns. Finding the perfect winter coat may take hours. Department stores can be disappointingly mediocre when it comes to outerwear. Exceptions are Harrods, Simpsons, Burberry's and most larger branches of Austin Reed where good names, such as Chester Barrie, Crombie and Daks, can be found. Fashion stores, too, offer some great ranges - and not necessarily at more expensive prices. The new Jigsaw for Men range has a selection from Pounds 165. Harvey Nichols has a slightly higher-priced range but offers top quality. This season's best buys are at Joseph with its own Joseph Homme range outshining the designer labels.</p>

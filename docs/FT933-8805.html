			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Observer: Time, please Jim Slater, The Independent's share tipster, seems to have pulled off a sleight of hand in his weekly column. To reassure readers, and get round conflicts of interest, Slater agreed not to deal in shares which he writes about for six weeks before and after publication. In yesterday's column, however, he neatly reversed the burden of proof by claiming that he could not reveal to readers which two tips they should cut losses on, since he had recently bailed out himself. Thus the rule now seems to be that Slater cannot advise people about shares he has dealt in, rather than the other way round. Those who followed his advice and bought his tips earlier this year were left scrabbling for hints about the identity of the two companies.</p>

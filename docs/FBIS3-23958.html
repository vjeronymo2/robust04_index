			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article based on RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA information under the </F> rubric "Business News": "Bankers Bet on Solidarity"]    [Text] A general meeting of partners of Solidarity  Bank, at which the results of two years of operation of the  banking collective were summed up, has been held in Moscow.    Aleksandr Zaikin, chairman of the board of the bank, told  the  audience: "Indicators of our operations are closely associated  with the situation of the bank's founders, among which we can  point out the FITUR [Federation of Independent Trade Unions of  Russia], the Social Insurance Fund of the Russian Federation,  and some others, as well as our numerous business partners. The  reinforcement of the financial standing of our colleagues and  clients is behind the 13-fold increase in the statutory fund,  the 13-fold increase in assets, and the 20-fold increase in  transactions on the balance-sheet accounts of the bank."    In the opinion of independent experts, Solidarity Bank is  among the most stable and rapidly developing in Russia. In  particular, this was facilitated by the orientation of the  collective of the bank toward ensuring the complete automation  of financial transactions. Solidarity has implemented a network  version of an automated accounting system. Clients of the bank  are offered the use of the "Bank-Client" system which makes it  possible to make payments and receive original banking documents  directly in one's office.    Recently, Solidarity Bank received a license to conduct  operations in foreign exchange which has considerably expanded  the list of services it provides and made it possible to  strengthen contacts with quite a number of the largest trade  union banks of Europe such as, for example, the Norwegian  Landsbank.    The meeting of Solidarity's partners unanimously approved  the  report of the board of the bank and once again elected Aleksandr  Zaikin as its president, thus showing complete confidence in him.    Yuriy Shatyrenko, chairman of the Social Insurance Fund of  the Russian Federation, was elected chairman of the bank council.</p>

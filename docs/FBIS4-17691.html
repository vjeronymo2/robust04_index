			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 27 (ITAR-TASS) -- Today's NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA newspaper examines two versions of a treaty on public  accord which members of the lower house now compare. One of  them is planned to be signed in the Kremlin on Thursday.    "What has changed in the version (of the treaty -- eds.) Of  April 26 as compared with the text of April 24 and the more so  of April 20?" the newspaper asks.    "While the sides took obligations to refrain from demands to  make amendments to the constitution in the version of April 20,  which destabilise the situation in society, such explicitness  disappeared in the document of April 24: the sides decided that  amendments to the constitution can be made but only those which  promote stabilisation.    "Explicitness again appeared in the draft of April 26 but  this time with the sign plus: amendments stabilising the  situation must be made. True, as in previous cases, nothing is  said who will reject amendments. Nothing was changed in the  thesis either that the sides take obligations not to initiate  propaganda campaigns for early elections of federal bodies of  power."    Continuing this theme, the NOVAYA EZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA daily  notes: "In our opinion, the signing of a treaty on social accord  will be the most important event of this month. It is difficult  to overestimate this event, irrespective of its results.    "Realisation (any) and failure are equally important. We  believe that the treaty is not a scrap of paper and not a formal  act in the train of many such events which will pass without  notice.    "We regard this event in a broader context: in the context  of  actions which preceded the signing of the treaty and which will  follow.    The treaty, at the same time, is a symbol, a seal which will  authorise processes taking place now at the top echelons of  power and a lever helping to speed up these processes without,  although, completing them."    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes that it learnt from reliable  sources that another reorganisation of the Russian cabinet's  office is brewing at the white house. It will take place in the  near future.    "According to new draft regulations, divisions of the  government's office will be liquidated, and their functions will  be assumed by newly-formed departments. Naturally, expected  personnel reshuffling is the most burning question now.    "According to available information, the office head  Vladimir  Kvasov will be replaced by Valeriy Katukov who is now chief of  the organisational division."    The ROSSIISKIYE VESTI newspaper comments on the  Russian-Ukrainian talks in Sevastopol. "Apart from a diplomatic  failure of the talks on the Black Sea Fleet between the Russian  and Ukrainian defence ministers, the visit by General Pavel  Grachev to Sevastopol brought him personal annoyance," the  newspaper holds.    Following the failure of the talks, Ministers Grachev and  Vitaliy Radetskyy exchanged recriminations in public: General  Radetskyy was very caustic with respect to Grachev, speaking  over Ukrainian television.    In turn, General Grachev, standing on the gangway of his  "ministerial" plane before departure, expressed his opinion to  Ukrainian officers, who were seeing him off, about the reception  of the Russian delegation on Ukrainian soil.    The essence of Grachev's speech was that Ukraine is of  course  is a young state, but this does not justify how it receives  foreign delegations (he meant the Russian military delegation).    The minister mentioned in passing that the Ukrainian side  has  no notion about diplomatic etiquette and that he would not be  surprised if the russian delegation would have been arrested  right at the airport instead of flying to moscow and he defence  minister would have been handcuffed.    The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper features an interview  with  chairman of the state committee for the munitions industry  Viktor Glukhikh who stresses: "We are extremely concerned over  the situation with the state defence order for 1994.    "Its reduction by 80 per cent will cause, to put it mildly,  very serious difficulties with the development and production of  promising systems of weapons. It will deprive 150,000 people in  the munitions industry of their jobs as well as over 100,000  workers in the industry of ammunition and special chemistry."    The PRAVDA newspaper carries an interview with ex-premier of  the former Soviet Union Nikolay Ryzhkov, which is entitled "I'm  from the party whose name is Russia".    Ryzhkov writes: "To serve in the government now means to  come  under suspicion from honest people of complicity in corruption.  The present executive power is very corrupt. Besides, it is  against people, against the country. I don't see my place in  it."    Under the headline "Master of Intelligence Partially Reveals  Secrets", the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper started publishing  reminiscences by Pavel Sudoplatov, one of the former heads of  Soviet intelligence during Stalin's rule.    "The brilliant and tragic fate of this man," the newspaper  notes, "reflects all vicissitudes of time at which he happened  to live."</p>

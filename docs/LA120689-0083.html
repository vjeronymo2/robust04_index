			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCALLY APPLIED DRUGS  </P> <P> Question: It is my understanding that some medications that are applied locally  can have an effect on other parts of the body. From what I've been told, even  something like eye drops can affect the entire body. I have been told to use a  vaginal estrogen cream for reasons that are not important for my question.  Since estrogen also is prescribed to prevent bone loss in menopausal women,  would this vaginal estrogen cream do any good for that, or do I also have to  take estrogen some other way?  </P> <P> Answer: If, as I assume, the vaginal estrogen cream was prescribed for the  purpose of improving vaginal atrophy, the dose is probably insufficient to have  any effect on the development of osteoporosis.  </P></p>

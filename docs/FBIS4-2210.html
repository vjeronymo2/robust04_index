			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Gilles Campion] </F>   [Excerpts] Beijing, April 7 (AFP)--China launched a fresh  verbal assault Thursday on its most famous dissident, Wei  Jingsheng, warning he faced prosecution despite attempts by the  United States to intervene on his behalf. Foreign Ministry  spokesman Wu Jianmin told a press conference that Wei, detained  since last Friday, "has broken the law and must be prosecuted."    "These people are outsiders and are cut off from the Chinese  reality," he said of Wei and other pro-democracy agitators.    The arrest of Wei was "a small problem that should not be  exaggerated," Wu said. "There are people in jail anywhere in  the world. In China, this is so because they have broken the  law," he said, adding: "There is no universal penal code."    Wei was released on parole in September, six months short of  a 15-year prison term for his "counter-revolutionary" role in  the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement. [passage omitted]    Foreign ministry spokesman Wu derided suggestions that the  government was "persecuting" dissidents. "It is a completely  groundless accusation," he said. "For China, stability is  essential for economic development and it is necessary to uphold  order."    The row over Wei and other dissidents comes in the runup to  the decision by President Bill Clinton, scheduled in June, to  renew most-favoured-nation status for Chinese goods to the US  market, a benefit estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of  dollars in customs dues.</p>

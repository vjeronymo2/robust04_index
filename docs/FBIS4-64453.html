			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks are recorded] </F>   [Text] During a gathering of party heads last night to  review the election results, Elco Brinkman, CDA [Christian  Democratic Appeal] leader, said that he would not step down  following his party's historic defeat.    [Brinkman] "Assuming my responsibility does not mean  assuming  my responsibilities during good weather only. Usually, the  captain is most needed when the ship is sailing in bad weather."    [Unidentified reporter] "Does this mean that you will remain  as CDA leader?    [Brinkman] "Well, I am saying that it is not usual to refuse  to take up one's responsibilities in bad weather."    D66's [Democrats 66] Van Mierlo was happy, despite  expectations of a better outcome, about the result for his  party, whose seats in parliament increased from 12 to 24 seats.    [Van Mierlo] "I simply will say that the present which the  electors have given us is so nice that it would be unsuitable to  say: Could it not have been even nicer?"    The PvdA's [Labor Party] Wim Kok did not rule out that the  standard of living of people on welfare or social benefits would  drop during the next cabinet period. Contrary to the VVD  [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], the PvdA does not  want the system changed.    [Kok] "The people in need know that the coming years are  highly uncertain. Promising stability is out of the question.  I am just saying: No further changes on top of wage and social  benefit restraints. And that is quite a different matter."    The VVD's Frits Bolkestein refused in advance to participate  in a cabinet with the CDA and PvdA.    [Bolkestein] "If the CDA as well as PvdA have to govern  because of a lack of their success, it will be without us. We  will not participate."    According to Bolkestein, the result shows that the voters  reject the policies followed by the current government.</p>

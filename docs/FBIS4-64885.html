			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "A Dispute About Work"] </F>   [Text] The four European firms involved in the production  of the Eurofighter 2000 (formerly known as "Fighter 90")  appeared to be in agreement with each other during the fighter's  first public demonstration in England, but this unity in fact  conceals a dispute over the future distribution of tasks of the  billion-mark armaments program. According to current plans,  some 33 percent of this program is the responsibility of  Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) and British Aerospace, 21 percent is  the responsibility of the Italian Alenia, and 13 percent is the  responsibility of Spanish Casa. These proportions are based on  the number of aircraft each partner country will purchase. But  because Defense Minister Ruehe wants to purchase 140  Eurofighters instead of the planned 200, the German share should  fall to 25 percent. DASA will not accept this reduction,  arguing that the degree of involvement in the program depends on  the share of the costs of developing the fighter, and this share  remains the same, of course. The dispute will probably drag on  until next spring because that is when the government will  decide whether or not to buy the expensive Eurofighter. The  latest price offered by the aircraft industry is 102.5 million  marks.</p>

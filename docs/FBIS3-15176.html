			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, 2 Mar (TANJUG) -- "Russia is on the side of  those Serbs in Bosnia who are working for peace," Vladimir  Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation Council, said today  following his talks with Radovan Karadzic, president of the Serb  Republic.    The chairman of the upper chamber of the Russian parliament  did not specify what he meant by this. He went on to say that  "some forces in the world today want the confrontation in former  Yugoslavia to continue." The Bosnian Serbs' decision to allow  Tuzla airport to be opened for humanitarian aid deliveries  "knocks the ground from under the feet of those forces."    During his meeting with journalists, Karadzic said that  Bosnian Serbs are ready to work for a peaceful solution to the  Bosnian crisis and that mechanisms for achieving this goal are  being discussed in the talks in Moscow.    In reply to a question, the president of the Serb Republic  said that the Serb side is ready to join the agreement on a  federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina signed in Washington by the  Croats and Muslims, "if it is in our interest."    Karadzic supported an initiative by Russian President Boris  Yeltsin for a summit meeting of Russia, the United States, Great  Britain, France, and Germany.    This afternoon Radovan Karadzic had talks in the Russian  Ministry of Defense with Chief of General Staff Mikhail  Kolesnikov.</p>

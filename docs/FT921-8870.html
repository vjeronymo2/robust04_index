			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Sharp decline at Crest Nicholson to Pounds 59.4m loss CREST NICHOLSON, the south-east of England-based housebuilder and property developer which ran into trouble last year following the collapse in the housing market, incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 59.4m during the year to October 31. This compares with pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.06m in the previous 12 months. The losses were struck after exceptional provisions of Pounds 39.8m due to the write-down of the group's residential and commercial land and developments to take account of falling property prices. Resulting losses per share were 55.67p, against earnings of 3.86p. The group announced a nominal dividend of 0.01p to preserve its share status under the Trustee Investments Act 1961. Last time the final dividend was 4.65p for a total of 7.65p. The figures, however, were in line with expectations and the stock market was encouraged by the announcement of a further reduction in group borrowings from Pounds 117.6m in May to Pounds 54.7m at the year-end - equivalent to 51 per cent of shareholders' funds. Crest's shares yesterday rose by 6p to 37p. Mr John Callcutt, chief executive, also revealed that house sales had increased last month. Net reservations by house buyers were currently averaging 33 a week, compared with 15 a week in December. Mr Callcutt said the improvement was encouraging but that it was too early to say whether the rise would mark the beginning of a recovery in the UK housing market. Last year the group made an operating loss of Pounds 6.9m on house sales before write-downs of Pounds 28m. There was a further Pounds 11.1m write-down in the commercial property division which made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 10.9m. The group's contracting business however turned in a small profit. The big improvement, said Mr Callcutt, had been a big reduction in group borrowings as a result of commercial property sales and a decision to reduce house prices and increase sales to generate more cash. During the year Crest sold a record 1,435 homes. Average prices however fell from Pounds 90,000 to Pounds 78,000. The group's aim was to halve last year's interest charge of Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 6.68m). COMMENT The market was right to be pleased with the news of a further reduction in Crest's borrowings. The company has survived a difficult 12 months intact. Bank facilities of Pounds 167m are more than adequate to meet foreseeable requirements, say the directors. Pre-tax profits, given the severity of the write-downs should also recover this year. Some market forecasts suggest that Pounds 5m might even be achievable. A more cautious view is that profits will be between Pounds 2m and Pounds 3m. The share price does not yet fully take account of the improvement Crest has made, but the upside remains limited. There are better quality housing recovery stocks around.</p>

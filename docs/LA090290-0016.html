			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LORD LOVE A DUCK  </P> <P> So Louie wears green, huh? As producer and writer of the animated feature "Duck  Tales," I (along with my associates) went to great lengths never to  differentiate between Huey, Dewey and Louie.  </P> <P> What made them unique was that they were one personality in three bodies.  </P> <P> However, I guess there are those like Kathryn Wafer who insists on structure  and order for everything. If that's the case, don't I have the right to insist  Louie's the one in red?  </P> <P> DAVID WIEMERS  </P> <P> Producer, story editor, writer, voice director of "Duck Tales"  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

			<p>Europe      Economic Review:  WESTERN EUROPE Vol. III, No. 18, 05 May  1994      Notice To Readers:  FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a series published by  FBIS Europe/Latin America Group featuring brief summaries of foreign  media reports on topical issues, compiled from the most recent  sources available to FBIS.      Europe Economic Review (EER) is a subseries of FOREIGN MEDIA  SURVEY published by the West and East Europe Divisions of  Europe/Latin America Group with contributions from FBIS overseas  bureaus.  The EER is intended to supplement coverage of European  economic issues by the FBIS Daily Report for West and East Europe,  and other FBIS publications.  Foreign news, feature, and editorial  reports selected for summary in this publication normally do not  appear in other FBIS publications.      The EER is published in two editions, one for West Europe (also  including media coverage of Canada and Turkey), and the other for  East Europe.  Drawing primarily from domestic media sources of these  countries but also using other foreign media where appropriate, the  EER focuses on national and regional economic issues, such as  economic competitiveness, regional economic integration, economic  reforms and other changes in economic policies, and foreign trade  and investment.      FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a U.S. Government publication.  Its  contents in no way represent the policies, views, or attitudes of  the U.S. Government.  All comment or analysis contained herein is  attributable to the cited media source, unless otherwise indicated.

It  did not, for example, settle the "social dumping" issue resulting  from the disparity of workers' salaries in developed and developing  countries.  Although developing countries will in time evolve into  markets for European goods and services and will increase European  employment, Catala writes, entire segments of the European  production system may have disappeared by then because of  competition from low-salary countries.  Despite U.S. support, France  failed to convince Uruguay Round participants to include a "social  clause" in the future World Trade Organization (WTO) regulations, in  part because even some of its neighbors, such as Portugal and Great  Britain, never ratified the similar International Labor  Organization's child labor agreement.  Catala concludes that despite  the successful outcome of the Marrakesh meetings, the loss of jobs  and the competition from low-salary countries will continue.      According to an unattributed editorial in the 15 April Paris  daily LE MONDE, the Marrakesh agreement also failed in other ways.  The editorial claims the WTO cannot be considered a complete success  because many important industries still remain outside its purview.  Additionally, the final agreement will not be easy to implement and  will require "singular obstinacy" to substitute multilateralism for  the present bilateralism in a world where trade relations are  dominated by the most powerful countries, notably the United States.  More importantly, however, the entire Uruguay Round has been marked  by the rapid rise of influence of developing countries, which almost  unanimously fought the adoption of a "social clause" requiring  workers' rights to be respected.  Despite their solidarity over this  issue and the fact that they successfully blocked its adoption,  developing countries will not benefit equally under the new GATT  trade liberalization, the editorial comments.  The poorest countries  that have been unable to attain food self-sufficiency ought to fear  an agreement that will result in higher grain prices.  For these  countries, the editorial concludes, despite promises from richer  countries, "Marrakesh can only have a bitter taste."      Pascal Riche, writing in the 15 April Paris daily LIBERATION,  claims that while Marrakesh marked the end of the international  trading system in existence since the end of World War II, it also  failed to establish fully the policy of multilaterlism in trade  negotiations.  While multilateralism is the official rule, Riche  points out, trade negotiations are now so difficult that countries  can only handle them on a bilateral or regional basis.  The United  States, for example, chose to create the North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA) and engaged in bilateral negotiations with Japan  over market access.  Even the Uruguay Round, which was  "theoretically" negotiated by 117 countries, was finally signed in  bilateral fashion, the result of long discussions between Europe and  the United States.  Market rules, Riche writes, are gradually giving  way to "arrangements, pressure, and threats."  It is logical to  expect that a new WTO will be able to settle differences.  However,  the United States is intent on restraining the WTO's independence  and development, Riche contends, since it has already announced it  will not renounce its unilateral trade sanctions measures, the  "Article 301 and super 301" of U.S. trade law.  Moreover,  pessimistic Europeans recall that when the fourth round of GATT  negotiations in Geneva in 1954 gave birth to an "international  cooperation organization," the United States "quickly transformed it  into an empty shell."  More optimistic observers, however, note that  the United States "no longer rules over the world as it did 40 years  ago' and that well-conceived institutions have their own dynamics,  Riche concludes.

The first article  reports that Labor Minister Jytte Andersen has announced she is  making contingency plans so that the government can act quickly at  the first sign of labor bottlenecks in the private sector.  Part of  her plan is to set aside 100 million kroner to reintroduce worker  relocation grants for unemployed individuals willing to relocate to  new jobs, a program discontinued in 1989 because of a drastic cut in  job openings.  The head of Denmark's employer association backed  Andersen's initiative and cited her pledge to plug up past loopholes  in the program "so the unemployed will be forced to move--both  geographically and job-wise."  A labor union leader also expressed  support for the program but cautioned that the bottleneck problem  had more to do with job type than geography and that more would need  to be done to ease the pressure on wages which had undermined  international competitiveness in the mid-1980's.  Andersen said that  she is also looking at other measures, such as increased job  retraining, to increase labor mobility.      The second article describes actions to counter labor bottlenecks  already existing in the public sector.  Here even more, government  policy is largely blamed for problems.  A new law granting workers  paid leave of up to one year for training sabbaticals or child care  has resulted in a sudden shortage in many occupations, especially  nursing.  Currently, some 1,700 nurses are on leave, forcing  hospitals to hire Swedish and Norwegian health workers to fill the  gap.  There is also a danger that this situation will be repeated in  schools and welfare offices.  As a result, emergency legislation was  approved on 11 April to require that leave applications be submitted  six months before the leave is to begin.  In addition, a pact signed  by local governments and employee associations will aim at avoiding  labor shortages.  Here too, job retraining will be implemented to  alleviate labor bottleneck pressures which could derail recovery.

According to BERLINGSKE TIDENDE reporter Peter Andersen, the labor  movement is fighting against implementation of an EU regulation  stipulating a 21-day notice before large-scale layoffs are effected;  under current Danish law, employers must give 30-days notice.  In  talks chaired by Andersen, the LO said it was willing to accept a  21-day notice before layoffs could be officially communicated to  workers but demanded a further 77-day delay before the action could  be carried out.  This would entitle workers to a total of eight  weeks' pay from the time of preliminary warning.  The Employers  Association rejected this demand, claiming Denmark has no right to  go beyond provisions in EU directives.  While talks will resume  later, the article's author sees little hope of a bill emerging  before the next election, which must be held by 10 December.  In the  absence of new legislation, employers and unions will probably have  to resolve the issue in individual contract agreements.  It is  believed that labor will ultimately have to compromise heavily on  its 77-day demand, the article reports. (Roger B. x36508)  (Copenhagen BERLINGSKE TIDENDE in Danish 16 Apr 94 p III 1)      FRANCE      COMMENTS ON FEDERAL RESERVE APPOINTEES--Jacques Hubert-Rodier,  writing in the financial daily LES ECHOS, noted that the two  economists appointed to the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank by President  Bill Clinton will probably have no effect on the bank's policies.  Rodier describes the two, Alan Blinder and Janet Yellen, as more  pragmatic" in fighting inflation--more like "doves" than "hawks"-  -than those they replace.  Although their appointments may allow  Clinton to leave his "imprint" on monetary policy at the bank since  the two are considered close to presidential economic adviser Laura  d'Andrea Tyson, Rodier argues it is still difficult to determine how  they can change the balance within the bank's board.  The views of  the head of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, who in the eyes of  the markets really controls the central bank, remain generally  preponderant.  Moreover, the main decisions of the bank are made by  a larger group in the Open Market Committee which includes, besides  the seven governors, five of the presidents of the regional Federal  Reserve Banks. (Dian I. x36286)  (Paris LES ECHOS in French 25 Apr  94 p 4)      CLINTON'S COMPUTER INDUSTRY 'SUBSIDIES' NOTED--President Bill  Clinton's administration has confirmed its taste for industrial  policy and close government-industry cooperation, according to LA  TRIBUNE DESFOSSES Washington correspondent Jean-Marie Macabrey.  Macabrey charges Clinton is subsidizing the computer industry,  citing the announcement by the U.S. Department of Defense that it  will supply $587 million over five years to computer companies to  increase U.S. capacity to produce flat screens--a key computer  component used in aircraft and portable computers and now produced  mainly in Japan.  Furthermore, Macabrey notes that more help is  forthcoming from the U.S. Commerce Department, which is charged with  promoting these products abroad, and from U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor, who is trying to force open recalcitrant markets for  them.  To forestall criticism, the U.S. Government is justifying its  initiative on the basis of national security, Macabrey states.  However, the project has commercial goals: to establish a U.S.  presence on a market 95-percent controlled by the Japanese.      Macabrey adds that this is not Clinton's first attempt at  industrial policy.  Clinton has aided the U.S. military industry to  convert to civilian production and has collaborated with U.S. auto  manufacturers on developing an automobile by putting idle government  laboratories at their disposal.  Macabrey concludes that if the  flat-screen experience is any indication, Clinton will repeat the  strategy in other industries dominated by the Japanese, such as in  robotics and high-tech ceramics. (Dian I. x336286)  (Paris LA  TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 2 May 94 p 6)      UAP TO RECEIVE FR3 BILLION FROM STATE--On 22 April, Economy  Minister Edmond Alphandery confirmed that the government would  increase the capital of the Paris Insurance Union (UAP) by around 3  billion francs (Fr) to facilitate its privatization, according to an  article in LES ECHOS.  The article cites unnamed banking sources as  stating that the capital transfer will be in the form of short-term  stock options for shareholders, allowing them to purchase new shares  at the public offer price.  In this plan the government, which hold  50.2 percent of the company's shares, will then cede back its  options to members of a core shareholder group.      According to the article, UAP president Jacques Friedmann wanted  around Fr5 billion to recapitalize the company.  He has said on  several occasions that his company no longer had a margin of  maneuver.  Friedmann also indicated that UAP still intends to  complete its European insurance network by acquisition.  The article  adds that the government hopes to receive some Fr20 billion from  UAP's privatization.  Some 86 million shares will be sold on the  market, of which 43 million will be in the form of a public purchase  offering. (Dian I. x36286)  (Paris LES ECHOS in French 25 Apr 94 p  25)      GOVERNMENT GIVES SHIPPING LINE FR900 MILLION--According to Claude  Barjonet, writing in LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, Transportation Minister  Bernard Bosson has confirmed that in 1994 the government will give  Fr900 million to General Maritime Company (CGM) in a capital  infusion which is much larger than expected.  Moreover, for 1995 and  1996 the government intends to give the government-owned shipping  line even more, the sum of which Barjonet speculates will be several  hundreds of millions of francs.  In the fall of 1993, Bosson had  publicly confirmed that CGM President, Eric Giuily, was asking for  Fr500 million to help his financially-strapped company.  But this  sum would not have compensated for 1993 losses of Fr450 million  after a loss in 1992 of Fr689 million.  Giuily therefore convinced  Bosson that the capital infusion must be more "ambitious," allowing  the company not only to pay off its debts but to substantially  strengthen the company's coffers.  Barjonet concludes that Giuily  should be very happy about the "pugnacity" with which Bosson  defended CGM's interests within the government. (Dian I. x36286)  (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 29 Apr 94 p 7)      EDITORIAL ON AIR FRANCE, EU AIR ROUTE DECISION--LES ECHOS chief  deputy editor for economics, Patrick Lamm, reacting to the recent EU  Commission decision which requires France to allow TAT airlines to  compete with Air France subsidiary Air Inter and operate routes out  of Orly Airport, writes that the French Government is cornered  between the intransigent wish of Brussels to develop airline  competition in Europe and the necessity to maintain peace with labor  unions at the financially troubled Air France.  Lamm notes that the  government has once again been "nailed" by Brussels in the name of  free markets.  He adds, however, that the French Government seems  determined not to open its domestic air routes to competition and  that it has already announced it would bring the issue before the  EU's Court of Justice.  The Commission's decision could be foreseen,  Lamm claims, and is based on former Prime Minister Michel Rocard's  promise in 1990 to open French domestic routes to competition in  exchange for EU Commission approval for Air France to buy UTA  airlines.  However, the problem was when to open them.  The  government at that time thought it could control any competition by  authorizing small companies to operate on a few routes which would  not challenge Air France.      The French Government has even more of a problem with the EU  Commission, Lamm contends, since it must also have the Commission's  approval for the Fr10-billion capital transfer it wants to make to  Air France.  Although the two issues may not be linked, it is  difficult to escape seeing one as a bargaining chip for the other.  The government's predicament is exacerbated by the fact it must be  played out under the  watchful eye of Air France labor unions who,  despite the support that they recently gave to Air France President  Christian Blanc's reorganization  plan, keep a gun to management's  head.  Meanwhile, competition is increasing.  The French airline  company TAT is 49-percent owned by British Airways and if allowed to  compete out of Orly, Air Inter--now operating on these routes--would  lose important market share on very profitable routes.  (Dian I.  x36286)  (Paris LES ECHOS in French 28 Apr 94 p 13)      ECONOMIC RECOVERY QUESTIONED--In an editorial in the 28 April  Paris weekly L'EXPRESS, Yann de l'Ecotais questions whether the 2.0-  percent economic growth "predicted by almost all economic experts"  for 1994 and the 2.4 percent envisioned for 1995 will ensure a  massive economic recovery, even if they denote considerable  improvement.  A progressive recovery will be slowed down by a number  of factors, according to de l'Ecotais.  The first stems from the  importance of the German economy, whose expected low 0.5-percent  growth this year and only 1.5-percent growth in 1995 will reduce  exports to that country and affect the French recovery.  Secondly,  high unemployment, the reduction of public debt in a lumber of  countries, and a very slow increase in household incomes, resulting  in cautious consumer spending, will dampen the recovery.  Thirdly,  economists have been too optimistic in the variables they used to  assess future growth.  According to these economists, de l'Ecotais  writes, oil prices will remain low, European short-term interest  rates will further decrease, as will long-term rates after first  registering an increase, and no international large-scale crisis  will emerge.      Additionally, according to de l'Ecotais, the reaction of French  unemployment to the economic recovery does not match that of other  countries.  Nothing guarantees that France's GDP this year will rise  twice as much as expected, to reach the level necessary for a drop  in the unemployment rate.  Finally, "burdensome regulations and  excessive compulsory withholdings" limit any benefit that France  might obtain from an improved economic situation.  (Rosa M. x36287)  (Paris L'EXPRESS in French 28 Apr 94 p 4)      DANGERS OF PRIVATIZATION DISCUSSED--While government-mandated  privatization is by now generally accepted, opposition is slowly  developing, according to Airy Routier writing in the 14-20 April  Paris weekly LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR.  A Socialist Party (PS) leader,  the former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, has criticized  conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's privatizations and  has charged that through them, he has shaped an "oligarchy" which  would "weigh heavily" on France's future.  Additionally, Routier  cites Elie Cohen, researcher at the National Center for Scientific  Research, as expressing his disapproval of Balladur's privatization  methods, despite Cohen's support for privatization itself.  Cohen  questions the government's use of the income produced by these  privatizations.  Rather than being used to reduce the deficit and  aid government-owned companies, the income has been applied to  current budget expenses.  Fabius characterizes the use of this  revenue as a near-sighted policy that postpones problems by covering  them up.      Routier charges that Balladur's method entails his choosing  conservatives to head privatized companies and putting Socialists in  charge of firms whose privatization is impossible in the short term.  Additionally, he has established extensive cross ownerships in  privatized companies--for instance, the National Bank of Paris (BNP)  will hold 15 percent of the Paris Insurance Union (UAP), which will  hold 15 percent of the BNP--which may create interlocking interests  that will eventually weaken the French economy through lack of  monitoring and absence of sanctions on the part of shareholders.  As  a countermeasure, Routier states, the Socialist group of the  National Assembly has asked its members to purchase shares in all  the privatized companies, to ensure that small shareholders lead the  fight for more transparency and equal treatment within these  companies.  (Rosa M. x36287)  (Paris LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR in French  14-20 Apr 94 pp 14-17)      GERMANY      TRUST AGENCY TO RESTRUCTURE, DOWNSIZE--Starting in January 1995,  the Trust Agency will be split into a Federal Office for Special  Unification Tasks (BVS) and several entities in which the Federal  Government will hold a partial or total interest.  The BVS, the  legal successor to the Trust Agency, will be charged with enforcing  the terms of purchase contracts for Trust Agency holdings.  It will  oversee what was once the GDR government's Commercial Coordination  (Koko) foreign trade operation and administer the remaining holdings  of the GDR's political parties.  After two years, the BVS will be  integrated into the Federal Office- for the Regulation of Unresolved  Public Holding Questions (BARoV).  Meanwhile, two government  corporations, the Shareholding Management Company (BMG) and the  Trust Agency Realty Company (TLG) will take over the Finance  Ministry's proprietary interests.  The BMG, a holding company, will  oversee the privatization or liquidation of the roughly 100 firms  still held by the Trust Agency, operate the Agency's five limited  partnerships, and help close down some firms engaged in mining and  nuclear power production.  The TLG will administer the Trust  Agency's landholdings in urban areas.      The Trust Agency anticipates needing a staff of 3,700 to operate  these new entities, with a possible reduction to 2,000 by the end of  1998.  The Bundestag budget committee, however, is pressing for a  limit of 2,000 starting in 1995.  An initial post-unification plan  to divest government holdings in Trust Agency enterprises has not  been realized, except for the impending privatization of the Trust  Agency East Europe Consulting Company.  (Charles W. x36473)  (Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE in German 20 Apr 94 p 17)      Government Contracts Boost Eastern German Economy-The Federal  Government increased public contract awards to eastern German firms  from 7.5 billion German marks (DM) in 1992 to DM17.5 billion in  1993, according to a report by the Ministry of Economics.  Over 90  percent of the Federal Government's 1993 orders for construction  projects in eastern Germany went to firms native to the region,  especially small- and medium-sized companies.  The government also  provided over DM6 billion in federally-funded road and railway work.  Federal spending on such contracts accounted for about 6 percent of  eastern Germany's 1993 economic output.     According to the report, the increase in awards resulted mainly  from the official preference given to eastern German firms in  bidding for projects.  Under this policy, which is due to expire at  the end of 1995, federal contracts may be awarded to eastern German  firms even if their bids are up to 20 percent higher than those of  their western German competitors.  The federal program, however, has  been hindered on at least two fronts.  First, few western German  laender have joined the Federal Government's effort to funnel  official orders to eastern Germany: only Hesse and Berlin have done  so thus far.  Second, eastern German firms continue to lag behind  their western counterparts in the important information and  communications technologies market.  Although this gap closed  somewhat in 1993, it continues to put eastern German companies at a  competitive disadvantage in a high-demand sector.  (Charles W.  x36473)  (Duesseldorf HANDELSBLATT in German 26 Apr 94 p 3)      WISMUT URANIUM DAMAGE LESS THAN THOUGHT--According to Environment  Minister Klaus Toepfer, the environmental damage caused by the GDR-  Soviet uranium mining company Wismut is more limited than originally  thought.  New federal studies estimate that only about 180 square  kilometers of territory in Saxony, Thuringia, and Saxony-Anhalt were  contaminated by Wismut's mining operations.  Early post-unification  projections estimated that such contamination had affected around  1,500 square kilometers.  The Federal Government's projection of a  10-15 year cleanup program costing DM13 billion should nevertheless  be regarded as a "lower limit," according to Toepfer.      Some DM3 billion has already been spent on projects such as  moving uranium ore dumps and flooding abandoned mineshafts.  Clean-  up financing is subject to revision in cases where local governments  acquire Wismut real estate, and a complete decontamination of GDR-  era sites is still going to take years, if not decades, in Toepfer's  view.  Moreover, the president of the Federal Office for Nuclear  Protection recently reported the discovery of radon contamination in  some Wismut structures and the documentation of some 7,000 cases of  lung cancer in one-time Wismut miners.  The government is not  prepared to concede, however, that the radon gas in the mines, as  opposed to the radioactivity in the ore, is the cause of the high  lung cancer rates.

Sanctions  could translate into fines, as well as demands for damages from the  companies that used to export goods to the FYROM.  Worse still,  sanctions could include withholding of EU "Delors II package"  grants, a move with unpredictable repercussions on the Greek  economy.  In addition, the economy could not be trusted to meet the  standards required for EU convergence, which are based on the  assumptions of this year's budget.  The article contends that  Greece's relations with the EU have entered a critical period and  that the EU will probably in the future treat Greece more with  severity than tolerance. (Rosa M. x36287)  (Athens I KATHIMERINI in  Greek 17 Apr 94 p 51)      VIOLATION OF EMBARGO CHARGED--Northern Greece customs authorities  are conducting a detailed investigation of border crossings-  -especially at the Promakhonas point, one of the main exits to  Bulgaria, through which almost all Greek exports to the Balkans are  made--after a number of exporters charged that some businessmen are  violating the embargo Greece has imposed on the Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).  According to the charges, illegal  exports to Skopje include raw materials, yarn, packaging materials,  and metals.  Exports go through Bulgaria, where product descriptions  are altered, reportedly with the acquiescence of Bulgarian  authorities.  (Rosa M. x36287)  (Athens I KATHIMERINI in Greek 15  Apr 95 p 21)      NEW TAX BILL EXPECTED--The new tax bill, which was recently  submitted to the Chamber of Deputies, provoked a strong reaction  even on the part of social and professional classes that  traditionally support the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement  (PASOK), according to an article in I KATHEMERINI.  The government,  under pressure to modify a number of the bill's provisions, such as  raising the limit of workers and retirees' tax-free income and  abolishing the taxation of earnings from mutual funds, is reportedly  determined to stand its ground and is expecting to derive the  following revenues from the bill's provisions (in drachmas):      1.  From businessmen and professions: 120 million     2.  From builders: 10 billion     3.  From farmers: 5 billion     4.  From property (cars, real estate, boats): 10 billion     5.  From abolishing tax-free housing loans for second residences:         3 billion     6.  From tax on incomes over 15 million drachmas: 5 billion     7.  From taxes levied on large companies and mutual funds: 80  billion     8.  From real estate transfers: 2 billion     9.  From value-added taxes on certain vehicles: 13.6 billion     10. From tax evasion countermeasures: 170 billion     11. Total: 418.6 billion      An article in ELEVTHEROTIPIA adds that the new tax bill is not  the best that could have been proposed.  It will not result in fair  taxation, will not decisively stop "Greek national sports" such as  tax evasion, and may even prove unfair in a number of cases.  However, it does attempt to correct the tax differences that divide  Greeks into "dumb taxpayers" and "clever tax evaders." (Rosa M.  x36287)  (Athens I KATHIMERINI in Greek 10 Apr 94 p 1;  Athens  ELEVTHEROTIPIA in Greek 8 Apr 94 p 6)      ITALY      FARM ORGANIZATIONS UNHAPPY WITH GATT ACCORD--The National  Confederation of Small Farmers (Coldiretti), the General  Confederation of Italian Agriculture (Confagricoltura), and the CIA  (former General Confederation of Italian Farmers) expressed their  displeasure over the GATT accord signed in Marrakesh and its  negative effects on Italy's agricultural industry.  These  organizations blame the Ciampi government for the GATT's total lack  of concessions to Mediterranean products.  They claim the government  did not want to listen to the farmers' concerns and never took the  problem to heart, even though protecting these products would not  have required great sacrifices since they they have small markets.  As a result, the organizations now foresee the loss of 100,000 jobs  over the next five years, a further drop in profits, at least a 20-  -percent reduction in production of beef, milk, and grains and a  further decrease--from 30 to 50 percent--in the price of farmlands.      Furthermore, any benefit derived from importing cheaper South  American products will be absorbed by intermediaries such as  processors and distributors rather than farmers and consumers.  At  the same time, the burden of production costs remains,  Confagricoltura General Manager Arcangelo Mafrici stated.  With  cheaper South American products and 20-percent fewer exports to  Third World countries imposed on Europe over five years, more  agricultural products will remain in Europe, lowering prices and  reducing production.      Coldiretti President Paolo Micolini said that to survive, Italian  farmers must become better educated, produce high quality and fresh  products, and raise more products indigenous to the country.  Above  all, the agricultural industry must cut production costs.  This is  possible, Micolini claims, despite the fact that the government  cannot fix prices.

According to Prodi, France's telecommunications company  Alcatel, which along with Italy's Pirelli company is interested in  purchasing large shares in STET once it is privatized.  Prodi  clearly stated, however, that he sees no reason why Alcatel should  be allowed to control an Italian telecommunications company when  Italian companies cannot do the same in France.  "I have been very  clear on this," Prodi said, and dashed any hopes that Alcatel or  Pirelli could gain control of STET by adding that manufacturers of  telecommunications equipment and providers of telecommunications  services cannot own the same company.  Although he can understand  Alcatel's interest in STET, as well as Ericsson's and AT&amp;T's, Prodi   said he cannot understand why they are creating such a commotion  over Italian but not French telecommunications companies.      In the interview Prodi also discussed plans for other  privatizations.  His comments are summarized below:      * SIP:  Italy's National Telephone Company may be dismantled,  with part of it incorporated into STET.      * ILVA:  The privatization of the steel company is scheduled to  be completed within a few weeks, since the banks have agreed to  convert part of the credits into capital, and therefore future share  purchasers will no longer have to purchase 100 percent of the  company.      * GS-Autogrills: Privatization of the chain of highway  restaurants and shops is expected soon because the chain has been  opened up to new bids and Prodi expects quick and adequate bids to  come in.      * Food Industry: Privatization of this sector is expected to be  more difficult, because the just-completed privatization of the  Cirio-Bertolli-De Rica group has been severely criticized by the  Italian Federation of Trade Unions (UIL) for having been sold  separately to FISVI and Cragnotti.      * Alitalia: The public airline company will not be privatized at  the present time because the company has just changed management and  is being reorganized.

The majority was optimistic, with many  respondents saying they would be willing to hire and invest more.  They also stressed that the new government must quickly cut public  expense, increase privatizations, reduce taxes, liberalize  employment regulations, increase public administration efficiency,  lower interest rates, and resume providing for public works.

Fossa said that during the recent electoral campaign all  the parties promised to address the problems of small companies and  these firms hoped the new government would not forget them.  Fossa  was particularly impressed with Forza Italia's program to support  small business, saying it coincided almost word for word with  proposals contained in a document released by Confindustria in  November.      Fossa listed some measures needed immediately to keep companies  from going under.  They include extending export credit insurance to  small companies, especially since exports seems to be the only part  of the economy that is currently growing and small companies are not  allowed to use the traditional channels of export credit insurance;  removing the tax on reinvested profits; more flexibility in the use  of labor, including short-term employment; refinancing Law 317,  which allowed many companies to undergo technological innovation;  shifting the indebtedness of small companies from a short to a  medium- and long-term period "to give them a chance to catch their  breath"; and standardizing taxes on company bonds not listed on the  stock market.

Assistal, comprised of 1,200  small- and medium-sized companies legally authorized by the Ministry  of Posts to install and maintain commercial switchboards, complained  to the Antitrust Commission SIP is illicitly using its position of  strength as the sole provider of basic telephone services to keep  out competitors.  Although the telecommunications industry has been  completely deregulated, SIP continues to use its privileged position  to dominate the market.  Because it is the sole provider of basic  telephone services, SIP knows who the potential new users are and  will explicitly tell those customers that new installations and  maintenance "will proceed smoothly" as long as they use SIP for both  services.  According to Assistal, SIP's behavior automatically  excludes private companies from competition.  It believes SIP should  act as other public utilities do, that is, provide their service "to  the front door" of companies and then let the free market dictate  the rest.  Only this way can companies operating in the same  industry have a chance to compete fairly.      According to the complaint, SIP should be given one of two  choices:  either it act solely as a public utility company or it  privatizes and acts like other private companies in the  telecommunications markets, under the same regulations.  It should  not be allowed to do both.  Continuation of the present situation,  Assistal stressed, will adversely affect employment in the  telecommunications field, leading to a loss of 12,000 jobs within a  couple of years.  SIP is slated to merge with four other public  telecommunications companies into a single company, Telecom Italia,  to be privatized later this year.

The  takeover means that the Santander group is now Spain's largest bank,  placing it ahead of close competitors such as Banco Bilbao Vizcaya  (BBV) and Banco Central Hispano (BCH).  Banco Santander President  Emilio Botin has also announced his decision to retain Banesto  management, currently headed by Alfredo Saenz who has been in charge  of Banesto's reorganization during the past four months.  According  to the article, the acquisition has meant that the Deposit Insurance  Fund (FGD) has been able to recover 313 billion pesetas of the total  505 billion pesetas that it will cost to financially reorganize  Banesto.  The remainder of the cost will be picked up by the state  through the Bank of Spain.      Purchasing Banesto has given Banco Santander several advantages.  It will now have a controlling interest in Spain's media industry  since Banesto owns part of Antena 3 TV network, the centrist daily  newspaper EL MUNDO, and the publishing house Grupo Zeta.  In  addition, Banco Santander will acquire Banesto's network of branches  located in towns of fewer than 50,000 people and its participation  in foreign investments.  Santander will also now control 2.1  trillion pesetas from former Banesto deposits in addition to its own  deposits of up to 4.5 trillion pesetas.  It will lead the Spanish  banking world in terms of increased assets, which are now valued at  17 trillion pesetas.  However, the Banesto acquisition presents  Banco Santander's management with a more narrow margin for financial  maneuvering and operations than before because Santander will also  be inheriting heavier operating costs from Banesto.

The quantity of goods transported on  the highways and railways is increasing, as is air traffic, which,  according to the paper, reflects an increase in exports.  According  the Central Statistical Bureau (SCB), a record share of households-  -40 percent of those surveyed--believe the economy will improve over  the next few years.  In addition, more new firms are being founded  than at any time in the last five years, and industry is producing  more.      In the last year, the largest firms have gone front posting a 4  billion-kronor collective loss to realizing a 35 billion-kronor  collective gain.  60 percent of smaller firms are reporting an  increase in orders as well.  Companies are planning to increase  investment this year by 41 billion kronor, which represents a 15-  percent jump.  Sales of large consumer goods, such as cars,  increased by 21 percent in March.  The stock market is rising again  too, and inflation has sunk to about 2 percent.  Although  unemployment is still high, DAGENS NYHETER reports a 154-percent  increase in help wanted ads and the SCB notes that there was a 0.5  percent drop in the official unemployment rate from January to  February.

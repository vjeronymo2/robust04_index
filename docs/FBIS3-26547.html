On behalf of the party Central Committee and  the State Council, I wish to extend their festival regards and  lofty respects to you veteran comrades here today and all the  retired veteran cadres in the country, as well as veteran  comrades working on all fronts!    The past year was one in which the whole party and people of  all nationalities in the country fully implemented the  guidelines laid down by the 14th national party congress and  marched forward victoriously along the course charted by Comrade  Deng Xiaoping of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. The nation continued to maintain the good  momentum of thriving development in reform, opening up, and  modernization. New successes were achieved on all fronts --  industrial, agricultural, scientific-technological, educational,  cultural, defense, and foreign affairs. Our party became  stronger and better. Because of our economic growth, political  stability, solidarity among people of all nationalities, and  social progress, the country as a whole was full of life and  vitality.    The year 1994 is crucial for the development of reform,  opening up, and modernization in China. The basic policy for  this year's work is: Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as by  the basic party line, we will accelerate the process of building  a socialist market economic system; maintain a sustained, fast,  and healthy national economic development; maintain political  stability; and expedite progress in all social sectors -- doing  all this by implementing the guidelines laid down by the 14th  national party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee. Seizing the opportunity to deepen  reform, open up wider to the outside world, expedite  development, and maintain stability is an assignment of overall  importance for the whole party. To expedite the great cause of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must have a  clear idea of this assignment, obey and serve it, proceed with  our work cautiously and earnestly, firmly develop our socialist  market economy, and firmly promote socialist democracy and  spiritual construction.    The "CPC Central Committee Decision on Issues About Building  a Socialist Market Economic System" adopted by the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee is an indicator of the  beginning of a new stage at which China will achieve  breakthroughs at major points while promoting economic reform in  all areas. An integral part of our basic socialist system, the  socialist market economic system we are now building will enable  the market to play a fundamental role in the distribution of  resources under the state's macroscopic regulation and control.  The basic objective is to further liberate and develop  productive forces so that China's sustained, fast, and healthy  economic development can be guaranteed institutionally.  Meanwhile, we must also realize that, as reform continues to  deepen, we will inevitably have to restructure the existing  patterns and relationships of interests, encounter deep- rooted  problems, and deal with complex and unprecedented situations and  issues. We are now reforming the economic system as we are  having a high economic growth, we also have to maintain a high  economic growth while accelerating the process of structural  change; we must also attach great importance to social and  political stability. To make sure that all of the Central  Committee's reform decisions will be carried out, we must  provide stronger leadership, know the entire situation, and  correctly handle the dialectical relationship between reform and  development on the one hand and stability on the other so that  our reform programs and construction projects can proceed in a  healthy and orderly manner.    To accomplish this year's formidable reform and  construction assignments, we must do an even better job in  upholding the party's ideological line of emancipating our minds  and seeking truth from facts; in upholding the party's basic  line of work -- namely doing everything for the masses, counting  on the masses in doing everything, coming from the masses, and  going to the masses; and in integrating the party's ideological  and mass lines. We must continue to change those ideas and  concepts which are incompatible with building a socialist market  economic system and firmly push reform forward. We must  earnestly change our work style, go deep into the realities of  life to conduct investigation and study, insist on doing things  in the light of materialist dialectics, and concentrate our  efforts on accomplishing all assignments and dealing with  outstanding problems obstructing reform and construction. We  must seriously listen to what the masses have to say, understand  their feelings, care for their plight, do ideological and  political work among the masses deeply and meticulously, strive  to deal with those practical problems vital to their personal  interests, and always pay attention to guiding and protecting  the masses' enthusiasm so that they can bring their initiative  into play. Our party counts on the masses for its source of  strength and for winning victories. So long as we depend on the  masses, establish close ties with them, rally the strength of  the nation, and mobilize the positive factors in all quarters,  we can surmount every difficulty in our way and our cause in all  fields will be invincible.    The CPC is the leading core of our socialist construction.  Building the CPC into a stronger party is the basic guarantee  for winning the victory in building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as by  the party's basic line, we must focus on economic construction,  strive to adapt to the new situation of building a socialist  market economic system, consciously uphold the party's character  as being the vanguard of the working class and its objective of  serving the people wholeheartedly, and continue to build a  stronger and better party; and we also must strengthen all party  organizations' coherence, rallying power and militancy during  the course of reform, development, and stability so that our  party will be able to play its nuclear leading role more  effectively. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics epitomizes the rich  experiences we have gained from launching reform, opening up to  the outside world, and carrying out socialist construction. This  theory is the spiritual pillar and scientific guide leading us  to continue to march forward victoriously. During this new  year, we must continue to organize the vast number of cadres and  party members to thoroughly study Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping, and accomplish the 14th national  party congress assignment of arming the whole party with the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.  Leading groups must earnestly strengthen their ideological  construction and improve their work style. They must uphold and  improve democratic centralism and maintain a high degree of  political and ideological unity and unity in actions. We must  make great efforts to train and promote outstanding young cadres  in accordance with the requirement that cadres must be more  revolutionary, better educated, younger in average age, and  professionally more competent as well as the principle that our  cadres must be ethical and capable. To meet the needs of the  new situation, all leading groups must make constant efforts to  improve their capabilities of leading the socialist market  economy, build stronger grass-roots party organizations, and  explore ways and means of establishing party organizations in  all types of new economies. The anticorruption struggle is an  important task for building stronger party and government  organizations, and it is a task having a close bearing on the  future and destiny of our party and state. We must thoroughly  understand the struggle's protracted nature and formidability.  On the basis of consolidating the successes that have been  achieved, we must continue to wage this struggle in a sustained,  deep-going, and more effective manner so that we can win the  trust of the people and ensure the normal development of reform,  opening up, and socialist modernization.    Comrades! Building an affluent, strong, democratic, and  civilized socialist modern China is an ideal shared by all  Chinese people, and a great goal of our party during the new  period. The achievement of this great idea requires the  strenuous and untiring efforts exerted by people of many  generations. You veteran comrades are a precious wealth of our  party and state. During all historical periods of revolution  and construction, you have done all you possibly can, dedicated  yourselves selflessly, and endured all hardships. The  historical services you have rendered in winning the victory of  the new democratic revolution; in building the socialist system;  in developing the socialist cause; in promoting reform, opening  up, and modernization; and in building a prosperous and strong  motherland are unerasable. Your brilliant successes will go  down in the annals. We will forever cherish, inherit, and carry  forward the steadfastness; conviction; wisdom; experiences;  lofty spirit and examples, fine traditions, and conduct which  you veteran comrades have developed during the protracted  struggles. During the new historical period, your important  roles in developing the economy, expediting reform and opening  up, safeguarding social stability, and intensifying spiritual  construction will still be irreplaceable. We believe that you  will continue to care for and support all projects of reform and  construction, help the vast number of middle-aged and young  cadres to grow up healthily, and will continue to make new  contributions during the new period. The vast number of  middle-aged and young cadres must humbly learn from veteran  comrades; do a good job in taking over the veteran comrades'  spirit of waging heroic revolutionary struggle; serve as links  of the past and the future; and strive to contribute to  expediting reform, opening up, and socialist modernization.    An important project of the party and government is the  project about veteran cadres. Currently, the nation has more  than 7 million retired cadres. Party committee and governments  at all levels must heighten their understanding of veteran  cadres' affairs, improve their leadership over veteran cadres'  affairs, earnestly study the new situations and new issues of  veteran cadres' affairs, and sum up new experiences. We must  care for veteran cadres politically and take care of their  livelihood. While drawing up new measures for reforms, we must  also gradually establish and improve the social security system  and take timely steps to study, resolve veteran cadres'  practical living problems, and do something practical for them  so that our veteran cadres can provide and do something, learn  something, enjoying life during their remaining years.    Comrades! The nineties are important for the development of  our party and state. Our cause cannot be more grandiose and our  future cannot be brighter. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and that of the party's basic line, let us rally  even closer around the party Central Committee with Comrade  Jiang Zemin as the core, work with one heart and one soul, be  determined in launching reform, take the initiative in our own  hands, make painstaking efforts in doing pioneering work, and  work hard to finish building an initial socialist market  economic system and achieving the magnificent goal of China's  socialist modernization by the end of this century.    Finally I wish you a pleasant Spring Festival, good health,  and a happy family life!</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / HK's airport move tests China ties The Hong Kong government yesterday put its improving relations with China to the test when it said it would seek the local legislature's approval for more than HKDollars 15bn (Pounds 1.2bn) of finance for the colony's multi-billion dollar airport project. Britain and China have yet to agree overall terms for the financing of the project, Asia's largest integrated transport plan. The two are discussing the Hong Kong government's fourth financial plan for the project; hopes have been raised that an agreement is within sight. China yesterday confirmed that Mr Alastair Goodlad, a British foreign office minister, will visit Beijing next month. A Chinese government spokesman said Beijing was keen that disputes about Hong Kong should not sour China's wider relations with Britain. The request for further funding from the Legislative Council (LegCo) is by far the government's biggest gamble in its 'step-by-step' approach to building the airport. China has acquiesced in the past to LegCo voting funds for the project, but its continued indulgence cannot be taken for granted. Mr Lu Ping, a senior Beijing official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, said recently that the government should refrain from further funding requests, pending an overall agreement with China. At the same time, Mr Lu said he thought the issue of finance could be settled shortly. A Hong Kong government official said yesterday that more funds were needed by the Provisional Airport Authority so that companies tendering for work could be certain the authority had the money. Tenders for work have to be let between July and September if a mid-1997 completion date for the airport is to be achieved. The official noted that China had been informed about a month ago of the need for more funds and had been told the details of yesterday's funding request some days ago. The government is asking LegCo for HKDollars 8.9bn to build the airport passenger terminal, HKDollars 4.93bn for the airport's first runway and other essential civil engineering, Dollars HK1.08bn for baggage handling facilities, and HKDollars 227m for the airport authority's head office expenses.</p>

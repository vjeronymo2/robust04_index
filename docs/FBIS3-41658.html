			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer by Ulrich </F> Deupmann and Giovanni di Lorenzo; place and date not given:  ``CDU (Christian Democratic Union) Should Also Examine  Possibilities for Cooperation With the Greens'']    [Excerpt]    SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: You are not known as an  enemy of Greenpeace -- do you understand the occupation of the  nuclear waste storage site in Morsleben?    Toepfer: First of all: Despite all understanding  for personal involvement, it is impossible that someone protests  without any consideration for law and order and then gets an  appointment with the minister. Therefore, I would like to make  one thing clear: My condition was an end to the occupation --  then the talk. I offered this talk so that I could make it  clear that there is nothing like a ``sacrificial area'' in the  new laender -- following the slogan: The storage site from the  old GDR [German Democratic Republic] times is used without any  checks so that it can take in the radioactive waste from all  over Germany as quickly as possible. This impression is wrong.  In the case of Morsleben, we have ordered independent,  comprehensive examinations, we have tightened the safety  measures, and have reduced the active potential of the waste.  There is no safety discount. In order to make this clear we  discussed the matter with Greenpeace, but hardly ever have I had  such an awkward feeling as during these talks.    SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: You stick to Morsleben.  What is the conclusion derived from that for the Federal  Government's energy policy?    Toepfer: Morsleben does not mean that the  licensing procedure for the Konrad final storage site is no  longer possible. Whoever believed that this has been settled by  putting low-radioactive waste in final storage in Morsleben, is  very wrong. Of course, the corresponding steps for getting a  permit for the Konrad mine continue. By closing down Greifswald  and Rheinsberg, and because of an extremely high amount of other  sources of radiation and radioactive waste, we have a  considerable amount of waste in the new laender. We must  integrate Morsleben quite normally into Germany's waste disposal  infrastructure -- just as the facilities in the western laender  are available for waste from all over Germany, too.    SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: This also means that the  Federal Government and its environment minister stick to nuclear  energy -- and, as a result, accept all ensuing waste disposal  problems.    Toepfer: I really think that it is a very  superficial morality not to use a technology in our country,  which has been recognized as being difficult, while knowing  that, in other countries, it will be used even more intensively.  The safety standards -- or better, the safety culture, which is  more than just safety technology -- which have been developed in  our country also mean that it is better for us to accept  responsibility for this technology in our country than to fob it  off on those places where it is used with rather less safety,  such as in Central and Eastern Europe, for instance. However,  we must be aware of the fact that we are not dealing with an  absolutely risk-free technology, so that constant safety checks  are indispensable. In order to justify nuclear energy, I have  never made relative environmental comparisons between the  various energy sources. Any energy must prove to be justifiable  with its remaining risk. We also cannot -- as we did in the  past -- ignore our obligation for research, a more intensive use  of other energy sources, and saving energy by saying that we  have got nuclear energy and thus something like a  prrpetual-motion energy policy. I want to make every effort to  facilitate energy supplies without nuclear energy, but I see the  necessity to preserve the specific option of nuclear energy at  the moment and to contribute to decisively expanding the safety  standards in a new generation of nuclear power plants.    SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: In the laender, you are also  dealing with environmental ministers from a completely different  camp, for instance with experienced ministers of the Greens. Is  cooperation with these colleagues now possible, at least on  certain issues, despite or because of your just-described  attitude?    Toepfer: I can answer this question with yes  without any reservations. I have already mentioned exceptions,  such as energy policy. In environmental policy, in particular,  we must not always stress the party policy differences in our  answers, but must ask which are the environmentally justifiable  answers. I really think that this is extremely important, and  the citizens expect that from us. They do not ask whether a  good answer was worked out by a green, a black, or a red  politician. And in some corners, and at some edges, one  surprisingly finds coinciding views. [passage omitted]</p>

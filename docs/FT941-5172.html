			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Action overdue on tube initiative Sir, In order to attract overseas investors to London, as well as relieve the misery endured by Londoners on a daily basis, we must have greater investment in London's public transport system. The private sector has a real opportunity to take a leading role in achieving this, under the government's Private Finance Initiative. Accordingly, we are concerned that one of the first proposals to follow the initiative - to replace the desperately old tube cars running on the Northern Line - is still awaiting a decision in principle by the Treasury. Not only does a deal of this type make sound commercial sense, but it also meets Treasury guidelines for the realistic transfer of risk to the private sector - or at least, as the private sector has to date understood the guidelines. This straightforward, imaginative project must be allowed to move ahead without further delay. If new cars for the Northern Line cannot be secured, what future is there for private finance in public-sector projects? Stephen O'Brien, London First, 5 Cleveland Place, London SW1Y 6JJ</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRAF, NAVRATILOVA STRUGGLE EARLY BEFORE WINNING  </P> <P> Top-seeded Steffi Graf and No. 2 Martina Navratilova both struggled in the  early going before winning Tuesday in the second round of the $300,000 Family  Circle Magazine Cup tennis tournament at Sea Pines Racquet Club.  </P> <P> Graf, the top-ranked women's player in the world, defeated Rosalyn Fairbank of  South Africa, 6-4, 6-3.  </P> <P> Navratilova was extended to three sets before defeating Laura Gildemeister of  Peru, 6-4, 4-6, 6-0.  </P> <P> No. 3 Zina Garrison withdrew from the competition Tuesday. She suffered a groin  injury against Chris Evert during the Lipton International Players  Championships last week.  </P> <P> The only seeded player to lose was No. 12 Raffaella Reggi of Italy, who fell to  Jana Pospisilova of Czechoslovakia, 7-5, 6-4.  </P> <P> Graf's match against Fairbank lasted 76 minutes on a hot day at stadium court.  The West German fell behind, 4-3, in the first set before taking three straight  games.  </P> <P> Graf, 19, double-faulted to end the sixth game of the second set and allow  Fairbank to draw even at 3-3.  </P> <P> But Graf then rattled off three straight to take the set and the match.  </P> <P> "The first match is a little tougher than usual and you're not as patient,"  said Graf, who had a bye in the first round on Monday.  </P> <P> "Rosalyn was playing really well. She kept the ball in play and I really didn't  have the rhythm."  </P></p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Russian duma deflects budget row The Russian parliament last night stepped back from confrontation with the government over the budget by calling for a 'conciliation commission' to 'check on the basic figures' of next year's budget before a vote is taken. The commission is due to report by December 10. However, the debate yesterday in the state duma (lower house) and comments by leading deputies leave little doubt that the budget as it stands - promoted by the government as a strategy which will finally puncture high inflation and stabilise the rouble - would be voted down by the duma. According to Mr Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the duma budget committee, only the liberal Russia's Choice party led by Mr Yegor Gaidar would vote for it. The government has made clear it is open to proposals to tinker with the figures, but will reject all efforts at strategic shifts. The budget envisages no central bank credits for the government next year, the sale of a massive Rbs70,000bn worth of treasury bills, and support, largely from the International Monetary Fund, of nearly Dollars 13bn (Pounds 8bn) - at the present exchange rate, around one third of the projected yearly income. Mr Zadornov attacked each part of the budget strategy. He said treasury bills would not be sold in large amounts at a time of high inflation, that the projected level of taxes could not be gathered and that the projected level of expenditure was far too low given commitments already made and debts which had to be paid. Mr Vladimir Panskov, the new finance minister, yesterday revealed the parlous state of the government's finances - admitting that it could not pay Rbs3,000bn it owes to defence equipment companies. However, he said that the nearly Rbs2,000bn debt owed in back wages to state employees had been reduced to Rbs600bn. The discussions are now very bitter. Mr Alexander Pochinok, the Russia's Choice member who is deputy chairman of the budget committee, yesterday attacked Mr Zadornov and other leading members for refusing to realise how essential the budget was to save the country from continuing decline. To derision from his colleagues and from many of the press, Mr Pochinok said: 'If we want to live reasonably, we have to learn how to produce and how to sell. People buy imported goods because they are better - it's that simple.'</p>

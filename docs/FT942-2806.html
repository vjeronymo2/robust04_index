			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Crude expectations Crude at Dollars 20 a barrel by the end of the year is starting to look like a credible scenario. The sharp rise in oil prices this week has already taken the benchmark Brent price to Dollars 17. In the US, the benchmark West Texas Intermediate price has risen even faster, touching Dollars 20 and opening what looks like an unsustainable Dollars 3 spread over Brent. A firm line at this week's Opec meeting and worries over Korea have clearly played their part in the price rise. But the decisive factor is new evidence that oil demand in the US is accelerating. The cartel's decision to cancel its September meeting, so emphasising its determination not to increase production, has had such an impact because demand is robust. Given that only Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and possibly Venezuela have substantial excess capacity, the chances of quota cheating are slim. The market has concluded that supplies will be stretched next winter and has reacted by attempting to build up stocks now. Whether this is as bad for inflation prospects as bond markets have concluded is less clear. The direct impact of higher oil prices will be fairly modest. While the Saudis are happy to see crude at Dollars 20, there is no evidence that they wish to drive it much higher than that. Of greater concern is the possibility that strong oil demand may indicate that the US economy is running ahead faster than expected. But this is not the only interpretation. The more comforting view is that the US has forgotten about conservation and is back to its old gas-guzzling ways. If that is true, robust oil demand may reflect the particularly oil-intensive nature of this US recovery rather than warning of inflation ahead.</p>

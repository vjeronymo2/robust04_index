			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by XINHUA reporters Chen Yun (7115 5366), Tian </F> Shubin (3944 5289 2430), and Zhang Juncheng (1728 0193 2052):  "Profits and Losses as Viewed from Another Angle"]    [Excerpts] Beijing, 9 Mar (XINHUA) -- It seems that we  will develop a fixed way of thinking about an economic problem  if we keep discussing it for a long period of time. However, if  we analyze the problem dialectically, it is not hard for us to  discover that nothing is immutable. If we view a fact from  another angle, we usually can come up with a new idea.    The new changes faced by deficit-incurring enterprises in  China during the course of implementing "Regulations on  Transforming the Operational Mechanisms of State-Owned  Industrial Enterprises" are the best example of this truth.  <H5>  Changes Among Those Which Usually Did Not Change -- Drastic </H5> Decrease in the Losses Caused by Policies and Macro-Control    State-owned enterprises operating with losses have been a  longstanding, difficult problem for the whole country. Meetings  have been held and measures taken to deal with the problem every  year for the last 10 years. However, the problem remains; it  even became worse at one time. For instance, according to  statistics compiled under new rules after the implementation of  "General Rules for Enterprise Finance" and "Rules for Enterprise  Accounting" in July 1993, the enterprises covered by the state  budget which operated with losses in 1993 totalled 11,453 in  number, 2,488 more than in 1992. They accounted for 31.8  percent of the total, up 7.3 percentage points from the previous  year; and the total amount of losses was 31.91 billion yuan, 7.2  percent or 2.13 billion yuan more than 1992.    However, what has not changed is the fact that roughly one  third of the enterprises incurred losses, and what has greatly  changed is the cause of loss. While some enterprises have  alleviated their deficit problem, other enterprises incur more  serious losses. According to a 1991 survey conducted by Lu Dong,  president of the China Industrial Economy Society, of 50  deficit-incurring enterprises in Beijing, Shenyang and Tianjin,  19.4 percent incurred losses due to policies, 47.8 percent were  the result of macro-control, and 32.8 percent suffered losses  due to poor enterprise management. According to a 1993 survey  conducted by the technology and economy institute of the State  Planning Commission and the former production management bureau  of the State Economic and Trade Commission, of 2,586  deficit-incurring enterprises in Shanghai, Shandong, Jilin and  five other provinces and municipalities, only about 9 percent  operated with losses due to policy or macro-control reasons,  while 81.7 percent were the result of poor enterprise management.    Statistical figures by category show that China's central  industries maintained a trend toward decreased losses in 1993,  with a total annual decrease of 5.85 billion yuan in losses.  The losses incurred by coal, petroleum and tobacco industries  decreased by 17 percent, 54.4 percent, and 66.2 percent,  respectively. While their losses were due to policy factors,  the decrease in losses was mainly because the state readjusted  prices in favor of them, reduced their tax burden, and let them  retain more profits. The losses incurred by local industries  showed a rising tendency in 1993. The local industrial  enterprises which incurred losses in 1993 accounted for 31.5  percent of the total, up 7.4 percentage points. Their total  loss was 19.03 billion yuan, up 72.2 percent or 7.98 billion  yuan from 1992. The increase in losses was due to local  industries -- mostly textile, light, chemical, and  machine-building industries -- being in a period of structural  readjustment and change, subject to more uncertain factors.  [passage omitted]    Geographically speaking, the ratio of deficit-incurring  enterprises slightly decreased in Shandong and Tibet, while it  increased to a varying degree in other provinces, autonomous  regions, and municipalities during the 1985-1992 period. In  1993, however, of China's 35 provinces, autonomous regions,  municipalities, and cities with provincial-level economic  decision-making authority (excluding Tibet), the ratio of  deficit-incurring enterprises decreased in Beijing, Dalian,  Fujian, Xiamen, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, and Yunnan.    Another good trend is worth mentioning. Over the last two  years, state-owned enterprises have shown a tendency toward  increased profits. The profits earned in 1992 by the  enterprises covered in the state budget increased by 32.1  percent as compared with the previous year, and their profit  from a 100-yuan sale increased by 14.1 percent, from 2.06 yuan  to 2.35 yuan. In 1993, they maintained the tendency toward  increased profits. This is inspiring. [passage omitted]    During our coverage, the plant directors and managers of  many  large and medium state-owned enterprises told the reporters:  The diversified, changeable market demand contains  opportunities for the revival of deficit-incurring enterprises.  Large and medium state-owned enterprises have several decades  of development experience and enjoy the advantages of  specialized personnel, technology, and skilled workers, which  village and town enterprises do not enjoy. In order to seize the  opportunity, it is necessary to apply the new concepts of the  market economy and assume a new vision of development and change  in treating the advantages and disadvantages of state-owned  enterprises. It is necessary to make changes to deal with the  changing situation and to develop new supports for enterprises.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / People: New challenge for Vance the peacemaker at Macy's Cyrus Vance, the unflappable US diplomat who tried and failed to bring peace to Bosnia, has taken on his fair share of thankless tasks since serving as US secretary of state under Jimmy Carter, writes Frank McGurty. His latest leap of faith - as court-appointed mediator in the negotiations to bring the Macy's department store chain out of bankruptcy - is likely to test his patience to the limit. Vance, who celebrated his 77th birthday yesterday, is charged with hammering out a reorganisation plan that will satisfy a panoply of competing creditors, owed a total of Dollars 6bn by the once-proud New York retailing group. After dragging on for more than two years, the process took on a sense of urgency three months ago when Federated Department Stores, a long-time rival and owner of New York's Bloomingdales, bought a big chunk of Macy's debt to use as leverage in forcing a merger between the two groups. Last week the battle entered a critical phase, with Macy's management submitting to Vance its blueprint for keeping the group independent. The plan, which is really just a starting point for negotiations, appears to have placated a disgruntled group of junk bondholders, but it managed to upset secured creditors who had supported an earlier version of the plan. The escalation of tensions raises the likelihood of Federated succeeding in its ambitions. Vance, who works for the law firm of Simpson, Thacher and Bartlett, is scheduled to meet Macy's creditors, including Federated, on April 11. If he hopes to broker a deal among them, Vance will be sure to need all the diplomatic skills he refined on his last international mission.</p>

This came in a letter in Arabic sent to Brig. Gen.  al-Mutawakkil by Yemeni Jews and signed in Hebrew by nine of  their dignitaries, protesting against the Zionist campaign which  exploits the "poor financial situation" in Yemen to make them  emigrate to Israel "with financial enticements."    It is worth noting that an American Jew of Yemeni origin by  the name of Moshe Yarimi and a Jewish Swiss journalist by the  name of Oneger are currently in Yemen. The latter is  accompanied on his tour of the cities of Sa'dah and Raydah by  Muhammad al-Juraydi, an employee of the Yemeni Information  Ministry, which helps him move around and which also arouses  fears among Yemeni Jews about their continuing to live in Yemen  and encouragement to emigrate to Israel.    While Yemeni Jews welcome religious groups of their faith  who  visit them and bring books and educational literature such as  Naturi Carta, known as Guards of the City, which help them  within their community, they express surprise at the Yemeni  authorities' lack of response so far to their requests for  protection from "foreign corruption," in the form sometimes of  enticement and sometimes threats. Joseph Kaplan and Yosef Amar,  two American Jewish assistants of Shlomo Grafi, representative  of the Jewish Agency which actively works for the emigration of  Jews to Israel, visited Yemen last month and distributed sums of  money to Yemeni Jews. Kaplan succeeded in leaving with a Yemeni  Jewish woman whom he married on the way to Israel via European  capitals or New York.    Yosef Amar remained [in Yemen] after that for two weeks,  during which he worked for the emigration of a Yemeni Jew by the  name of Harun Murji to Israel to join one of his two wives who  preceded him there without the knowledge of his other wife, whom  he intended to leave behind in Yemen to join him later.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that Moshe Yarimi managed to  get close to a tribal chief in the area of Sa'dah and persuaded  him to threaten one of the Jews opposed to emigration to Israel.  It reached a point where that chief pointed his gun at the Jew  and threatened that "he would kill him if he continued to  instigate others against the Americans."    The letter addressed to the Yemeni interior minister  mentioned that and said "we wish to inform you that we have  received ultimatums and threats that they will make some corrupt  people harm us unless we give in to them."    Observers believe that the Zionist groups, whose work in  Yemen is coordinated by a special committee directly attached to  the Israeli prime minister's office, use American and European  Jews to fulfill their mission and they exploit the current  liberal atmosphere in Yemen and the weak government presence in  the northern areas, a matter which facilitates their task.</p>

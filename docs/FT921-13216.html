			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Citicorp extends a welcoming hand - Onno Ruding, the US bank's new vice-chairman Onno to his friends - was in a joyful mood yesterday afternoon. Having just been named a new vice-chairman of Citicorp, the wounded Gulliver of US banking, the 52-year-old Mr Ruding relaxed in a second-floor office with Mr John Reed, the Citicorp chairman, chatting about Mr Reed's 'kind offer' to join the bank. The lanky Mr Ruding, best known in financial circles as a former Dutch finance minister and as a past executive director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), did work as a banker in the 1970s, when for five years he was joint general manager of AMRO Bank. Having failed in recent years to land such jobs as head of the IMF (1986) and head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (1991), he has been filling his time as three-day-a-week chairman of the Netherlands' Christian employers federation and as a board member at Unilever, Philips and, of course, Citicorp. By March 1, he will move lock, stock and barrel to New York and devote himself 'more than 100 per cent' to Citicorp. As a wily politician, however, Mr Ruding declined to rule out a return to Dutch politics. Mr Reed, who yesterday reported nearly Dollars 5bn of loan write-offs in 1991 and a heavy loss for the year, looked only mildly disconcerted when Mr Ruding was asked to offer his analysis of the current woes of Citicorp and the US banking industry. 'It is quite different from European banking. There are some tendencies of weakness in American banking,' Mr Ruding began, before singing the praises of Citicorp's stature as 'the most global bank.' Citicorp's most significant problems, Mr Ruding then essayed, are 'in the field of credit policies and in the credit portfolio, and in the field of capital'. Among Mr Ruding's responsibilities will be the running of Citicorp's Japan, Europe and North American (JENA) corporate finance division, which last year suffered nearly quadrupled losses of more than Dollars 1bn. But the diplomatic Dutchman, while admitting that 'nobody expects US real estate to be better in a few months' time,' said he wished to point out that there are some profitable bits of JENA. Mr Reed himself has taken charge of the real estate portfolio, and he stressed the way in which he perceives Mr Ruding 'as firstly a colleague at the senior level' whose most important contribution will be the views he brings to senior management. Mr Ruding's line responsibility for the bank's corporate division is, for Mr Reed, second to his 'strong personal views and leadership'. The issue of whether or not Mr Ruding is the man to turn around Citicorp's corporate business remains to be seen.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: The Eurotunnel paperchase FT-SE Index: 2,556.8 (-3.4) The difference between a Eurotunnel share issue and most others is that the Anglo-French company ends up with nothing tangible to show for it. The exercise is wholly dilutive. It is therefore not surprising that the market was less than enthused by yesterday's rumours, later confirmed, that the tunnel operator has toyed with a plan to issue new paper rather than ready cash to the disgruntled contractors. It is not clear, though, that existing shareholders need be sceptical. For a start, Eurotunnel's articles ensure that nothing can be done behind their backs. Beyond that, they might as well face facts. It is most unlikely that the Pounds 850m or so margin between Eurotunnel's estimated peak financing requirement and total available resources will be enough both to settle the claims and to pay for the likely cost overruns between now and the tunnel opening. Investors should not set their minds against anything which might just break the present deadlock, and which would have the added attraction of tying in the likes of Taylor Woodrow, Wimpey and Costain more firmly over the next 18 months to two years. The main issue, though, is whether the builders would be tempted. They are arguably under more pressure than Eurotunnel, with the finalisation of their 1991 accounts looming. Whether they would surrender their right to real money is another matter. They would certainly be wise to demand a hefty discount on new shares in return for any restrictions on selling them.</p>

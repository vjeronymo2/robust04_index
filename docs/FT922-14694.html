			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / De Klerk visit to Nigeria seen as breakthrough SOUTH AFRICA'S President F W de Klerk is expected to visit Nigeria next week, in a breakthrough in Pretoria's diplomatic relations with black Africa. President Ibrahim Babangida, Nigeria's military leader and chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), will hold talks with Mr de Klerk in the capital, Abuja. Although Mr de Klerk has visited several African countries since initiating his reform programme, the visit to Nigeria has special significance. President Babangida's invitation represents a stamp of approval for the reform process from black Africa's economic and political heavyweight. The invitation also brings closer the day South Africa becomes a member of the OAU, given President Babangida's role as chairman of the organisation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, May 19, BNS -- Swedish Foreign Minister  Margaretha af Ugglas completed her one-day visit to Lithuania  Thursday [19 May] morning and left for Russia's Kaliningrad  region, where she intends to meet with the head of the region's  administration.    During her stay in Lithuania Wednesday, af Ugglas met with  President Algirdas Brazauskas, Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys  and visited the Ignalina nuclear power plant.    Asta Skaisgiryte, head of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry's  Northern Europe Division, said the Swedish minister has a  negative attitude toward nuclear plants, but when she saw  Ignalina's reactors, fire-prevention and safety systems, she  seemed to be quite satisfied with the situation at the plant.  "When there's no order, the chances of an accident are much  higher," the minister said.    A Swedish expert working at Ignalina showed and explained  how  Sweden helps Lithuania to make its plant safer. Af Ugglas said  she is satisfied with the work done.    The Swedish minister's meeting with her Lithuanian  counterpart was mainly devoted to cooperation between Baltic and  Nordic countries. Gylys and af Ugglas discussed preparations  for a meeting between Nordic and Baltic foreign ministers, who  intend to gather Aug. 31 in the Lithuanian seaside resort of  Palanga.    Before Palanga, Nordic countries are expected to discuss  possibilities to represent consular interests of the Baltic  states in countries where Estonia, Latvia and Estonia do not  have their diplomatic missions. Nordic countries already set up  a joint working group to deal with the matter.    Gylys and af Ugglas also discussed Kaliningrad's  demilitarization. The Swedish minister said she intends to  inform Matochkin about Sweden's official position regarding the  need to reduce Russia's military potential in Kaliningrad.</p>

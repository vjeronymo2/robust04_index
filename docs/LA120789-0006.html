			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE / THE BRAIN;  </P> <P> RESEARCHERS ISOLATE GENETIC KEY TO MEMORY, LEARNING  </P> <P> Researchers at La Jolla's Salk Institute have found the gene for one of the  most sought-after chemicals in the brain, a protein that plays a key role in  early learning and memory.  </P> <P> That protein, called the glutamate receptor, is intimately involved in the  transmission of signals from one brain cell to another and is thus crucial to  normal functioning of the brain.  </P> <P> Inborn defects in the glutamate receptor can produce epilepsy, while brain  injuries such as stroke and trauma can trigger malfunctions in the receptor  that cause permanent brain damage. The isolation of the gene for the receptor,  reported in today's Nature, may make possible the design of new drugs to combat  these medical problems and, in the longer term, may lead to drugs that enhance  memory and learning.  </P> <P> "This discovery is extremely important," said neurobiologist Charles F. Stevens  of the Yale Medical School. It is the culmination of an intense race to isolate  and identify the receptor, he said, and the beginning of a new race to develop  ways to take advantage of the knowledge  </P> <P> "People are going to be working in their labs day and night to follow up on  this," Stevens said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> Scientists have long recognized that there are four major receptor systems in  the brain that are involved in the most rapid communications between cells. The  receptors are all proteins that are embedded in the external membranes of the  brain cells. When they bind to specific messenger molecules, they trigger  chemical changes within the cell.  </P> <P> Two of the receptor systems, the so-called GABA and glycine receptors, are  suppressive, shutting brain cells down so they don't transmit a signal. Such  systems are involved, for example, in blocking off pain and in modulating  muscle movements.  </P> <P> The other two systems, the acetylcholinergic and glutamate receptors, are  excitatory, stimulating a brain cell to send a message on to other brain cells,  a process known as "firing." They are crucial in learning and memory and in  computational and recognition processes.  </P> <P> Scientists had previously isolated the genes that code for the other three  types of receptors, but the gene for the glutamate receptors has proved elusive  -- presumably because this receptor's structure is substantially different from  that of the other receptors. The new discovery thus means that neurologists now  have all four types of receptors available for study and potential  manipulation.  </P> <P> There are at least half a dozen different types of glutamate receptors in the  brain.  </P> <P> One type of glutamate receptor binds very tightly to a chemical called kainic  acid. Defects in this type of receptor cause the convulsions that characterize  epilepsy.  </P> <P> Neurobiologist Stephen Heinemann and his colleagues at Salk report today that  they have isolated and cloned the gene for the glutamate receptor that binds to  kainic acid. They have shown that when kainic acid binds to this receptor, the  receptor opens a pore or gate that allows electrically charged calcium ions to  enter the cell. That influx creates an electrical potential that stimulates the  cell to send a message on to another cell.  </P> <P> Another type of glutamate receptor binds to a chemical called NMDA. This  receptor triggers a strengthening of communication links between brain cells  that is thought crucial to the storage of memories. The NMDA receptor is also  the site where PCP, the street drug also known as "angel dust," binds to the  brain to stimulate hallucinations.  </P> <P> The NMDA receptor also plays a crucial role in brain damage when stroke or  trauma occurs. When the oxygen supply to brain cells is cut off by such an  event, glutamate leaks out of the cells. Acting through the NMDA receptor, that  overabundance of glutamate causes the cell to fire repeatedly -- to the point  where the cell self-destructs.  </P> <P> Pharmaceutical companies are extremely interested in learning the structure of  the glutamate receptors, according to Heinemann, because the knowledge should  make possible the design of drugs that could interfere with the destructive  processes by binding to the receptor without causing the cells to fire.  </P> <P> Heinemann said in a telephone interview that, with the knowledge they have  gained about the structure of the kainic acid receptor gene, they are well  along the way toward isolating the genes for the other glutamate receptors,  including the NMDA receptor gene.  </P> <P> Heinemann and his colleagues isolated the kainic gene and the receptor from the  brains of rats because those animals are relatively easy to work with. Previous  studies with the other three classes of receptors have shown that the rat  receptors are very similar to their human counterparts, Heinemann said, and  that information gained from them is directly applicable to humans.  </P> <P> Two other groups of researchers involving scientists from Salk also report  independently in today's Nature that they have isolated the genes for other  brain proteins that bind kainic acid. In both cases, however, the proteins they  observed -- one from chickens and one from frogs -- are much smaller than that  observed by Heinemann. And in neither case does the protein appear to have a  role in communication among brain cells, because the proteins do not cause a  pore to open in the cell membrane.  </P> <P> It is likely, Stevens said, that these two kainic-acid-binding proteins may be  involved in previously unknown physiological reactions. But the simultaneous  appearance of the three papers, he wrote in a commentary in Nature, suggests  that "something about Southern California must be good for research on  excitatory amino acids."  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW THE GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR WORKS  </P> <P> The glutamate receptor, which is involved in the learning process and memory  formation, allows brain cells to communicate by converting a chemical signal  into an electrical signal.  </P> <P> 1-When one brain cell or neuron is about to send a message to another, it  releases a molecule of glutamate, an amino acid.  </P> <P> 2-The glutamate molecule binds to the glutamate receptor on the second brain  cell.  </P> <P> 3-This opens a pore or gate that allows electrically charged calcium atoms to  flow into the cell.  </P> <P> 4-The change in the electrical charge within the second brain cell stimulates  it to send a message on to the next neuron in line by releasing another  glutamate molecule.  </P></p>

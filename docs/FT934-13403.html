			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Swedish economy to shrink by 2.8% THE SWEDISH economy will shrink by 2.8 per cent this year, its worst performance since the second world war, according to the government. Its latest forecast is much more pessimistic than the one it gave in April, when it predicted a fall of just 1.7 per cent. However, it believes 1993 will mark the low point, with GNP growth of 1.9 per cent expected in 1994 and 2.9 per cent in 1995. Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, said: 'The road back to sustained growth, full employment and healthy financing is a long one, but more and more signs of recovery can now be discerned'. No growth in private consumption is expected in 1994, and public consumption is forecast to fall 1.3 per cent. Unemployment will rise to 8.4 per cent, excluding those on training schemes, before falling to 7.9 per cent in 1995. To help tackle the unemployment crisis, the government yesterday announced plans to nearly halve employers' social security contributions for new staff. The measure will apply to all companies with more employees in 1994 than in September 1993, and is partly designed to combat explosive growth in overtime. The government is relying on export-led recovery to get Sweden out of a three-year economic trough, and to cut the budget deficit and state borrowing totals which, in relative terms, are among the highest in the western world. It expects the public finance deficit to fall from SKr208bn (Dollars 26bn), or 14.5 per cent of GNP, in 1993 to SKr180bn, or 12 per cent of GNP, in 1995. New measures to help achieve a targetted SKr81bn strengthening of the budget over five years include higher individual social security charges and reduced medical subsidies.</p>

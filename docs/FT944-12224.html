			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Pfizer to buy cardiology equipment manufacturer Pfizer, the US pharmaceuticals group, has announced that it is buying a specialist manufacturer of hospital cardiology equipment in an all-stock deal valued at Dollars 158m. The purchase will give Pfizer a dominant position in the market for such equipment, and reflects the consolidation under way in the US healthcare sector. Faced with pressure from hospitals and other buyers for lower prices, most healthcare companies have come to focus on market share as their primary short-term goal. Namic USA, based in Glen Falls, New York, reported after-tax profits of Dollars 5m on sales of Dollars 57m in its last fiscal year, which ended on May 31. The company claims to hold around two-thirds of the US market for equipment used in fluid administration, waste containment and pressure monitoring during angio-plasty. Namic said it also accounts for about 20 per cent of the European market for this equipment and that the acquisition by Pfizer would increase its ability to expand in European markets. Pfizer's own subsidiary which makes cardiology equipment, Schneider, accounted for just under 15 per cent of the Dollars 1bn sales generated by its hospital supplies operations in 1993.</p>

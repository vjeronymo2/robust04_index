			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARIZONA LINEBACKER, A LEUKEMIA VICTIM, LEAVES HOSPITAL; EARLY PROGNOSIS IS GOOD  </P> <P> Kevin Singleton, a University of Arizona linebacker being treated for leukemia,  was released Wednesday from University Medical Center. His doctor said  Singleton was headed toward remission.  </P> <P> Singleton, who expressed his thanks for widespread support, said his acute  lymphblastic leukemia is "a challenge for me. I handle challenges. I live to  destroy, to dominate challenges."  </P> <P> Singleton, 22, a fifth-year senior, was admitted July 7 with a bacterial  shoulder infection and other symptoms later diagnosed as leukemia. He lost 30  of his 230 pounds but has regained four to five pounds in the past few days, he  said.  </P> <P> Dr. Robert M. Rifkin said the infection has cleared up completely, but added  that Singleton has not received chemotherapy treatment long enough to be in  formal remission.  </P> <P> Said Singleton: "The people of Arizona have shown me that they really care for  Kevin Singleton as a person, as an athlete," and that 20 to 30 letters daily  and a barrage of flowers and balloons had helped his recovery.  </P> <P> Singleton was an honorable mention Pacific 10 Conference selection at inside  linebacker.  </P></p>

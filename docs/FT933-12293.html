			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Special Report on Second Cars: The luxury that has become a necessity - Recession has failed to halt the second-car market, but it faces another threat from tax changes next year DEFINING a 'second' car is not easy. Most would, perhaps, see it as a cheap family runabout, secondary to the company-provided 'first' car. But, in fact, it takes many forms: It is the lovingly-maintained classic sports car used only on special occasions - and then only when the weather is dry. It is the Range Rover Vogue, dripping with accessories, used for dropping off the children at their day public school en route to the tennis club - a four-wheel-drive as a fashion statement. It is the small, open, Japanese two-seater reviving 1960s' MG memories for nostalgic, middle-aged businessmen. Or it is the battered Mini which the caring father drives daily to the station, leaving the company car for his nearest and dearest The growth of the second-car market has been slowed, but not halted, by recession. As bus and rail services continue to decline, so the second car is becoming a necessity rather than a luxury. More than a third of households now operate two cars, and more than one in 20 run three. Around 500,000 'second' vehicles, both new and used, are likely to be bought this year. But the exact cost of running them - in terms of purchase, depreciation and, particularly, insurance (as a result of soaring car crime) - is likely to be examined more closely than usual this year by many families. Doing so should provide some clues as to what company car drivers should do when new rules for taxing the private benefit of company cars start on April 6. Many companies already are offering staff a cash alternative to their company vehicles. But surveys - such as this year's Lex Report on Motoring - indicate that few drivers have any accurate idea of how much salary would be needed in lieu. Since most second cars are bought with private, after-tax income, a close study of total costs - including finance charges, or interest foregone on money used for a cash purchase - could make many drivers ponder long and hard before handing back the company car keys. That favoured small band of employees which gets two company cars will find from April 6 that both will be assessed for tax on exactly the same basis, so that the second car - which is likely to do little or no business mileage  -will be taxed at the highest rate. The new taxation regime, based on a simple percentage of a vehicle's cost, will thus hit small pockets of the second-car market hard. Because there is no 'cap' on the system, drivers of very expensive cars face almost unlimited tax bills - an actual cash payment of more than Pounds 58,000, for example, for anyone running one of Jaguar's Pounds 415,000 XJ220 sports coupes on the company and covering fewer than 2,500 business miles a year. There is also a nasty shock in store for anyone running an exotic classic car as a second company vehicle. Historically, doing this has been quite sensible because they were taxed on the basis of original purchase price, long since slashed by inflation. But next year's tax regime will cover them on the basis of present market value. Women now account for 40 per cent of the UK driving population, and most are making clear they are more interested in value for money than driving 'classics' or what time it takes a car to go from 0/60 mph. This bodes well for the further rapid growth of diesels in the second-car market because of their much greater fuel economy compared with petrol vehicles. Another sector showing sharp sales growth is that for highly versatile 'people carriers.' These high-roof, multi-passenger, multi-purpose vehicles were pioneered in the US by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. Based on commercial vans, most have long since parted company with their mundane forebears and versions sold by specialist converters include refrigerators, videos, televisions, carpets, curtains, sofas which convert into beds, air-conditioning and even cookers - all at prices that would yield only a mid-range family saloon to buyers elsewhere. European manufacturers have yet to take such a bold step, though. A few years from now, it is possible that the second car - at least, if used as a local runabout - will be battery-powered. But electric car development in the UK is lagging behind some continental countries and France in particular, where low-cost nuclear energy is particularly suitable for charging electric cars and facilities for this are being set up in cities throughout the country. These facilities are aimed particularly at Peugeot and Renault electric cars to be launched from the mid-1990s. Peugeot estimates Europeans will be buying 200,000 such vehicles annually by year-2000.</p>

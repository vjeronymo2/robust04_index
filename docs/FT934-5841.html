			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A matter of choice My wife and I own our house in equal shares as tenants-in-common. To reduce inheritance tax, we intend to leave our half shares to our son. But would it not be wiser to leave him 9/10ths of our half share so that the survivor with 11/20ths would have full control over the property? An individual who owns a share of property as tenant-in-common is able to leave the whole or part of his share in the property to whoever he wishes. It is possible, therefore, that you could in your will leave 9/10ths of your share to your son and 1/10th to your spouse. Your spouse would then have an 11/20ths share in the property, but this does not mean that she would have 'full control' of it. Both your son and widow, as tenants-in-common, have an undivided share in the whole property, which means that the person with the smaller interest can still enjoy the whole of the property.

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Ministers see savings in drive against housing benefit fraud HOUSING BENEFIT fraud is to be the main focus of government plans to save up to Pounds 1bn next year by preventing false social security payments. Ministers hope to be able to announce the detailed measures in time for the Tory party conference due to take place early next month. The move is likely to be announced by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, who will be keen to find a statement popular with the party, given the anger among grassroots Tories that no scheme has yet been announced for compensating those worst affected by the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. Housing benefit is administered by local authorities, and among the probable changes is a reform of the complicated arrangements through which councils are repaid by government for what they spend, to give them a greater incentive to cut down on fraud. Better systems under which central government can keep a check on how authorities are running the benefit are also likely. Until now, Whitehall officials say, the emphasis has been strongest on tackling fraud in benefits administered by central government, and the greatest savings in these areas may already have been made. A report from the Audit Commission, a government-spending watchdog, said early this year that it welcomed moves already taken to reduce the disincentive for councils to mount fraud investigations and improve housing benefit administration. However it added that more should be done. A group of officials from the interested departments have been carrying out a review of housing benefit for some months, as part of the long-term review of public spending. Ministers in the Department of the Environment and the Department of Social Security have concluded, however, that they can do little to cut housing benefit rates without undermining the government's social housing policy. Instead, in the public spending discussions with the Treasury, they are offering to make the savings necessary from an anti-fraud initiative. One official said that discussions were still going on, but housing benefit would probably alter to put the onus on local authorities to track down fraudsters.</p>

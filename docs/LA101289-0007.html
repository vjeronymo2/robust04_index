			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARNOLD M. PICKER; FILM INDUSTRY FIGURE  </P> <P> Arnold M. Picker, former executive vice president of United Artists Pictures  and a nationally prominent political fund-raiser for Democrats, has died at the  age of 76.  </P> <P> He died Sunday of pneumonia at New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston.  </P> <P> As finance chairman for former Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie's 1972  presidential campaign, Picker became something of a political power broker. In  1980, he was considered the driving force behind Democrats for an Open  Convention, a group of businessmen and officials who tried to prevent the  nomination of either incumbent President Jimmy Carter or Sen. Edward M. Kennedy  (D-Mass.)  </P> <P> Because of his work with Muskie, Picker was targeted by a 1971 plan of the  Nixon White House to use Internal Revenue Service audits in what a memo called  an effort "to screw our political enemies." According to secret memos given to  the Senate Watergate Committee by John W. Dean III, counsel to President  Richard M. Nixon, Picker was the No. 1 target on a priority list of 20 supposed  "enemies."  </P> <P> Picker gained respect in the film industry for his efforts to foster the medium  as art. He helped form the American Film Institute and was a co-founder of the  Holocaust Documentation &amp; Education Center at Florida International  University in Miami.  </P> <P> He also served as chairman of the board of the National Center for Jewish Film  set up by the American Jewish Historical Society at Brandeis University in  Waltham, Mass.  </P> <P> The son of Loews Theater executive David V. Picker, he began his career with  Columbia Pictures in 1935 in its foreign department. Ten years later, he was  named vice president in charge of foreign distribution for Columbia Pictures  International Corp.  </P> <P> Picker switched to United Artists Pictures in 1951 as a partner and executive  vice president in charge of international distribution.  </P> <P> "No executive to my knowledge was more respected and admired by those who were  privileged to work with him," Arthur B. Krim, former chairman of United Artists  Corp. and now chairman of the board of Orion Pictures, told Daily Variety after  Picker's death.  </P> <P> President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Picker to the U.S. Advisory Commission on  International Education and Cultural Affairs in 1965.  </P> <P> Picker is survived by his wife, two daughters, two brothers, and seven  grandchildren.  </P> <P> Private services were conducted Wednesday in New York.  </P></p>

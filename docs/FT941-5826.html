			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Singh's gamble Mr Manmohan Singh's fourth budget, announced this week, has to be judged against the background of nearly three years of remarkable progress in opening up an Indian economy distorted by decades of protection and over-zealous bureaucracy. Indian companies are working with a new spirit of enterprise, far less fettered by government, and have substantially boosted exports. The liberalisation which made this possible has been advanced somewhat by Mr Singh's budget. But investors who have been pouring money into India may be disappointed that the finance minister has not taken advantage of the government's now strong political position to push the reform process ahead more aggressively. Mr Singh was facing twin problems: the fiscal deficit has been running far higher than he expected, partly because economic growth has been slower. He opted to boost the latter and take a risk that the former will not balloon further. Unsurprisingly, the Indian business community is delighted with cuts in interest rates and corporate taxes. There is no trace of austerity measures to bring the budget deficit back on track - the target has been set at an undesirably high level of 6 per cent of gross domestic product. This is an acknowledged gamble. The government still lacks broad enough popular support for reform because it has not triggered Chinese-style growth. If the economy could be induced to boom without excessive inflation, it would reduce the fiscal deficit and provide a broad mandate for further liberalisation. Admittedly, the budget deficit is not as alarming as it was in 1991 when it was financed by foreign borrowing. Now it is financed internally and Mr Singh has pledged to eliminate direct government borrowing from the banking system within three years. At the same time, inflation is in single figures and the reserves position is so comfortable that the International Monetary Fund is to be repaid early. There are also good reform measures. Convertibility of the rupee on current account transactions is an important step forward. Import duties have been reduced further, and simplified. There are moves towards indirect taxes which would enable the government to reduce its dependence on customs duties and reduce them again. But there were no surprises, and nothing suggesting a desire to accelerate the pace of reform. For the time being, this may be it. Significant reforms of taxation and labour law, as well as stepped-up privatisation, may have to wait. India's reforms have not, however, come so far that they will create their own momentum. Mr Rao and Mr Singh need to ensure that they do not, by reverting to the slow track, allow the progress they have made so far to be sacrificed to the many still well-protected interests - in the public sector, business and labour - who stand in the way of a true opening of the economy.</p>

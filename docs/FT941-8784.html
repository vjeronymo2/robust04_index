			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Canberra moves to stop dock strike The Australian government yesterday intervened to move more than ADollars 100m (Pounds 49m) worth of exports which have been held up in a nationwide port strike, writes Emilia Tagaza in Melbourne. Mr Laurie Brereton, industrial relations minister, asked the Transport Department to 'do everything possible' to move stranded cargo using the only stevedore company, Conaust, which is not strike-bound. This is the most significant intervention since the pilots' strike four years ago when the government mobilised Air Force jets and pilots to fly passengers. The strike began last week when Australian Stevedores sacked 55 workers in Sydney, the first compulsory port redundancies since the reform programme. The government intervention in the dock strike was caused by a need to sustain the economic recovery, which has been helped by improving exports.</p>

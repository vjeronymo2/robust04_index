			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development  Corporation (PNC) has decided to introduce supercomputers this  fiscal year and they will begin selecting early next year.    The ones planned to be introduced would be a Central  Processing Unit (CPU) system incorporating over ten units of  super row calculators combined with a graphic calculator and an  operation work station. PNC already has introduced a Bechtel  Computer System at the Information Center, at O-arai Engineer  Center last year and this will be their second unit. The new  unit will also be installed at the Center and it will be used  for studies of underground waste disposal and severe event  conditions for fast breeder reactors (FBRs).    At the Information Center, a CPU with one Bechtel calculator  has already been installed and assimilation of complex phenomena  are being treated. However, with only one CPU, it is not always  effective for timely assimilation. For example, in research and  development of underground waste disposal, many calculation  codes must be combined and an event is assimilated while basic  understanding and evaluation must be made repeatedly. At the  same time, models are formed and systems are developed, and  accuracy must be raised. In such cases, while trial and error is  being repeated, tremendous number of parameter surveys are being  made while the calculation process is being confirmed by visual  reappearance and at the same time, it is important that  conditions be changed during calculation in order that the best  condition be found. In this way, while calculating, results are  made real and visual at the work station, but with the Bechtel  computer, it is not effective in using methods to change and  evaluate established conditions in the midst of a calculation.    In contrast, with a CPU containing super rows of computers,  it is possible to simultaneously process multiple calculation  codes in rows at high speed. It is also possible to dynamically  establish changes during operation and it has the advantage of  being able to evaluate results realistically.    At PNC, the assimilation is to be used for real evaluation  analysis such as for heat flow power of FBRs and also for  various kinds of phenomena occurring in underground waste  disposal.    The introduction will be decided within this fiscal year,  installation is to be made next year, tests on the applicability  of the existing software programs for row calculators will be  investigated, and trial is planned for 1995. The present  introduction has been approved under this year's revised budget  and Science and Technology Agency has decided to introduce  computers not only to PNC but to the Institute of Physical and  Chemical Research and to National Aerospace Laboratory.</p>

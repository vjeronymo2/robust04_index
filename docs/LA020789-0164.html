			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SUNS FILE PROTEST OVER DOUBLE FOUL  </P> <P> The Phoenix Suns have filed a protest with the NBA, claiming that the referees'  misinterpretation of a rule cost their club in last Saturday night's overtime  loss here to Atlanta.  </P> <P> With Phoenix trailing 118-116, Suns guard Kevin Johnson collided with Hawks  guard Doc Rivers on a drive to the basket with 10 seconds remaining in  overtime.  </P> <P> Referee Ed Rush called a charging foul on Johnson while referee Jim Capers  called a blocking foul on Rivers. A double-foul was assessed and Phoenix  retained possession of the ball. Instead of calling a jump ball at center  court, however, referees instructed Phoenix to inbound the ball, and Johnson's  desperation jumper at the buzzer bounced off the front of the rim on the final  play.  </P> <P> The Suns, in their protest Monday, said that the double-foul rule was  misinterpreted by the referees and that there should have been a jump ball.  </P> <P> Phoenix officials said NBA Commissioner David Stern should make a ruling on the  protest within five days of receiving the letter.  </P></p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Control Techniques edges ahead Shares in Control Techniques fell by more than 9 per cent yesterday after the Powys-based electronic drives group reported a modest 3 per cent increase in interim profits on lower sales and blamed 'a slow start in a poor first quarter'. The shares closed down 45p at 442p after the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.84m after US reorganisation costs of Pounds 600,000 in the six months to March 31, against profits of Pounds 3.72m after reorganisation costs of Pounds 200,000 in the comparable period. Turnover fell from Pounds 54.2m to Pounds 52.1m, reflecting the effects of the reorganisation in the US which resulted in the postponement of Pounds 1.4m of sales to the second half. Despite the setback, Mr Trevor Wheatley, chairman, said the US operations, which were acquired three years ago and have undergone substantial rationalisation, were now in profit. 'The second quarter moved ahead very strongly and order books are some 17 per cent ahead of the same time last year and showing signs of improving even further,' he said. 'Orders in April were an all-time record and over 40 per cent up on the same month last year.' Earnings in the first half increased by 10 per cent to 6.5p (5.9p), and the interim dividend is raised to 2.6p (2.35p) reflecting confidence about the outcome for the year as a whole and the fact that the reorganisation process is now substantially complete. Net interest costs fell to Pounds 524,000 (Pounds 807,000) although net borrowings increased to Pounds 13.8m at the end of March, up from Pounds 8.63m at the end of September, partly reflecting growth in stocks. The group opened four new CT Drive Centres in Denmark, the Czech Republic, India and Norway during the first half bringing the total to 27 - more than half way to its target of 50. COMMENT A nervous market punished Control Techniques for surprising it with unexpected re-organisation costs and disappointing figures yesterday. Nevertheless, the fundamentals remain strong, and provided orders are converted into sales, the outlook for the second half is good. Eliminating losses in the US and cutting costs in Germany will help margins. Pre-tax profits should reach at least Pounds 12m this year, producing earnings of 20p. Even after yesterday's fall the shares are still trading on a prospective multiple of 22.1, which reflects continued speculation about the intentions of Emerson Electric, the US group which holds a 29.37 per cent stake.</p>

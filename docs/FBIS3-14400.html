They also arrested 250 political suspects, some with earlier  political convictions.    This news came in an announcement today by Major General  Mansur al-'Isawi, assistant foreign minister and Cairo security  director. He said this latest campaign, carried out on the  instructions of Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi, focused  primarily on Cairo's al-Matariyah, al-Basatin, al-Sharabiyah,  and Manshiyat Nasir districts.    Maj. Gen. al-'Isawi added that the security forces also  rounded up 350 other people suspected or convicted criminals.    He added that counternarcotics agents who assisted in the  security campaign uncovered 350 narcotics cases in which various  types of illegal drugs were involved. Two days ago one kg of  heroin with an estimated value of two million Egyptian pounds  was seized.    Al-'Isawi reported that the security sweeps began several  days ago and spread over the northern, southern, eastern, and  western sectors of Cairo. The campaign, in which units from the  Central Security Forces, Public Security, Police, State Security  Detective Force, and the Traffic police participated, was  designed to tighten the noose around fugitive criminals.    The Cairo security director said that the campaign was  fruitful.</p>

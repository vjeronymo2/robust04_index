			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Arts: Lily-livered executioner - Off the Wall THE Arts Council is proving a maladroit executioner. On Thursday it was set to freeze the blood, to announce the arts companies that would have their grants withdrawn following the Council's new policy of backing winners and removing support from the mundane. Already the rumour factory had reduced the number of victims to around 10, but it was made clear that drama would be badly hit. On Wednesday the drama panel at the Council threatened mass resignations. On Thursday the Council announced that there would be more consultations. There is nothing wrong with the Council finally daring to wield the axe. In the past, once you became a client you were on a permanent gravy train. But it is going about the business in a hopeless fashion. For a start it is planning to give most of the Pounds 1.4m saved from the drama budget to contemporary dance and visual art. If the public had a choice it would surely favour saving its local theatres rather than funding such minority art forms more lavishly. Presenting even more cause for concern are the names rumoured to be on the hit list - the theatres at Plymouth, Oldham, Coventry, Watford, Greenwich, and the Lyric Hammersmith, all of whom have recently presented excellent work. Given the box office recession, and the financial problems of local authorities, their future would be in jeopardy if their grants were withdrawn. It gets worse. The Council is threatened with a 2 per cent, or Pounds 5m, cut in its own grant by the government in 1994-95. Is this the time for the Council to impose additional misery on the arts world? And it seems confused in its judgments. It suggests that if the government comes up with more money than anticipated then some of the doomed theatres might get their cash. This makes a nonsense of the argument that they have been chosen for closure for artistic failings. The Arts Council also shows its lack of relish for blood letting by choosing an outsider, Sir Leonard Hoffman, to do its dirty work on the London orchestras. The Council wants to save the Pounds 400,000 subsidy it gives to the RPO. It wants the LPO and the Philharmonia to merge into a slightly enlarged band based on the South Bank, giving London two top-flight orchestras. (The other would be the LSO at the Barbican). This is the formula that Sir Leonard will be expected to recommend to the Council. Finally, the Council is behaving shabbily over the popular and successful Glyndebourne Touring Opera. It has asked it to apply annually for grants from 1995-96 and stipulates that these will be confined to visits to medium sized theatres such as Plymouth (if it is still in business) and Norwich. But Glyndebourne prefers to play bigger venues and its productions are often ill-designed for smaller stages. The Council seems to have a vendetta against southern-based opera companies. One of the few clients it has killed off was Kent Opera. Now it has Glyndebourne Touring in its sights. It is all very strange.                           *       *       * 'Sensational' was the word when an early 19th century calculator, which was estimated to sell for around Pounds 15,000, was bid up to Pounds 7.7m at Christie's in London on May 19. It was an unprecedented event in any auction room. So how do you describe the subsequent events - super-sational? The successful bidder, the well-respected Swiss dealer Edgar Mannheimer, has failed to pay up during the official 30-day period. This is just about understandable: he could have crossed wires with a big collector who subsequently decided that he did not want to go that high. However, the most intriguing aspect of the affair is the behaviour of the under-bidder who was, in theory, representing a German museum. The museum says that its top budget for an acquisition is Pounds 200,000. There is no sense to it all. That is why there are wild rumours in the antiques trade of a dealer who is very ill but who wants to leave his mark on the business to enter antiques history. But he would have to persuade a friend to co-operate on chasing up the price of a rare but not unique object to incredible heights. This seems less likely. The most sensible explanation is that whatever Mannheimer's motives, the under-bidder got carried away by atmosphere and Teutonic pride carried him into the stratosphere. It is bad news for the vendor, who went on holiday to celebrate his extraordinary coup. It is less bad news for Christie's which, as agent, does not have to recompense him with Pounds 7.7m. But somehow one cannot see a long legal case materialising with the vendor trying to extract Pounds 7m from the 'buyer'. If the German museum still wants an early 19th century calculator, well, Sotheby's is offering what it considers to be a similar example on October 7. It is keeping its feet on the ground with an estimate of Pounds 200,000, just what the museum can afford.                           *       *       * All those cynics who have dubbed the Department of National Heritage, the Department of Nothing Happening, need only wait another nine months. By then Peter Brooke, the minister, will be in a position to amaze us with his energy. Brooke, a politician and a gentleman if ever the two can twin, takes a relaxed, long term view of his job. He spent his first nine months mugging up his brief and at the end of the next nine anticipates that he will have enough data for decisions to be made. He seems quite ready to switch resources in his Pounds 1bn balliwick from sports to arts, or from heritage to broadcasting if the evidence favours drastic change. Brooke believes that it requires a long stint at a job to be effective. Let us hope that the PM thinks the same. Brooke is not bullish about the prospects for the arts and heritage in the current expenditure round. He takes comfort from the thought that the traditional approach of giving arts organisations lavish grant increases one year and then being forced by economic crises to take the money away the next is as deleterious as keeping them permanently skint, the current plan. But he does feel that he has ring-fenced National Lottery money from Treasury predators, and if the legislation can pass through Parliament this month then by the end of 1984 the arts and the heritage, as well as sport, charities and the Millennium Fund, will each benefit by at least Pounds 75m a year, with most (but not all) the extra money going on capital projects. The sum could be as high as Pounds 200m, which would transform the UK cultural scene. So it seems a case of hanging on grimly for the good times. Brooke also believes in leaving well alone, but he does not seem to think that the Arts Council is a totally healthy organisation.</p>

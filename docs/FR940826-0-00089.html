The existence of several substitutes in this end-use may increase the likelihood of significant cross-contamination. To address this increased risk, EPA is proposing several use conditions on the use of all motor vehicle air conditioning refrigerants. Please refer to the notice of proposed rulemaking, soon to be issued, for more information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (22) CFC&hyph;12 Non-Automobile Motor Vehicle Air Conditioners, Retrofit and New <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (a) HCFC&hyph;22._HCFC&hyph;22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in retrofitted and new CFC&hyph;12 Non-Automobile Motor Vehicle Air Conditioners.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In some situations, HCFC&hyph;22 may be used as a retrofit refrigerant in bus and rail car air conditioning systems originally designed to use CFC&hyph;12. In addition, while HCFC&hyph;22 is the primary refrigerant in these uses, EPA is listing it as an acceptable substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in new systems in order to remove confusion about its usefulness. Please note that HCFC&hyph;22 is only acceptable in motor vehicles other than automobiles. Design differences render HCFC&hyph;22 ineffective in cars. In fact, HCFC&hyph;22 may damage automobile air conditioners. HCFC&hyph;22 does contribute to ozone depletion and will therefore be phased out according to the accelerated schedule (published 12/10/93, 58 FR 65018). It is therefore covered by regulations issued under section 608 of the CAA. HCFC&hyph;22 is nonflammable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (23) Non-mechanical Heat Transfer, Retrofit and New <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA did not review substitutes for this end-use as part of the SNAP FRM, nor did it propose to include this end-use in the refrigeration and air conditioning sector in the NPRM (58 FR 28094). However, the Agency has developed a better understanding of the volumes likely to be used as coolants, and this new information has led EPA to reconsider its earlier position that heat transfer systems constitute small uses. Therefore, EPA has included this end-use within the refrigeration and air conditioning sector. In a subsequent proposal, EPA plans to propose narrowed use limits for several substitutes in this end-use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (24) CFC&hyph;13, R&hyph;13B1, and R&hyph;503 Very Low Temperature Refrigeration, Retrofit and New <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This type of refrigeration requires temperatures well below those achieved with R&hyph;502 or HCFC&hyph;22. Because these systems are used for purposes such as freezing blood or for simulating extreme conditions for testing, extremely low leakage rakes are essential. A limited number of substitutes have been identified that are capable of meeting technical requirements. These substitutes all contain components with extremely high GWPS, and EPA is concerned about their potential contribution to global warming. However, under SNAP, EPA intends to only find those substitutes unacceptable that clearly present greater overall risk. Given this framework, EPA finds these high-GWP substitutes acceptable. At the same time, EPA strongly urges industry to develop new alternatives for this end-use that do not contain substances with such high GWPs and long lifetimes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (a) HFC&hyph;23._HFC&hyph;23 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;13, R&hyph;13B1, and R&hyph;503 in retrofitted and new very low temperature refrigeration.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HFC&hyph;23 has an extremely high GWP of 9000 and a lifetime of 280 years. Its GWP is the highest among the HFCs, and its lifetime is exceeded only by the PFCs. EPA believes it could contribute significantly to global warming. In addition, the long lifetime of HFC&hyph;23 means any global warming or other effects would be essentially irreversible. While the current rule issued under section 608 of the CAA does not require recycling and recovery of HFC&hyph;23, or leak repair for systems using HFC&hyph;23, EPA strongly encourages users to anticipate future rulemakings with voluntary compliance. In particular, EPA urges users to reduce leakage and recover and recycle HFC&hyph;23 during equipment servicing and upon the retirement of equipment. HFC&hyph;23 is nonflammable and does not deplete ozone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Italian action fails to boost lira ITALY forced up interest rates yesterday by 1.75 percentage points, the biggest increase in 11 years, and drew on international central bank credits in a fresh attempt to protect the lira. The rise in the Bank of Italy's discount rate to 15 per cent, the highest since 1985, was accompanied by further heavy intervention but gave no significant boost to the lira. The Italian currency finished a nervous European trading day close to its floor in the European Monetary System against the D-Mark. The international efforts to bolster the lira, backed by the German and Belgian central banks, represented one of the largest EMS support operations since the last full-scale realignment nearly six years ago. In spite of the action, the lira closed in Milan at its EMS floor of 765.40 against the D-Mark. In London it closed just off its floor at 765.0. Italian commercial banks said they would match the discount rate increase with a matching rise in their interest rates charged to customers. The discount rate move was accompanied by increases in short-term money market rates, which yesterday were about 18 per cent. Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of the Fiat group, was quoted as saying: 'We are very concerned. Interest rates have reached unbearable levels for industry.' The Bank of Italy said the lira had become vulnerable after the UK's move on Thursday to borrow Ecu10bn of foreign currencies to prop up sterling. This shifted international selling pressure from the pound to the lira. In intervening to support the lira, the Bundesbank and Belgian central bank were acting under EMS rules requiring automatic action to prop up weak currencies once they touch their floor. Although the Italian authorities insisted the country was not running short of foreign exchange reserves, the Bank of Italy's convertible currency holdings have fallen sharply during the lira's weakness of the past two months. The last published figures for Italy's foreign currency reserves at the end of July showed a total of L27,808bn against L38,583bn the previous month and L66,513bn in July 1991. Partly in response to this drain on reserves, the Bank of Italy announced yesterday it was making use of EMS credit facilities enabling it to borrow unlimited amounts of strong currencies for up to 2 1/2 months to defend the lira's parity. Using foreign currency drawn from the other EMS central banks, the Bank of Italy intervened early in the day selling DM890m and BFr800m to protect the lira. The Bundesbank, according to market dealers, bought L13bn at yesterday's midday currency fixing. By drawing on EMS credit facilities, the Bank of Italy appears anxious to remind the Bundesbank in particular that the weakness of the lira does not have repercussions only for Italy. The Bundesbank's purchases of lira, as well as its loans of D-Marks to the Italian central bank, can indirectly lead to an expansion of German banking liquidity, counteracting the Bundesbank's efforts to hold down rapidly rising monetary growth.

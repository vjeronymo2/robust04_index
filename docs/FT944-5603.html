			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Retail decline leaves Anglian Gp lower at Pounds 10m Shares in Anglian Group, the double glazing company, fell 25p to 175p yesterday, after the group revealed a sharp decline in interim profits and stated that 'it is likely that the result for the full year will be lower than last year'. A marked decline in retail revenues was the main factor in a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 10.1m for the six months ended October 1. Mr Ron Swift, chief executive, admitted the figures were disappointing, but said retail orders in the pipeline were up 6 per cent from 1993, which would feed through into profits for the second half. Retail sales account for more than 75 per cent of Anglian's annual revenues, and command the highest margins. Turnover rose by 6.4 per cent to Pounds 89.4m (Pounds 84m), while operating profits fell from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 9.9m, reflecting price cutting by Anglian in order to win public sector orders, following the privatisation of the Property Services Agency. Anglian has also expanded direct sales to the building trade, which reap substantially lower margins. Trade sales, while expanding rapidly, had an adverse impact on cash flow, as debtors increased from Pounds 17.4m to Pounds 23.7m, reflecting slow payment. However, Anglian retains Pounds 8.36m of cash and no bank debt. The company warned of an acceleration in the rise of raw material prices, particularly polymer, which rose by 20 per cent in October. Mr David Herman, finance director, said: 'We are competing against a lot of people who are not making any money. In the long run, they will have to pass on cost increases to the customer.' Mr Swift was confident of a pick-up in the second half, reflecting Anglian's fuller order book, and the dividend has been maintained at 4.1p. Earnings per share fell from 9.1p to 7.9p.</p>

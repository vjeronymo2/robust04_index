			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Storehouse Pity about FRS3. The adoption of the new accounting conventions rather wrecked Storehouse's annual results, knocking down pre-tax profits to Pounds 15.2m and almost wiping out earnings per share. The damage caused by disposing of businesses also meant the company had to dip into reserves to fund its maintained dividend. But the market chose to ignore such technicalities, concentrating instead on Storehouse's underlying trading. At that level, the company buffed up its reputation as one of retailing's most promising recovery stocks, lifting trading profits more than four-fold to Pounds 43m. BhS doubled its contribution. Mothercare, at last, came back into the black. Storehouse's share rating certainly demands as much. Fortunately, the recovery momentum seems to have a long way to run - although the appointment of a chief executive would help convert the doubters. BhS's sales per square foot remain pitiful in comparison with Marks and Spencer. Mothercare's profit margin is still less than 2 per cent. Yet Storehouse is also laying firm foundations for solid organic growth over the longer term. Although expensive in the short run, the repurchase of property freeholds will lower its future cost base. Its continuing restructuring of store operations will do the same. Storehouse's recovery is a classic example of the benefits of concentrating on core businesses - and the joys of starting from a low base. Would that Burton and Sears were to follow suit.</p>

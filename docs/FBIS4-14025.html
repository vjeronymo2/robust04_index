			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dividing Lines" column by Samir Rajab] </F>   [Text] It does not befit the United States to sell 25 F-15A  military aircraft to Israel in the current tense atmosphere and  when acts of violence are taking place daily. With this  decision, Washington wants to tell the whole world: "Let Israel  strike at the Palestinians as it pleases, let it slow down and  stall over implementing the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, and let it  set the toughest conditions for withdrawal from the Syrian  Golan; that is, if it ever really considered withdrawal." These  are not our words. This is, verbatim, what the Pentagon said to  justify the aircraft deal: The Pentagon's statement said that  the deal will contribute to furthering the foreign policy and  national security of a "friendly" country that will remain an  important force for political stability and economic progress in  the Middle East.    First, the claim that Israel is a factor of stability  contradicts the truth, because since they "planted it," Israel  has been the root of upheaval, conflict, and war. Even after  signs of peace began to loom on the horizon, Israel did not give  up its shameless actions and behavior. Proof of this is the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and subsequent shameless acts.    At the same time, I maintain that the United States has a  right to market its industrial products and help its partners  survive. Frankly speaking, however, the timing is  inappropriate. The need is not so urgent that Israel should be  provided with the most modern offensive aircraft on the pretext  of strengthening its air force so that it can reach particular  positions in Iraq, which fired missiles at Israeli cities during  the Gulf war. This, of course, is a flimsy excuse for the  simple reason that the United States is the first to know Iraq's  current military and economic capabilities, which do not enable  it to stage even a limited maneuver, let alone launch a raid on  Israel.    Anyway, America continues to reiterate that it is a  "partner"  in the peace negotiations. A partner is supposed to be  concerned about attaining the goal. But I believe that the  announcement today about a deal for the sale of  $2.4-billion-worth of aircraft to one of the parties in the  partnership, a party noted for its intransigence, arbitrariness,  and conceit, will not make the achievement of the "goal" of  peace, which we have long and eagerly awaited, easy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 21 Jun (AFP) -- Dante Caputo, former  Argentine foreign minister and current UN/OAS mediator in the  Haitian conflict, delivered to Dominican President Joaquin  Balaguer the list of food supplies and medicines exempt from the  embargo imposed against the Haitian military regime, it was  announced this Tuesday.    Balaguer met with Caputo the night of 20 June, without prior  notice, at his office at the Government Palace. This is  Caputo's third visit with the Dominican president for  discussions on the Haitian crisis with the goal of reinforcing  control of the 300-km border between Haiti and the Dominican  Republic, two nations that share the Caribbean island of  Hispanolia.    Caputo stated a copy of the list delivered to Balguer was  sent approximately 10 days ago to the Dominican Foreign Ministry.    Recently, Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral  stated  Caputo had not sent the list within the timeframe that was  agreed with Balaguer during a prior meeting at which Ambassador  William Gray, President Bill Clinton's special envoy for the  Haitian crisis, had been present. During this meeting, Balaguer  accepted the sending of U.S. advisers and equipment to reinforce  the embargo along the Dominican-Haitian border.    Trade between the two nations since then has been  semiparalyzed and is only allowed twice a week for four hours  across the most transited border crossing.    "We have delivered what we promised," Caputo said this  Tuesday, referring to the document which contains, according to  what he pointed out, "the basic explanation of the (UN)  resolution to enforce a total embargo against the neighboring  nation."    Concerning the United Nations sending advisers and equipment  to verify the compliance of the border embargo, Caputo said, "by  the way, I held conversations last night (...) and logistic  support and equipment coordination are being implemented."    The Argentine diplomat said: "We are very concerned with the  Haitian situation, and we are doing everything possible within  our power" to speed up the resolution to the crisis.    After meeting with Balaguer, Caputo traveled to the  Dominican-Haitian border without giving an explanation as to how  long he would remain there. "We will see," he told reporters  when questioned.    Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer openly opposes the  embargo against the Port-au-Prince military; nevertheless, he  agreed to send soldiers to the border to prevent gasoline  smuggling after meeting with Ambassador Gray.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> MAN WHO MOLESTED 2 GIRLS GETS 38 YEARS  </P> <P> A convicted child molester was sentenced Friday in Ventura County Superior  Court to 38 years in prison for assaulting two girls over a period of six  years.  </P> <P> Charles Ceballos, 58, of Camarillo was arrested Jan. 18 after the younger of  the two girls, who are now 11 and 15, complained to her teacher that Ceballos  had been assaulting her and the other girl since 1984.  </P> <P> Ceballos was convicted Aug. 22 of 89 counts of child molesting, including lewd  or lascivious acts with a child, lewd or lascivious acts with a child with  force and oral copulation with a child with force.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Jenny Scovis filed motions for Judge Robert C. Bradley to  acquit Ceballos and grant a new trial. She argued that the criminal complaint  filed against Ceballos made only vague accusations, alleging that he committed  one act of molestation during each month of each year against each girl,  instead of charging him with specific acts at specific dates and times.  </P> <P> But Bradley denied the motions.  </P> <P> "The jury's either going to believe this conduct took place or it did not,"  Bradley said. "The jury believed the victims and did not believe the defendant.  It's just as simple as that."  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley said in an interview that Ceballos had  faced a maximum sentence of 190 years and eight months in prison.  </P></p>

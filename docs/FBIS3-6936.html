Our party is leading the socialist cause down an  ever-victorious road without the slightest degree of faltering  despite all kinds of difficulties and barriers. In the course  of this struggle our party is demonstrating its pride as a party  of impregnable fortress. The party of impregnable fortress!  This is the symbol of our party's greatness and invincibility.  Our party is a mighty party, the ideology of which is great and  the faith and will of which are incomparably strong and which is  single-heartedly united. There is no such great party in the  world.    Today our people are filled with the great dignity and honor  of having the party of impregnable fortress led by the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. They are burning with the firm  faith and determination to fight more staunchly along the banner  of the party.  <H5>  1. Our Party Is a Party With Great Ideology </H5>   The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: The  chuche, which is our party's world view, is a guiding ideology  of our times that elucidates the most correct way for the  realization of the independence of the popular masses.    The working class party is the general staff of the  revolution and the guiding organization of socialist, communist  construction. For the party to become the strong and mighty  party that leads the socialist cause to victory, its ideology  should be great. The party's guiding ideology is the fundamental  idea [kibon inyom] that elucidates the purpose of the party's  struggle and the principles and methods for its realization. The  guiding ideology determines the party's character and regulates  the basic direction of party building and party activities.    The party of the working class cannot only implant faith in  the correctness and victory of its cause among party members and  the people, but also achieve its ideological and volitional  unity and cohesion and lead to victory the revolution and  construction with correct strategies and tactics only when it  has the great guiding ideology. For the party of the working  class to have a correct guiding ideology is a serious problem  that is closely related to the destiny of the party, that is,  the destiny of socialism. The socialist ruling party collapsed  in some countries in recent years. This was because they did not  have a correct guiding ideology.    When one fails to carry out activities independently with  one's own guiding ideology and fails to develop creatively one's  own guiding ideology in conformity with the aspirations of the  times and people, one will inevitably encounter bitter failure  and vicissitudes in party building, which will eventually result  in creating a grave consequence of making a mess of the party  itself.    Historic lessons have shown that when the party of the  working class lacks a great ideology it is destined to become an  enervated party like a club and cannot defend socialism from the  maneuvers by the imperialists and the betrayers of the  revolution.    Today our party has become a party of impregnable fortress  because it has the great revolutionary ideology. Our party's  only guiding ideology is the immortal chuche idea, that is, the  ideology that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has developed  and completed.    The correctness and vitality of the revolutionary ideology  lie in how correctly the ideology reflects the independent  demands and interests of the popular masses and how  scientifically it has elucidated the way for their realization.    The dear comrade leader has developed and completed the  chuche idea based on his scientific, deep insight into the  demands of our times and the aspirations of the people. Our  party's ideology and theory are the ever-victorious banner that  leads the struggle for the popular masses' independence to  victory and are also the revolutionary strategies and tactics  that make it possible to defeat imperialism and to consummate  the socialist cause, the cause of mankind's independence.    Our party has become the great and invincible revolutionary  party that has not been shaken under any difficult circumstances  because it has the great ideology and theory that are grouped  with the respected name of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    The might of our party that has the great ideology is  boundless. That our party has been able to pioneer a most  correct road in building the revolutionary party of the era of  independence and to defend the banner of the revolution without  the slightest trepidation, even when others were encountering  difficulties and vicissitudes, is precisely because it carries  out party building and party activities, taking the great  ideology and theory as its guiding principle.    When we carry out party building and activities with the  great ideology, we can be constantly strengthened and develop  the party into an invincible, revolutionary party and can  brilliantly implement the socialist cause. This is a valuable  truth proven by our revolutionary practices.    Our party is, above all, thoroughly adhering to its  revolutionary character as a chuche-type party because it has  the great ideology. How the party adheres to its revolutionary  character is an important question that is related to its  prospects.    Missions, strategies, tactics, and the fighting way of the  party can change in the course of progress of the revolution,  but its revolutionary character cannot change. Changes in the  party's character cause a loss of the party's face [tangui  myonmoui sangsil] and result in a tragedy of its degeneration  into a strange party.    The strength of the party is demonstrated in the way of  thoroughly adhering to its revolutionary character. The party's  guiding ideology is essential in adhering to its revolutionary  character. If its guiding ideology is great, the party will not  flutter no matter how the imperialists and reactionaries  maneuver to degenerate the party and can be constantly  consolidated and developed along its own way. Today, our party  can thoroughly adhere to its chuche-oriented character under any  circumstances just because of its great ideology.    No matter how environments and conditions for the revolution  change, the party's revolutionary character created by the  leader [suryong] should thoroughly be adhered to. This is a  firm position that the dear comrade leader sticks to in the  party building. Based on this position, the dear comrade leader  presented the party building program on modelling the entire  party after the chuche idea and has wisely led the struggle to  realize it.    In those days, the dear comrade leader generally systemized  and completed the ideology and theory on the chuche-oriented  party building and accumulated immortal achievements and  valuable experience in party building. His achievements  comprehend all theoretical and practical problems in building  the revolutionary party -- including the question on party  building and its activities with the chuche idea as a guiding  principle, the policies of building the party as a party for the  working popular masses, of firmly guaranteeing the unitary  ideology and leadership in the party, of considering the party's  unity a primary task in party building, and of preparing the  party based on the ideology, as well as the question on imbuing  the society with a single ideology and firmly realizing the  political leadership for the entire society.    Thanks to the ideology for chuche-oriented party building  elucidated by the dear comrade leader, our party is proceeding  with the party building and its activities without the slightest  deviation or vicissitude and is firmly adhering to its  revolutionary character.    Our party is arming party cadres and members with the chuche  idea and preparing them to become chuche-type communist  revolutionaries who actively struggle to realize the chuche  idea. At the same time, our party is firmly adhering to the  purity of the chuche idea and is uncompromisingly fighting  against all old ideologies that contradict it, such as bourgeois  and revisionist ideologies, so that it can prevent any strange  ideology from penetrating our party.    Because it has the great ideology, our party has hardened  its  organizational and ideological basis and has consolidated and  strengthened the single-hearted unity of the entire party.    No matter how far the revolution advances, and no matter how  vicious the imperialists and reactionaries maneuver, our party  will continue its blood line unblemished and will shine forever  as a chuche-type revolutionary party.    With the great ideology as a guiding principle, our party is  also brilliantly developing the future of socialism, overcoming  any trial and obstacle. The road toward socialism is an  untrodden road to be developed totally anew as well as a road of  severe struggle, along which we should advance in an acute  confrontation with the imperialists. Therefore, it is matter of  course that there are obstacles and trials in the course of  advance toward socialism and that unexpected incidents may occur.    In order to stoutly push ahead with the struggle to complete  socialism without the slightest vicissitude, the party must have  scientific ideology and correct strategies and tactics. The  party with the great ideology never pulls down the socialist  banner until it accomplishes its historic mission and advances  even more stoutly, filled with faith and optimism.    Our party has the great socialist, communist building  ideology and theory that enable it to victoriously lead the  revolution and construction according to the demand of reality.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il presaged the  inevitability [happopchiksong] of socialist construction and the  people's desire with his extraordinary wisdom and scientific  insight a long time ago, and has brilliantly completed the  ideology and theory for chuche-oriented socialist, communist  construction.    Our party's ideology and theory are a great communist theory  on occupying the ideological and material fortresses of  socialism by remolding the nature, the society, and human beings  in accordance with the chuche demand, under the banner of  modelling the entire society after the chuche idea. It is also  an encyclopedic theory, with which we can brilliantly solve all  problems arising in the course of the revolution and  construction. Because it is leading the revolution and  construction with this great ideology and theory as its guiding  principle, our party is brilliantly developing the future of  socialism without the slightest deviation or vicissitude.    Without fluttering even when others were loudly talking that  they would reform and reorganize socialism [namduri sahoejuuirul  kaehyokhago kaepyonhandago ttodurodael ttaeedo], our party has  been able to further strengthen its leadership and advance  toward socialism with confidence, adhering to the Taean work  system and the rural theses, just because it considers the great  ideology and theory its guiding principle. This is the basic  factor that has enabled our party to protect and defend  socialism of our own style and to accelerate the revolution and  construction.    The wise leadership of our party, which is pioneering the  course of socialism with the great ideology, was clearly  demonstrated when the grave incident of frustration of socialism  occurred in some countries. When imperialists and reactionaries  talked as if socialism had come to an end and when people who  desire socialism lost their faith, our party scientifically  elucidated the way to correctly explain the substance of the  incident and to rebuild the socialist movement. This is a great  historic contribution that can be made only by a party with its  own great guiding ideology.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's works -- such as  "Historic Lessons of Socialist Construction and Our Party's  General Line," "On Fundamental Questions on Revolutionary Party  Building," and "Disturbance of Socialism Cannot Be Allowed" --  vigorously demonstrate the greatness and justness of our party's  ideology and theory that advance the socialist cause  victoriously.    Not only our people but also the revolutionary people of the  world firmly believe that, when they adhere to the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il's ideology and theory, they can sternly  smash all antisocialist maneuvers by imperialists and  reactionaries and can achieve the ultimate victory of the  socialist cause.    Since it has the great ideology, our party is displaying its  high esteem and honor as a great guide [hyangdoja] that pioneers  the socialist cause at the forefront through severe trials in  history.  <H3>  2. Our Party Is a Party With Peerlessly Strong Faith and  Will </H3>   The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il noted: Our party has  never given in its faith and will under any offensive by the  enemy. It has advanced through severe trials with such faith  and will.    The party cause is a difficult and complicated struggle  through manifold trials and hardships. In order for the party  to fulfill its sublime mission, it must have not only the great  ideology but also faith and will with which to realize it to the  end. The invincible faith that would rather break than bend!  The invincible will with which the party never recedes from the  road of revolution even if the world overturns tens of hundreds  of times! The principle that the party never pulls down the  revolutionary banner until it achieves the ultimate victory of  the revolution! These are uncommon traits of the party that are  carrying out the revolution. When the entire party is filled  with such invincible faith and will, the party can demonstrate  itself as an impregnable party.    A party with firm faith and will that is unswayable in any  trend of the time will never be destroyed or degenerated by any  offensive by the enemy. Just like the people's revolutionary  spirit is determined by the depth of their faith, the party's  might and solidity are guaranteed by the resoluteness of its  revolutionary faith. Faith and determination that the party  keeps in leading the revolution are decisive factors that  influence the destinies of the country and the nation.    The long history of the communist movement has many actual  examples showing that the revolution was frustrated and people  fell into misery because of unstable determination. The faith  of the working class party and its leader [yongdoja], which are  responsible for the destinies of the country and the nation, did  not become unstable.    Inconsistent faith and weak will can never be allowed on the  arduous road of struggle, on which even a single misstep may  cause one to fall into subordination, servitude, frustration,  and failure. The party's faith is the destiny and future of the  revolution. Only a party with stout faith and will can overcome  severe difficulties in the revolution and can lead the people to  the heroic struggle and feats. Because it has iron-firm faith  and will, our party wins honor as an impregnable party and as an  ever-victorious party that never loses.    All our party's activities and struggle are run through with  the firm determination to advance along the single chuche road  pioneered by the great leader [suryong] and with the perfect  faith and will to lead the people to consummate the socialist  cause.    This determination and will have their roots in the Paektu  revolutionary spirit created in an early stage of pioneering the  revolution, and they have been firmly hardened through the  severe class struggle and the huge struggle for creation and  construction.    Therefore, our party's faith and will are not shaken even in  the fierce political, military, and ideological confrontation  with the enemy, and have become stouter as generations are  shifted and as the revolution advances further. Herein is the  reason the people of the world call the Worker's Party of Korea  [WPK] an iron party.    As it has invincible faith and will, our party has become  the  great party that changes an adverse situation into a favorable  one by bravely smashing any antisocialist maneuver by the  imperialists.    The confrontation with the enemy is the confrontation of  strength and of faith and will. Only with faith and courage to  free oneself from being afraid of any threat, blackmail, and  powerful enemy, one can win a victory without fail. This is why  we call the victory of the revolution the victory of faith and  will.    Today, imperialists are taking an unprecedented offensive in  all areas -- political, military, and economic -- to isolate and  ruin [malsal] our Republic, the fortress of socialism. Today,  when socialism has been frustrated in some countries, the world  reactionaries' antisocialist maneuvers aim at us.    Although our party is leading the revolution in this acute  political and military confrontation, it has never fumbled or  fluttered under the enemy's antirevolutionary offensive. The  more the imperialists highhandedly put pressure on it, our party  copes with it with the spirit of untiring patience and smashes  an antirevolutionary offensive with a revolutionary offensive.  This is the stout trait of the WPK under the leadership of  General Kim Chong-il, an iron-willed, sagacious general.    Any threat with nuclear weapons or slandering agitation can  never work with our party and people. It is no accident that  the conscientious people of the world, who can look straight at  the reality, warn imperialists to be well aware what rival  [sangdae] they are facing.    Since it has invincible, firm faith, and will, our party is  always strong and stern in the confrontation with the  imperialists. When the enemy created a dangerous situation on  the brink of war, our party responded to it with the great  decision by announcing the semi-war state in the entire country,  all the people, and the entire Army. When the enemy maneuvered  to demolish [wahae] us with crafty pacification strategy, our  party smashed it with bold and clever tactics, taking the  initiative.    Today, our people are accelerating the socialist  construction  with the fighting spirit to annihilate the aggressors, who try  to harm our socialism, while singing the song of faith that one  can win victory when one keeps socialism, and one will die when  one abandons it. This is because they have the same invincible  faith and offensive spirit [konggyok chongsin] as that of our  party.    As long as our people's struggle is under the leadership of  our party, which has the stoutest faith and will, its history  will shine as an ever-victorious history of struggle of changing  an adverse situation into a favorable one and of turning  misfortune into a blessing.    Because of its firm revolutionary faith and will, our party  is demonstrating its mighty appearance as a most revolutionary  party that never retreats even a step from the principle of the  revolution. The process in which socialism is victorious is the  process in which the principle of the revolution is defended and  embodied. In the revolutionary struggle, the principle of the  revolution is always precious as life--yesterday, today, and in  the future, too. In the struggle to determine socialism or  capitalism standing back from the principle of the revolution  itself is synonymous with surrender.    How to deal with the principle of the revolution and how to  defend it is precisely an important touchstone which shows the  firmness of the faith of the working class party and its combat  capability and might. The character of our party's resolute  revolutionary principle has already been known to the world.  Even in the early period when modern revisionism emerged, our  party repelled any pressure from big countries and firmly  defended its chuche-oriented revolutionary line. Even in the  period when the trend of modern socialist democracy emerged, our  party never stood back from the principle of the revolution.    The principle is victorious without fail, and even though  the  circumstances and conditions of the revolutionary struggle may  vary, the basic ideal and demands of socialism can never change.  This is precisely the revolutionary position to which our party  has firmly adhered.    It is easy to speak about faithfulness to the principle of  the revolution, but it is not easy to put it into practice. This  is more true today, at a time when the wind of antisocialism is  sweeping. However, our party has firmly and invariably adhered  to the basic principles of socialism, including the principle of  realizing the party's unitary leadership in the revolution and  construction, cherishing firm will. To be faithful to the  principles of socialism, it is imperative to have firm faith,  and to render this firm faith absolutely and invariably. This is  precisely the noble truth that has been proven by the struggle  history of our party.    Because of its firm faith and will our party has also become  an invincible revolutionary party that is capable of fulfilling  without fail any vast tasks arising in socialist construction.    The might of the working class party lies in the power of  the  practice of changing the socialist ideal into a great reality.  The party that fails to carry out the struggle task once it has  promised the people, cannot enjoy support from the people or  maintain dignity.    The history of our party's struggle is a history of  stubbornness and a history of heroic exploits, as -- upon  setting a bold attacking target -- it has occupied that target  and has been constantly occupying a new attacking position in  succession. The power of will that our party displayed on these  days was beyond our imagination. Once our party decides to carry  out a task, it fulfills it without fail. This is our party's  disposition. Once our party has started to carry out a task it  pushes ahead with it until it is finished. This is our party's  (?habit).    Smashing the maneuvers of the enemies of the revolution with  rock-firm will if they provoke and breaking through the  mountains with indomitable spirit of attack if they block is  precisely the inherent struggle spirit of our party. The huge  locomotive of the Korean revolution that is dashing toward the  terminal of communism has been running to today's plane on the  strength of this faith and will of our party.    Our party is faced with the heavy but honorable task to  cultivate political and economic strength capable of living  independently under any difficult circumstances and to fully  enhance the superiority of socialism of our own style. Each of  the struggle tasks that our party carried out in the past were  not easy. However, today's revolutionary tasks of our party are  more vast and difficult. Despite such a situation, our party's  determination and will to turn our Republic into a firm fortress  of socialism by thoroughly embodying the revolutionary economic  strategy and by firmly deepening the country's national defense  capability are firm and invariable.    Our party's matchless courage and its strong power of  decision and rock-firm will have constantly bestowed faith and  courage in the victory of the revolution upon our people.  Whenever our party made a courageous decision and a strong  measure that shook the social circles of the world our people's  hearts were seething with the dignity and pride that our party  is the first and our Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il is  the first.    In the dark period of national suffering our people waged an  indomitable struggle, looking ahead to the future of national  liberation. Likewise, our people are struggling with firm faith,  looking ahead to the bright future of socialism of our own style  from the might of the Workers' Party of Korea. This is today's  proud appearance of our people. For our people who have the  party of impregnable fortress there is nothing to fear and there  is no task that cannot be carried out.    With the resolute faith and will embraced by the party, our  people will all the more vigorously accelerate the general march  of socialism of our own style, and will wholly demonstrate the  indomitable spirit of the heroic people who do not know defeat  or retreat in that road.  <H5>  3. Our Party Is a Party of Single-Hearted Unity </H5>   The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: We can  say today with confidence that our party achieved cohesion and  unity that is most solid and has the greatest vitality in which  it cannot be frustrated in whatever way and which can overcome  any kind of trial.    Unity is the party's might and the source of invincibility.  The party itself cannot exist and strengthen apart from the  revolutionary unity. Therefore, we are saying that one of the  most important signs of the revolutionary party--the party of  impregnable fortress--that does not waver in any kind of  hardship of history, lies in the revolutionary unity.    When looking back at history, there were no parties that did  not uphold the banner of unity among the working class parties  that exist up till the present. Then what is the reason for the  collapse of parties that have magnificent tradition and a long  history? This is because the parties did not carry out the  struggle to achieve a true revolutionary unity.    The most solid and mighty unity among unity is the  single-hearted unity. The single-hearted unity is consisted of  only one ideology and one center. It is also based on one  bloodline being succeeded generation after generation.    If we achieve single-hearted unity, then we can smash  [chitbusida] any powerful enemy and acquire the universe. In  the historical communist movement, the WPK was the first party  to achieve this great single-hearted unity. Therefore, it is  becoming a party of impregnable fortress in which the whole  world is admiring.    Our party's single-hearted unity has currently risen to the  most lofty height under the leadership of the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il. In our party, we have already completed  the historical cause that builds the party's organizational and  ideological basis.    Therefore, our party is becoming an iron-willed rank in  which  the whole party is firmly uniting around the great leader  [yongdoja], who is succeeding the revolutionary cause, through  ideological will, morality, and sense of duty. Also, our party  is becoming an invincible party in which whatever element cannot  weaken the party's political and ideological integrity and unity.    The might of our party's single-hearted unity is most of all  being manifested by the fact that the whole party is overflowing  with the absolute admiration of endlessly cherishing and  following its leader [yongdoja]. In essence, the work to  realize the party's cohesion and unity is the work to strengthen  the blood-tied relationship between the leader [yongdoja]  leading the party and the party members who comprehend the party.    Only when the leader [yongdoja] is great and when all the  party members united around the leader [yongdoja] have a  thorough faith and sense of duty, can this kind of unity become  an invincible cohesion and unity that overcomes any kind of  trials and difficulties.    Unity based on practical unity and obligation cannot last  long and cannot manifest the invincible might. In our party, we  are highly upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the  center of unity and center of leadership. Therefore, the  blood-tied relationship, which cannot be severed even if we  wanted to, between the leader [yongdoja] and fighters was firmly  formed.    This resolute relationship is based on absolute admiration  of  their leader [yongdoja], which is deeply rooted in the hearts of  our party members through the long experiences of practical  life. Thus, this has eternal vitality.    Our party members are singing the song by Comrade Yi In-mo,  "We win if you are with us," and are carrying on their party  life bearing his dedicated poem deep in their hearts, for in  this poem and song is reflected the firm, invariable outlook on  the leader of the revolutionary fighter. The absolute mind of  reverence the WPK members have--this is the fascination toward  the dear comrade leader, the great iron-willed man and the  incarnation of the great faith and will; the invariable  conviction that our fatherland and socialism exist because he is  with us; and the noble revolutionary conscience with which they  are firmly determined to adhere to the revolutionary fidelity to  the leader [yongdoja] who has brought them up. Because they  have this ideology and spirit, our party members are waging a  vigorous struggle with a resolve to become a gun and a bomb to  protect and defend the party as they did during the last  semi-war state period. Whenever they are assigned a difficult  revolutionary task, they highly display unmatched devotion as a  standard-bearer of the ranks.    Flawlessly pure and warm is our party members' mind to  entrust the great leader [widaehan yongdoja] with all their  destiny and follow him to the end of the world. Seeing the  noble traits of our party members who adore the dear comrade  leader day and night and send him many a letter of faith and  loyalty, the people of the world cannot help admiring our  party's might in which the leader and the fighter are  wholeheartedly united. Because the millions of party members  with indomitable conviction are upholding the great leader  [widaehan yongdoja], our party's unity and cohesion cannot be  destroyed by anything, and the WPK displays its might to the  entire world.    Our party's might of wholehearted unity is also demonstrated  in the strong organization and discipline with which the entire  party membership functions consistently according to the  leader's ideology and volition. The revolutionary organization  and discipline are the lifeline of the party, and it is an  important yardstick showing its might of wholehearted unity.  Only such a party that has succeeded in realizing wholehearted  unity can function consistently according to the leader's  ideology and volition, and can organize and mobilize the entire  party membership vigorously toward the realization of a single  objective. The party's might is the might of organization and  discipline.    Our party has realized wholehearted unity without its  parallel in history and has become a militant party with strong  organization and discipline. In our party, a revolutionary  leadership system has been firmly established, and all the party  work and party activities are conducted thoroughly according to  the dear comrade leader's ideology and volition. All the party  organizations and party members always develop all work  according to the party policy and implement the party's  decisions and directives through fire and water to the end.  This is the proud feature of our party.    In our party, the resolve of the leader [yongdoja] is the  resolve of the party members. All the party members talk the  same thing and walk at the same pace. Apart from this might of  our party, which has firmly established firm order and  discipline, we cannot mention the proud reality of our  revolution in which the unitary nature of ideology and  leadership is firmly ensured, nor can we think of the might of  our country with which all the country, all the people, and the  entire Army function consistently. Because of its strong  organization and discipline which nothing can destroy, our party  becomes a great party which invariably deals the revolution's  enemy a powerful blow and which gives the people confidence and  optimism.    Our party is neither a feeble party that is utterly  disunited  faced with the trial of the revolution, nor a dispirited party  that is crumbled in the revisionist inclination advocating  liberalization and democracy. Our party's organization and  discipline are unshakable today, and they will remain as strong  as iron in the future as well. No counterrevolutionary  maneuvers of the enemy of the revolution will be able to destroy  our party's strong organization and discipline.    Our party's might, which is solidified like an impregnable  fortress, consists in its taking root deep in the broad popular  masses and commanding their absolute support. The popular  masses are the foundation and root based on the working class  party. The party which has departed from the popular masses,  the party which cannot command the support of the masses is like  a house of cards. As the strength of the popular masses is  inexhaustible, so the party which is in firm unity with the  people is ever-victorious.    Today, our party has not only achieved single-hearted unity  in the party ranks, but struck its roots deep among the broad  strata of the popular masses and won absolute support from them.    Our people have boundless pride in their party and cherish  deep in their hearts the notion that they cannot live even for a  moment without the party.    The belief of our heroic working class is that our party is  the best because it has built a working class-oriented society,  and the will of our farmers is that they would defend and  maintain the socialist rural economic system to the end under  the party's leadership. Our intellectuals have a great honor to  be the party's eternal companions, sincere supporters, and  excellent advisers, and the young people of the new generation  are filled with the pride of being the young vanguards of the  WPK. This is a testament to the fact that the WPK is an  invincible party that has blood ties with people from all walks  of life and leads the revolution with their absolute support and  trust.    In particular, our party and the People's Army are one in  flesh and spirit. This is great pride incomparable to anything  else. A revolutionary army is the defender of the party's  cause, the socialist cause. A party that wins no support or  trust from a revolutionary army and fails to take deep roots in  the army cannot defend socialism against the imperialists'  aggression maneuvers or lead the revolution to victory.    The military discipline of the People's Army, which is  boundlessly loyal to the party and the leader [suryong] and  moves like one under the party's leadership, is very excellent.  Our People's Army officers and men are filled with a firm  resolve to entrust their entire destinies to General Kim  Chong-il, our supreme commander, and be the first to resolutely  defend the party and the leader [suryong] by becoming guns and  bombs.    Our party is powerful, and the security of our fatherland is  firmly guaranteed because there is the People's Army, which has  grown into an invincible powerful Army under the comrade supreme  commander's leadership.    The invincible might of our party, which has struck its  roots  deep among the workers, farmers, soldiers, intellectuals, and  popular masses from all other walks of life, is fully  demonstrated in revolution and construction. We crush any  challenge by the imperialists, resolutely defend and maintain  socialism of our own style, and score great upsurges in  revolution and construction because we have this might of  single-hearted unity.    The invincibility of socialism of our own style and its  bright prospects lie in blood unity among the party, people, and  Army that are strongly united around the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il.    Truly, our party is a party that achieved the most solid and  vital unity and cohesion never before seen in history and an  invincible party that has blood ties with the popular masses.  No power in the world can match this steel-like party.    Having an impregnable party is our people's greatest  happiness and honor. Because there is our party led by General  Kim Chong-il, our supreme commander, our country takes pride in  being a powerful socialist country no one dares to provoke; our  people take pride in being heroic people with combatant  disposition who are always in the habit of winning; and our  People's Army takes pride in being an invincible revolutionary  Army that makes it its conviction to win every war.    Because the party is mighty, socialism of our own style wins  victory after victory without shaking. Our party today takes  pride in being an impregnable party, entirely because it upholds  the iron-willed general and great leader of the revolution  [kangchorui yongjang hyongmyongui widaehan yongdoja].    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great leader  [widaehan yongdoja] who strengthens and develops our party into  an invincible revolutionary party under the banner of modeling  the entire party after the chuche idea. Our party's great ideas  are Comrade Kim Chong-il's ideas and theories, our party's  belief and will is General Kim Chong-il's incomparable boldness  and will, and our party's single-hearted unity is single-hearted  unity around Comrade Kim Chong-il.    That our party casts its ray as an impregnable party because  it upholds the great leader [yongdoja] is our party's proud  reality today. Our party's might is boundless, and the party's  prospects are boundlessly bright. Under this invincible party's  leadership, we will win a victory in the cause of socialism of  our own style and accomplish the historic cause of the  fatherland's reunification after overcoming any wind or storm,  defeat the imperialists, and hasten the cause of achieving  independence throughout the world.    The revolutionary banner which our impregnable party hoists  aloft will eternally fly with the strong belief that "Let the  cowardice go his way, and but we will defend the red flag!"    The revolutionary cause of our people who, filled with  confidence and optimism, are fighting under the banner of the  great party, is ever-victorious!</p>

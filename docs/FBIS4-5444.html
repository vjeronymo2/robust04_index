			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "What On Earth Does the Remark on `North </F> Korea's Possession of One or Two Nuclear Weapons' Mean?"]    [Text] We have been concerned about the government's  inconsistent countermeasures in coping with the North Korean  nuclear issue, and now we have come to harbor the suspicion that  the United States has made some changes in its policy on the  nuclear issue. We have repeatedly heard through authoritative  media the report that, as the means to guarantee the nuclear  transparency of North Korea faced the uppermost practical limit,  the United States has decided to seek a countermeasure, with  which it may ignore the possibility that North Korea currently  possesses nuclear weapons. Some of the U.S. conservatives even  suggested that the ROK and other countries be allowed  small-scale nuclear armaments as a countermove against the  possible possession of nuclear weapons by North Korea.    Last year, U.S. President Bill Clinton warned that "I will  not allow North Korea to develop nuclear weapons." U.S. Defense  Secretary Perry, however, lately said that "What we can do now  is to deter North Korea from producing any more nuclear  weapons." The phrase "any more" in Secretary Perry's remark is  noteworthy. It is natural for us to be concerned about the  possibility of very serious changes in the situation since our  aim is the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. If the  situation is actually changing seriously, we must not be puzzled  now with the phrase that "there is no clear evidence to prove  that North Korea possesses nuclear weapons."    A more difficult task has been added to our policy which is  solely based on the assumption of North Korea's nuclear  transparency. Even if North Korea had one or two nuclear  weapons, this could not be a threat to the United States. The  United States would only have an additional burden in the  international nuclear management. However, we are in a  different situation. We are the direct object of North Korea's  nuclear threat. It is clear that our military position would be  weakened. In addition, if North Korea uses nuclear weapons as a  means of force, not as a trump card, we would unavoidably be  driven into a defensive position in South-North relations and in  other international arenas.    It would be too late if we tried to seek a countermeasure  when the United States comes to have interest only in "any more"  production of nuclear weapons by North Korea after admitting it  possesses nuclear weapons. We still hope for the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but we cannot adhere  to it even in case the hope is stifled by North Korea. We  should return to the "no confirm, no deny" policy toward the  nuclear problem or further strengthen the international  cooperation system. In any case, we should assume a  peace-guaranteeing policy.    With regard to the North Korean nuclear issue, the  government  seems to make considerable efforts only to relieve the people's  anxiety. The government makes a wrong assumption, however, if  it believes that the people are reassured by the government  authorities' remarks that "there is no clear evidence that  proves the North's nuclear weapons development" and that "there  has been no sign of the North's military provocation." The  level of the people's security consciousness is far beyond the  government's expectation. When the government takes a security  policy that the people think is reliable, it will overcome  trials caused by the North Korean nuclear issue, encouraged by  the people's confidence, without making public relations efforts.</p>

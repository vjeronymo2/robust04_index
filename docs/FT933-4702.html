			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Japan admits economy at 'standstill' JAPAN'S official economic forecaster has downgraded its assessment of the state of the economy, prompting calls from within the coalition government for a cut in the official discount rate. The Economic Planning Agency, which has held a stubbornly sanguine view of the prospects for recovery this year as most other public and private sector forecasters have sharply downgraded their expectations, yesterday admitted that the economy was at a 'standstill' and 'stagnating'. This indicates serious official concern that the downturn may have to hit bottom twice before a recovery, though Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, yesterday chided the agency for being too optimistic. The agency maintained in June that the downturn had hit bottom and two months later said the economy was at 'somewhat of a standstill'. Economic problems have quickly overtaken plans to reform Japan's creaking political system, to occupy 80 per cent of Mr Hosokawa's time, says a government official. According to Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, there is no consensus among cabinet members on when recovery might come. The EPA is nevertheless sticking to its forecast of 3.3 per cent growth in gross national product this year. That compares with 1.5 per cent in 1992 and is far more optimistic than the market consensus of growth between 0.3 per cent and 1.5 per cent for this year. Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, said there were no clear signs of recovery. But he refused to be drawn on a widely expected imminent cut in the official discount rate, already at a post-war low of 2.5 per cent, beyond saying that the bank was carefully watching the effect of the yen's rise on business confidence. The markets believe a rate cut is possible after Friday's release of the central bank's latest survey of business confidence. If not, the bank could wait for the basic outline of the government's forthcoming economic stimulation package, expected around September 20. Exact details of the package will be the result of tough negotiations among the seven coalition members, though the government has already announced that plans to cut official red tape and costly business regulations will form the centrepiece. Deregulation has broad coalition support in principle, though the left-wing Social Democrats, the largest coalition party, is anxious not to upset small retailers, an important socialist constituency. Social Democrats are more seriously out of line with the rest of the coalition on possible income tax cuts, as favoured by Mr Hosokawa. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the former LDP powerbroker who exerts a strong behind-the-scenes influence on the coalition, argues that any income tax cuts must be compensated by rises in consumption taxes. The Social Democrats oppose a rise in consumption taxes and are said to be among the toughest bargainers in a coalition which would lose its parliamentary majority without them.</p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / The education policy that divided a town: John Authers on how the Baker reforms have caused a stir at two of Penrith's schools PENRITH has a problem. Only 30 per cent of youngsters from the town's catchment area on the northern edge of the Lake District stay in education after the age of 16, well below the national average. The Education Reform Act awakened hopes in the town's two secondary schools that something could be done to solve this problem. But the visions of the two differ widely and these differences grabbed national attention when Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, which had become grant-maintained, was given the right by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, to select pupils on academic criteria. Mr Patten had in effect created Britain's first new grammar school in more than two decades. What started as a local education issue has now been highly politicised. Critics fear that the move will turn the other secondary school in the Penrith area into a secondary modern. Until 1988 the two schools operated a cosy local compromise. Ullswater High School educates children from the ages of 11 to 16. It used to have a formal system of recommending its ablest pupils to move to Queen Elizabeth's at the age of 13. There, ideally, they would stay until 18. Both schools look the part - Ullswater has a sprawling cement and glass campus with all signs printed in English, French and German, while Queen Elizabeth's is a smaller stone building just below Penrith Castle. Honours boards commemorate ex-pupils who achieve awards at university. Mr David Robinson, a former schools inspector who was appointed head of Ullswater in 1990, had other ideas. He believed that Penrith could encourage more children to stay in education after 16 only if they were offered a broader range of less academic courses than the rigorous selection on offer at Queen Elizabeth's. He decided to open a sixth form. He did not think this would be practical if the school continued to send pupils to Queen Elizabeth's at 13, so he stopped the arrangement for sending pupils there. This angered Mr Donald Fay, head of Queen Elizabeth's, who believed the county council was already starving his school of funds - a claim supported by the temporary classrooms which surround the school's small main block. Queen Elizabeth's asked for grant-maintained status, initially to allow it a new source of funds. It also decided it would need to admit pupils from 11, as the supply of pupils from Ullswater at 13 had dried up. To do this the school's intake per year will need to be slimmed down from about 120 to 90, and so Queen Elizabeth's asked for the right to apply academic selection. About 110 have applied, and they will be assessed on the basis of interviews and their work at primary school. There will be no 11-plus examinations. Mr Fay is adamant that it was only Ullswater's move which provoked his decision to apply for selection, and that he will not be turning Ullswater into a secondary modern by doing so. Mr Robinson is equally confident that Ullswater, which is roughly double the size of Queen Elizabeth's, will succeed in attracting a fair proportion of the Penrith area's academically able pupils, but describes Mr Patten's decision as a 'betrayal'. Penrith is deeply Conservative - the Labour party is not even running a candidate in the county council election, while the local Conservative MP increased his majority at the last election - but the issue plays a big part on the doorsteps. Ms Joan Robinson, leader of Cumbria County Council's Liberal Democrat group and a Penrith councillor, collected a petition with more than 2,000 signatures opposing Mr Patten's decision, in an attempt to rebut his claim that he had 'granted what the community had asked for'. Ms Robinson said: 'I would have preferred to pool all the resources and make sure that all the children in this area could have pursued the courses they wanted. That would have allowed greater choice within that one school, although not necessarily between two schools.' Local Conservatives play down the issue. Mr Stephen Parry, Ms Robinson's Conservative opponent and a governor of Ullswater High, says that both schools will be needed if provision for 16 to 18-year-olds is to be improved. He is a keen supporter of Ullswater's Mr Robinson, and believes that many parents will choose Ullswater but admits to feeling strong sympathy with Queen Elizabeth's governors in their dilemma. He also attacks the Liberal Democrats for making political capital out of the issue. Education is probably the biggest issue of the campaign for Cumbria County Council, which is narrowly controlled by a coalition of Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Labour opposes selection because it 'takes choice away from parents and gives it to schools'. The Conservatives counterattack by claiming that the 26 Cumbrian schools which have opted out did so, as did Queen Elizabeth's, to escape inefficient council administration. They want the county to cut administrative staff because the workload has fallen after the opt-outs, and to redistribute the money to schools. All three parties seem to accept that the Cumbrian status quo is likely to remain after May 6. The future in Penrith rests with the town's parents, and with its two secondary schools. The issues raised there are bound to appear elsewhere as the government tests its theory that creating a competitive market allows better planning than leaving the job to local education authorities.</p>

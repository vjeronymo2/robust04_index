			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHAREHOLDER SUIT SETTLEMENT TENTATIVELY OKD;  </P> <P> LIABILITY: NEWPORT PHARMACEUTICALS AND ITS INSURER AGREE TO PAY ABOUT $5.7  MILLION IN TWO COMPLAINTS ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY MISLED INVESTORS.  </P> <P> Newport Pharmaceuticals and its liability insurer have tentatively agreed to  pay about $5.7 million to settle two shareholders' lawsuits alleging that the  company misled investors in promoting an anti-AIDS drug in 1985 and 1986, the  company said Monday.  </P> <P> The civil lawsuits, which make identical complaints, were filed separately in  state and federal courts in September, 1986. They accuse the company and  several of its officers and directors -- among them founder and former chief  executive Alvin Glasky -- of fraud and violations of securities laws.  </P> <P> Newport has denied the allegations.  </P> <P> The settlements would compensate those who bought Newport common stock between  May 15, 1985, and Feb. 21, 1986. The terms call for Newport to pay $1 million  cash and to issue shares of company common stock with a market value of between  $1.75 million and $2.1 million.  </P> <P> In addition, the plaintiffs would receive payments of $2.9 million from a  company insurance policy that covers Newport's officers and directors.  </P> <P> A condition of the settlement proposal is that it get the approval of a group  of corporate senior note holders and of the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles,  said Judith Woodward Archbold, an attorney for Newport.  </P> <P> "In connection with the settlement, the court has not made and will not make  any determination as to the liability of any defendant, and the company  continues to deny any fault . . . ," the company said in a statement.  </P> <P> But Leonard Simon, attorney for the plaintiffs, said his clients continue to  believe, as the lawsuits allege, that Newport Pharmaceuticals' officials  personally profited by selling company stock at prices that were "artificially  inflated" after they issued "false and misleading" statements about the drug  Isoprinosine.  </P> <P> According to the lawsuits, the price of Newport stock increased by more than  50% between April and September, 1985. That was the six-month period before the  company filed for Food and Drug Administration approval to market Isoprinosine  as a medication for people with conditions that often precede the onset of  acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  </P> <P> During that period, the suits allege, Newport insiders were "reaping large  profits for themselves" by selling their stock.  </P> <P> Newport stock plunged more than 50% on Feb. 21, 1986, the day that the FDA told  Newport that Isoprinosine had been rejected as a pre-AIDS treatment. The FDA  also criticized Glasky for misrepresenting results of clinical tests of the  drug in public statements earlier that month.  </P> <P> Newport's public statements "were too optimistic, and it turned out the drug  wasn't approved at the time and it still isn't approved," Simon said Monday.  </P> <P> Archbold said the FDA last year recommended that there be more clinical tests  of Isoprinosine in the United States. But, she added, Newport "can't afford to  do them unless it gets additional public or private funding and support from  the AIDS research community."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, she said, Newport, which lost $2.6 million for the first half of  this year, is striving to become profitable by developing its mail-order  pharmacy business.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brno, South Moravia Jan 7 (CTK) -- Moravian  National Party (MNS) Chairman Ivan Drimal today said that it  would be impossible to arrive at a rational, functioning  territorial-administrative set-up in the Czech Republic if the  restoration of Moravia's historical lands was ignored.    He said that the realisation of Moravia-wide projects in all  spheres, and consequently the corresponding living standard of  Moravia's citizens, would depend on the position of Moravia  within the Czech Republic. A government bill on the creation of  higher territorial and administrative units ignores this  reality, Drimal said. "It is merely a postponing maneuver and  an attempt at a factual strengthening of centralism," he said.    "By its attempt to leave the issue of Moravia's territorial  integrity out of problems concerning the Czech Republic's future  set-up, the government actually helps create the source of  internal instability," Drimal said.    The far-right nationalist MNS disagrees with the idea of  linking the 1994 local elections to other elections, which would  result in voter disorientation, said the MNS chairman.    Regarding Czech President Vaclav Havel's New Year's speech,  he said it was "not very specific and practically ignored the  most pressing problems in our society at present." On the other  hand, he said, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus was pretty specific in  his television appearance on January 2 and confirmed his  uncompromising centralist attitudes towards all fundamental  issues of the Czech Republic's management and internal  structure, Drimal said.    "Under Premier Klaus's leadership the Czech Republic is  becoming a bastion of rigid centralism, which is an anachronism  in the rest of Europe, and this is rather disquieting for the  future of our democratically-developing state," Drimal said.</p>

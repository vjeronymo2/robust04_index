			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ylva Nilsson report: "EU Wants To See a Referendum First"] </F>   [Text] Brussels -- The Swedish political parties' headache  over when the Swedish referendum should be held is not being  made any easier by the fact that the EU [European Union] side  must also be brought into the picture if Sweden is to be able to  meet the timetable and become a member on 1 January 1995.    The national parliaments of the EU countries also have to  approve Sweden as a new member, and in several countries over  six months are needed to get through the formal procedures.    Having EU candidates Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria  approved in the EU countries' national parliaments is not likely  to cause political problems, and all twelve are likely to say  "yes." However, one complication could be that a country or  countries could want first to see a "yes" from the referendums  in the new countries before reaching a decision on the matter.    "For some countries the issue is a sensitive one. In 1972  governments asked their parliaments to approve Norway as a new  member and then the Norwegian people voted `no.' Not everyone  has the inclination to expose themselves to that embarrassment  again, but wants to see the referendum result first," an EU  diplomat in Brussels said.    If the Bildt government launches Operation Persuasion in the  EU capitals, this risk could perhaps be eliminated and the  twelve governments could ask their parliaments to begin  consideration of the matter before the referendums in order to  be able to complete the process quickly for those countries  where the people vote "yes." On the other hand no one can start  work until the EU's own parliament has said "yes." This could  happen in May this year at the earliest, but it is uncertain  whether the European Parliament is able or willing to keep to  this timetable.    A subsequent problem could be the fact that parliamentary  procedure in certain countries is relatively detailed. In the  Netherlands and Britain, for example, a bill passes from the  lower chamber to the upper chamber and is then passed back to  the lower chamber again.    In Spain procedures normally take six months and the  government has to request speedy treatment if things are to move  more quickly.    "The quickest the countries have ever ratified an EU  agreement is seven months," EU Commissioner Henning  Christophersen said when the EEA [European Economic Area]  agreement was under discussion.    The EEA agreement, which has been approved by all the  governments involved, did indeed take the EU countries seven  months to ratify. Despite its popularity, the Maastricht Treaty  took seven months to ratify in Belgium. In Italy, another  country which welcomed the treaty, it took eight months. The  Netherlands -- also pro-Maastricht -- needed six months.</p>

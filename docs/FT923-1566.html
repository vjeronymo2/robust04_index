			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / TV debate perils for both Bush and Clinton MR BILL CLINTON will appear on a platform in East Lansing, Michigan, tonight but President George Bush will not be alongside him. Indeed the question of when and where the two US presidential candidates will confront each other in debate has become one of the most intriguing tactical issues of the campaign. According to the schedule proposed by a bipartisan commission of five prominent Republicans and five Democrats, Mr Clinton and Mr Bush were to start a three-match series tonight in East Lansing, followed by a second in San Diego, California, on October 4 and a final in Richmond, Virginia, on October 15. Senator Al Gore and Mr Dan Quayle, the vice-presidential candidates, were to square off on September 29 in Louisville, Kentucky. The commission recommended that the format of previous debates be changed, with a single moderator, rather than a panel of three or four journalists, serving as the buffer between the two candidates. The Clinton side accepted the proposal, but the Bush team, under Mr James Baker, campaign supremo, said no. Mr Baker, whose hand is omnipresent but largely invisible, has not gone public with his reasons for backing out of the first confrontation. Mr Robert Zoellick, his right hand man, merely said in a weekend television interview that he could not see why a tried and trusted format needed to be changed. Speculation centres on three main reasons for the reluctance of the Bush camp to participate. The first is the fear that Mr Clinton, adept with words, might show to advantage against Mr Bush, who is often not. Giving the challenger an equal platform with the incumbent only enhances his stature. The second argument is that a single self-effacing moderator is less likely to ask the outlandish 'character' question most likely to embarrass Mr Clinton than a journalist on the panel, the selection of which can be influenced by both campaigns. In 1988, Mr Bernie Shaw, of CNN, asked Democratic runner Mr Michael Dukakis a question concerning the hypothetical rape of a member of his family that put the candidate hopelessly on the defensive. Finally, if the 1988 experience is anything to go by, Mr Baker is known to believe that the mere announcement of a debate at a definite future date freezes public opinion for several critical days. Well behind in the polls, Mr Bush can hardly afford that. The latest evidence of this deficit was furnished yesterday by six state polls. The two candidates were dead even in Mr Quayle's home state of Indiana, which the Democrats have not carried since 1964, and in Florida, a Republican stronghold. But Mr Clinton was leading by 21 points in Missouri, 19 in Illinois, 14 in Delaware, and eight in Ohio. This also suggests that Mr Clinton has something to lose by debating Mr Bush and doing badly, which is why his campaign prefers the single moderator approach. The probable reality is that he will debate with the president in any event, for the obvious reason that whoever ducks out becomes an easy target. The general expectation is that the two will debate, either once or twice, in October, as will Senator Gore and Vice-President Quayle. Much may hang on it. At least three recent elections - 1960, 1976 and 1980 - may be said to have been decisively swayed by the debates and it is certainly true that four years ago Mr Dukakis lost an opportunity to restore fading fortunes.</p>

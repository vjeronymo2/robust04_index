			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: European building stocks enjoy return to favour - But many had a lot of ground to make up after an unhappy close to 1991 European construction stocks have enjoyed a return to favour this year, but many of them had a lot of ground to make up after an unhappy close to 1991. The FT-Actuaries index for Europe, excluding the UK, ended 10.6 per cent higher last year. According to County NatWest, the construction and building materials component showed a rise in local currency terms of just 0.9 per cent. The sector dropped 12.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1991. Continental Europe joined the real estate casualty list last year and worldwide construction activity is forecast to be weak well into 1993, especially where central business district office buildings are concerned. Construction is an industry where luck matters, accidents happen and mistakes are often punished unmercifully. Country by country, and share by share, it produced some stark contrasts in 1991. In France, Bouygues outperformed the sector, and Europe as a whole in 1991, rising 16.5 per cent. This compared with a 22.7 per cent drop at Spie Batignolles, Schneider's building, civil and industrial engineering subsidiary which accelerated into a 41.2 per cent slump in the final three months of the year. Both companies outperformed Europe in January; but Schneider said earlier this month that Spie had slumped into net losses of FFr950m for 1991 against a previous net profit of FFr250m. In February, Spie's share price ended more or less where it started, while Bouygues rose 3.5 per cent and the Paris market's CAC 40 index by 5.8 per cent. James Capel said in mid-February that interest in Spie shares could only be justified by hopes of: A rapid improvement in earnings at the operating level, which they discount as slim; or Schneider disposing of one or more Spie divisions. 'It is also possible that Schneider might decide to take advantage of the present weakness in the share price and buy up the minority interest,' said Capel. 'However, only the brave should be prepared to buy on this expectation.' In Spain, Agroman stood out in a sector full of deep downtrends, with a fall of 45 per cent in the final quarter, recovering to produce a a recovery of about 33 per cent since then. Mr Miguel Olabarri of Schroder Securities says that, following the Spanish budget guidelines for 1992 published last summer, the sector reacted to drastic cuts in infrastructural expenditure. Agroman is medium-large by Spanish standards, ranking number four in the country. It sub-contracts very little of its work compared with other construction groups, says Mr Olabarri, leaving it relatively exposed when a crunch comes; the corollary is that recovery hopes have the reverse effect. Austria's Universale-Bau offers a parallel to its Spanish counterpart with a fall of 49.2 per cent in October/December followed by a subsequent rally of 30 per cent. Here, Mr Andrew Thomson of Kleinwort Benson noted two years ago that Universale was the company most geared to the then promising Viennese property market. Mr Thomson's colleague, Mr Frank Jonuschat, adds that Universale's final quarter was also hit by enormous problems in an aluminium smelting operation that forced it to raise provisions on the project from Sch500m to Sch795m and, under Austrian law, forced it to pass its dividend. Kleinwort fells that Universale probably does not rate its recent performance against the Vienna market, itself up by around a fifth this year. In Germany, however, Hochtief still exemplifies the hopes of a boom amplified, and extended by German reunification. Mr Roderick Hinkel and Mr Robert Willis of Hoare Govett said on January 2 that the sector had unprecedented opportunities to make both substantial and long-term earnings gains and tipped Hochtief at DM981. Hochtief shares had fallen by just 10 per cent in 1991 compared with drops of 28 per cent for Spie, 57 per cent for Universale and 49 per cent for Agroman. Since then they have risen by 30 per cent. Germany's construction prospects are seen as broadly-based, and solid, despite arguments about whether the country itself is, or is not in recession. Mr Michael Geiger of County Natwest says that east Germany is likely to see a 17.5 per cent rise in construction output this year, against a 2 per cent gain for the west. 'This industry is not going over a cliff, not in the next five years,' says Mr Geiger. 'its order backlog will last for more than a year, and its new orders intake is fantastic.'</p>

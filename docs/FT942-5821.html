			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: News Corp relies on Lords ruling Lawyers acting for News Corp, the media, film and publishing group controlled by Mr Rupert Murdoch, are relying on a landmark ruling by the House of Lords to limit their client's liability in a potentially costly dispute stemming from the publication of an erroneous notice. The notice, published in the Financial Times last December on behalf of a subsidiary of News Corp, advised holders of News Corp preference shares, which were exchangeable into shares which the company had bought in Pearson in the 1980s, that they were also entitled to shares in Royal Doulton, the fine china manufacturer, as part of the exchange property. When Pearson, the media, banking and entertainment group which publishes the Financial Times, demerged Royal Doulton last year, it offered its shareholders one Royal Doulton share for every 10 held in the parent. At the time, dealers estimated that holders of News Corp's preference shares, denominated in sterling and guilders, and News Corp's D-Mark convertible bonds would receive 5 1/2 m Royal Doulton shares worth Pounds 15m. However, in January, News Corp stunned the market with another notice which said it was taking legal advice over whether the Royal Doulton shares were part of the exchange property. In February, News Corp said holders were not entitled to the Royal Doulton shares because, in its view, there had not been a change in the composition of the exchange property. Since then, a number of investment banks have been seeking compensation from News Corp for the financial losses which they and their clients incurred as a result of the first notice. The losses could run into millions of dollars. Claimants say while News Corp's London-based solicitors, Allen &amp; Overy, are taking a sympathetic approach to claims by individuals who were holders at the time of the erroneous notice, they are taking a much tougher line with those who dealt in the shares as a result of the notice, citing the legal precedent set in Caparo Industries v Dickman. In 1990, the House of Lords ruled that auditors had no 'duty of care' to individual shareholders or other users of accounts, and only to the company and to shareholders as a collective body. Allen &amp; Overy are drawing an analogy between the Caparo ruling and News Corp's position since the company gave notice to persons registered as holders of the preference shares, not the whole market. Therefore, in their view, News Corp's duty is only to them and not to anyone else who relied on the notice to make investment decisions. The claimants, some of whom are also believed to be contesting News Corp's claim to the Royal Doulton shares, say it is by no means clear that the Caparo principle will apply in News Corp's case. For example, News Corp had called the issues around the same time as the erroneous notice was published, forcing the market to act. News Corp declined to comment on the matter apart from to confirm that it was corresponding with a number of people who had written to Allen &amp; Overy to make claims. 'We don't feel that it will be useful for us to make general statements about the claims in the press in view of this ongoing correspondence,' News Corp said.</p>

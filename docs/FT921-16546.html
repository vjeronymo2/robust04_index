			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / New US corporate issues hit Dollars 579.7bn NEW ISSUES of underwritten corporate securities reached record levels during 1991 in the US, generating more than Dollars 4.5bn in fees for Wall Street investment banks. Total corporate new issues - of both debt and equity-related securities - reached Dollars 579.7bn (Pounds 311bn) last year, according to IDD Information Services, the US financial information company. The previous record was set in 1990, when the figure amounted to Dollars 312.1bn. The surge in new issue volume is attributed partly to record stockmarket levels which encouraged many companies with debt-ridden balance sheets to seek new equity funds, and partly to the dramatic decline in interest rates. The sharpest growth was seen in 'common share' offerings, up by 185 per cent to Dollars 54.8bn, whereas initial public offerings - or flotations - were up 140 per cent to Dollars 24.3bn. There was also a marked increase in preferred stock financings thanks to the use of PERCs, a new Morgan Stanley-designed financial instrument. Straight debt issues rose by 75 per cent to Dollars 497.4bn. The trend has brought healthy underwriting fees for Wall Street investment banks, although these remained below the record Dollars 5bn in 1986. Disclosed underwriting fees totalled Dollars 4.54bn last year, more than double the 1990 figure, with Merrill Lynch holding its position as the leading US corporate underwriter. IDD attributed part of the surge in fees to the large number of equity offerings, which traditionally carry the highest percentage fee for underwriting investment banks.</p>

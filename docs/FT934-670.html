			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Ferranti managers may make bid to receivers A seven-man team of senior Ferranti International managers is preparing a bid for the bulk of the defence electronics company, which is in receivership. The team, led by Mr Phil Burton, Ferranti's director of marketing, is aiming to put together a consortium in the new year and begin detailed financial negotiations in February. 'It has become clear to us that, shorn of problems stemming from the ISC acquisition, the group has a bright future,' Mr Burton said yesterday. The initial proposals envisage the management group teaming up with UK or overseas partners to mount a bid for most of Ferranti's non-manufacturing operations. It is understood that Ferranti's components business, which manufactures specialist hardware and sub-systems, would not be included in the bid. Ferranti's highly successful simulation and training business has attracted interest from potential purchasers and may be sold separately. The management consortium proposals were immediately welcomed by Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr John Talbot, the two administrative receivers from Arthur Andersen, appointed to the ailing group after GEC withdrew a 1p-a-share rescue bid in December. They said there were a number of long-term options for the businesses. The receivers added they had been approached by a large number of UK and overseas groups that had expressed an interest in acquiring Ferranti businesses. Mr Burton said a re-born Ferranti would have to be well capitalised and strong enough to compete in the international defence and civil markets. He said these factors put it beyond the reach of an ordinary management buy-out. Therefore, he said, the management team, which is being advised by Mr Richard Stone of Coopers and Lybrand Corporate Finance, was proposing a consortium bid, 'backed by long-term players in these nationally important sectors'. He said initial discussions with the receivers and potential partners from the UK and overseas had been 'very encouraging'. While emphasising that it remained early days, he said 'we do plan to be in a position to commence formal purchase negotiations in February'.</p>

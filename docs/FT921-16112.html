			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Squeeze forecast for credit-card issuers SMALLER credit-card issuers are likely to be squeezed out of the market in the next few years, according to Barclaycard, the largest UK payment-card issuer. Barclaycard says the presence in the UK of 76 credit-card schemes means there is overcapacity. Some cards will be sold to larger issuers and others may disappear completely, it adds. Barclaycard says that the pressure on smaller issuers was illustrated recently by the decision of Halifax building society to increase the interest rate on its card from 1.8 per cent a month to 1.95 per cent from January 3. It predicts that new entrants to the payment cards market, such as the building societies, will issue debit cards such as Switch or the Visa Delta card rather than credit cards. Debit-card usage is set to grow by more than 30 per cent this year, mostly at the expense of cash and cheques. The more mature credit-card market is also growing, but at a slower rate. Barclaycard forecasts that it will grow by about 5 per cent this year. It says the credit-card market has been boosted by a recent decision by J. Sainsbury, the food retailer, to accept credit cards. Marks and Spencer and the John Lewis Partnership are now the only large retailers which do not accept credit cards. Barclaycard forecasts that large issuers will have to find additional incentives to ensure that their customers remain loyal to them. These will include: purchase protection insurance cover; Ecu-based accounts for customers who travel frequently in Europe; improved international cash machine networks to enable cardholders to obtain cash from virtually any machine in any country. Barclaycard says it plans to expand its operations in the European card market. It already issues cards in Germany, France and Spain. It warns, however, that fraud is growing and banks will have to step up their co-operation against fraud.</p>

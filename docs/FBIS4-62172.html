			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia will not supply Georgian customers with  natural gas in 1994. This is what knowledgeable sources in the  Russian Gazprom organization told the (OIL INFORMATION AGENCY).    According to the Russian gas distribution plan approved for  this year, Gazprom intends to have all surplus raw material  resources sent to Ukraine to be stored in underground gas  storage depots to ensure uninterrupted gas supplies to western  European countries.    Georgia currently receives natural gas from Turkmenistan.</p>

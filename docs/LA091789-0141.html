			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTWOOD VILLAGE PROJECT DEFENDED  </P> <P> As the developers of a proposed mixed-use project in Westwood Village, we would  like to take this opportunity to respond to various letters regarding our  proposed new hotel in the village and correct some misstatements.  </P> <P> Nansay Corp. USA undertook this project with the express intent of fulfilling a  mandate from the Westwood community as outlined in the Westwood Village  Specific Plan. Following a design competition, we retained world-class  architects with a specialty in creating urban, pedestrian-oriented  environments. We instructed our architects to design a project which embodies  the spirit of the recently enacted Specific Plan, in conformance with its  design and use guidelines.  </P> <P> Prior to the recent controversy regarding the status of the Westwood Horizons  Retirement Hotel, we -- like the city officials and community leaders who  endorsed the Specific Plan -- were totally unaware that anyone might interpret  that building to be a hotel. We continue to believe we are designing a project  that meets the spirit and intent of the Westwood Specific Plan, which  represents a compromise and agreement between the various diverse elements of  the Westwood community.  </P> <P> Regarding the impact on the residents of Tiverton Avenue, it should be noted  that the Specific Plan protects this neighborhood by limiting pedestrian and  vehicular access, prohibiting retail display and signage, and requiring a  15-foot landscaped setback on Tiverton. The design of our hotel is sensitive to  our Tiverton neighbors.  </P> <P> We look forward to continuing our efforts to realize this project in  cooperation and consultation with the community.  </P> <P> T.C. WANG  </P> <P> vice president, Nansay Corp. USA  </P></p>

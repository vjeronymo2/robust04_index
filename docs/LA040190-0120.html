			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE WIND A WINNER FOR ASTOR;  </P> <P> SAILING: A STRONG WIND BACKED A STRONG PREDICTION BY SKIPPER RICHARD STRAMAN AS  ASTOR WON THE CLASS 'A' FLEET RACE BY MORE THAN TWO MINUTES OVER DAUNTLESS.  </P> <P> Skipper Richard Straman didn't mean to sound cocky when he proclaimed before  the fourth America's Schooner Cup: "If it's a windy day, we'll win. Simple as  that."  </P> <P> It was about that simple Saturday on San Diego Bay.  </P> <P> Straman's schooner, Astor, received large doses of wind throughout the day and  sailed away with the Class 'A' fleet race by more than two minutes over  Dauntless.  </P> <P> "It wasn't as windy as we would have liked, but we got all the wind we needed,"  Straman said.  </P> <P> Straman and his 12-man crew will have to root for the wind again as Astor faces  Dauntless at noon today in a match race for the Schooner Cup.  </P> <P> "We're hoping it doesn't blow out," Straman said. "It looks like this system  will hold."  </P> <P> Dauntless, skippered by Paul Plotts, gained the right to meet Astor by virtue  of its second place finish. Two-time defending champion, Kelpie, would have met  Astor for the second consecutive year, but structural damage sidelined the  schooner until next year's race.  </P> <P> When asked what Dauntless' chances were today if the wind held, Straman said:  "There's not a whole lot they can do. The history has been, whenever the wind's  up, we beat Dauntless. When it's not, Dauntless wins. Paul's just a great  light-wind sailor."  </P> <P> Straman said one of the keys to Astor's easy victory, besides the wind, was its  start.  </P> <P> "Everybody else was doing a starboard start, but we did a port start and dove  across the starting line," Straman said. "We just had a tremendous advantage on  everybody. And then we just began to pull away."  </P> <P> Last year Straman said his port start was also successful.  </P> <P> "We blew away the field by 16 minutes," he said.  </P> <P> But after his excellent start, Straman said a tactical error almost let  Dauntless, the 1987 America's Schooner Cup Champion, back in the race.  </P> <P> "We got a little too conservative about the halfway point and Dauntless started  gaining on us," Straman said. "In retrospect, we probably should have changed  sails."  </P> <P> Bagheera, one of the pre-race favorites, finished well back in third place and  will race today for the consolation title.  </P></p>

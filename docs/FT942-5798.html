			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Belgium (4): 'This is only the beginning' - Interview, Luc van den Brande, Flanders' regional leader Next month, when football fever grips the world, Mr Luc van den Brande, minister-president of the Flemish government, will be supporting the Belgian team, the Red Devils, writes EMMA TUCKER. As yet, no Flanders team exists for him to support. Like the Belgian monarchy, the Red Devils remain one of a handful of institutions that inspire people like Mr van den Brande to call themselves Belgian, even if it is just for the duration of a football match. The rest of the time, Mr van den Brande is without question Flemish. Minister-president of the region since 1992, he has steered Flanders through its first year of full federalism. For the 49 year old politician this is only the beginning. Although wary of what he says - he has been rebuked by the King for thinly-veiled calls for Flemish independence - Mr van den Brande is keen to see yet more powers devolved to the regions. 'Is this the end?' he asks of last year's St Michael agreements, which completed Belgium's long transition from a unitary state to a loose federation. 'I don't think so. It is possible that new competences, such as social security, will be transferred to the regions, but linked to the new framework.' 'The debate in my view does not revolve around whether or not the Belgian level of government is disappearing, but around the way in which the Flemish and French-speaking communities may best live together in a modern federal state,' he says. 'I believe that the Flemish and French-speaking communities must in future work out, on a basis of equality, what it is they wish to undertake jointly and are able to do better jointly.' He maintains that the conditions for federalism, together with consensus where required at a national level, are now in place. For a start, the St Michael accords have lowered the tension of Belgian politics. For example, Mr van den Brande says that two years ago a Belgian from Flanders would not have wanted to turn up for the annual festivities in Namur, capital of French speaking Wallonia. 'Since St Michael the pressure has become less,' he says. 'It was necessary to have this reform. It was the best way of managing the controversies between the two major parts of the country.' Meanwhile, Flanders is making the most of its newly acquired responsibilities, enthusiastically pursuing its own foreign policy on the one hand, while remaining 'intense and loyal' to the Belgian diplomatic service on the other. It has been particularly active on trade, using the Flemish Foreign Trade Board as a defender and promoter of Flemish exports. On the economics front, Mr van den Brande would like to see the levying of social security transferred to the regions, not least because in order to attract foreign investment to Flanders, he would like the authority to lower employers' costs. 'It is not normal for us to have our own regional industrial policy, but to not have any say over social security,' he says. Although he will not put a date on it - preferring instead to talk about Belgium's natural evolution - the Flemish minister president's ultimate aim is to see an even more decentralised Belgium, in which the federal government does little more than act as an 'accepted go between' for the regions. Such a vision, he maintains, is not out of line with the process of European integration, as it conforms to the notion of subsidiarity - devolving decision-making down to the most appropriate level. His ambitions for Flanders tie in nicely to such a structure. And by the time Europe gets round to it, Flanders may even be sending its own football team to the World Cup championship.</p>

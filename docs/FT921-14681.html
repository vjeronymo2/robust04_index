			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Business and the Environment: Green tinge to company books UK companies could soon be blushing green with embarrassment over their environmental and safety records if a private member's bill successfully passes its second reading in Parliament on Friday. The Corporate Safety and Environmental Information Bill, sponsored by Jeff Rooker MP, would amend the 1985 Companies Act and force businesses to add a new section to the directors' report in the annual report and accounts. Any company with more than 50 employees would have to include a new paragraph called 'Safety and the Environment' alongside existing required disclosures on issues such as the disabled, political contributions and employee consultation - as well as pure financial information. Information required to be disclosed includes: Enforcement notices served by the regulatory authorities. Convictions for environmental and safety offences. Serious accidents suffered by employees. Compensation payments made after injury or fatal accidents. The idea originally came from the Citizen Action Compensation Campaign. Henry Witcomb, a barrister who helped draft the bill, says: 'Our concern was that existing legislation doesn't do enough for prevention. It just leads to compensation, which is never adequate. Putting the facts down on paper should be a crucial stimulus to change.' Some safety and environmental action taken by regulatory bodies is already published in local public registers. However, the information revealed is relatively minimal and inaccessible. Emily Russell, a researcher with the Campaign for the Freedom of Information, which jointly sponsored the bill, said it took a long time to unearth details of action taken against companies. She analysed more than 20 large companies convicted on safety or environmental offences during financial years since 1989. None revealed this information in annual reports. For example, during 1990 ICI received a Pounds 100,000 fine after two workers were killed by an explosion in 1988, and a Pounds 250,000 fine after another explosion killed a fireman and injured 93 people in March 1989. The annual report simply stated: 'ICI places the highest priority on the safety and health of employees, customers and the general public.' Shell Transport and Trading Company received a Pounds 1m fine in February 1990 after 156 tonnes of crude oil spilled into Mersey from a fractured pipeline. No mention is made of the incident in the report and accounts. Russell argues that companies already have to collate most of these statistics for statutory purposes. She argues that any additional costs in their compilation and presentation in accounts would be minimal. 'The bill would force directors to place their true record against the public relations blurb they usually produce,' she says. 'But it doesn't have to be negative. It allows companies to put the action into context and explain any remedial action they have taken.' A separate survey conducted last year by Company Reporting, a journal which monitors annual reports, unearthed similar lack of disclosure. In a sample of 670 annual reports it found that only 3 per cent highlighted environmental information in a separate statement. 'The majority of disclosures are of such a low level as to be virtually meaningless,' it said. Courtaulds, the chemicals and fibres group, supports the spirit of the bill. Freddie Daniel, public affairs manager, says: 'I think the initial response from some companies is likely to be defensive, but there is no point keeping your head in the sand. We try to take as open an attitude as we can.' However, he says simple totals should be given in the report to prevent a very long list, with a separate report giving further details; and that the privacy of individual confidential compensation payments should be respected. He also adds that many environmental and safety problems are caused by employers in sectors such as farming and construction with fewer than 50 employees, which are excluded under the current wording of the bill. Rob Gray from the University of Dundee, who specialises in 'green accounting' issues, says: 'I am pleased to see any developments in the annual report like this. Whether publishing this sort of information achieves anything is unclear. But at least it would disclose new facts, and act like a ratchet on greater disclosure.' But first the campaigners face what is likely to be an extremely difficult task in trying to get the bill through parliament on Friday. The Department of Trade and Industry, for example, is believed to be opposed to the bill, on the grounds that while the information it would require to be disclosed is important, the annual report is not the appropriate vehicle in which it should appear.</p>

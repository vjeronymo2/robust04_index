			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The University of Kentucky basketball program will reportedly be placed on two  years' probation, including one season of no postseason appearances, when the  National Collegiate Athletic Assn. report on its alleged rules violations is  released today, according to a television station.  </P> <P> WTVQ in Lexington, Ky., quoted sources close to the investigation as saying  that during the probation, the Wildcats would possibly also lose two  scholarships, but there would be no ban on Kentucky games being televised.  </P> <P> Earlier Thursday, Athletic Director C.M. Newton said the penalties could  include up to two years' probation and a third year of sanctions, and  university President David Roselle said the program is "going down the  plumbing."  </P> <P> Newton's comments came in a speech to the Louisville Rotary Club, but it was  unclear whether he had seen the report beforehand.  </P> <P> "We're gonna get through them, just like they did back in the '50s when they  said Kentucky basketball was dead," he said. "We're going to enjoy the good  times. The good times will be back."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Rick Pitino, the New York Knicks' coach who is being considered for  the Kentucky coaching vacancy, said he has not ruled out the possibility that  he will take the job.  </P></p>

[Kebich] A total of 25 documents had been prepared for  discussion at the level of heads of state, and 19 -- at the  level of prime ministers. Some of those documents, indeed, we  did not sign, including the agreement on assistance to  Tajikistan in proportion to national budgets. We were among  those who opposed adopting this resolution, saying that as long  as we receive no assistance in eliminating the consequences of  the Chernobyl accident, we cannot grant financial aid to  Tajikistan. We have nothing against sending foodstuffs and  other products there, but we do not agree to pay a VAT just for  them. Russia backed us on this issue, and so did other states.  It was decided to send the draft for completion.    Another document that we did not sign stipulated the  unification of prices and taxes, and thus, the lifting of  customs duties. The document was not approved at the initiative  of Russia and Belarus. We cannot grant equal conditions to all  the states, because Russia and Belarus spent a long time paving  the path and we should receive the status of trailblazers.    We also refrained from signing a document on the mechanism  of  enacting the collective security treaty, because in fact, we had  not joined the treaty. This happened because CIS members did  not acknowledge the onetime declaration by Stanislav  Shushkevich, and maintained that the document should be signed  without provisos. On the other hand, the collective security  treaty has not been ratified by the Belarusian Supreme Soviet as  of yet. We also did not sign a number of less relevant  agreements.    [Reporter] Which of the signed agreements do you consider  most significant? In general, what can be regarded as the most  momentous outcome of the Ashgabat summit?    [Kebich] First of all, I want to emphasize the agreement on  investments. Similar agreements had been signed with foreign  states, but somehow this had fallen through the cracks and they  had not existed within the CIS framework. That was a paradox.  The signing of this document facilitates investments in  neighboring states, the forming of joint-stock companies, and  leasing enterprises in CIS states. Our legislative opposition  has always stressed the urgent need for such an agreement. The  treaty was signed by all the participants, and so were the  agreements on joint financing of the Interstate Economic Court  and the Television and Radio Company. The most important thing  was that agreements vital for the functioning of the economic  union were signed. I also want to underline the fact that  Turkmenistan has become a legal member of the union. Thus, only  Ukraine has not joined the economic union yet, but we believe  that the situation will change in the immediate future....  Among other important agreements there are also the ones on  communications and medicine.... Medicine will be exempt from  VAT, and thus will be cheaper.    The cooperation agreement alone was worth going to  Ashgabat. It envisions that if we receive oil or gas as part of  cooperation deals, that is if the end product is returned to the  producer of raw materials, we will not pay any taxes or customs  duties. This will significantly reduce prices.    At the same time, we also held bilateral talks in Ashgabat.  I signed a bilateral agreement with Kazakhstan, while Uladzimir  Zalamay signed such agreements with all the other republics  except Russia, Moldova, and Tajikistan. I will be visiting  Moldova soon, while we need time to reach an accord with  Tajikistan. With regard to Russia, after we sign an agreement  on merging our financial systems, we will not need any bilateral  agreements at all. There were a lot of personal talks in  Ashgabat, including my meeting with Russian Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin.    Bilateral talks with the Turkmen leadership also yielded  dividends. Turkmenistan remains our primary debtor. We agreed  with Chernomyrdin that Russia will not hinder shipments of  Turkmen gas via its territory. In addition in 1994,  Turkmenistan is going to supply us with 1,000,000 metric tons of  industrial oil. Kazakhstan also agreed to ship industrial oil  to Belarus, while our commercial organizations will be able to  buy Kazakh oil. There is one more thing. In January, we will  receive 90,000 metric tons of high quality wheat as compensation  for the work of Belarusians in Kustanay Oblast. Truck and  tractor drivers and combine operators who took part in  harvesting in that oblast will receive another 11,000 metric  tons.    [Reporter] Can we anticipate the merging of financial  systems in the immediate future?    [Kebich] We are rapidly approaching this goal. I want to  get this straight to everybody -- forming a monetary union with  Russia will not preclude pursuing independent policies. By the  way, we adopted the national budget some time ago. In Ashgabat,  Aleksandr Shokhin told me: "You were faster, and now Russia will  have to adjust its budget to the Belarusian one." This means  that politically, we have gained a lot.    [Reporter] What other Russian leaders did you confer with in  Ashgabat?    [Kebich] I talked to almost all of them, including a short  conversation with Boris Yeltsin. He confirmed our agreements  with Chernomyrdin and Shokhin.    [Reporter] Who among the Russian leadership supports the  merging of our financial systems, and who opposes it?    [Kebich] There is no opposition, although some people may  have doubts. However, there is one problem. When we resolve  issues at the highest level everything goes smoothly, but every  bureaucrat at lower levels wants to demonstrate his omnipotence.  Thus, we decided that there will be no more agreements at the  level of clerks. Agreements should be signed by the highest  officials and then be carried out by clerks.    [Reporter] Will a political declaration be announced soon?    [Kebich] Although we agreed on this, both the Russian and  Belarusian schedules are so packed with events that the  declaration may be postponed through a lack of time and not a  lack of desire. As we know, the Russian leadership is concerned  with the future of its two legislative chambers. Anyway, I  believe, that a political declaration will be made shortly after  the New Year. This is my forecast.    [Reporter] The CIS Charter has not been ratified by our  legislature. Do you think there may be complications in the  course of the ratification process?    [Kebich] I believe there will be no problems until the  clause dealing with collective security is discussed. This will  initiate another great debate. We have plenty of experts  majoring in disputes.</p>

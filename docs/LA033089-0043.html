			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> TODDLER RUN OVER BY UNCLE DIES  </P> <P> A 14-month-old girl was killed in Azusa on Wednesday when her uncle  accidentally drove his car over the toddler, police said.  </P> <P> Jorge Curiel, 34, returned to his home on North Alameda Avenue at about 1 p.m.  and honked his horn, signaling his 4-year-old daughter to come out and open the  gate, said Lt. Karen Pihlak. Curiel's daughter ran outside, opened the gate and  entered the car with her father, a routine they practiced every day, police  said.  </P> <P> Unknown to either Curiel or his daughter, "her cousin had crawled out of the  house following her," Pihlak said. "The little girl crawled into the driveway  where she could not be seen by either her uncle or her cousin. He ran over her,  crushing her under the left front wheel."  </P> <P> The officer said no charges would be filed because the death appeared to be  accidental.  </P></p>

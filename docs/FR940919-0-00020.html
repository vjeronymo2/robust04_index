			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After careful review of all available information including the comment referenced above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 551 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 3 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $90,915. This figure does not take into account the cost of repetitive inspections nor the cost of the optional inspection-extending or inspection-terminating service kit installations. The FAA has no way of determining how many repetitive inspections each operator would incur over the lifetime of the airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the FAA estimates 52 workhours to install service kits on the spar caps at an average labor rate of approximately $55 an hour, and $1,050 cost per airplane for service kit parts. Based on these figures, the cost for the optional service kit installations on U.S. operators would be $2,154,410 or $3,910 per airplane. After incorporation of these kits, the repetitive inspections would be terminated or the number of repetitive inspections would be reduced depending on whether the spar was cracked.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Cessna Aircraft Company has informed the FAA that 67 SK421&hyph;142&blank; (&hyph;1 or &hyph;2) or SK425&hyph;44 (&hyph;1 or &hyph;2) service kits have been sold, thus reducing or terminating the inspections for the particular airplane wing front spar upper cap that the kit is installed on. Repetitive inspections are no longer required on the airplane if both wing front spar upper caps have service kits incorporated, and these kits are incorporated without cracks present. The FAA has no reasonably available means of finding out how many inspection reductions (kit incorporated with cracks) and how many inspection terminations (kit incorporated without cracks) are involved, or how many airplanes incorporated a left wing kit&blank; (&hyph;1) and a right wing kit (&hyph;2). With this in mind, the FAA does not know exactly how much this reduces the cost of the inspections and optional modification portion of this AD on U.S. operators; however, the FAA would estimate this cost reduction at around $125,000, thus reducing the optional modification portion of this AD from a fleetwide cost impact of $2,154,410 to $2,029,410. This estimate is based on taking the average workhour per wing of 26 workhours (2 wings = 52 workhours) times the average labor rate of $55 per hour plus the average cost of the different kits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

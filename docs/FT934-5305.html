			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Survey of Vietnam (9): Patience an essential tool - Victor Mallet looks at the obstacles to doing business in Vietnam The physical difficulties of doing business in Vietnam are being eased but the bureaucratic, legal and political obstacles to securing a successful deal remain almost as formidable as ever. Those who arrived in Vietnam immediately after the enactment of the country's first foreign investment law in December 1987 had to overcome the most basic transport and communications problems. Many of these have been resolved. Taxis now circulate in the capital Hanoi and in Ho Chi Minh City, the southern commercial centre formerly called - and still known as - Saigon; international direct dialling is available from even modest hotels; frequent international flights connect both cities and Vietnam Airlines has added leased Airbuses, Boeings and ATR aircraft to its ageing Soviet fleet for both domestic and foreign routes. Multilateral and bilateral donors, such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Japanese government, are starting the task of repairing and upgrading roads, ports and other infrastructure left in a sorry state by decades of war and communist rule. But Vietnam's policy of doi moi (renovation) - its equivalent of perestroika - and the government's official adoption of free market economics has not eased problems for foreign investors. Some companies have abandoned their projects after months of frustrating negotiations. The experience of the first five years of foreign investment in Vietnam suggests that the principal obstacles to sealing an agreement are frequent conflicts between the central and local governments with their own agendas. 'The power of the emperor ends at the village gate,' is an old saying that has become increasingly popular among Vietnamese and foreign executives in recent months. A local communist people's committee will usually try to ensure that one of its own subsidiaries is the partner in a joint venture with a foreign company, or it will want to charge for the lease of state land above the limits set by Hanoi; the people's committees vet project proposals in their territory and are therefore both players and referees. The central government is acutely aware of the threat to foreign investment posed by free wheeling local officials and is trying to reimpose its authority on the provinces. 'The decision-maker must be the central government,' says Nguyen Mai, vice-chairman of the State Committee for Co-operation and Investment. Meanwhile prospective investors must ensure that their negotiations with the central and local authorities are heading in the same direction; approval from Hanoi is of little benefit if the people's committee in Ho Chi Minh City where your factory is located is going to make life difficult. Investors planning to export what they produce and with no need of a local distribution network often opt for 100 per cent foreign ownership. Others usually take the easy way out and form a joint venture with a local government enterprise or with a company controlled by the relevant national ministry. There are several significant risks attached to doing business in Vietnam besides the uneasy relationship between Hanoi and the regions. The legal system is rudimentary, and the influence of your contacts or partners is more important than the application of laws - if there is one to cover your particular situation. The government plans to introduce a bankruptcy law and improve commercial contract law, but for now disputes are referred to local arbitration panels which have no powers of enforcement. Even the foreign investment law contains internal contradictions. It includes guarantees against nationalisation, but amendments introduced last year suggest that Vietnamese companies have the right to buy into the foreign share of a joint venture in 'important economic sectors'. Foreign lawyers urge investors to ensure their agreement states that the business is not 'important'. Investors are also advised to insist on the right to hire their employees directly rather than through a government agency. Another concern for both foreigners and Vietnamese is the confused and apparently arbitrary tax system, which includes a turnover tax on business, personal income tax of up to 50 per cent, a complex import tariff scale and local taxes. Again there is a lack of co-ordination between the centre and the regions, with different provinces making different demands on taxpayers. One irritating if understandable countrywide feature of life in Vietnam is dual pricing. Foreigners pay between two and and 10 times as much as Vietnamese for services ranging from domestic flights to access to ancient monuments. Corruption is widespread. The government has launched a high-profile campaign in an attempt to eradicate corrupt practices, but bribery remains common both for petty transactions such as visa applications and in business dealings. For example, one foreign businessman, said it was normal to over-invoice the health ministry for pharmaceutical supplies, with the difference between the actual cost and the invoice total going to ministry officials. As a Vietnamese banker points out, corruption is unlikely to disappear when civil servants with nominal salaries of Dollars 20 or so a month are overseeing Dollars 1m contracts. Lastly, the banking and accounting systems in Vietnam are rudimentary. Cash dollars and dong, the Vietnamese currency, are both used freely in urban areas and it is not difficult at present to obtain foreign exchange. But personal cheques for domestic accounts do not yet exist; most employees are paid in cash. Many of the problems detailed above are the inevitable result of Vietnam's rapid switch-over from a Soviet-style command economy to a free market system requiring new regulations which have yet to be enacted; others are common to fast-growing economies elsewhere in Asia, such as Indonesia and Thailand. If the Vietnamese government succeeds in pushing the necessary legislation through the National Assembly and in enforcing the laws thereafter, the investment climate in Vietnam will be much improved.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: REDEVELOPMENT SUIT GETS COURT APPROVAL  </P> <P> The Moorpark Unified School District was given the go-ahead by the state Court  of Appeal on Monday to continue its lawsuit challenging the city's 1989  redevelopment plan.  </P> <P> A lower court had ruled in January that the district waited too long to join  lawsuits filed by Ventura County, the Mosquito Abatement District and the  Ventura County Community College District over the city's redevelopment plans.  </P> <P> According to district officials, the redevelopment plan would deprive the  district of $120 million in taxes over 45 years.  </P> <P> The city's redevelopment plan includes more than 1,200 acres of the downtown  area in addition to the Virginia Colony, a small community on the eastern side  of the city.  </P> <P> Tax revenue gained through redevelopment will be used to pay for sidewalk,  storm drain and street repairs. The city will also be able to lend residents  money to rehabilitate houses. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER  </P></p>

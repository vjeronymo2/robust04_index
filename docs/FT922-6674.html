			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Recovery in coarse grain production forecast WORLD coarse grain production, which is expected to fall to less than 800m tonnes this year from 829.9m tonnes in 1990, is expected to recover in the 1992-93 season, according to the International Wheat Council. The IWC's latest report gives a first estimate for the 1992-93 coarse grain harvest of 825m tonnes, an increase over this season of 27m tonnes. This season's low harvest is attributed to dry weather conditions in many growing areas. The largest increases are expected in the US, up 30m to 249m tonnes, and the former Soviet Union, up just over 10m to 92.8m tonnes. However, The IWC warns that the former Soviet Union's harvest could end up being affected by shortages of fuel, quality seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and spare parts for agricultural machinery. Consumption is estimated at 820m tonnes, little changed from the previous two years. Consumption in developing countries is expected to increase slightly.</p>

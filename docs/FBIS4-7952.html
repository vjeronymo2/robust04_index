			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The National Assembly's last working day started  with speeches by the president of the Republic and the prime  minister. Andras Domany reports:    [Domany] If the deputies can conclude the past four years  with a clear conscience, it is because they managed to lay the  foundation of the institutional legal system of the new and  democratic Hungary. This, even if haltingly, operates without  hitches -- an achievement of both the government coalition and  the opposition equally, President Arpad Goncz said.    He praised the work that was accomplished and said that one  of the reasons why the assembly could not manage to gain the  heart of the country completely was that the country had  expected miracles from the newborn democracy. However, fate,  and not the National Assembly, failed to deliver that miracle.  Although an inappropriate tone was sometimes used, it was the  failing of a few. Hopefully, the head of state continued, the  majority of those deputies saying farewell would be able to use  their experience in their next tenure.    There are things that the assembly still has to do, Goncz  said. The commissioner of human rights was not elected and the  assembly representation of minorities has not been settled. The  head of state is to submit a bill to the next assembly about  amending the Penal Code, which will serve to prevent racial  discrimination. He also considers the media law and social  supervision of the public service radio and television  important, deeming it inadmissible that the lack of these laws  should create a source of ceaseless and poisonous internal  political tension and put in doubt the enforcement of the  freedom of expression of opinion and freedom of speech granted  by the constitution. Hoping for a fair and clean election  fight, Arpad Goncz said the following: Whatever the people's  choice is, we have a duty to take heed of that, winners and  losers alike, for the mutual aim remains the same -- the good of  the country and the service of the people.    He hoped that the Hungarian people, owing to its wisdom,  would emerge victorious from the elections.    After this, Prime Minister Peter Boross asked permission to  speak. He said that the performance of the National Assembly  over the past four years may perhaps be disputed today, but  looking back from a distance it will be seen as an historic  period marking the change of the epoch and the regime.    He also mentioned the election period, hoping that it will  take place in an atmosphere of fairness and that everybody will  participate, which would serve the prosperity of the country  ensuring that in the next assembly everybody could meet in a  good and friendly atmosphere. The legislative work will cease  now, but the government will function, Peter Boross said.  During its operation, among other things, the government will  create all possible conditions for clean elections and the  election of an assembly, the composition of which is realistic  and meets the public will. Furthermore, this government, for  the first time in several decades, will give a detailed account  of its four-year activity, the prime minister said.    After this, the National Assembly began its last working  day.  [passage omitted]</p>

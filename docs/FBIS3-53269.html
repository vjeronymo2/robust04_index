			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] President Husni Mubarak, leader of the National  Democratic Party [NDP], has chaired a meeting for the party's  General Secretariat at the presidential palace. [passage  omitted]    After the meeting, Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif  noted that this was the first meeting chaired by President  Mubarak after forming the new Secretariat. He said the NDP has  now formed all its leaderships and structures.    Al-Sharif said that President Mubarak discussed party and  national work at this stage and in the future, touching on  several basic issues such as economy, economic reforms and the  progress made therein, and the side-effects of the economic  reform policy. The president also dealt with a number of  political issues, notably national dialogue, democratic  practice, confronting terrorism, and the role of the NDP in  creating a climate for political and economic reforms and  addressing people's daily concerns. [passage omitted]    The information minister said President Mubarak pointed out  that the economic situation looms as the most important issue  for society. Addressing that issue and creating an appropriate  living standard for society is not possible without a sound  economy that takes into consideration population growth, the  president said.    Mubarak reviewed the developments of the economic crisis  that  face Egypt and explained the stages of the economic reforms. He  noted that the reforms and their progress are not isolated from  Egypt's internal and foreign policies. They were linked, he  said, to Egypt's ability to restore its Arab and international  status, to capitalize on its international relations, and to  deal and interact with the issues of the region. He said this  ability largely helped achieve international backing for Egypt's  economy and cancellation of Egypt's debts. The president  pointed out that the debts that were written off were equal in  value to Egypt's investments in the rebuilding of the  infrastructure during the first and second development plans.  [passage omitted]    Minister al-Sharif said President Mubarak pointed out the  phenomenon of terrorism, which aims to harm Egypt's achievements  and the interests of the people. The president stressed his  eagerness to serve citizens' interests and ensure security and  safety for all Egyptians, noting that all Egyptians reject  terrorism. President Mubarak also discussed the role of the NDP  in political and social work to strengthen society and mobilize  its forces to confront terrorism, expose its false allegations,  and protect youths from sliding into wrong notions. [passage  omitted]    On the national dialogue, President Mubarak said his call  for  a dialogue proceeds from the public interest and from a desire  to preserve Egypt and the future of its sons. He said he hoped  the dialogue will be objective, honest, and devoid of any  maneuvers or one-upmanship by any party. [passage omitted]    On foreign policy, President Mubarak discussed Egypt's Arab  relations, noting that they are good with all the brothers. He  said relations are strong and firm with the Custodian of the Two  Holy Mosques, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz of Saudi Arabia; His  Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan, president of the United Arab  Emirates [UAE]; and Sultan Qabus of Oman. The president noted  cooperation with the leadership, government, and people of Saudi  Arabia, and he also noted strong firm relations with Oman, the  UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, and Bahrain.    The president said the priority is now to achieve Arab  reconciliation, and he noted the importance of Arab cooperation  and coordination in facing challenges. President Mubarak said  that despite differences, Egypt is against any attempt to harm  the territorial integrity of Iraq or Sudan, and is against  fragmentation and struggle in Yemen. He said Egypt is working  with Africa to solve the deteriorating situation in Somalia. On  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mubarak said what the people there are  facing can be described as an international scandal.    The information minister said that President Mubarak  explained Egypt's role in the Middle East and its attempts to  bring viewpoints closer, whether in the meeting between Syrian  President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton, in  overcoming the obstacles facing the Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations, or in moves concerning southern Lebanon. The  president noted that the road is still long and needs  determination without relinquishment of rights. He also noted  Egypt's efforts to solve the Libyan-Western crisis and said that  Egypt interacts with the international community while  preserving Egyptian dignity and appreciating the country's  weight and culture. He said Egypt knows its Arab role as a  backer of the brothers, its African role in defending the causes  of the continent, and its Islamic role as an influential country.</p>

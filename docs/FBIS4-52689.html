			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota on reports that </F> Japan and the United States signed a secret agreement on  deployment of nuclear weapons in 1969]    [Text] Twenty-five years have passed since the Japan-U.S.  joint communique was issued. Recently, however, it was reported  that a bilateral secret accord exists. This report resulted in  great shock and further anxieties among Okinawan residents, who  eagerly hope for the removal of U.S. military bases. The  Okinawa Prefectural Government considers this a serious matter.  It will ask the central government to take steps acceptable to  the Okinawan people to disclose the facts, and state its views  on the three anti- nuclear principles. From the standpoint of  protecting local residents' lives, livelihood, and properties,  we will further seek a peaceful Okinawa with no "nuclear arms"  and "military bases" by patiently appealing to both the Japanese  and U.S. Governments to make efforts.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Porvair advances to Pounds 2.6m Porvair, the microporous synthetic materials manufacturer, returned record pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.55m for the year to November 30. The 26 per cent improvement over the previous Pounds 2.02m was achieved against a backdrop of difficult economic conditions in certain world markets. Helped by acquisitions, sales rose 22 per cent to Pounds 21.9m - some 78 per cent of group production is exported. Earnings emerged at 13.2p (11.6p) and a final dividend of 2.8p raises the total from 3.6p to 4.2p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Assets"] </F>   [Text] In trying to explain newly installed President  Liamine Zeroual's decision yesterday to keep [Prime Minister]  Redha Malek in place, it might be too pretentious to say, as in  the world of sports, that you do not change a winning team. But  the experts will tell you not to change the line-up in the  middle of a critical game.    Has Mr. Redha Malek, who succeeds himself in the position he  has occupied since last August, been retained because on balance  the new president rated his government's record of  accomplishment the last five months as positive? Or was it  rather to allow him to finish the internal and external work he  took such great pains to launch? Perhaps both reasons came into  play in the decision. In the view of many observers, Mr. Redha  Malek's continuation as head of government is no real surprise,  despite rumors about his possible departure and possible  successors.    What history will judge most important about the "old-new"  prime minister was a symbolic gesture that shows there has been  a change for the better in Algerian politics: Mr. Redha Malek  hastened to submit his government's resignation as soon as Mr.  Zeroual took the oath of office.    As for the government's record of accomplishment, although  it  is difficult to give a meaningful assessment of a government  team so soon after its inception, Mr. Redha Malek does have to  his credit a number of achievements, which it will be up to him  now to consolidate. It is above all in the economic sphere that  the head of government's style contrasts most sharply with his  predecessors' orientation.    Accelerated movement--to all appearances quite  resolute--toward a market economy was what most notably  distinguished the Redha Malek government. The path ahead is thus  well marked. His reinstallation as head of government under Mr.  Zeroual is first of all a confirmation of a commitment shared by  the new leadership. In the social sphere, Mr. Redha Malek has  succeeded where his predecessors failed.</p>

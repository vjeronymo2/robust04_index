			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Swimming against the tide Why am I standing in Berkhamsted High Street at 2.30am in a thunderstorm, when sensible people are asleep? In a rash moment I have arranged to spend a day working with my local fishmonger, Wayne Slessor, owner of Aylesbury Fisheries, to find out how he makes such a success of a business in which many of his competitors have been closing down. Superstores, which concentrate on a limited range of fresh fish, have increased their share of the market and independent fishmongers have found it hard to compete. Yet in the last 15 years Slessor, who is 35, and his family have created a business which now has three shops, seven market stalls and a steady business in special orders for customers such as Champneys health farm. Sales are more than Pounds 1m a year. I want to know how he has done it. I am also curious about how hard he has to work to afford the new Lamborghini for which he has just traded in his two-year-old Ferrari. We set out in his van at 2.45am, making brief calls at two of his shops and at his depot to check that the ice-making machines have been working effectively overnight. At 3.30 we call at Nat Jacobs of Edgware, a Kosher shop he has recently bought, to check that the overnight deliveries have arrived from the ports and that the shop has been thoroughly cleaned. This shop is run separately from the others, to conform to strict Jewish dietary laws. No shellfish may be stocked and a skilled 'blockman' is employed to fillet and prepare fish while customers wait. The shop, like Slessor's other outlets, has been re-fitted with white, decorative tiling and stainless steel units to display the fish in ice. It is attractively decorated with preserved fish. It costs about Pounds 30,000 to fit out a shop in this way. It is now 4am and we set off for Billingsgate, arriving at 4.40. The new Billingsgate is in the shadow of Canary Wharf. It is a modern complex with a trading floor of about 40,000 sq ft. The first impression I get is of whiteness. The tiles are white; the polystyrene boxes containing the fish are white; much of the fish is white; and the overalls of the market traders and porters are white - though by the end of trading they are stained grey. The only incongruous note is struck by the Harrods buyer, dressed in a black banker's jacket and black striped trousers. He looks as if he has stopped off on the way to a wedding. But there are no representatives from the superstores at Billingsgate looking for anything out of the ordinary this morning. The second impression is that there is hardly any smell of fish: the ice that keeps the fish fresh and the ventilation system are responsible for that. At 5am a bell rings and trading begins. Slessor makes his way from one trader to another, checking the quality of the fish and haggling over prices. He can tell, from handling a fish, how long has passed since it was caught, from the degree of rigor mortis. Crabs are rejected because today they weigh too little in relation to their size. He shows me how to tell a wild salmon from a farm salmon. Much friendly, loud abuse is exchanged between buyers and sellers before prices and quantities are agreed. Each makes a note in his own book (or occasionally on his sleeve) about the bargain struck. No signatures are exchanged. The speed and informality remind me of the old trading floor of the Stock Exchange. Slessor also distributes cheques in payment for fish bought the previous week. In 45 minutes he spends Pounds 15,000. Half of his produce comes from Billingsgate, the remainder direct from the ports - much of the latter being for his Kosher outlet. By the time we return to his van, much of the fish has been brought by porters to the rear of the vehicle. We start to load it and, while we do so, further deliveries arrive. It is hard, physical work, lifting boxes which can weigh more than 80lbs - a fully grown tuna is longer than a small car. It is now 6.30, about the time I would normally be waking up. We make deliveries to the shops, the managers having arrived by 6.30. By 9.30 the shops have received their deliveries and I am exhausted. Slessor heads off to make deliveries to two of his stalls. He has built an expanding, profitable business in the face of supermarket competition and has made a substantial fortune. How has he done it? First, through hard work. He first began to sell fish (and meat) in his teens, putting in a full day as an engineering apprentice at Vauxhall, selling his produce in the evenings and at weekends. He also attended evening classes to learn about retailing fresh produce. Now that he works for himself he leaves home at 2am three days a week. On those days it is normal for him to work a 15-hour day. Secondly, he knows his customers. No two shops or stalls have the same mix of products. Some sell mostly cod and plaice, some do better with exotic species. By judging his markets carefully sells up to 75 per cent of his produce on the day of purchase. He therefore has no money tied up in stock and has never needed a bank loan. Finally, he emphasises the importance of his family to the enterprise. His wife, Michelle, has worked with him since they were both in their teens. Of the 10 people employed in the business, six are close relatives who, like him, are prepared to work unsocial hours and can be trusted not to pocket the takings in what is almost entirely a cash business. He is also fortunate in having secured the services of experienced staff from businesses he has bought. The biggest single constraint on the expansion of the business is likely to be difficulty in recruiting staff with the knowledge and commitment required to work in a rewarding but tough business. In the 15 years Slessor has been in business 10 per cent of fishmongers have closed. Slessor has bucked the trend towards superstores and is seeking further sites from which to trade. He has certainly earned his Lamborghini in my book though I cannot imagine when he finds time to drive it.

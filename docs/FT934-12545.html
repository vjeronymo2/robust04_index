			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Kewill's Austrian arm signs marketing deal with IBM KEWILL SYSTEMS, a Surrey-based computer software supplier, said yesterday that Han Dataport, its Austrian subsidiary, had signed a development and marketing agreement with IBM Deutschland through which the computer giant would sell Han Dataport's computer-aided design software. The agreement covers co-operation in the development of the software - called CAD 400 - and its selling on IBM's System/6000 mid-range computers. CAD 400 is designed for the construction and building services market. The aim of the co-operative effort is to provide systems for planners, architects, construction engineers, interior designers, building services engineers and building managers. Mr Richard Broad, Kewill's finance director, said he expected the adoption of CAD 400 by IBM to prove very significant for the company but he did not expect to see the benefits working through to the results before 1994 or 1995. IBM is thought to have about 25 per cent of the German CAD market. Kewill is recovering from a period of poor results caused by problems with its German subsidiary, Weigang, sold to its management earlier this year. Kewill reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.69m for the year to March 31. The shares closed up 4p at 248p, against a 12-month low of 47p.</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> NEWBURY PARK BRACES TO FACE SIMI VALLEY  </P> <P> Newbury Park enters today's Marmonte League baseball game against first-place  Simi Valley with an 11-1-3 record, an 11-game unbeaten streak (9-0-2), and the  distinction as one of the area's surprise teams.  </P> <P> "I think we've opened a few eyes," Newbury Park Coach Gary Fabricius said,  "including mine. The kids believe in themselves, though."  </P> <P> The Panthers, who are 2-0 in league play, can make believers of others if they  knock off Simi Valley, which has won 10 in a row, including three league games.  Newbury Park almost upset the Pioneers last season when it took a 5-0 lead into  the seventh inning. But Simi Valley rallied for six runs to win, a key step in  the Pioneers' drive to their third consecutive league title under Coach Mike  Scyphers.  </P> <P> "We were up, 5-0, and never did get an out," Fabricius said. "I'm wondering if  Scyphers is going to want those three outs back."  </P> <P> Eight men out: Perhaps for Cleveland, eight is enough.  </P> <P> In a North Valley League game at Kennedy last week, the Cavaliers were forced  to finish the game with eight players after senior Mario Valencia was ejected  in the top of the sixth for arguing through the backstop screen with the  home-plate umpire.  </P> <P> "He got into a verbal disagreement with the ump," Cleveland assistant Marty  Siegel said. "And by then, we'd already used everyone else."  </P> <P> With the Cavaliers' 15-man roster exhausted, Siegel elected to play with two  outfielders.  </P> <P> Kennedy won the game, 11-1, but failed to score in the sixth. With nine  Cleveland players on the field, Kennedy scored in every inning but the third.  </P> <P> Packing a punch: Notre Dame committed six errors in losing its first game of  the season to St. John Bosco in the St. Paul tournament last week, but Coach  Bob Mandeville could not fault the Knights' offense.  </P> <P> With seniors Chris Lohman and Steve Martinez and junior Kevin Milligan leading  the way, Notre Dame (12-1) scored 53 runs in five games last week.  </P> <P> After losing to St. John Bosco, 11-7, the Knights defeated Murphy (12-0),  Loyola (13-2), Alemany (6-3) and Hawthorne (15-13).  </P> <P> Left fielder Lohman was 11 for 20 with a double, triple, three home runs and  nine runs batted in during the tournament. First baseman Milligan was eight for  13 with a home run and eight RBIs. Second baseman Martinez was nine for 15 with  a double, triple and home run.  </P> <P> "We're hitting the ball exceptionally well right now," Mandeville said. "I  think the fact that we've got five seniors in the starting lineup has a lot to  do with that. We've got some kids who expect to hit well and that feeling has  rubbed off on the younger players."  </P> <P> With Lohman (.500), Milligan (.486), Martinez (.405) and catcher Bobby Hughes  (.455) all hitting better than .400, Notre Dame was batting .365 as a team and  scored 119 runs through 12 games.  </P> <P> Add Notre Dame: Hughes began the season as one of the area's most highly  regarded catchers, but he has also proved to be a dependable pitcher.  </P> <P> Hughes (1-0) picked up a save and a win in relief last week and has two saves  this season. He has struck out seven batters in four innings.  </P> <P> "He throws hard so you can only use him for an inning or two, but he can be  overpowering when he's on the mound," Mandeville said. "He's got a good  fastball with good location and he has a decent off-speed pitch."  </P> <P> Staff writers Tim Brown, Steve Elling and John Ortega contributed to this  notebook.  </P></p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Post Office sell-off necessary to ensure low prices, chief says MR BILL COCKBURN, chief executive of the Post Office, yesterday warned that lack of greater commercial freedom would lead to increased costs and higher letter prices. His warning came as he announced that the current price freeze on first and second class letters, at 24p and 18p respectively, would be extended to the end of August - two years after the last increase. For the first time since becoming chief executive last October, Mr Cockburn indicated that only privatisation would give the Post Office the freedom it needs to guarantee low costs and low prices. Privatisation was put back on the political agenda last year when the Department of Trade and Industry announced a review of the Post Office's future. It is expected to announce its conclusions in the summer. Although Mr Cockburn said the future ownership was a matter for the government, he said that attempts to give the Post Office more commercial freedom within the public sector were bound to fail. He feared such a move might turn out to be a 'fudge' or an 'optical illusion'. Speaking at a conference in London on post office privatisation, Mr Cockburn said: 'If the Post Office is to maintain its winning edge as the leading postal operator in the world, it needs to cut loose from the stifling cash-book culture of the public sector. Privatisation would give us the freedom we need.' If the government did decide to privatise the Post Office, Mr Cockburn said it should keep it as a single entity. 'Chopping up the Post Office into different bits would make no sense at all.' Mr Cockburn also criticised the existing financial targets imposed on the Post Office. His attack was echoed by Mr Tom Corrigan, chairman of the Post Office Users' National Council, the industry watchdog. Mr Corrigan called for a strong user voice to be heard independently from a Post Office regulator to ensure that financial considerations 'will not mean cuts in postal services or increased prices for the user'. Mr Cockburn's support for the Post Office's letter monopoly drew an angry response from Mr Peter Kane, chairman of Business Post. Although Mr Cockburn indicated that the monopoly on letters costing Pounds 1 and under could be reduced to 50p, Mr Kane described any letter monopoly as a 'nonsense' and urged the government to scrap it in order to promote greater competition.</p>

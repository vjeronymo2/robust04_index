			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Caught in an ion trap A new detection system to catch drug smugglers and terrorists is undergoing trials in the UK and US. The ion trap mobility spectrometer works by heating samples to a high temperature. Once the relevant molecules are ionised, they are detected using a sensitive electronic collection and signal processing system. The detector, which has been developed by Ai Cambridge of the UK and Ion Track Instruments of Massachusetts detects explosives and narcotics between 10 and 100 times more sensitively than existing machines. The system is capable of getting a strong signal from one picogram (10'12 gram) of explosives or narcotics. Field trials are expected to be completed in airports by the end of this year.

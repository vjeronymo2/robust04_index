Leaders of the five groupings stressed that the coalition is  of a confederation character and that there are proper  conditions at present to form a conservative and liberal camp,  as time will act to the advantage of such a camp.    Leader of the Conservative Party Aleksander Hall said that  the formation of such a camp will decide whether the Right in  Poland will score a success. He stressed that his party is  determined to form a strong right-wing centre in the coalition.    The SND was set up in April 1992. At present the party has  about one thousand members.</p>

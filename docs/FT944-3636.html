			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: UK producer price figures will give a further clue to inflationary pressures. Manufacturers' input prices are forecast to be up 7.5 per cent in the 12 months to November, but the markets will watch more closely what has happened to output, or factory gate, prices. The annual rise of this measure is expected to be a more muted 2.5 per cent. Tuesday: The Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey will be the week's first clue to consumer confidence. The survey relates to November; since then, the retail sector has had to absorb both the Budget and last week's interest rate rise. Thursday: Official figures on November's retail sales are published today. Friday: Having achieved a surprising surplus in October, the UK's public sector borrowing requirement is expected to slip back to a Pounds 2bn deficit in November. The markets were disappointed that the Chancellor only cut the 1994-95 forecast to Pounds 34.5bn in the Budget. Also published today will be the CBI's industrial trends survey, which is closely watched by the Bank of England, particularly with regard to price intentions.</p>

			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Arts: Either foreign, classic - or both - Best of the theatre in 1992 A year that started with Tony Kushner's epic Angels in America at the National and ended with Adrian Noble's production of Hamlet at the Barbican can hardly have been a bad one for theatre in Britain. Angels had an intellectual spread in the writing and an artistic depth in the performance rarely to be found in tandem. The same can be said of Hamlet, though Noble had a better text to start with. There were at least 10 other productions that will remain indelibly in the memory. I list them in the order in which they appeared. Gregory Hersov's production of Romeo and Juliet at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, where there was a strikingly wild Romeo played by Michael Sheen, probably the first to enter drinking from a bottle of Jack Daniels. Uncle Vanya at the National's Cottesloe Theatre, directed by Sean Mathias with Sir Ian McKellen as Vanya and the entire cast playing to a perfection you will seldom see again. The pity was that there were so few performances. Dejavu by John Osborne at the Comedy Theatre where the Jimmy Porter of Look Back in Anger reappeared in middle age and was as articulate as ever. Six Degrees of Separation by John Guare at the Royal Court, which showed the American talent for fast, witty and socially nuanced dialogue and had a wonderful performance by Stockard Channing, a woman who acts as well as she looks. The Winter's Tale directed by Adrian Noble at the Royal Shakespeare Company's home in Stratford. There, one now realises, was the foretaste of the mastery of an entire text that was to come in this month's production of Hamlet. The Voysey Inheritance and The Madras House, both by Harley Granville Barker, at the Edinburgh Festival. Here was a reminder of how strong the European theatre was in the early years of this century: educated plays for an educated audience. The Madras House had a new twist: the daughters doubled with the mannequins. Le Baruffe Chiozzotte by Carlo Goldoni, which made a brief appearance at the National in a production by Giorgio Strehler's Piccolo Teatro of Milan. The dialect may have been hard to follow even for Italians, but it was a lesson in staging from which even the National can learn. Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author, which also passed through the National in a production by Franco Zeffirelli. I singled out the playing of Benedetta Buccellato as the step-daughter, but it was a team performance par excellence. The Tempest, directed by Yukio Ninagawa on a visit to the Barbican. Once again here was an indication that however good our home ensembles have become, outsiders still have something to teach in the way of technical perfection and elements that go beyond the words. There were, of course, other incidental pleasures in the course of the year. It was bold of the National to revive the original Pygmalion, and you would have to be dull of soul not to enjoy Maria Aitken and her supporting cast in Noel Coward's Hay Fever. Timberlake Wertenbaker's Three Birds Alighting on a Field had a new outing at the Royal Court and showed that it is still possible to be both contemporary and witty. The fringe continued to please, led by The Gate with its European season and The Bush with its performance of Billy Roche's Wexford Trilogy. Those two pub theatres, in Notting Hill and Shepherds Bush respectively, have become an essential part of the theatre scene, often heavily oversubscribed. Yet if you look at the list above, several facts stand out. Most of the plays are either foreign or classics or both. The two best modern plays were American: Angels in America and Six Degrees of Separation. Shakespeare, whether native or imported, accounts for four of the 12 entries. Two of the Shakespeare productions - Hamlet and The Winter's Tale - are by the same director: Adrian Noble. Much of the best work has taken place on the stages of the two big subsidised theatres,the National and the RSC, especially if one includes the imports. The Granville Barker plays do not fit into any particular pattern; they are revived periodically. That leaves only one new British play in the top 12 productions of 1992: Dejavu. And while I admired it a great deal, I have to admit that it flopped. Some people reminded us that they had never liked Look Back in Anger in the first place and did not want to revisit it. A younger generation knew little about the original excitement and therefore had no interest in Jimmy Porter 35 years on. Osborne has suggested that he will not write for the theatre again, but the conclusion is sadder than that: there is now no school of British dramatists writing about the present in the way of Osborne and his fellows in the 1950s and 1960s. Perhaps we should not be too surprised. Great waves of new new theatrical writing do not come very often. There was the Elizabethan/Jacobean explosion matched, as the Gate has been showing us, by a similar golden age in Spain with such playwrights as Tirso de Molina. Then there was the more intellectual departure around the beginning of this century not only with Granville Barker and Shaw in Britain, but Ibsen and Chekhov abroad. The apparent new take-off in the mid-1950s does not look nearly so revolutionary with hindsight. As the revival of Billy Liar at the National demonstrated, what seemed like youthful, northern rebellion in 1960 now appears old hat. In the end, the rebellion was tame. Fresh fields for protest have not yet emerged. Indeed there is a preference for nostalgia, as in Jim Cartwright's The Rise and Fall of Little Voice where the young heroine specialises in singing the songs of Judy Garland and Gracie Fields. Meanwhile we can take pleasure in re-exploring the old, and in imports - a not uncommon British phenomenon. The theatre has been extremely good at it. There is also the musical, which had an interesting year. The best of the new was Stephen Sondheim's Assassins at the refurbished Donmar Warehouse. It flopped in America possibly because its launch coincided with the opening of the Gulf War. Here it showed that by choosing new themes, the musical still has plenty of room for development. Cameron Mackintosh had a shot at new frontiers in Moby Dick, which I enjoyed more than most of my colleagues. Old musicals came back: notably Annie Get Your Gun with a dynamic Kim Criswell as Annie at the Prince of Wales, and Carousel at the National where one can admire the performance while bridling at the sentiment. I suspect that there are many good musicals still to be written and look forward to seeing them. A final point: the theatre in Britain remains remarkably efficient compared with many other institutions. There is a great deal of hard, professional work, the curtain goes up roughly on time and you should compare the price of a ticket to that of other products before complaining that theatre is too expensive. What is needed most of all is a regular audience.</p>

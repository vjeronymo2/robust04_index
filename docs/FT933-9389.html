			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Limit on CIS imports fails to move aluminium market THE ALUMINIUM market was unimpressed yesterday by the European Commission's decision at the weekend to impose short-term restrictions on imports of the metal from the Commonwealth of Independent States. The price of metal for delivery in three months fell on the London Metal Exchange by Dollars 15 a tonne to Dollars 1,207.50. Analysts pointed out that CIS aluminium would simply flow to other regions, particularly Japan and the US, and still have a depressing impact on what was a global commodity market. The Russian producers group, Concern Aluminy, also warned that the block on some imports would be ineffective. And it said it was likely to damage European Community countries because aluminium worth Dollars 250m-Dollars 300m was used by Russia to buy raw materials, food and industrial goods from them. The group suggested that the potential annual cost to the EC in higher prices and the loss of tolling operations - where Russian organisations process raw materials on behalf of foreign companies - was about Dollars 1bn. The European Commission said that its investigation showed that the CIS imports were causing 'serious injury' to the EC aluminium industry. The European industry estimates that those imports rose from 123,000 tonnes in 1990 to 582,000 tonnes last year. 'Aluminium produced in the CIS states enjoys the huge advantage of artificially low energy prices, and environmental standards there are far less strict than those in western countries. In addition, other significant costs involved in aluminium production are not borne by the producers,' the Commission said. Discussions with CIS producers so far had produced no results - not even any production and export statistics - so, 'given the extreme urgency of the situation', the Commission would limit aluminium imports from the CIS to 60,000 tonnes in the months to the end of November. The Commission said it would continue to work hard for a negotiated settlement but it implied further action would be taken if no agreement was reached by the end of November. Mr Nick Moore, analyst with Ord Minnett, suggested the European industry had lost an opportunity for further necessary rationalisation. It was true that Europe accounted for 25 per cent of the western world's supply of aluminium and had suffered 80 per cent of the capacity cuts so far, 'but this is right because so many European smelters are high-cost and small'. The European Aluminium Association gave a guarded welcome to the Commission's action and said it remained willing to support the efforts of the CIS aluminium industry to stimulate its domestic consumption of the metal and to modernise its production facilities.</p>

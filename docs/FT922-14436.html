			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Marginal York squares up to a grand old fight MR Conal Gregory, the Conservative defending the York constituency, insists he is sleeping soundly at night. This could lead to one of three conclusions: the elegant Master of Wine, holder of the Tories' slimmest majority in Britain, is optimistic, realistic or resigned to defeat. Officially, of course, Mr Gregory is optimistic about retaining the seat he wrested back from Labour in 1983 with a 3,647 majority and clung on to in 1987 with 25,880 votes against Labour's 25,733 - a majority of just 147. In conversation, he is realistic, pointing out that York has long been a marginal seat, bouncing since the war between Labour and the Conservatives. Then he says: 'I know, if fairness was anything to play by, that would be a big factor in my getting re-elected.' There are few things on which Mr Gregory and Mr Hugh Bayley, his Labour rival whom he beat in 1987, agree. Least of all Mr Bayley's political hue - 'very hard left', according to Mr Gregory, or 'chair of the Yorkshire Region Fabian Society', according to Mr Bayley's press briefing. Mr Bayley, a York University health economist, insists that his campaign has been a clean fight. The candidates agree that both their parties traditionally enjoy a large bedrock of support in this tightly drawn constituency. Mr Gregory says: 'It's the third party which tends to decide the issue.' The superb heritage and upmarket air of York's centre are misleading. The city also has expanses of terraced housing, underpinning its industrial role. York may be the jam but many middle-class voters live in the doughnut of Tory-held rural seats encircling it. Mr Gregory, who is vocal on consumer affairs, hopes to have York's chocolate and sweet industry, employing 8,000 people, on his side. However, the crucial 6,500 rail-industry voters may prove more elusive. He is scathing about 'sabre rattling' by workers at Brel, the privatised train maker. The workers have been lobbying the government to help British Rail place a Pounds 130m order for carriages for Network SouthEast. The news during the campaign, in a letter to Mr Gregory from transport minister Mr Roger Freeman, that BR plans to place the order soon, ought in theory to bolster the Tories' electoral chances in York as Brel's works in the city hopes to win the work. However, Mr Gregory's trenchant criticism not only of Brel workers but also of their privatised management may cost him votes. Government talk of rail privatisation has also triggered anxieties about jobs. Mr Steve Kenwright of the Green party is more likely to dent Mr Bayley's support than Mr Gregory's. In 1987 the Green party attracted 637 votes. Of greater importance in this fight is Miss Karen Anderson, the Liberal Democrat candidate and a community care development officer employed by the diocese of York. In 1987 the SDP's vote slumped by 3,625 to 9,898, apparently to Labour's benefit. Miss Anderson says: 'It was the tactical squeeze; we think it's already happened.' The Budget's concessions on the Uniform Business Rate should help Mr Gregory but a mere 0.1% swing will cost him his seat.</p>

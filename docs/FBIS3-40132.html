In the last 10 years,  Japanese companies have replaced U.S. and British firms as the  largest foreign investor in Hong Kong. In order to lower  operational costs and compete for greater market share, Japanese  manufacturing enterprises have been increasing their overseas  investments, and Hong Kong is a key point for such investment  because of its proximity to China. According to Hong Kong  government statistics, by the end of 1992, cumulative investment  from Japan amounted to HK$124.45 billion, and Japanese companies  fixed assets in Hong Kong totalled HK$85.16 billion, exceeding  that of U.S. corporations, who ranked second. (Hong Kong  ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE in Chinese 0812 GMT 11 Jan 94)  <H5>  Report Says Commercial Rents, Housing Costs To Rival Tokyo </H5>   Hong Kong could have the world's most expensive rents if  current trends continue, leading to fears that the territory  could lose investment as businesses flee spiraling costs.    According to a study by property consultancy Brooke Hillier  Parker, Hong Kong's retail rents are already 130 percent those  of Tokyo at HK$545 per square foot (psf), while office and  housing costs are rising continuously. The average office rent  in Hong Kong is currently HK$62 psf, compared to HK$84 in Tokyo.  However, a projected 30-percent rise in the territory's average  office rent this year, combined with a 10 percent drop in Japan,  could cause the two cities to change places in 1994. Housing  costs, which are expected to rise by 25 to 30 percent this year,  are also approaching parity with Tokyo. (Hong Kong THE STANDARD  in English 12 Jan 94 p 21)</p>

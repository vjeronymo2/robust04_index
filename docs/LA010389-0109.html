			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> SCHNEIDER WINS 6TH WORLD CUP SKIING RACE  </P> <P> Vreni Schneider of Switzerland won her sixth World Cup race of the season today  and became a clear favorite to dominate the World Alpine Skiing Championships  at Vail, Colo., in 25 days.  </P> <P> While Schneider won a women's slalom, her third of the season, and appears in  top form for Jan. 29-Feb. 12 in Vail, American Tamara McKinney was third and  also could be heard from at the world championships.  </P> <P> But Schneider, the 24-year-old double Olympic gold medalist who looks to be  well on her way toward capturing the 1988-89 World Cup, was cautious not to  accept premature laurels.  </P> <P> "I'm still not thinking of ultimate victory because there are still a lot of  races left until the end of the season. I still remember last year's injury,"  she said.  </P> <P> Last year, when she captured the Olympic slalom and giant slalom titles, she  led the World Cup standings until she had a bad spill in a race at Aspen,  Colo., and tore ligaments in her left knee.  </P> <P> Second in today's race, held in dense fog, was Austrian Monika Maierhofer, in  1:23.81.  </P></p>

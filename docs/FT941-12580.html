			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Insolvency blueprint under fire Government proposals for restructuring insolvency law appear to have little chance of rescuing many more businesses, it emerged yesterday. A survey conducted by the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, the leading industry body, suggests that the recession explains a high proportion of company failures - so proposals to defer creditors launching insolvency proceedings would have little chance of improving survival rates. The Department of Trade and Industry issued a consultation document last November calling for radical changes to insolvency law, including granting companies a one-month 'stay of execution' from creditors. Yet analysis of 1,593 companies that failed in the first half of last year shows that insolvency practitioners believe recessionary factors are the main cause of collapse. Mr Mark Homan, head of insolvency at accountants Price Waterhouse and president of the society, stressed that the profession had not yet submitted its response to the government's proposals and that the survey only provided limited information. However, Mr Homan added: 'You can't legislate against insolvency. The way to cut down on company failures is to have a stable economic environment.' Practitioners ranked loss of markets as the main reason for company failure in 47 per cent of cases, and as an important contributory factor for 63 per cent of business insolvencies. They believed that a negotiated compromise achieved with a stay of action by creditors would have provided a realistic prospect of survival in just 3 per cent of cases. Company insolvency in the UK.

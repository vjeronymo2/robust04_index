			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BEST MCCOLL DUMP OPTION: CLOSURE  </P> <P> As stated in an editorial (June 3), the time for action at the McColl Disposal  Site in Fullerton is now. The endless studies and delays surrounding McColl  must turn to decisive action designed to deal with waste at the site.  </P> <P> Last month, Fullerton community members living near McColl hosted a meeting to  hear and discuss the Stabilization and Closure Plan proposed by the five oil  companies that form the McColl Site Group.  </P> <P> MSG believes this plan would be the most protective of public health, the  quickest to implement and the least disruptive to the community. Of all the  alternatives the Environmental Protection Agency is considering, closure  provides the highest level of protection at the lowest cost.  </P> <P> The 1990 Stabilization and Closure Plan proposed by MSG protects the public  health and environment by avoiding the massive disturbance of wastes that  thermal destruction engenders. The plan involves an emissions treatment system,  reinforcement against earthquakes, waste stabilization and treatment, and  drinking-water protection by means of a cover and underground walls.  </P> <P> The plan includes landscaping the site to provide a parklike setting and  provides for long-term operation and maintenance activities. Closure is an  alternative that has been used successfully elsewhere under similar conditions,  and it meets all EPA, state and local regulations.  </P> <P> The sentiment of many people attending the May 24 community meeting was clear:  The closure plan has merit and should be selected by the EPA. Above all, the  community said, let's stop delays, move forward and resolve the issue.  </P> <P> Our differences lie in the method of dealing with the waste: excavation and  thermal destruction versus stabilization and closure. The EPA favors the  former, MSG the latter. Excavation and thermal destruction could take 10 or  more years to complete; stabilization and closure could take only 20 months,  while being most protective of public health.  </P> <P> Excavating tons of waste and then placing a huge incinerator in the midst of a  highly populated area in the nation's worst air-pollution basin defies logic.  Not only does excavation and thermal destruction pose a potential air-pollution  problem, but it is the highest-cost alternative with the highest potential risk  to public health, cleanup workers and the community. Closure, on the other  hand, leaves the wastes mostly undisturbed and, therefore, results in little  risk.  </P> <P> W.J. DUCHIE  </P> <P> Spokesman  </P> <P> McColl Site Group  </P></p>

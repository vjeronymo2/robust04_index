			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil recovery in Kuwait runs ahead of target KUWAIT WILL be producing 920,000 barrels of oil a day by the end of the second quarter of this year and averaging more than 1m b/d in the third quarter, Mr Homoud al Rqobah, the oil minister, said yesterday. The minister, just returned from the Geneva ministerial meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said output was reviving at a monthly rate of 70,000 to 80,000 b/d, well above an earlier target of 50,000 b/d a month. More than 120 wells, out of the emirate's 1,080, are back in production and 28 have already been re-drilled in the southern fields. The oil ministry has set a target of 100 newly-drilled wells by June and estimates that 65 per cent of the 727 wells ignited by the departing Iraqis may be reparable at the well head. Mr Rqobah said Kuwait's output share of 812,000 b/d under the Opec ceiling of 22.9m b/d agreed in Geneva represented an average of expected output for the second quarter. Production, including Kuwait's share of output from the joint Saudi Arabia-Kuwait neutral zone, will be 710,000 b/d by next month. The minister portrayed the Geneva agreement as a modest, if not entirely satisfactory achievement. 'Any agreement is better than no agreement,' he said; '22.9m b/d is not really the best, but good enough.' He said the deal would offer only limited support to prices in the second quarter, and predicted a still more difficult Opec summit when ministers meet again in May to consider an output ceiling for the third quarter. By then, he said, Kuwait would be pumping 1.07m b/d and on target to meet its pre-war Opec quota level of 1.5m b/d by the year's end. Thereafter, Mr Rqobah said, Kuwait could press for an increased share of Opec output to help recoup lost revenues. 'If there is an increment in the Opec ceiling, we should have an increment of that,' he said. The minister also said that Kuwait would very shortly award the management contract for repairs to the country's three refineries, Mina al-Ahmadi, Mina Abdullah and Shuaiba, the shortlist for which includes Foster Wheeler, Fluor Daniel and Brown &amp; Root of the US. Present working capacity is 270,000 b/d, and Mr Rqobah said this will be restored to 650,000 b/d by next year - about 80,000 b/d short of pre-invasion capacity.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The information center of the Zaporozhye AES  reported that the first generating set went temporarily out of  order last night. It was deactivated by the emergency shutdown  system because of a fault in the water make-up unit in one of  the turbine generators. The reactor plant capacity thus became  ineffective. The fault was quickly rectified, and the generating  set was switched on again. At the same time, the information  center reports, the civil defense alarm sounded while the  technical staff was being informed of the incident. The cause  of the alarm is being investigated. The incident at the AES  poses no danger to the safety of its personnel or the  population. Background radiation remains within the norm.</p>

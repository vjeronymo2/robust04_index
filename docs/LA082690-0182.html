			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HARPER PREVAILS TO KEEP POINTS LEAD AT SAUGUS  </P> <P> Early Saturday evening, Saugus Speedway officials drew numbers to see which car  would start on the pole of the 40-lap Sportsman main event.  </P> <P> It turned out to be Ole 96, the car of Tarzana's Will Harper. Only it would  have been wise if the officials had just called things right then and there.  </P> <P> Because there was no way that Harper, the defending points champion and current  points leader, was going to do anything but keep that lead.  </P> <P> Sure enough, 40 laps later, Harper raced to an uncontested checkered flag, all  but sewing up the 1990 Sportsman division points championship.  </P> <P> Keith Spangler of Northridge tailed Harper all the while and took second place.  Gary Sigman of Carson took third while Dave Phipps of Simi Valley, Harper's  main challenger in the points standings after Reseda's Larry Krieger had to go  to the back after an early spinout, took fourth.  </P> <P> In other races, Richard Smith of Reseda won the 12-lap Jalopy main event.  </P> <P> In the Hobby Stock oval main event, Oliver Aguilar of Sun Valley wowed the  crowd by starting 22nd and blazing past the competition to win the race.  </P> <P> Shannon Flavin of West Hills took second.  </P> <P> Earlier, Phipps started on the pole and held off all challengers to win an  eight-lap Sportsman fast-heat race. John Cran of Reseda sustained heavy damage  to his car in a pileup but was able to resume racing.  </P> <P> In other fast-heat races, Flavin sneaked past Glen Whitton of Lancaster on Turn  4 of the final lap to win the Hobby Stock oval, while Clay Forsythe of Palmdale  trimphed in the Jalopy fast heat.  </P> <P> Jim Gunnarson of Reseda won the six-lap Hobby Stock figure-eight fast heat.  </P> <P> In trophy dash races, Spangler won the six-lap Sportsman event after pole  position driver spun out on the back straightaway of Lap 5.  </P> <P> Other trophy dash winners included Russ Wolff of Glendale (Hobby Stock oval),  Dick Leighton of Pacoima (Jalopy) and Mike McAtee of North Hollywood (Hobby  Stock figure-eight).  </P> <P> Pat Mintey Jr. of Quartz Hill set fast time again for Sportsman cars, racing  the oval in 16.87 seconds. He holds the track record of 16.62 seconds.  </P></p>

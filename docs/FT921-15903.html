			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Bush calls on South Korea to remove non-tariff barriers MR George Bush, the US president, yesterday called on South Korea to remove all non-tariff barriers to trade and liberalise its financial system, saying that doing business in Korea was still more difficult than it should be. Mr Bush, addressing the subject of trade liberalisation which has been one of the principal objectives of his Asia-Pacific tour  - Seoul is his third stop and he arrives in Tokyo today  - said that Korea had made 'great progress in removing visible trade barriers over the last five years'. But he said that there are still 'fundamental problems that stifle the ability of foreign firms to compete in Korea'. He cited 'cumbersome customs procedures' and 'unjustified standards and regulations' as some of the difficulties facing US exporters. Mr Bush also urged Korea's co-operation in a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. Korea's refusal to allow imports of rice has been one of the obstacles to a successful conclusion of the multilateral negotiations. There were several scattered protests by students, farmers and dissidents demanding the Washington end pressure on the Seoul government to improve trade. Students and farmers burned effigies of President Bush, torched US flags, staged marches and took out newspaper advertisements to demand an end to Washington's pressure for opening of Korea's rice market. Protests occurred in three cities, at the US embassy, in streets and on campuses. No arrests were reported and most protests were peaceful. The main opposition Democratic party adopted a resolution urging Mr Bush to halt pressure to open Korea's rice market, saying it could touch off a new wave of anti-Americanism. Thirty-seven opposition party members who represent farm districts boycotted Mr Bush's speech to the National Assembly. The Democratic party has 75 seats in the 299-seat parliament. Riot police blocked a march on parliament by angry farmers. There was pushing and shoving, but no serious injuries were reported. In Kwangju, 210km south-west of Seoul, about 300 students shouting 'No rice imports' staged a rally in the streets, the national news agency Yonhap reported. Another group of several hundred students burned an American flag and a bag of US rice before riot police dispersed them, Yonhap said. Later, 400 students staged a torch-light parade through Kwangju. The government-backed National Agricultural Co-operative Federation placed half-page advertisements in two English-language newspapers to support the government's protectionist stance. It cited a recent campaign that collected 13m signatures in support of keeping the rice market closed.</p>

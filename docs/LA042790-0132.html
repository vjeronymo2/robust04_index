			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TODAY AT AFI FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Following are the Times' recommendations for today's schedule of the American  Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival, with commentary by the  film-reviewing staff. Information: (213) 480-3232 or (213) 520-2000.  </P> <P> Highly recommended:  </P> <P> "Heart of the Warrior"(U.S./Finland; Director: Stephen Peck; Century Plaza, 7  p.m.). A compassionate, wrenchingly well-made film. Two wounded veterans of  Vietnam and Afghanistan revisit the countries where they fought and compare  experiences as amputees. The Afghan vet suggests that "people's heartlessness"  must not get the better of them. In the face of films like this, heartlessness  is not even a possibility.  </P> <P> Recommended:  </P> <P> "Berkeley in the '60s"(U.S.; Director: Mark Kitchell; AFI Mark Goodson, 9  p.m.). Outstanding, a careful, balanced job on a complex, many-layered subject.  Sheila Benson  </P></p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Cyclicals more mixed as Frankfurt eases on session Political hopes continued to move Italy, but its hard currency neighbours made a more sedate approach to the Christmas holiday, writes Our Market Staff. FRANKFURT suspended its recent enthusiasm for front line cyclicals, and chemicals, carmakers and engineers were mixed as the Dax index eased 6.64 to 2,094.01 on the session, up 1.1 per cent on the week. Turnover fell from DM5.2bn to DM4bn. In the post bourse, shares edged higher with Wall Street, the Ibis-indicated Dax closing at 2,100.98. In cyclicals, Bayer fell DM4 to DM360.10 Mannesmann rose DM5 to DM420; Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt said that some foreign, judicious profit taking had been balanced by 'window dressing'. The latter might explain why Allianz moved from a loss of DM6 on the session to a gain of DM10 at DM2,510 after hours. Otherwise, financials were weak on unrealised hopes for a bond market revival. PARIS, as a market, moved quietly towards Christmas Eve with the CAC-40 index off 2.2 at 1,949.85, but 1.3 per cent higher on the week. However, there was more cheer at the level of individual stocks. On Thursday night, L'Oreal said that its Paravision International unit had sold about 300 films to Canal Plus, the French pay-TV channel. Yesterday L'Oreal rose FFr26 to FFr1,145 and Canal Plus FFr11 to FFr898  - suggesting, somehow, that both sides had got the better of the deal. Meanwhile, Valeo said that it would have 75 per cent of a joint venture with Siemens to produce systems and electric motors for car heaters and air conditioners, and the French company's shares rose FFr3 to FFr257. MILAN continued higher as hopes rose that the country would avoid early elections which might postpone action on the budget deficit and possibly bring higher interest rates. The Comit index picked up 1.70 to 629.00, with the weakness of the lira still prompting foreigners to buy. The index had risen by 3.8 per cent during the course of a highly charged week on the political front which saw the resignation of the prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi on Thursday. Olivetti, popular with foreign investors, rose L87 or 4.5 per cent to L2,040, but analysts were unable to point to any news to account for the rise. Other blue chips found strong demand taking Fiat L136 higher to L6,024 and Telecom Italia up L75 to L4,193. Credito Italiano slipped L17 to L1,678 amid concern that it might relaunch a bid for Credito Romagnolo. Rolo, for which a group headed by Cariplo is also bidding, rose L151 to L19,073. ZURICH featured a 3.7 per cent fall in Holderbank as the cement producer, which has companies in Mexico and in other Latin American countries, fell prey to the Mexican financial crisis. The SMI index finished 1.2 higher at 2,651.0for a 1.8 per cent rise on the week. One leading domestic bank was said to be a major seller in Holderbank, which also saw foreign sell orders. The shares fell SFr38 to SFr1,003, although some analysts commented that the fall seemed to have been overdone. UBS was again seen as a buyer of its own shares, which have been under pressure recently, and the bearers rose SFr16 to SFr1,111. AMSTERDAM finished with modest falls after a shortened session and the AEX index lost 0.95 to 414.40. It was still 1.5 per cent ahead on the week. Among chemicals shares, Akzo was up 40 cents to Fl 198.10, helped by positive comments about higher 1995 and 1996 sales. DSM was Fl 1 higher at Fl 139.30. Other leading shares were uninspired with Philips down 20 cents to Fl 52.30 and Royal Dutch off 60 cents to Fl 188.30. Heineken lost Fl 3 to Fl 261.50 on profit-taking after recent gains, while other food and drink issues were mixed. MADRID staged a technical recovery in low volume, the general index rising 1.68 to 292.88, 1.7 per cent lower on the week in turnover of just Pta13.4bn, close to the lowest measure of market activity this year. STOCKHOLM edged lower with the market's lacklustre performance exacerbated by an early close on the debt market and higher government bill rates and bond yields. The Affarsvarlden General index eased 0.5 to 1471.1. MoDo, the forestry group, rose SKr5 to SKr346 after a large block trade in the stock led to speculation that its fellow paper products group, SCA, had sold some of its large holding. HELSINKI revived after news that a pay deal had averted strikes in the forestry and paper industries. The Hex index rose 19.0 to 1,813.7, a fraction better on the week, with Repola up FM4 at FM84.

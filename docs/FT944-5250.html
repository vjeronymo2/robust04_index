			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Clothing sales hit by mild weather Clothing retailers are waiting anxiously for a spell of cold weather to boost sales of winter clothing in the crucial Christmas period, after the exceptionally warm November left them struggling to meet sales forecasts. The warmest November since records began, coming after a mild October, prompted consumers to postpone purchases of winter clothes such as coats, scarves, gloves and knitwear - with a knock-on effect on other purchases. Marks and Spencer, the UK's biggest clothing retailer, said the temperate weather had made life 'difficult' and it was hoping for some 'nice bright, very cold weather'. 'When you are in the rag trade and you have your winter catalogue in the stores, a warm November is not good news,' the company said. 'If you get a nice cold snap, you don't just pick it up on winter lines, you pick it up on everything. People don't just buy a winter coat.' The weather has been a persistent theme in the in-house Gazette of the John Lewis Partnership, which runs 22 department stores across the UK, and the Waitrose food retailing chain. As early as November 5 it noted: 'Above average temperatures throughout October have stood in stark contrast to the colder conditions a year ago, and for the past four weeks demand for winter-weight clothing and accessories has fallen short of our expectations.' It said products such as winter bedding and heating appliances had also been affected. Mr Tim Daniels, managing director of Selfridges and president of London's Oxford Street Association, said: 'Nobody is selling any coats, scarves or gloves.' Mr Grenville Peacock, chief executive of Bentalls, the department store group in south-east England, said women's clothing sales since October had been poor. 'We are still ahead of last year, but we were hoping to be running about 10 to 12 per cent ahead, and in fact we are only 7 to 8 per cent ahead. I think it has been evident that people are waiting until the last minute to buy the things they need,' he said. M&amp;S added: 'We don't really detect a big change from the way people have always behaved. There is still everything to play for.'</p>

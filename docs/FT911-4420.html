			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Share swappers at halfway house / A look at tentative link-ups The possibility of a share swap between Credit Lyonnais, the French state-controlled high street bank, and Commerzbank, Germany's third largest bank, was first mooted by Mr Walter Seipp, chief executive of the German bank in 1987. However, the attempt to reinforce links was put on ice when the French socialists returned to power in 1988. With the climate now changed, Credit Lyonnais, he hopes, will take a roughly 10 per cent stake in Commerzbank, with the Germans buying some 7 per cent of the significantly larger French entity. But Mr Seipp must worry that with his agreement dotted and crossed, awaiting only its coveted official seal, the French government may in fact give priority to a larger, if apparently less advanced, deal. This is the arrangement between BNP, the largest state-controlled bank and Dresdner, Germany's second financial institution. The two have been working together under an agreement formalised in 1989 by appointing a director to each others' supervisory boards. Now, a share exchange, of perhaps 7 per cent each way, is in prospect. But why - assuming both deals come to fruition - a cross-shareholding in the first place? Is it merely the strategy of those who cannot, or cannot afford to buy? Certainly Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank that has bought aggressively in other parts of Europe and has loudly shunned the halfway house of share swaps, has so far failed to find an eligible candidate in France. Dresdner Bank has secured control of the Paris bond and derivatives specialist Banque Internationale de Placement, but it is not the size of venture to which the German house aspires. Meanwhile, Barclays Bank snapped up the private bank Merck Finck in Germany last year, merely demonstrating in the process how rare such opportunities are - with full service banks essentially not for sale in the closely-knit and soundly solid domestic market. Hence the share swaps. At the same time, as Mr Stephen Lewis, banking analyst at Salomon in London points out, 'a cross-shareholding per se does nothing for the development of business'. With most analysts regarding all parties relatively immune from predatory advances, hence rejecting a primarily defensive rationale, the search is on for concrete advantages. There has been a degree of basic co-operation already. Most recently, Credit Lyonnais and Commerzbank, whose association goes back 20 years, combined forces in the UK with Commerzbank providing a German desk in CL Securities. BNP and Dresdner, meanwhile, last year set up a venture in Hungary, with plans too in Prague. All the banks are coy as to specific plans for togetherness in the future. However, one obvious plus would be the capital boost. Credit Lyonnais for example has expanded fast recently. As regards sharing the retail branch network, it is difficult to see large dividends. Commerzbank, which has exchanged shares with another Europartner, Banco Hispano Americano, is able to arrange useful facilities for German tourists in Spain. But the Franco-German fit is not so neat. The main advantages will therefore accrue from commercial business though Dresdner sounds interested in the global reach of possible links with BNP extending thorough Asia and North America. Both groupings cite eastern Europe - where the Germans see a political advantage in a partner helping staunch any nascent imperialism charges. Sharing the risks as well as the rewards could in the early stages be attractive. Further along, the very different styles of the partners may grate - Credit Lyonnais has paid handsomely for its expansion. Later both German banks will also have to decide how they react to the possibly inconvenient wishes of their partners' principal shareholder. Meanwhile, should the French government drag its feet now, both German banks can console themselves that the emergent east German market is boosting their savings base and hence future profits far faster than could the fruits of French partnerships, at least for the foreseeable future.</p>

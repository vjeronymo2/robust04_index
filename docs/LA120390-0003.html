			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING DECLINE  </P> <P> In response to your Column One article ("Lure of Fishing Is Fading," Nov. 19),  it is no mystery why California fishermen are giving up the sport. They are  thoroughly disgusted with the Republican Administration which has made the  Department of Fish and Game the enforcement arm of commercial fishermen.  </P> <P> They see sportfishing license fees increase every year. Then this  administration turns around and uses those collected revenues to rape and  pillage the natural resources of this state for the benefit of the commercial  despoilers and to the detriment of the outdoor-loving public.  </P> <P> The public is tired of being robbed to enrich greedy commercial interests. They  are refusing to pay these criminally high license fees that provide fewer and  fewer recreational benefits to the public. Despite greater revenue, less is  being spent each year for hatcheries and maintenance of wildlife recreational  resources. Instead, these funds go increasingly to fund projects benefiting  commercial interests. That is why there are decreasing numbers of fishing  licenses bought each year.  </P> <P> VICTORIA R.

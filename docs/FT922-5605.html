			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Deal likely on pit lease BRITISH COAL appears likely to agree to lease the mothballed Monktonhall colliery near Edinburgh to Monktonhall Mineworkers, the consortium of mineworkers whom British Coal named last December as preferred bidder to reopen the pit. Earlier this month British Coal said that because Monktonhall Mineworkers had not provided the necessary finance, it was reopening negotiations with Caledonian Mining, a private mining company that has also bid to lease the pit. It now appears that the consortium has secured the necessary finance and a lease may be granted by British Coal to Monktonhall Mineworkers next week. Each of the miners in the consortium - about 150 in total - will be expected to contribute Pounds 10,000 to the company's capital.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> MARRIAGE LAW CHANGE URGED  </P> <P> The Bar Assn. of San Francisco has voted to support a change in the law that  would permit legal marriages between people of the same sex, a legal newspaper  reported. The Banner Daily Journal said the 8,000-member association voted to  support a change in California's Civil Code that would have the effect of  putting to rest all debates over "domestic partners" legislation. State law now  defines marriage for legal purposes as specifically involving one man and one  woman. The suggested wording would define marriage as a "personal relation  arising out of a civil contract between two people." Association President  Peter Keane said the resolution was intended to correct "invidious  discrimination against non-heterosexuals."  </P></p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Car importers take record share of Japanese market Car importers in Japan profited from the yen's strength last month to increase their share of the Japanese market to a record 8.6 per cent. This completed the seventh consecutive monthly rise in car imports, helped by aggressive price cutting and an increase in the number of dealers prepared to break links with Japanese car makers and handle foreign marques. Foreign producers were, by volume, the main beneficiaries of a 36.2 per cent rise in car imports in May, from the same month last year, and a 48.4 per cent rise in all kinds of vehicles, to 21,579 units. Overall vehicle imports reached 6.6 per cent of the Japanese market, another record. The figures come after US and Japan ended a fresh round of talks in Washington last week without agreement on how further to open the Japanese car market to imports. Officials are planning to reopen the car talks in Tokyo on Friday. As in the past, Japanese producers' overseas car plants also benefited, with a 50.5 per cent rise, to 4,558 vehicles imported back to their home country. US car companies, however, were the best performers, up 60.6 per cent, led by Ford, whose sales nearly tripled by comparison with May 1992, thanks to the popularity of its Taurus estate car. German producers lifted their Japanese sales by 25.7 per cent, followed by France with 24 per cent and Britain - led by Nissan - with 16 per cent.</p>

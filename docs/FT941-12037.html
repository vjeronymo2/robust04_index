			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bid battle for mining deposit in Argentina Two former allies in the international mining industry, both with links to Germany's Metallgesellschaft, have emerged as rivals in a hotly-contested bid for a rich copper-gold deposit in Argentina. MIM Holdings of Australia signed an agreement in principle last weekend to participate in the development of the Bajo de la Alumbrera project, alongside International Musto Explorations, a small Vancouver-based group. The Australian company said that negotiations towards a final agreement were 'ongoing'. It plans to pay USDollars 130m for a 50 per cent stake in the venture and would be the operator of the project. The deal is due to close around February 17. MIM's announcement comes on the heels of a CDollars 332m (USDollars 251m) hostile bid by Toronto-based Metall Mining for all Musto's outstanding shares. Metall's offer is conditional, however, on Musto not signing a legally-binding joint venture agreement, or other arrangement to dispose of any substantial part of its 100 per cent interest in Alumbrera. Metallgesellschaft (MG), MIM and Metall were the pillars of what was designed in the mid-1980s to be a powerful mining alliance. The three companies forged a close relationship, including cross-shareholdings, board directorships and joint ventures. However, as the rivalry for control of Alumbrera shows, they have begun to move apart. Metall, which is 50.1 per cent owned by MG, recently sold its minority stake in MIM, and Mr Klaus Zeitler, Metall's chief executive officer, left the Australian company's board. MG is expected to dispose of its Metall shares as part of its financial restructuring. MIM retains a 3.5 per cent interest in MG. Metall said that it would formally launch its tender offer this week. It maintains that a decision on the project should be taken by Musto's shareholders, not its management.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Magma bid wins Peruvian copper prize Tintaya, Peru's second biggest copper producer and owner of the country's highest-grade copper deposits, was sold at a keenly-contested auction in Lima yesterday. After seven bids were received, Tintaya was knocked down to Magma Copper of Tucson, Arizona for Dollars 218m plus Dollars 55m in Peruvian secondary debt paper. Magma's winning bid was just Dollars 4m ahead of its nearest rival Metall Mining Corporation of Toronto. The third highest offer of Dollars 191.6m came from Britain's RTZ. The minimum set by Peru's privatisers was Dollars 60m cash, an investment commitment of Dollars 85m plus a fixed Dollars 55m in debt paper taken at face value. Tintaya will be Magma's first operating unit outside the US. Company representatives at the sale called the mine - at 4,100m above sea level in the department of Cuzco, some 400 miles south-east of the capital Lima - 'a wonderful opportunity'. They said the company was 'extremely confident about operating in Peru'. The sale of Tintaya marks another milestone in Peru's aggressive privatisation process. It is the first time debt paper has been used as part of the purchase price. Under new legislation, bidders may choose between offering a fixed amount of secondary debt or a cash equivalent. The same procedure will be followed with next month's sell-off of the Cajamarquilla zinc refinery. Tintaya's new owner faces a major investment commitment, which may be well in excess of the minimum Dollars 85m over five years specified in the conditions for bidding. Reserves in the main open-pit mine - where ore averages 2.04 per cent copper - are down below 12m tonnes and will run out in around three years. Development of as-yet untouched but highly promising surrounding deposits will be a matter of urgency. Three of these - Chabuca Este, Chabuca Sur and Coroccohuayco - together have some 56.5m proven reserves averaging around 2.3 per cent copper, higher than Tinataya's main mine. In addition, Tintaya has some 10m tonnes of oxide ore already mined and stockpiled ready for leaching. The Tintaya processing plant is one of Peru's most modern and most ecologically sound. Expanded, it could serve other privately-owned mines in the same area. Water supply is abundant and electricity seems not to be a problem. Privatisation should bring happier times for Tintaya. It is often cited as a choice example of state mismanagement of a prime asset, having posted losses consistently since coming on stream in 1985, despite being well-designed and equipped. Next on Peru's mining privatisation agenda is the zinc refinery of Cajamarquilla, located in the province of Lima and less than 40km from the port of Callao. The sale date has been set for November 4 and the privatisers are asking for Dollars 40m in debt paper and a minimum of Dollars 120m in cash (Dollars 8m on signature of contract and the remainder in deferred quotas). There is also an immediate investment commitment of Dollars 20m. Cajamarquilla is one of just half a dozen zinc refineries in the Latin American continent. It was constructed by Sybetra of Belgium at a cost of Dollars 309m and started operations in 1981. Installed capacity is 101,500 tonnes of refined zinc and under normal conditions the plant produces at between 90 and 95 per cent of that. Last year's sales topped Dollars 85m, with zinc ingots accounting for Dollars 70m. Cajamarquilla also produces up to 180,000 tonnes of sulphuric acid - which brought in Dollars 4.4m last year. Fourteen companies have pre-qualified for the purchase, two of them Peruvian operations that buy zinc for industrial transformation. The front runner looks to be Canada's Cominco, which has associated with Marubeni of Japan. There is considerable scope for increasing local zinc refining capacity. Peru is the world's fourth largest zinc producer behind Canada, the former Soviet Union and Australia. But only a third of the 600,000 tonnes of concentrates produced annually in Peru is refined inside the country. Until recently, unreliable electricity supply made expansion possibilities remote. Not-infrequent droughts have always meant unavoidable cuts in production. But under Peru's new liberal economic regime, privatisation of the energy sector is already under way. The new owner of Cajamarquilla will be free to contract electricity supply from either the recently-privatised Lima distribution system, or directly from a privately-owned and operated generating plant in the hinterland. 'This will mean a revolution for Cajamarquilla,' said Mr Carlos Malaga, the refinery's general manager. After rationalisation, which has halved the workforce from 1990's high of 1,100, Cajamarquilla looks a leaner and more efficient operation. In 1993 production costs were Dollars 712 a tonne, with still-high energy costs. If zinc prices hold firm, next month should see another successful privatisation.</p>

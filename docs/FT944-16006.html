			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Senior shares dive on profits warning Shares in Senior Engineering fell by a third yesterday after the company warned that its 1994 profits would be 'significantly' lower than last year's Pounds 24.2m. Analysts cut their forecasts from about Pounds 28m to Pounds 18m after the group said it had suffered significant losses on a contract in its thermal engineering division which would only break even. The shares fell from 106p to 72p, about half this year's high of 150 1/2 p. Mr John Bell, chief executive, admitted the news was 'particularly disappointing' for shareholders which supported a Pounds 67m rights issue at 115p in March. Analysts expressed surprise that the warning came only seven weeks after Senior's interim statement, which made no reference to contract problems. Mr Bell replied: 'We knew we would lose a little money on the contract at the time of the interims, but not sufficient to mention it. Over the past two to three weeks the cost to complete kept going up.' He said that the contract, which is in the UK, was of a type the group had not tackled before, but would give no further details. Senior plans to make a claim against the customer but will make full provision in its 1994 figures. Engineering contracting is a notoriously difficult business, and analysts yesterday criticised Senior for playing down its continued exposure following the closure of its large power project contracting arm in 1992. 'Investors who had been told not to worry about contracting will be pretty angry now it has jumped up and bit them,' said one analyst. Mr Bell said that some of the division's delayed orders, mentioned in the interim statement, had since come through and that significant management changes had been made. But he added that the division's future was being reviewed 'in all sorts of ways'. The group said problems with other contracts came to light during a review started by Mr Kevin Gamble when he assumed responsibility for the division in the summer. He replaced Mr David Bebb, who ran the division for four years and is now in charge of developing the group's interest in Asia Pacific. Mr Bell would not comment on Mr Bebb's position. Senior said it would at least maintain its final dividend, giving a total of 3.4p. Albert E Sharp, the house broker, is predicting a sharp recovery in profits to Pounds 29.5m next year.</p>

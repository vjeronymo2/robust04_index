			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: HSBC set to win bid for Midland today THE THREE-month-old takeover battle for Midland Bank is expected to end today in a convincing victory for Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. On the eve of the biggest takeover in British banking history, the mood at both banks was restrained. 'We are treating this very much as routine,' Midland said. The offer period does not close formally until 1 pm today. But several of Midland's largest institutional shareholders said last night they had already notified their acceptance of the offer, which values each Midland share at 440p, 10p above last night's closing price. Schroders, the merchant bank advising Hongkong Bank, is expected to announce the result of the bid before 5pm today. This will almost certainly confirm that Hongkong Bank has gained control of Midland, in which it already holds a 14.9 per cent stake. But it is likely to take up to two weeks before all the Midland shares are transferred to the new owners. The success of the Hongkong Bank bid has been virtually assured since Lloyds Bank decided on June 5 not to pursue its proposed counter-bid. 'I can't imagine anyone refusing to tender,' said one major institutional shareholder, who said he would have strongly preferred selling his shares to Lloyds. Midland shareholders will get 120 shares in the new Hongkong Bank Holding Company after the merger and Pounds 65 in either bonds or cash for each 100 Midland shares. Last night in London a 'grey' market in the Hongkong Bank bonds was already beginning in expectation that the bid would succeed. Dealing in shares of the Hongkong Bank Holding Company will get under way in London on July 11.</p>

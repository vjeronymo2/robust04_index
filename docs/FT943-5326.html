			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Business Travel: 'Stunning' Kansai opens its doors Kansai International Airport opened yesterday. 'Take-offs and landings went very smoothly,' said Tsuneharu Hattori, airport president. But 19 flights were delayed for up to 65 minutes - owing to the malfunction of an air traffic-control computer - and he acknowledged that the opening, after seven and a half years of construction, did not give cause for 'unalloyed joy'. 'We are still learning from problems, and if two more runways are to be built soon we will need more support from the Kansai region.' he said. Kansai, is built on a man-made island off Osaka and is Japan's first major airport to operate round the clock. It has a daily capacity of 454 arrivals and departures. But, partly because of high landing fees and passenger service charges, only 339 international and 469 domestic weekly flights were scheduled by the time of the opening. For harried business travellers who do use the airport, Kansai is likely to offer plenty of visual appeal with a stunning terminal building designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano. Transit passengers to other cities in Japan will also find the airport designed to meet their needs, with flights taking off to 24 domestic destinations from the same terminal building. Passengers are only required to move either up or down a floor by escalator or elevator. A shuttle that runs along the length of the terminal building at frequent intervals ensures that moving from one end of the long building is a smooth and easy process. For passengers travelling on to one of the major cities around Kansai International, such as Osaka, Kobe or Kyoto, or to other parts of Japan by train, the airport offers the convenience of direct access to the railway station through the terminal building. If taxis or personal cars are the preferred method of transport, the airport is linked to two major expressways that run to major cities, with an estimated driving time of one hour to Osaka and 70-minutes to Kobe. Kansai also offers a boat service into Osaka. This takes about half an hour. But whatever route is taken, the high costs of public transport from the airport are guaranteed to shock the first-time visitor. The 3.75-km bridge linking the airport to the main island costs cars Y1,700 (Dollars 17) to cross, the JR train ride to Shin-Osaka station is nearly Y3,000, and the 35-minute boat ride to Kobe, to which there is not direct train link, is Y2,490. At around 6am yesterday, The Crystal Wing was the first ferry to make the 30-minute journey from Kobe air terminal to the airport island. But, due to engine trouble, another boat, the Pearl Wing, had to return to Kobe at around 7am. The 173 passengers were transferred to another boat. In a related development, an accident involving a hydrofoil carrying passengers from the port of Kobe to the airport forced more than 100 passengers to miss their flights.</p>

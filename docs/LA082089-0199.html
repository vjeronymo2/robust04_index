			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANNEMEYER ON AIDS  </P> <P> One can't help but be struck by the contrast between two articles that appeared  in the Aug. 4 Orange County Edition of the Los Angeles Times.  </P> <P> On the front page of your newspaper appeared the very positive article  reporting the results of a new study that shows the significant effect of the  drug AZT when used as an early intervention treatment program for persons with  AIDS-related complex. Because of the study, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal AIDS  chief, renewed his call that persons at risk undertake the AIDS antibody test  to see if they are HIV-positive, and, if so, to possibly begin early drug  therapy, which might prevent or delay the onset of full-blown AIDS.  </P> <P> Then, on the front page of Part II appeared a report about the current  activities of our infamous Orange County congressman, William E. Dannemeyer  (R-Fullerton). By threatening to legislatively withhold federal funds, he wants  to force states to require the reporting of names of all persons who test  positive for the virus causing AIDS. He is now attempting to do at the federal  level what he failed to do last year at the state level when California voters  overwhelmingly rejected Proposition 102.  </P> <P> As Fauci and every knowledgeable, reputable figure in our public health system  has warned, such a reporting policy would discourage people at risk from taking  the test and would be completely contrary to exactly what Fauci calls for in  the front-page article.  </P> <P> It is clear once again that Dannemeyer is not really interested in public  health or in the prevention of the spread of AIDS. His true interest is his  political and religious agenda of zealotry.  </P> <P> JOSEPH J. BUCUZZO  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

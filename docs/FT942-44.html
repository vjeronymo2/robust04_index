			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Caution over yen's rise leaves Nikkei lower Tokyo Caution over the yen's rise left the Nikkei 225 average lower on arbitrage selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index lost 158.23 at 20,481.00 after opening at the day's high of 20,559.12 and hitting a low of 20,420.48 in the first hour of trading, just after the yen climbed to a record Y99.50 against the dollar. Traders said the political situation had little effect on confidence. Mr Nobuhiro Kaneda, general manager of Daiwa Securities' stock division, said the 20,000 level was likely to be a first floor for the market. He added that domestic institutions had started to buy shares. 'Financial institutions, including public funds, bought a total Y50bn on Friday last week and Monday,' he said. Yesterday's activity, however, centred around technical trading by arbitrageurs and volume totalled 317m shares, against 385m. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 5.62 to 1,666.62 and the Nikkei 300 eased 0.54 to 303.46. Falls led rises by 648 to 334, with 192 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 6.35 to 1,348.19. Telecommunication-related stocks gained popularity on hopes of an enlarging portable telephone market. DDI, a telecom group, rose Y330,000 to Y9.53m on the second section. Kyocera, DDI's leading shareholder, gained Y190 at Y7,450. Nippon Comsys, the telecom engineering company, was the day's most active issue, adding Y30 at Y1,530. Ushio, also a DDI shareholder and involved in technology applicable to the handy-phone, moved forward Y50 to Y1,150. Banks were lower on arbitrage selling. Bank of Tokyo declined Y40 to Y1,560. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 69.32 to 23,633.63 in volume of 15.2m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, was the most active issue, advancing Y150 to Y7,050. Roundup Window dressing by firms closing half-yearly accounts provided impetus in some of the Pacific Rim markets. BANGKOK rebounded after falling for seven straight days, the SET index closing 19.84, or 1.6 per cent, up at 1,272.77 in low turnover of Bt3.85bn. Most of the buying came from local funds, which have to calculate net asset values of their unit trusts at the half year. HONG KONG was easier but recouped almost all its earlier losses ahead of the close on futures related business, with political developments largely ignored. The Hang Seng index ended 33.18 off at 8,640.31, having fallen to 8,461.61 during the morning. HSBC finished steady at HKDollars 83, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 43.25 and Hutchison Whampoa dipped 25 cents to HKDollars 31.25. SEOUL was spurred ahead by a late round of institutional buying which took the composite index 10.35 ahead to 933.96. News of the agreement to hold summit talks between the presidents of the two Koreas next month briefly helped the market in the morning. Low-priced construction and trading companies with interests in expanded north-south trade gained momentum. TAIPEI encountered some demand for industrials, but the mood remained cautious amid expectations that the market's consolidation would continue. The weighted index closed 58.59, or 1 per cent, firmer at 5,933.15 in TDollars 41.23bn turnover. SYDNEY edged marginally ahead, with losses in the resources sector offset by gains in industrials. The All Ordinaries index finished 0.7 points higher at 1,975.1 in volume of 273.3m shares. BHP and CRA each fell 34 cents to ADollars 17.86 and ADollars 17.76 respectively, their lowest levels in six weeks. Western Mining receded 8 cents to ADollars 7.26. Among banks, NAB closed 18 cents stronger at ADollars 10.86, while Westpac rose 13 cents to ADollars 4.44 after BankWatch said it had assigned Westpac's senior debt at AA-minus. SINGAPORE closed off lows after late bargain hunting of index stocks emerged. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 9.19 at 2,218.41. Kim Eng Holdings gained 10 cents at SDollars 2.83 on market expectations of good earnings. Parkway Holdings added 20 cents at SDollars 3.02 on talk of a third hospital being set up in Indonesia and rumours of a listing of its Gleneagles Hospital at the end of this year. KUALA LUMPUR was helped higher by late buying of blue chips, although the broader market fell in response to Wall Street's drop. The composite Index put on 3.19 at 1,010.11. WELLINGTON gave up much of its early gains to end a quiet and thinly traded session little changed ahead of today's budget. The NZSE-40 Capital index closed 3.16 up at 1,982.27 in volume of NZDollars 27m. BOMBAY fell after an early advance, the BSE 30-share index finishing 53.41 down at 4,158.42 ahead of today's end of the account.</p>

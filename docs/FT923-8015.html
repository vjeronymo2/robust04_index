			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Miners in radical S African accord A radical agreement has been signed between labour and management at the Harmony gold mine in the Orange Free State which opens the way to more co-operative labour relations in the gold mining industry, writes Philip Gawith from Johannesburg. The agreement, reached between the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and Harmony, a member of the Rand Mines group, includes a pay increase of less than 2.5 per cent, a profit-sharing scheme, an agreement to minimise the effect of work stayaways on production and the introduction of a 'collective bargaining fund'. Harmony, which employs 14,000 people, is the largest gold mine in South Africa, but has been threatened with closure because of marginal profitability. The agreement follows close on the heels of an important Code of Conduct signed between NUM and the Anglo American group in June seeking to stop violence on the mines and the abuse of a wide range of labour and civil rights. It also provides for negotiations with NUM on new work practices and new technology to improve efficiency, negotiations on skill training and an improved production bonus.</p>

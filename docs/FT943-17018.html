			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Cuts in beer duty 'would lift tax take' Cuts in beer duty would ultimately increase tax revenues to the Treasury, the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association said yesterday. In 'A Real Alternative', the association's 1994 Budget submission, the brewers called on the chancellor to halve the excise duty on beer - 29.7p per pint - in his November Budget. By 1997 they want to see beer duty lowered to the European Union average of 8p per pint.</p>

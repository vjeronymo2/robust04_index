			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Magistrates' corruption probe forces finance minister to quit MR Franco Reviglio, the Italian finance minister, resigned last night after becoming the fifth minister in the Amato government to be caught up in the expanding series of corruption investigations by magistrates, writes Robert Graham. Mr Reviglio, an economist and former chairman of Eni, the state oil concern, sent a letter of resignation to Mr Amato after being served notice yesterday by Milan magistrates that he was under investigation for alleged illicit receipt of funds. The notice was served after he had voluntarily presented himself for questioning. Mr Reviglio's name has been frequently raised in recent weeks as investigations deepened into Eni but he has repeatedly denied wrong-doing. The notice is understood to concern his time as chairman at Eni from 1983 to 1989 when he was replaced by Mr Guiseppe Cagliari, who is in jail on charges of alleged corruption and falsifying accounts. Mr Reviglio claimed to have returned Eni to profitability. Although considered a technocrat, Mr Reviglio, aged 58, was elected as a Socialist senator in 1992. He joined the Amato government as budget minister but was moved last month to finance, a portfolio he had held from 1979-81.</p>

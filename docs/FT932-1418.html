			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (12): Ambition and motivation / Profile of Argentaria ARGENTARIA, the state-controlled banking corporation, issued 25 per cent of its shares on the international and domestic markets in mid-May and as far as investors are concerned it has become another big Spanish banking group to be put alongside BBV, Santander and the other players in the domestic system. The track record by Argentaria shares since its Dollars 1bn placement has been impressive. But now that is fully exposed to international fund manager scrutiny, questions have already been asked about how much more can be reasonably expected from an investment in Argentaria. On its the first day of trading Argentaria's share value rose briskly from its opening price of Pta3,800 to Pta4,305 before easing to Pta4,230 - a rise of more than 11 per cent which indicated that the banking group had set an intelligent premium. A month after the issue, in mid-June, Argentaria's share price stood at Pta4,670. The securities house James Capel has been one of the earliest to sound a note of caution over the group's future progress. Its bottom line conclusion is that Argentaria's share price has gone as far as can be reasonably expected for quite some time. The reasoning by Capel, and by other analysts, is that investors are not doing themselves a favour if they begin to view Argentaria on exactly the same terms as they might the big private sector banks. Argentaria certainly looks like its rivals. At the end of last year it was the third-ranked banking group in terms of total assets, behind BBV and BCH; the third, behind BBV and Santander in terms of net income; the fourth, behind BBV, Santander and BCH in terms of market capitalisation; and after the May share issue, it was the third, behind BCH and BBV, in terms of shareholder funds. But such figures are deceptive for Argentaria is not like the other big banking groups. It is essentially a corporation that was bundled together in 1991 by the Economy Ministry out of a series of state-owned financial institutions. Argentaria is the sum of Banco Exterior, the former export credit bank; of Caja Postal, the savings bank linked to the Spanish Post Office; and of three specialist banks that have established niches in the mortgage market, in providing financial services to local governments and to the agriculture sector. The corporation's management is wholly market-orientated and it measures itself constantly against its private sector rivals. Mr Francisco Luzon, chairman, was the rising star of Banco Vizcaya and he moved, initially to Exterior before the formation of the corporation, in the wake of Vizcaya's 1988 merger with Banco Bilbao. Mr Luzon, widely considered to be the most professional domestic banker of his generation, has attracted some 70 former Vizcaya colleagues over to Argentaria to create one of the most dynamic senior executive teams in Spanish banking. The path ahead for Mr Luzon, as he moves to position Argentaria alongside the private sector in terms of business mix and underlying profitability, may be perfectly clear in the charts that he and his colleagues have prepared but in practise it could come up against confusing signals. Present profitability is not in doubt. Argentaria lifted its first-quarter net profits by 14 per cent to Pta21.2bn. In 1992, its first full financial year, it posted net profits of Pta67.4bn. What analysts are looking at is where those profits are coming from and they are asking themselves whether they are sustainable. A close look at Argentaria's balance sheet suggests that Mr Luzon and his team are delivering profitability through spectacular success in their recovery of loans that had been written off by an apparently slack former management. Last year such recoveries accounted for 31 per cent of the group's pre-tax profits and a further 28 per cent of the profits came from recoveries of overdue interest. What has happened so far is, essentially, that a group of highly skilled and motivated market professionals has been put to work on a number of state enterprises that were underperforming if not virtually dormant. Capel's contention is that very substantial input to the group's income from loan loss recoveries will inevitably decline as the Mr Luzon's aggressive 'recoveries team' works its way through the backlog of neglected claims. Mr Luzon and his team are nevertheless confident. They set great store by the cross-selling possibilities afforded by the group and already they have successfully combined the strong network of Caja Postal retail outlets with the large home-buying client base of the group's Banco Hipotecario mortgage unit. They also see growth in the group's securities house, Argentaria Bolsa, which posted a 40 per cent increase in its trading volume last year, and in the mutual funds managed by the group's insurance unit. Argentaria ranked only fifth last year in terms of funds under management and it plans to raise these this year by 40-45 per cent from their current level of Pta330bn. Argentaria's management cannot be faulted on ambition and motivation. Mr Luzon and his colleagues have to score highly on both because they view last month's successful share issue as only the first step in a continuing privatisation process. When Argentaria comes round to placing more of its equity, it will be the markets, not the analysts, who will be judging the group's soundness.</p>

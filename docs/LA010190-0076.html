			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> THE STAR ATTRACTION OF HOLLYWOOD'S CHINA CLUB;  </P> <P> POP MUSIC: CELEBRITIES OFTEN PLAY AT THE LATE-NIGHT HOT SPOT, WHERE EVERYBODY  -- EVERYBODY WHO CAN GET IN -- IS SOMEBODY.  </P> <P> The long-haired young man seemed a bit fazed on a recent Monday night when the  doorman at Hollywood's China Club wouldn't let him enter the nightclub. After a  trip to the side door, the man returned to explain to the doorman that he'd  been told he would be allowed in.  </P> <P> "OK, so what's your name?" asked the doorman, a tall New Yorker in a beige  trench coat.  </P> <P> The young man paused. "Well . . . Axl."  </P> <P> The doorman stiffened. "That's good enough for me," he said, sweeping aside the  people waiting to clear the entry for one W. Axl Rose, the lead singer of Guns  N' Roses.  </P> <P> It's all par for the course at the China Club, the hottest nitery in town since  it opened in August, where class division is the rule -- and perhaps the  attraction. Before the Axl incident, as the club prepared for its 10 p.m.  opening, the same doorman gave those waiting a convoluted explanation of how  the entry system worked.  </P> <P> "If you're on the guest list, get in this line," he said, indicating the  20-person queue to the left of the entrance.  </P> <P> "If you're not on the guest list, you have to wait here," he continued,  motioning to a slightly longer line at the right. "Now, if you only think  you're on the guest list, you might not be. So, unless you know you're on the  list, don't stand in the guest-list line."  </P> <P> Sound inviting? It is to many in Hollywood who all-too willingly stand in line  -- especially on Mondays when a star-studded jam session draws celebrity guests  only a notch below the rumors -- so they can pay $10 to be sardined around the  elongated horseshoe bar or on the dance floor -- where it's too crowded to  dance and too loud to talk -- and pay five bucks a pop for mixed drinks. (The  "pro-jam" will be held tonight and, beginning next week, on Tuesdays as well.)  </P> <P> "The thing is, everybody's somebody here," said Stephen Eads, who has served as  general manager of the club since it opened in August. But, of course, some  people are more somebody than others at the China Club, a three-level,  400-capacity facility at the Selma and Argyle site that once housed the  punk-era Cathay de Grande.  </P> <P> Though the club is used frequently for record companies to showcase  up-and-coming artists, it's the Monday-night jams that get the buzz going. A  few weeks ago, Elton John hopped on stage to lead the band through nine songs.  Michael Bolton and Rick James are among those known to turn up. Even rocker  wanna-be John McEnroe plugged in his guitar recently.  </P> <P> And the rumors!  </P> <P> "Maybe Jeff Beck, maybe Phil Collins, maybe Eric Clapton," said club publicist  Joe D'Ambrosio as the cozy, understatedly Chinese-themed main room started to  fill up. On this occasion the rumors proved a bust (as was one about Paul  McCartney the week before) -- the crowd had to "settle" for Sam Kinison and  Gary Busey destroying "Wild Thing," plus the now-standard guest appearance of  Who bassist John Entwistle. Word persisted through the evening that Beck was in  the club, but that proved untrue.  </P> <P> Of course, some people are more somebody than others, and that is certainly, at  least in part, what draws the lesser somebodies.  </P> <P> "The general public is used to being slighted, watching premieres and parties  on TV that they can't go to," said Belissa Cohen, who covers the night life for  the L.A. Weekly. "So when they see it right in front of them, they're  privileged to be there. If you see Madonna walk ahead of you to the front of  the line, you know you're in the right place."  </P> <P> Indeed, on that Monday, they did see Madonna, with close-cropped dark hair,  walk by with Warren Beatty. The celebrated pair took their places at a table in  one of the elevated areas that flanks the narrow ground-floor room where the  nightly entertainment takes place. Others in the star contingent this night  included Justine Bateman, actor Danny Aiello -- his son Ricky was the doorman  that night. And Lakers owner Jerry Buss and party held a table throughout the  night separate from, though in sight of, the hoi polloi. A guarded VIP room  downstairs held more celebrities.  </P> <P> "They make it comfortable here," Buss said while the loud house band, the Nasty  Survivors, took a break and made conversation possible. "The security's real  good -- you don't have to have your bodyguards."  </P> <P> But, for all that, the China Club is fairly egalitarian, as these clubs go.  There's none of that trendy snobbery about style that people accustomed to the  likes of Vertigo expect. Both the celebs and the common folk tend to favor the  casual look here.  </P> <P> "We're in the rock 'n' roll business, not the snob business," insisted Danny  Fried, who co-owns both this club and its New York namesake, which has served  as a successful, celebrity-filled hot spot for five years. "We don't play the  'We don't like your clothes' games. . . . The only times it gets tight at the  door is when it's too busy.  </P> <P> "We're not a trendy kind of place," he continued. "We are in the music  business. I don't cater to kids; we cater to an older, sophisticated crowd.  That's why I'm so happy that top musicians have frequented the place. They know  if they play they're gonna sound good and play to a crowd that appreciates it."  </P> <P> Jerry Buss appreciates it.  </P> <P> "It's the only place (like it) with live entertainment in L.A., which is  strange for the entertainment capital of the world, that we would have to  import that from New York," Buss said.  </P> <P> And even those who have to wait in line outside, often for more than half an  hour, appreciate it too.  </P> <P> "I've been in L.A. for a year, and this is one of the best places I've been,"  said Erika Hjelm, a fashion designer from Switzerland, as she stood with her  brother Jonas, a USC student.  </P> <P> And the pair insisted that they'd like the club even if it weren't a great  place for star-gazing.  </P> <P> "I'd still come even if there were no celebrities," said Erika.  </P> <P> Belissa Cohen agreed that it's more than being able to rub elbows with the  aristocracy that brings the public to the China Club.  </P> <P> "You can be in there without knowing that David Bowie and Axl are over there,"  she said. "Some people find the conservative atmosphere pleasant. That's enough  for them. They don't want to deal with the underground and the trendiness."  </P> <P> But, if not for the impressive guest list, you'd have to wonder if the club  could remain the hottest place in town. It certainly wouldn't draw the  paparazzi who stake out the club religiously.  </P> <P> "We give the club a lot of publicity," said celebrity photographer Al Ortega  during his vigil. "Stuff we shoot here gets published."  </P> <P> At 2:15 in the morning, after the club had closed, Ortega and several  colleagues were still working, coaxing a complaining Justine Bateman to  dutifully pose as she headed across Argyle to the parking lot.  </P> <P> For now, the China Club's magic is working. But even those who are impressed  expect it will wear off eventually.  </P> <P> "This is great," marveled one record industry executive, who asked his name not  be used because he might need to book some of his acts there in the future. "I  wonder how long will it last."  </P></p>

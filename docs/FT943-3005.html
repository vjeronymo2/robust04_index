			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Mexicans plan talks on political reforms The Mexican government and the country's main political parties are close to starting talks aimed at further political reform and paving the way for a smooth transition to power by Mr Ernesto Zedillo, victor in last month's presidential elections. Legislators from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), National Action party (PAN) and Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD) agreed yesterday that 'the time has come for the reign of mistrust to be transformed into serious and open political negotiations.' In a separate meeting, Mr Jorge Carpizo, the interior minister, and the six 'citizen representatives' who control the Federal Electoral Institute resolved to push for a 'definitive' political reform that would include new rules for elections as well as changes in the relationship between the government and the PRI. These moves follow statements by outgoing President Carlos Salinas welcoming a call by the leftist PRD for a national dialogue before the country's electoral college meets in the last two weeks in October to ratify Mr Zedillo's electoral victory. A government official said issues such as making the electoral authority independent of the presidency and setting new rules for campaign spending and media access were relatively easy to resolve and that the sticking point was 'how to get the parties to the table'. Setting his conditions for dialogue, Mr Zedillo said yesterday that if his party agreed to a sweeping political reform, the opposition parties must reciprocate by legitimising his victory in the electoral college. Mr Zedillo hopes the PRD will recognise his victory so that after he becomes president in December he can avoid the antagonism that has persisted between Mr Salinas and the opposition. The PAN and the PRD want ruling party victories in some local elections to be overturned, notably the mayoral race in Monterrey and the gubernatorial race in the state of Chiapas. This would be a sign that the government is serious about political change, the parties say. In addition, the PRD wants a clear sign that concrete mechanisms to separate the ruling party from the state will be discussed.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO FUNDS, MUCH FURY  </P> <P> Donna Reed she's not. But Holly Hughes, that frisky femme of the performance  world and author of plays whose titles you can't print in this newspaper, is  cooking plenty.  </P> <P> With her poet's ear tuned to the ironies of gay life, her life, and the  ins-and-outs of waiting tables, Hughes is on the road to set some records  straight.  </P> <P> The New Yorker is one of four performance artists who were recently recommended  for NEA support by a peer panel of theater experts and then denied that funding  in an unprecedented action by NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer.  </P> <P> Despite these trying times, Hughes -- a Grove Press-published playwright,  Jerome Foundation grantee and recipient of a MacDowell Fellowship -- refuses to  let what she sees as the "open season on artists, whether they're publicly  funded or not," stop her from making art.  </P> <P> The world premiere of her performance "Dead Meat" ("I didn't know how prophetic  my title would be," she quips. "I didn't plan to live up to it this way") comes  to Highways on Tuesday for a benefit performance. The run continues Thursday as  part of "Ecce Lesbo/Ecce Homo," Highways' second annual gay and lesbian  performance festival. Later this month, Hughes reprises her solo, "World  Without End."  </P> <P> Tired from repeated sessions with the press and legal counsel, Hughes spoke  about the Frohnmayer action from Seattle, where she was taking part in the  National Gay and Lesbian Theater Festival. (Frohnmayer declined comment for  this article.)  </P> <P> "I'm furious," says Hughes. "All four of us are appealing the decision. Not  only did we get our grants turned down, but before the overturnings were  announced, (John) Fleck, Karen (Finley) and I were getting our careers  demolished by misrepresentation in the press."  </P> <P> Hughes has been recommended for three NEA grants in different categories during  the last three months. Before last year, when Congress installed a clause that  requires grantees to sign a pledge to comply with restrictive language in the  NEA's appropriations bill, Hughes was awarded a 1989 Inter-arts grant.  </P> <P> In March, after the new language was in place, she won a 1990 playwriting  grant. "I smeared the word lesbian all over my application," says Hughes. "I  wanted to make it perfectly clear; I have yet to receive that money."  </P> <P> After that award, says Hughes, the situation got much worse. "It was leaked to  me in the spring that I'd been recommended for funding in the solo  performance-artist category," she says, "but the solo fellowships had been  deferred.  </P> <P> "There was a gag order, but obviously somebody in the NEA was talking and  misrepresenting the work," recalls Hughes. "I contacted Frohnmayer's office in  early June when these distortions first started coming out in the Washington  Times and said, 'What are you going to do about these leaks?'  </P> <P> "I hadn't committed any crime other than applying to the NEA," says Hughes. "I  was offered all sorts of assurances that (Frohnmayer) was concerned and wanted  to protect the artists."  </P> <P> Yet, says Hughes, those promises apparently didn't matter next to what she  describes as Frohnmayer's desire "to make sacrifices to the right wing.  </P> <P> "I suspect the one thing that politicians do all the time is leak something and  see what the public response to it is," she says. "It's not impossible that  these leaks were coming from Frohnmayer's office."  </P> <P> "I have this fantasy: 'A Day in the Life of John Frohnmayer.' He wakes up in  the morning and crawls on his belly to the door of (North Carolina Sen.) Jesse  Helms. And he scratches on Helms' door and says, 'Ohhh, ohhhh, what can I do  for you today? Take some more trash out of the NEA -- those lesbians, those  feminists, those gay people -- and demolish the entire performance-art category  and establish in its place maybe a bake-off?' "  </P> <P> Kidding aside, Hughes says that Frohnmayer isn't doing his job. "Funding is  supposed to be based on artistic merit alone," she says. "The chairman's job is  to insulate (the process) from political realities, meaning Jesse Helms and  (Lomita Rep.) Dana Rohrabacher."  </P> <P> The reason for the four "sacrifices," says Hughes, is politics. "It diverts  attention," she says. "It's easier to de-fund four performance artists and to  look like you're doing something, than to indict Charles Keating or the  President's son" (both of whom are involved in savings and loan scandals).  </P> <P> "The total of all four of our grants was just $23,000, which is just a weekend  at Kennebunkport for the Bushes -- if they don't bring Millie along."  </P> <P> Nor, says Hughes, does the assault on the arts stop with the defunding of the  four performers. "Various organizations from the NEA to city governments are  going after spaces that present us," says Hughes.  </P> <P> "The Kitchen in New York is the subject of three grueling audits from the IRA.  The WOW Cafe is getting eviction notices. Franklin Furnace was shut down,  ostensibly for fire reasons, but really because they presented Karen (Finley).  And Sushi in San Diego -- which has presented all four of us -- has been  getting hate mail and phone calls because the religious right in San Diego has  been complaining to the city council.  </P> <P> "We have to remember other repressive cultures," Hughes continues. "It always  begins with the censorship of artists, the lack of tolerance for dissent and  the persecution of a minority."  </P></p>

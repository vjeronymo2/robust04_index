			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Taunton venture Taunton Cider has entered a joint venture with Miller Brewing Company, one of the world's leading brewers, for the UK distribution of its premium bottled lager, Miller Genuine Draft. The agreement follows US-based Miller's recent appointment of TBWA, a London advertising and promotions agency, to handle a Miller Genuine Draft branding campaign. The deal replaces Miller's existing distribution arrangement with Rawlings Voigt, though Miller hopes that Rawlings will continue to handle the product in the London area.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Arts: Tennstedt and the LPO - Concert In his later years the conductor Otto Klemperer was renowned for his slow speeds. He also had a dry sense of humour: at one rehearsal for a piano concerto the story goes that, after a whispered exchange between the soloist and conductor, Klemperer turned to the orchestra and with a twinkle in his eye proclaimed, 'You say you want it slower, Mr Barenboim?'. His words echoed again and again at the Royal Festival Hall on Tuesday. In his recent appearances Klaus Tennstedt has shown a fondness for slow speeds when he is working with soloists. His recording earlier this year of Beethoven's Violin Concerto with Kyung-Wha Chung was already deliberate enough. But this performance nearly died on its feet and it seemed that the evening's soloist, Nigel Kennedy, was encouraging him to hold back even more. There comes a point when the amount of time available is difficult to fill, even for a talented musician. Kennedy took more risks than Chung had in the same position, which yielded some rewarding moments, when the ideas worked. Unfortunately the strain involved in making sense of the music and keeping up a good quality of tone at these speeds too often told. Nor was Kennedy's own cadenza in the finale among the better of the genre. Altogether, an unsatisfying experience. That special ability that Tennstedt has of letting romantic music drift off across an ocean of inactivity was displayed again after the interval in Brahms's First Symphony, when the music suddenly became becalmed in the middle of the opening movement. But how expertly he uses the opportunity in symphonic works, building the momentum back to full strength with enormous power and conviction. This was a splendid account of the symphony, majestic, tumultuous, every phrase alive with feeling - the sort of performance that Giulini wanted to give here last year but failed to deliver. Under Tennstedt the London Philharmonic is shown to be a first-rate Brahms orchestra and it gave him the best playing to which it has aspired in recent months. For the German classics, at least, the South Bank has found a winning team.</p>

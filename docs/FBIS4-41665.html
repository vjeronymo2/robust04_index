			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnhik]    [Text] Kiev 27 June TASS -- According to preliminary data  in Ukraine's presidential election, held on Sunday [26 June],  ex-prime minister Leonid Kuchma and current President Leonid  Kravchuk will fight it out for the country's top seat in the  second round of voting, due to be held July 10. Kravchuk  gathered the most votes, ITAR-TASS learned from reliable sources.    According to Ukrainian political observers, Kravchuk seems  to  have a good chance of retaining his job. His reelection would  ensure stability in Ukraine's foreign and internal policies,  maintain the now-noticeable trend towards economic stability,  and prevent an outbreak of political conflicts, they say.    Kravchuk, 60, began his political career as a Communist  Party  member. He has admitted that the high point of his career  should have been department head in the Ukrainian Communist  Party's Central Committee, but fate apparently had different  things in store for him.    Kravchuk resigned his party membership after the August 1991  coup attempt in Moscow, and was elected president of Ukraine in  December of that year with a significant margin of victory over  his opponents.    Kravchuk started agitating for a postponement of the  presidential election early in June, arguing that the absence of  a new Ukrainian constitution, the undefined powers and  responsibilities of the president, and imperfect structure of  the executive branch made it difficult to fairly elect a  president. The new session of parliament, however, confirmed  its predecessor's judgement, and the electoral campaign entered  its final heat.    In less than one month Kravchuk visited all the regions in  the country, signed an agreement between Ukraine and the  European Union on cooperation and partnership, and issued a  series of decrees aimed at improving the social and economic  situation in the country. His rating grew so much during that  period that his competitors were left far behind. The  practically-unanimous support of voters in western Ukraine, who  christened the president "national-democrat number one," formed  the core of Kravchuk's electoral success.    Predictions concerning ex-premier Kuchma's fate seem to have  been justified as well. Kuchma, 55, stood at the head of the  government for 11 months, and now leads the Ukrainian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. His platform revolves around  the need for a union with Russia, which is supported by a large  percentage of Ukraine's population. Among Kuchma's assets is  the support of the factory managers and, the presidential  candidate is hoping, their shop workers as well.    Political experts have not overlooked Kuchma's minuses  either. Under his leadership, the government soon fell under  sharp criticism. At that time, Kuchma admitted to reporters  that he did not read newspapers, because he did not like  everythihg that he saw printed there. When the premier became  convinced that he could not manage the state apparatus, he  resigned his job. "I do not intend to carry that heavy cross  until my death," he declared then.    Although he left his post as prime minister, the former  industrial boss was far from renouncing political activity  altogether. "I am not going to fall out of the orbit of politics  or burn up like a meteor" the presidential hopeful announced.</p>

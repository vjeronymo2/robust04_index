That's a big if. Last week the country's top bankers  announced four anti-inflation measures, including nipping  runaway investment in fixed assets.    However, speculative moves have again pushed up the prices  of  raw materials beyond their real value.    Steel prices, for instance, have risen to around 4,000 yuan  ($459.80) per ton from below 3,000 yuan ($344.83) per ton at the  end of last year. The prices of crude oil and some other major  products are also expected to rise soon.    The State has budgeted 1.3 trillion yuan ($149.4 billion)  for  investment in fixed assets this year, and the People's Bank of  China, the central bank, has vowed to prevent any violation of  the ceiling.    But others speculate that at least 1.5 trillion yuan ($172.4  billion) will actually be forked out.    Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji warns that such speculation could  well threaten the stability of prices.    In January, in fact, inflation in 35 large cities exceeded  expectations by rising to 23.3 per cent. The government has  said it wants to contain inflation this year to 10 per cent  compared with 13 percent last year.    A senior Chinese economist who asked not to be named says  two  basic factors determine inflation.    One is the scale of investment in fixed assets. Failure to  restrain capital spending will lead to excessive growth in the  money supply.    The other factor is the prices of such basic goods as grain,  cotton edible oil, meat and sugar.    "The real threat of inflation does not come from the price  hikes of the latter, because people's purchasing power will grow  at the same pace," the economist said.    Besides, the State has pledged to stabilize agricultural  production this year to avert drastic price increases .    "What unsettles me most is a possible ballooning of the  money  supply," he said.    He said inflation may well surpass 10 per cent, but not to  the point where the economy will collapse.    "It will be an uphill battle to fight inflation this year,  and we need deft direction of the financial ropes and of public  psychology," he said.    In some regions inflation has been pushed up by freewheeling  price rises in defiance of State orders. Local governments have  also winked at big wage increases to dilute public fears about  devaluation.    Reliable sources say that despite an impending rise in the  price of crude oil, the price of oil products must be kept  stable or even lowered to protect consumers, especially farmers.  Higher prices for oil products would deal a hard blow to  farmers, jeopardizing grain output.    The State's major tools for curbing inflation include  controlling wages, restraining borrowing from banks to offset  budgetary deficits, and bolstering agricultural production.</p>

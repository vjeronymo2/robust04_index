			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bearish talk persists as bourses recover Morgan Stanley considered European bond and equity markets yesterday and said that they had further room to fall, writes Our Markets Staff. Inflationary pressures, the slowdown in German rate cuts and the fact that investors were still long in Europe after last year's bull market should keep bonds weak, said Mr Richard Davidson and Mr Brian V. Mullaney. Equities, they said, still looked expensive at over twice book value and 7.4 times cash flow: 'There may be some earnings momentum, but at these levels there is little earnings support'. FRANKFURT applied one extension of these arguments - a switch out of cyclicals - to its carmakers, which underperformed as the Dax index incorporated Wednesday's post bourse falls, and slid a fraction further to close 28.52 lower at 2,130.25. Turnover rose from DM8.2bn to DM8.5bn. BMW dropped DM26 to DM856, Daimler DM19.50 to DM814.50 and Volkswagen DM11.50 to DM491.50. At UBS, Mr Stephen Reitman said that, across Europe, carmakers had been coming back from their highs in reflection of events on the other side of the Atlantic, where interest rate fears had been reversing the substantial rise in US auto stocks. Germany had seen poor registration figures in April, he added, with a fall of 15 per cent leaving the year so far down 2.2 per cent after a rise of 2.9 per cent in the first quarter; and UBS expected a fall for the year as a whole. PARIS majored on banks as the CAC-40 index recovered 7.48 to 2,091.89. Credit Lyonnais certificates rose FFr32 to FFr582, the outperformance of the day, while CCF put on FFr4.90 at FFr237.40. Merrill Lynch said earlier this week that the savage correction in bank stock prices throughout Europe had opened up a number of value situations; that recovery plays should return to the fore within the sector, after quality banks had made the running for six months; and encapsulated Credit Lyonnais: 'a stock for which fundamental arguments are few, but the chart suggests a good bounce.' Eurotunnel shook after its rights issue terms, hitting a low of FFr27.50, but recovered to end 45 centimes higher on the day at FFr30.95. MADRID's technical recovery took the general index up 2.07 to 332.52 with banks leading the way, but there was still more interest in smaller capitalisation stocks. The overnight news that Soto Grande's Valderrama golf course had won the staging of the 1997 Ryder Cup took the shares up another Pta15 to Pta517 after a short-lived, but anticipatory high of Pta536 on Wednesday. At James Capel, Mr Chris Cooper noted that Soto had outperformed by 75 per cent this year. The brokers think that the de Benedetti holding company, Cofir, which owns 42 per cent of Soto, has the greater scope for outperformance in the next twelve months after nearly three years of underperformance in 1991-93. AMSTERDAM recovered from early weakness on news that March industrial production, up 2.2 per cent on the month, was 2 per cent better than a year earlier. The AEX index rose 1.24 to 404.74. Nedlloyd, the shipping and road transport group lost Fl 4.30 or 5.6 per cent to Fl 72.00 in response to lower than expected first quarter results. KLM, strong in recent days, rose another 50 cents to Fl 51.80 ahead of next week's earnings report. Shares in chemical companies, staging a technical recovery after last week's weakness, saw DSM add Fl 3.20 to Fl 134.00. Akzo put on Fl 1.80 to Fl 209.80 after it announced that it was to merge its European soda ash operations with those of France's Rhone-Poulenc. ZURICH finished higher after interest rate worries had inhibited trading early in the day before subsequent bargain-hunting helped to reverse the downward trend. The SMI index rose 16.1 to 2,689.2. Roche certificates rebounded SFr85 to SFr6,545 on the view that recent falls had been overdone. Ascom, the troubled telecommunications group, added SFr55 to SFr1,490 after it announced that it had avoided an operating loss in the first quarter and that it continued to expect to break even in 1994 and return to profit in 1995. The financial sector was subdued by the interest rate outlook. CS Holding advanced SFr5 to SFr606 as it awaited a decision by the Austrian finance ministry on its bid for a stake in Creditanstalt-Bankverein, following news that an Austrian-led consortium had submitted an offer. ATHENS rebounded, the general index closing 29.64, or 3.7 per cent higher at 836.31 after a drop of about 15 per cent in less than a fortnight during the drachma crisis, and a fall below 800 yesterday in early trading. After hours the bourse president, Mr Emmanuel Xanthakis, asked investors to stay cool: 'The decisive stand taken by the monetary authorities,' he said, 'will soon ease tension and help interest rates return to reasonable levels.' TEL AVIV recovered 3 per cent, the Mishtanim index closing 5.57 higher at 192.64, but sentiment was still shaky after a fall of some 18 per cent between May 1 and Wednesday.

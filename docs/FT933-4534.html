			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: NZ brewery overcomes difficulties DOMINION Breweries, the New Zealand brewer, reports an increase to NZDollars 15.8m (USDollars 8.61m) from NZDollars 13.8m in net profits for the year ended June. The directors said it had been another difficult year, marked by tough competition and reduced consumer spending. The company, previous-ly known as Magnum Corporation, is controlled by a joint venture of Brierley Investments and Singapore and Dutch liquor interests. It has been undergoing an extensive restructuring after heavy losses on investments in 1991. Dominion is planning further write-downs and provisions this year of NZDollars 30.6m, following last year's total provisions of NZDollars 264.3m. It said said that the tough trading climate looked like continuing. The board reaffirmed that there would be no rapid return to acceptable levels of profitability due to the extent of the resources and investment needed to rebuild the group. It said all business units were profitable with the exception of DB Hotels. There had been a significant improvement in earnings at Austotel, the Australian hotel arm. Further asset disposals were expected and as a result borrowings would be further reduced. The brewer's net debt last year fell from NZDollars 396.3m to NZDollars 216.5m.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of Mobile Communications (13): Confusion reigns - Germany COMPETITION is heating up in the multi-billion D-Mark market for mobile communications in Germany. Two operators launched services based on the GSM pan-European digital cellular radio standard on July 1. The aim is to have 6m to 7m GSM users by the turn of the century. But the delayed availability of handsets has created confusion in the market. This has been exacerbated by the announcement of new mobile services that could compete with GSM. Cellular penetration in Germany, at less than 1 per cent of the population, is much lower than in the UK, where it is over 2 per cent, or Scandinavia, where it is over 5 per cent. This partly due to the inability of the present analogue systems to handle satisfactorily calls to and from hand-portable cellular telephones and also to the relatively high cost of mobile phones in Germany. But another reason has been lack of competition. Until recently, mobile communications were under the monopoly of the country's national telecommunications carrier, Deutsche Telekom. It was hoped the introduction of GSM would address these problems. Between them, the two GSM network operators, Deutsche Telekom and Mannesmann Mobilfunk, have invested DM2bn in their networks and this is expected to be topped up by another DM1.8bn by the end of next year. But the delayed availability of suitable handsets has cost both operators dearly. This has been particularly damaging to mobile communications newcomer Mannesmann Mobilfunk, for whom the 12-month delay is estimated by analysts to have cost about DM1m a day. Service providers have also suffered from the delay. Having invested millions of D-Marks to build infrastructures with 5,000 or more retail and service outlets, the service providers have been forced to bridge the gap by selling terminals for the current analogue mobile telephone system, Deutsche Telekom's C-Netz. Then, two weeks before Deutsche Telekom and Mannesmann Mobilfunk were able to start the commercial operation of their networks with a supply of approved handsets, the minister for post and telecommunications, Mr Christian Schwarz-Schilling, announced the licensing procedure for a third mobile telephone network operator using personal communications network (PCN) technologies. Deutsche Telekom and Mannesmann Mobilfunk were both excluded from bidding and from any future bids for at least four years. The new operator will be licensed to run a PCN at 1.8GHz using the same DCS1800 pan-European PCN standard as is to be used in the UK. Bidders that have so far revealed their identity are led by BMW, the luxury car maker, MAN, the machine tool and truck manufacturer, Preussen Elektra, a subsidiary of power utility holdings company VEBA, and McCaw, the US cellular radio network operator. Adding to the confusion of Germany's mobile communications sector, GSM and PCN are not the only mobile communications opportunities in Germany. The ministry is planning shortly to issue two national radiopaging licences based on the European radio messaging (Ermes) standard. Some 28 public automatic mobile radio networks have also recently been licensed and a mobile data communications licence is due to be issued. At the same time n ew suppliers are entering the German market: Deutsche Telekom's legendary relationship with its house supplier Siemens is not as close as it used to be. Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia are supplying Deutsche Telekom with the radio technology for a wireless local loop programme in eastern Germany. Mannesmann Mobilfunk has selected US telecommunications giant AT&amp;T to supply parts of its cellular network. Anxious to gain their share of what they expect to be the largest European market, GSM handset manufacturers have made the German market their priority. Sweden's Ericsson, Finland's Nokia, the US's Motorola, the UK's Orbitel and Japan's Panasonic have all made their mark with prices about DM1,000 cheaper than the equivalent analogue cellular phones in Germany. Most of their initial orders have come from the two network operators, anxious to see GSM handsets at last available to their subscribers. 'It is plain economic reasoning that operators must procure worldwide wherever quality is best and prices are optimal,' says Mr Helmut Ricke, Deutsche Telekom chairman. By 2000, Deutsche Telekom intends to achieve market leadership with over 3m subscribers to its GSM network. But so does Mannesmann Mobilfunk. Now, however, the primary concern of both operators is simply to get their digital mobile telephone networks rolling and to dispel some of the confusion which surrounds Germany's mobile communications sector.</p>

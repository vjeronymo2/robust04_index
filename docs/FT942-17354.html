			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt German 10-year bond yields ended last week unchanged on the previous week at 6.30 per cent, but the market has yet to take account of the latest economic news from the US, which has lifted chances of a further US interest rate rise this week. Against this background, an expected cut of 3-5 basis points in the Bundesbank's repo rate is likely to have little impact. The Bundesbank repo results are due on Wednesday, when DM82.1bn of repos expire. Instead, any attention not trained on the US market is likely to be focused on German economic data. The market reopens today, after the long Easter weekend, to a slew of economic data this week, which includes manufacturing orders, output and unemployment. According to market surveys by IDEA, the market is expecting unemployment in March to show a rise of 10,000 to 35,000. The ranges for industrial and manufacturing production in February, month-on-month, are down 0.6 per cent to up 0.3 per cent and down 0.3 per cent to up 0.7 per cent respectively, according to IDEA. The range for manufacturing orders in February is down 0.5 per cent to up 0.5 per cent. Traders will be on the look-out for signs of economic recovery, which could reduce the likelihood of further rate cuts by the Bundesbank.</p>

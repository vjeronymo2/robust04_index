			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Munch Exhibit Opens: The tormented inner life of Norwegian artist Edvard Munch,  who once said that "my pictures are my diaries," is laid bare in a new  exhibition of his prints that opened Sunday at the National Gallery of Art in  Washington. The show's 94 prints were assembled from the holdings of Sarah and  Lionel Epstein, who plan to give their entire collection of about 200 Munch  woodcuts, lithographs and other graphic works to the museum. The exhibit will  travel later this year to Los Angeles. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

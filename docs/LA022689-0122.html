			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> THE ART OF TAKING RISKS FOR ART'S SAKE IS VERY CRUCIAL IN SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Artists take risks. A life in art is not only a shaky way to earn a living, but  each creative act is also an exercise in exposure. Standing nude in Horton  Plaza is nothing compared to the nakedness of painting a picture or writing a  poem. Then a critic tells the world whether or not the artist's bare soul has  value.  </P> <P> Politicians, on the other hand, trying to please as many constituents as  possible, play it safe.  </P> <P> The difference between the artist and the politician makes wise politicians  distance themselves from decisions on government funding of the arts. The  political risks are too great.  </P> <P> Therefore, the upcoming San Diego City Council vote on whether the Public  Services and Safety Committee gets first crack at the arts allocations is  meaningless because the real damage was done when the council foolishly  demanded that it have the final say on who gets money for the arts.  </P> <P> This situation may exist some other place, but I can think of no other body of  elected officials who have willingly made themselves targets for the wrath of  disgruntled artists, self-styled champions of wise government spending and any  assortment of crazy-cause flakes.  </P> <P> We can reasonably expect that arts funding in San Diego will now become a  combination of the divisiveness that has accompanied the renaming of Market  Street and the convention center and the scandals that made our city a joke in  the art world when the Board of Port Commissioners turned down three  sculptures. Referenda are sure to follow. No wonder then, that the new  Commission for Arts and Culture is proceeding with caution and in a very  strange direction.  </P> <P> With the council looking over its shoulder, the commission recently announced  that it would apportion money based on an art group's annual budget and the  excellence of its management. The commission's chairman said that funding  panels will not review artistic quality.  </P> <P> An arts commission that doesn't consider artistic excellence?  </P> <P> Another member of the commission said audience size and fund-raising success  are a measure of artistic excellence. Untrue. Grant writing, audience  development and fund raising are sales skills.  </P> <P> Under the commission's guidelines, Michael Jackson would beat out Mozart, and  LeRoy Neiman would win over Cezanne. Taking this formula to its logical, but  ridiculous, extreme, if this commission were funding theologians, they would  favor Jim and Tammy Bakker over Jesus.  </P> <P> No one denies that judgments about artistic quality are difficult. National,  state, and city funding bodies that use artistic excellence as a factor in  making grants -- and most do -- are not universally popular.  </P> <P> A commission that will not take risks does not give us confidence that it will  support artists who do. But that is one of the qualities it should be looking  for in those applying for grants.  </P> <P> Will the commission tackle big questions? Will it devise ways to enrich our  artistic life by including Mexican, African and Asian arts? Will it be bold  enough to fund experiments and young promising artists? Will it fearlessly  support work that is critical of society and artists who expose the bigotry and  racism in San Diego? Can it preserve the large institutions and at the same  time encourage new ones? Will it lobby for artist's housing, rehearsal space,  arts programs in the schools?  </P> <P> A timid commission that doesn't judge excellence will be forced to use  peripheral standards, such as an art's value as a tourist attraction or its use  in a public relations contest with other cities. That is like having a fancy  car in the driveway to impress the neighbors, but never driving it to get  anywhere.  </P> <P> A further problem is the perception that, by not considering artistic merit,  the commission is not being fair. The commission was already regarded  skeptically by many in the arts community, who believed that the mayor and the  council appointed political friends, some of whom represent one or another of  the major arts groups in town. Recognizing these affiliations, small groups and  individuals fear they'll be cut out of the funding process.  </P> <P> The commission must address these well-founded concerns by publicly stating its  responsibility to represent all citizens, all the arts and all the artists of  San Diego. To act otherwise would be a conflict of interest.  </P> <P> To give funds based on the excellence of an organization's management or its  attendance figures merely perpetuates the status quo, and we end up with a  welfare system for the arts rather than a vision for positive change.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, many arts institutions already have a welfare mentality, "Give  us money simply because we are needy." When have we heard them argue for  support based on the value of their art to the public? Their unwillingness or  inability to articulate a philosophical reason for government to fund their  work is a contributing factor to the vacuum in the artistic life of San Diego.  </P> <P> When the mayor partially filled that vacuum with her ill-considered "Year of  the Arts" speech, heads of arts organizations were aghast. Some of the larger  institutions might have attempted to guide the mayor or, failing that, have  criticized her plans in public statements. Instead, greed and fear of  retribution turned them into sycophants, unwilling to tell the empress she had  no clothes and unable to suspend their rivalries, join together and aid the  city to formulate an intelligent policy.  </P> <P> Taking a long view, I know from history that artists have often been courtiers.  Shakespeare had to flatter Queen Elizabeth and Moliere humored Louis XIV. But  we live in a democracy and should not have to fawn on our officials.  </P> <P> The arts, especially in a democracy and particularly if they are to receive  public funds, are obligated to tell the truth. We need the arts for precisely  that reason: to show us the truth.  </P> <P> Moreover, it seems to me that we have lost a thread of continuity when money  becomes so important to art. Art springs from religion, not commerce. Art and  religion ask many of the same questions about our nature as human beings, our  relationship to those infinite forces that confound us, and our treatment of  one another. Art is now more metaphorical than religion, and it is certainly  more subversive, in the political sense and in the original Latin meaning of  turning things upside down.  </P> <P> Art turns things upside down so that we see them in a new way, a changed  perspective. Because this is of value to society, one of the commission's  criteria for funding should be that an arts group or artist speak to questions  that force us to consider our humanity, our role in the universe and the nature  of society in new ways.  </P> <P> Going back to the same Latin root of subversion, vertere, to turn, there is  another kind of art, a diversion. This art turns us away from thinking of the  large questions. It is the tired businessman's art, a way of forgetting one's  problem. When awarding grants, the Commission for Arts and Culture should  realize that diversions are often able to support themselves.  </P> <P> Were the Soviet Arts Festival, "The Year of the Arts" and the Commission for  Arts and Culture intended as diversions? It doesn't matter now. The curtain has  risen on a new show and a much needed spotlight has been focused on the arts in  San Diego. The leading players are the power-hungry mayor and council, the  politicized commission and the greedy arts groups. Who will be the hero and who  the villain? Will anyone demonstrate wisdom, vision, unselfishness or honesty?  And who will take risks?  </P> <P> The paradox is -- as every artist knows and politicians do not -- that taking  risks is the only way to be safe.  </P></p>

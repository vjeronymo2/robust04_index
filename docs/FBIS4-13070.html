			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tel Aviv SHISHI in Hebrew on 15 April in  page 4 carries a 1,000-word report on an interview with PLO  leader Yasir 'Arafat by 'Uzi Mahanaymi conducted on 11 April at  PLO headquarters in Tunis.    Referring to Rabin, 'Arafat says: "I am pragmatic. I see  things as they are. The man does not want to give me Gaza and  Jericho." Moreover, he says, "Rabin regrets the whole business.  Believe me."    Mahanaymi asks him why should he not accept what Rabin  promised, Gaza and Jericho, and then worry about the details.    Shaking his head, 'Arafat replies: "Rabin does not want to  give me Gaza and Jericho. I am sure about it."    Asked whether he can afford not to accept Gaza and Jericho  or  complete what he started in Washington, the PLO leader replies:  "I can wait. I have waited so many years, I can wait another  10 years. Just you wait and see what happens when I come out and  tell the world that the process failed and why it did. You will  see the reaction then. I have patience. I can wait."  Moreover, 'Arafat notes, "I could have done business with  Begin. I could have done business with Dayan. You know what --  even with Shamir I could."    Asked why he should not meet Rabin to break the stalemate,  'Arafat replies: "There is no point to it. A meeting will not  bring about a breakthrough."    When Mahanaymi remarks that Rabin could divert his efforts  to  talks with Syria, whereas he had crossed the point of no return,  'Arafat answers: "I have patience. I am patient, I have all  the time in the world." He goes on to say: "It takes two to  tango, right? The same goes for peace. They do not want to.  So, what can I do?"    Commenting on the way Israel conducts the negotiations, he  says: "They came to me in Cairo with their walkie-talkies.  Everybody has his own personal walkie-talkie. They call  Israel. They step out to the garden and speak. One reports to  Baraq, another reports to Peres, and the third reports to Rabin.  Is that the way to work? I swear to you, President Mubarak was  kept waiting four hours until they finished all their talking.    "I will not forget what happened with Peres. We came to talk  business, and all of a sudden he gets on the walkie-talkie with  Rabin. I saw his hair stand on end and his mood change.    "And then there was the business of adjourning the talks  because of Holocaust Remembrance Day. What was this all about?  If Remembrance Day was the reason, then how do you explain that  the economic talks in Paris continued? Not only did they hold  talks on Remembrance Day, but also on the Sabbath. So, what is  going on here? The economic talks are more important than the  political talks. And, if they were really adjourned because of  Remembrance Day, why did the Paris talks continue that day?"    Asked where the Americans come into the picture, 'Arafat  "does not reply, and makes a dismissive gesture with his hand."    Wrapping up the interview, Mahanaymi asks 'Arafat the same  question he has asked him for years: "Can a Western and  European-oriented Israel, unwilling to assimilate into its  environment, survive in the Middle East?" The PLO leader  reported "smiled, but was not prepared to answer this question  either."</p>

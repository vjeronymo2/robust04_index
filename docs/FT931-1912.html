			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Russia split on Yeltsin support: President gives guarantee of media freedom - US pledges backing for reforms RUSSIA'S republics and regions were last night split more or less equally over support for Mr Boris Yeltsin in his attempt to hold a popular vote on his presidency and a new constitution. The mixed reaction in the regions - that belied expectations of widespread rejection of his action in outlying areas - filtered in to Moscow as the Constitutional Court adjourned its crucial review of Mr Yeltsin's move without an immediate decision. Reflecting western support for Mr Yeltsin, Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, said the US must help reform in Russia 'not as a matter of charity but as a strategic concern of the highest order'. He said Mr Yeltsin was committed to reform in its broadest sense, including protection of civil liberties. But Mr Christopher stressed that US assistance would not be 'cheap' and must be 'for the duration', vested in reformers 'whether they are up or whether they are down'. The response in Russia's outlying regions is vital for Mr Yeltsin as they could interfere with his proposal to hold a popular vote on April 25 on whether Russia should be ruled by the president or by the parliament that is largely hostile to him and his pro-market reforms. While the reaction was encouraging for him, it raised the danger of a deeply divided nation, with rising tension between regions as the power struggle in Moscow intensifies. Mr Yeltsin moved to forestall expected attempts by parliament to declare control over the media, by announcing he would guarantee the freedom of all TV and radio stations and newspapers. Most national papers are already sympathetic to him and the two main state channels are headed by his appointees. Mr Yeltsin got further strong support from Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, who highlighted the desperate nature of the Russian economy as the decisive factor in the president's decision to rule by decree until the popular vote was held. But Mr Yeltsin suffered a blow when Mr Nikolai Fyodorov, the justice minister, resigned - the first minister to make clear his lack of support for the president. The Constitutional Court deliberated for hours but failed to rule on the constitutionality of Mr Yeltsin's move. The court's chairman, Mr Valery Zorkin, said deliberations would continue later this week. Like parliament, the 13-member court is dominated by conservatives. But the delay pointed to a troubled debate on a ruling that might lead to steps in parliament to impeach Mr Yeltsin. Pointing to one of the court's problems, Mr Zorkin said it had not received any documents requested from Mr Yeltsin. Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, Mr Yeltsin's press secretary, earlier dismissed the court as biased because of Mr Zorkin's declaration on Sunday that the president was in breach of the constit-ution. In London, Mr John Major sent a message of support to Mr Yeltsin. 'Russia needs effective democratic government respecting the rule of law. That is what we support and what you are seeking to achieve,' the prime minister said. Mr Major added that over the past two weeks the Group of Seven leading industrial countries 'has been working on ideas for further economic support'.

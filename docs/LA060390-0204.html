			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JAIL INITIATIVE  </P> <P> As a 22-year resident of Yorba Linda, I was encouraged by the findings of the  recent survey done by The Times in regards to Measure A, the Centralized Jail  Initiative ("Voters Oppose Measure to Restrict Jail to Santa Ana," May 29).  </P> <P> The survey finds that the majority of voters surveyed are against the  initiative that would restrict the building of all future jails to Santa Ana.  </P> <P> I was horrified when I first learned that Yorba Linda supported this  initiative. The jail we didn't want, which would supposedly lower the value of  our homes, endanger our children and create traffic problems, is now acceptable  to dump on our neighbors in another city just because it gets it out of our  back yard and into theirs?  </P> <P> I am glad that the rest of the county is evidently not willing to do to Santa  Ana what some residents of Yorba Linda and Anaheim Hills are all too willing to  do.  </P> <P> I ask that all residents of Yorba Linda and Anaheim Hills examine their  thinking and vote no on Measure A.  </P> <P> TRICIA HOMRIGHAUSEN  </P> <P> Yorba Linda  </P></p>

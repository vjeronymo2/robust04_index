It discussed the draft of its report on government work  which  will be submitted to the forthcoming second session of the  Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) for deliberation.    Premier Li Peng presided over today's enlarged plenary  meeting.    He told the council that 1993 was the year when China  carried  out the spirit of the 14th national congress of the Communist  Party of China (CPC) in an all-round way, and marched  victoriously forward along the road of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics.    Great achievements were made during the year in the reform,  opening up and socialist modernization drive and all other  aspects of work. The annual tasks set for the year by the first  NPC session were basically accomplished, he said.    Premier Li said 1994 is an important year for China to  maintain a sustained and healthy development of the national  economy and a critical year for the country to make further  reforms.    On the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the current  domestic and international situation, he said, the CPC Central  Committee had put forth a basic principle for the work of the  whole party and the whole nation this year.    The principle is to be under the guidance of comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, carry out in an  all-round way the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee,  speed up the pace of building a socialist market economic  system, ensure a sustained, quick and healthy development of the  national economy, maintain political stability, and promote  social progress in an all-round way.    Premier Li said that the CPC Central Committee had  emphasized  that to seize the current opportunity to deepen the reform, open  wider to the outside world, promote development and maintain  stability are the major tasks of the whole party and the whole  nation.    The State Council and governments at other levels should  keep  this in mind in every aspect of their work and seriously handle  the relations between reform, development and stability.    While concentrating efforts on promotion of economic  development and reform, it is also necessary to actively develop  the causes of science, technology, education and culture,  greatly promote cultural and ideological progress of the  socialist society, raise the level of socialist democracy, and  improve the socialist legal system.    The draft of the government work report has been printed and  distributed to all the departments, provinces, municipalities,  autonomous regions and other units involved to solicit  suggestions so as to draw on collective wisdom and absorb all  useful ideas.    Wang Mengkui, deputy director of the Research Office of the  State Council and head of the group in charge of drafting the  government work report, gave today's meeting an introduction to  the process of drafting the report. Many ministers of the State  Council voiced their opinions on revisions of the draft.    Among those at today's meeting were Vice-Premiers Zhu  Rongji,  Zou Jiahua, Qian Qichen and Li Lanqing, as well State  Councillors Chi Haotian, Li Guixian, Chen Junsheng, Peng Peiyun  and Luo Gan.

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A PERSONAL HORROR STORY ON PESTICIDES  </P> <P> I feel compelled to respond to Supervisor Pete Schabarum's remarks to the  Downey Rotary Club luncheon last Tuesday (Times, Oct. 26). Schabarum stated  that "a couple of local politicians, desperately seeking some kind of issue to  justify reelection, have jumped on the construction of a county facility and  have repeatedly described it as some kind of chamber of horrors." Schabarum was  referring to Norwalk Assemblyman Bob Epple and Downey Councilman Roy Paul.  These gentlemen have tried to inform the citizens in the area adjacent to the  pesticide warehouse of the potential dangers.  </P> <P> "A chamber of horrors," if I may borrow from Schabarum, is an accurate  description of the present warehouse in Pico Rivera. In January of 1987, my  husband, a 14-year employee with the Los Angeles County Department of the  Agricultural Commissioner, was exposed to aluminum phosphide gas. He and two  other county employees were hospitalized for 24 hours. Aluminum phosphide is  used to fumigate grain for the control of rodents, etc. The fumigation was not  properly performed and the poisonous gas was vented into the interior of the  warehouse. My husband and the other two men were in the warehouse attending to  work-related responsibilities and were not involved in the ill-fated  fumigation. After release from the hospital, all three were homebound for three  weeks per doctor's orders.  </P> <P> Schabarum stated that he "believes the facility will operate safely on Downey's  western border with South Gate." I say to the supervisor, before any pesticides  are stored, or any grain is treated, please see that the people directly  involved with the daily function of this warehouse are properly trained. Also,  in the event of any violation, the penalty should be in accordance with the  penalties issued to private industry.  </P> <P> MAUREEN HURLEY  </P> <P> Norwalk  </P></p>

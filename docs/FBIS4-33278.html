			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Norberto Hernandez from the "Evening </F> Information Review" newscast]    [Text] International sanctions are the current fashion,  especially when it is the U.S. Government that is most  interested in those sanctions. Any government that refuses to  follow Washington's instructions or fulfill its demands sets  itself on the path to economic sanctions.    Worst of all is that the United States has managed to  introduce these methods in the OAS, and when a problem arises  with any government, the first thing that is proposed and  decided is to apply sanctions and twist the arm or squeeze the  necks of those who are reluctant or rebellious.    Washington's current target is North Korea because it has  refused to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  to conduct inspections to confirm whether or not the North  Korean Government is on the verge of manufacturing nuclear  weapons. The U.S. Government seems to have forgotten that North  Korea is an independent and sovereign country with the full  right to decide who does or does not enter its territory.    As for the possible danger of the North Korean Government's  having nuclear weapons, there is no doubt that the threat is  much less than that represented by the United States' huge  nuclear arsenal, which no one has questioned as one of the  greatest threats to humanity.    Washington has managed to make Russia, the Ukraine, and  other  former USSR countries agree to disarm themselves by eliminating  their nuclear arsenals. The U.S. Government demands that  everyone disarm, but it has not touched and does not seem as if  it will touch a single one of its intercontinental missiles with  their dreadful multiple-target nuclear warheads and its  terrifying chemical and biological warfare labs, where  catastrophic accidents could happen at any time, unleashing a  carnival of death and destruction on the planet.    No one, however, has even mentioned the possibility of the  United States' agreeing to disarm, let alone that it be punished  for this or any other reason. The United States has the same  legal status as all other countries, and within the context of  international law it has the same duties and rights. Why then,  is the United States above any international authority? Why has  no thought even been given to imposing sanctions on the United  States for any of the misdeeds it has traditionally perpetrated  against other countries?    It is obvious that international law has nothing to do with  that powerful state, which can request and implement sanctions,  (?express its views), make demands, level charges, and summon or  recriminate other governments, but does not allow anyone to even  disagree with its plans. With what moral authority do U.S.  leaders talk about democracy, law, [word indistinct] and justice  when they are not capable of submitting to the views and rights  of others?    The DPRK has every right to work scientifically for the  peaceful use of nuclear energy, as any other state should. The  DPRK Government has proven that it is not a warmongering country  and that it does not pose a threat to peace and stability in  Asia, as is proclaimed by the Western propaganda media, which  are dominated or influenced by the United States.    The international community need not attack the DPRK because  its government refuses to please Washington or submit to its  demands through international institutions. If the United  States had treated the DPRK respectfully, as the sovereign state  that it is, if it had been fair and egalitarian in its  international relations, it would have gotten a lot more and,  especially, it would have earned respect it will never be able  to claim by force.</p>

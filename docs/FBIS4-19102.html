			<p>BFN     [Text] In Paris this afternoon, Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe gave an explanation to deputies about the situation in  Bosnia.    [Begin Juppe recording] First, of course, we have to put an  end to the Serb offensive against Gorazde, without delay and  without conditions. This resolution must not waver. Of course,  France, which is part of the air support contingent, will face  up to all its responsibilities as far as this is concerned.    But equally, in order to prevent a potentially never-ending  escalation, we have to set precise political aims for our action  in Gorazde, starting with an immediate cease-fire, and, second,  the deployment of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] on the  ground to act as a buffer between the communities. We are  contemplating the possibility of a Security Council resolution  to this end. [end recording]</p>

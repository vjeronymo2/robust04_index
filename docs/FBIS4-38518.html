			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 30, RIA -- "The situation in the Crimea,  particularly in Simferopol, is outwardly calm, although the  internal tension persists," a RIA correspondent was told by  Pyotr Chernyatevich, Crimean president's advisor in a telephone  interview.    In his words, the situation was critically destabilised by a  recent statement by Nikolay Mikhalchenko, aide to the Ukrainian  president, who said that Leonid Kravchuk is currently  considering introduction of direct presidential rule not only in  the Crimea but on the entire territory of Ukraine.    Tomorrow is the last day of the deadline set by Kiev for the  Crimean Supreme Soviet to reject the Constitution of 1992. To  date, noted Mr. Chernyatevich, the working group of the  Ukrainian Supreme Soviet, which is scheduled to settle the most  acute problems together with their Crimean counterparts, has not  yet arrived in the Crimea. Stability in the Crimea is  continuedly hampered by the fact that all first deputies of the  Ukrainian power ministries remain on the peninsula. To cap it,  the Ukrainian armed forces started moving again this morning,  said Pyotr Chernyatevich, who saw in person a column of armoured  personnel carriers moving to Sevastopol. He failed to identify  whom they belonged to and what was their destination.    In all appearance, these were combat vehicles of the  Ukrainian National Guard, since the commanders of the 32nd  Ukrainian Army Corps vehemently deny their involvement with any  moves of personnel or hardware, emphasised Mr. Chernyatevich.</p>

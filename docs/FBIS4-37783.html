			<p>BFN     [Text] The YI'UD [Independent and Democratic Israel]  party's council has given its backing to negotiations with Labor  to enter the coalition. Any agreement will be brought before  the council.    Meanwhile, Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan said he believes that  there will be legal complications with YI'UD joining the  coalition. He said he was not sure whether Gonen Segev could  serve as a minister or Alex Goldfarb as a deputy minister. A  Qol Yisra'el reporter says the attorney general believes there  is no legal problem with Gonen Segev serving as a minister,  while the prime minister's legal adviser believes there is no  possibility of appointing someone from a breakaway faction to  the post of minister.</p>

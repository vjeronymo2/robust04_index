In a statement issued by the Egyutteles Parliamentary Group  and given to CTK today, movement representatives said they  considered the constant questioning of the legitimacy of  parliament to be part of a dangerous scenario which could  develop into establishing an open dictatorship.    The opposition movement voices the view that the current  Slovak Government was incapable of stopping the economic fall of  society and of finding a way out of the accumulated tension. By  the lack of will to create a functioning government coalition  the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) could  create a permanent governmental and parliamentary crisis. The  government lacks a concept for the transformation of society and  a strategy of economic and social policy. That is why it is  resorting to ever more arrogant methods to maintain and  concentrate power, the statement says.</p>

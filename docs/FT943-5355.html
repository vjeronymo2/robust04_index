			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Crime prevention investment urged The enormous financial costs of crime make a convincing case for more investment in its prevention, says the national crime prevention organisation Crime Concern in a report today. Crime Concern points out that although crime was a significant drain on individual, public and corporate resources, little information was available about its impact in a number of economic sectors. The report was commissioned by the Thames Valley Partnership, which was set up last year to achieve a united approach to tackling crime in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. It says the full cost of crime is difficult to quantify because much of it is not reported to the police. But running the criminal justice system cost Pounds 9bn in 1991-92, while a CBI/Crime Concern working party estimated the loss to business to be between Pounds 5bn and Pounds 10bn a year. Recorded crime statistics showed that direct losses from burglary exceeded Pounds 1bn.</p>

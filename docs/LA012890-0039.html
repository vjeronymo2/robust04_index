			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'ANATOMY OF BULLET WOUND'  </P> <P> Required for all writers, directors, producers of TV Movies: "Anatomy of a  Bullet Wound" (Jan. 14).  </P> <P> The entertainment people glorify use of weapons -- e.g. Rambo, Dirty Harry,  "Death Wish" 1, 2 and 3, most Westerns.  </P> <P> No wonder firearms are popular with street thugs and gangs. Why? That's all  they see on the screen. Entertainment people are the first to decry private gun  ownership, to blame the National Rifle Assn., yet they glamorize weaponry.  </P> <P> A popular technique used for years in the entertainment industry is (depicting  someone being hit) on the head using rocks, pipes, guns, bottles. Few things  are more dangerous -- often lethal -- than a blow to the head. Your article  said: "The guy (on TV) gets hit in the head with club and he passes out. He  never retches, never vomits, never sees double, never goes into grand mal  seizures. . . all of which occurs with people who have been struck in the head  with blunt instruments. If they don't die."  </P> <P> Let the entertainment industry clean up its act, deemphasize weaponry and  deglorify personal mayhem. Maybe, just maybe, violence in our society will  decrease.  </P> <P> BYRON DILLON, Downey  </P></p>

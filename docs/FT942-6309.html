			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: Suez in property deal with Unibail Suez, the French financial and industrial holding company, is selling a large part of the property assets of its Compagnie Fonciere Internationale property subsidiary to Unibail, the property management group, for between FFr3.2bn and FFr4bn (Dollars 570m to Dollars 712m). The deal forms part of the long-term strategy of asset sales adopted by Suez, which has for the past two years been rationalising its labyrinthine web of interests and is expected within the next few weeks to finalise negotiations to sell Victoire, its insurance business. Suez said it expected to make a capital gain of between FFr1.5bn and FFr1.9bn on the CFI deal, which includes the sale of a number of commercial centres, offices and residential property developments. Yesterday's announcement followed months of talks with Unibail and other prospective purchasers. Mr Leon Bressler, chairman of Unibail, said the acquisition offered 'a rare opportunity' for his company to expand its commercial centre interests. Unibail will help finance the transaction with the proceeds of its recent FFr1.25bn convertible bond issue. 'For the past two years we've pursued a policy of investing in commercial centres, as it is an area of the French property market that has traditionally been neglected,' said Mr Bressler. 'It isn't very often that a large portfolio of commercial properties like this becomes available in France.' Unibail already has interests in a number of large commercial centres, notably in the Paris region. It has made several acquisitions in the field over the past two years, culminating late last year in its purchase of a number of retail properties from the Pinault-Printemps group. Meanwhile Suez, which over the past two years has raised FFr20bn from asset sales, is trying to conclude negotiations to sell Victoire, which is valued in its books at around FFr18bn. Victoire has been up for sale since last autumn when Suez ceded control of its German interests to Union des Assurances de Paris. Mr Gerard Worms, chairman, last month announced that Suez had received four offers for Victoire and that it would decide which to accept by the end of June. The potential purchasers are believed to include Italy's Generali, Commercial Union of the UK and AEG of the US. Suez yesterday said the Victoire talks were proceeding smoothly and that it was still on course to conclude the deal by the end of next month.</p>

Tomorrow, the rally arrives in Spain and the  stage ends in Granada. In the opinion of the Polisario Front,  not even the Moroccan Army will be able to eliminate the danger  posed by the mines on the Sahara's frontier with Mauritania.    [Madrid RNE-1 Radio Network in Spanish at 2316 GMT on 28  December added the following report: "For almost a month the  Polisario Front has been warning of the danger of the  Paris-Dakar-Paris rally passing through the Western Sahara.  While initially the organizers of the rally turned a deaf ear  to the warnings, and it was even said that there was no kind of  threat, stark reality has drawn their attention to what is no  longer either a threat or a warning, but rather a serious and  firm declaration that cannot be shrugged off, a declaration such  as that made in Granada by Tahar Sidi, spokesman for the  Polisario Front in Andalusia:    [Begin Sidi recording] The Polisario Front's stance is  clear.  In our opinion, it is a violation of the cease-fire. In our  opinion, it is a territory of the utmost risk and no one can  guarantee the security of the caravan of motorbikes, cars,  trucks, and hundreds and hundreds of people." [end recording]</p>

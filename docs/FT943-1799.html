			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / SIB chief seeks to avert row over pensions with life groups The City's chief regulator has begun a series of meetings with top life insurance executives in an attempt to head off a damaging public split between the industry and its watchdog over the sale of personal pensions. The move, by Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, comes ahead of the planned publication by the regulator late next month of a report on compensating people who have suffered from poor advice over transferring out of occupational pension schemes. The SIB will face public criticism if its plans do not provide full redress for everyone who may have lost out. But life companies want to focus only on cases where customers have clearly suffered, and do not want to give others a chance to change their earlier decisions. Mr Large is warning chief executives of some large life insurance companies that a high-profile clash between life insurers and the SIB about compensating victims of mis-selling would further damage the reputation of the industry. Figures from the Association of British Insurers have shown that sales of some products have already fallen this year and that public concern about pension sales is one of the causes. He is also pointing out that the launch this summer of the Personal Investment Authority, the watchdog set up to protect the retail investor, offers life companies the chance to make a fresh start in making customers feel confident about taking out policies. Among executives already seen by Mr Large is Mr Allan Bridgewater, group chief executive of Norwich Union, the mutual insurer, and currently chairman of the ABI. At the same time, Mr Large is seeking to reassure life companies that the SIB has taken into account the practicalities of carrying out a review of thousands of pension cases. One of the most serious concerns expressed by life companies has been about the many tens of thousands of pension cases they may have to review to identify customers who should be compensated. One possibility for addressing this is that if - as some life companies insist - the scale of mis-selling revealed by looking at the priority cases is relatively small, then the process for deciding which other cases are re-examined might be streamlined to cut down on administrative costs. As a way of dealing with compensation arrangements where the independent financial adviser who carried out the sale is no longer in business, the PIA is expected to set up a specialist pensions unit to identify cases where customers should be recompensed.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: Safeway posts Dollars 4.9m loss in first quarter SAFEWAY, the California-based supermarket group which was subject to a Dollars 4.2bn leveraged buy-out in 1986, yesterday reported an after-tax loss of Dollars 4.9m in the first quarter of 1992. The result underlines the increasingly tough competition being faced by US food retailers. Safeway's after-tax figure compares with a Dollars 26.7m profit in the same period a year earlier. Sales during the first quarter shrank slightly, from Dollars 3.4bn a year ago to Dollars 3.39bn, and operating profits were down from Dollars 122.8m to Dollars 102.4m. Interest expenses fell from Dollars 86.5m to Dollars 70.3m, leaving a profit before extraordinary items of Dollars 22.9m, compared with Dollars 26.7m in the same period a year earlier. Safeway then incurred a Dollars 27.8m extraordinary item related to the early repayment of debt, creating the after-tax deficit. The company said same-store sales had been slightly higher in the US, but declined 1.2 per cent overall. It blamed low level of food price inflation and heightened competition in certain markets for the lack of progress. Safeway shares slipped Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 14 1/2 at close of trading.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Kolokoltseva report under the "Hearings" rubric: </F> "Senators Recognize Tax System Imperfect. Federal Assembly To  Look at Finance Ministry Draft on Tougher Fiscal Policy"]    [Text] During the 23 April parliamentary hearings in the  Federation Council, Nikolay Gonchar, chairman of the Federation  Council Budget Committee, heard the experts' opinion and  proposed that the Finance Ministry's proposal on the complete  abolition or considerable reduction of the number of tax  privileges be supported. The hearings also made a decision to  get the Federal Assembly to examine this draft in September to  October 1994. It was proposed to enlist as experts Sergey  Glazyev, chairman of the State Duma Economic Policy Committee;  Vladimir Gusev, head of the tax service; and Dmitriy Lvov,  corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences, among others.    Participants in the hearings recognized that Russia's tax  system is imperfect. Tax service chief Sergey Almazov stated  that tax evasion "has taken on a mass nature" and the number of  court cases instituted does not reflect its real dimensions.  Vladimir Gusev in turn intimated that the nonpayment of taxes  into the budget had grown during the first quarter of 1994 by a  factor of 1.7 over the corresponding period in 1993. The State  Committee for Taxes is planning to discuss this problem at a  sitting of its collegium in the second quarter.    Aleksandr Bukin, head of the Finance Ministry tax  department,  was more sanguine. He still expects that the revenue part of  the budget will be completed as forecast.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour highlights local authority job losses NEARLY 38,000 job losses have been announced in local government in the past five months, Labour said yesterday as the local election campaign entered its final stage. Launching a Labour-commissioned study of local government job losses, Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said local authorities in every region of the country had been affected. According to the report, conducted by the Centre for Local Economic Strategies, a total of 6,000 job losses have been announced in Yorkshire and Humberside, with 5,500 in the east Midlands and 5,400 in greater London. More than 12,500 of the job losses are in county councils, which, the study says, have 'borne the brunt' of council cuts along with metropolitan authorities. With voters in 47 county councils in England and Wales due to go to the polls tomorrow, the Conservatives countered by saying that Tory policies provided high-quality services in councils across the country at the lowest price. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said voters should ask themselves who would keep their bills down over the next four years and who would 'strive ceaselessly' for value for money. In Northamptonshire, where Wellingborough district council recently set the country's lowest council tax, Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, said the assertion that Conservative councils cost you less and serve you better was 'not just a slogan - it's the truth'. The remarks were targeted at the central plank of Labour's campaign: that average council tax bills are Pounds 14 lower in Labour councils than their Tory counterparts.</p>

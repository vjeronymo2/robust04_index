			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] North Korea has recently attracted attention by  promoting a legal investment environment for foreign investment  through laws such as the `land lease law.' (No. 40 decided by  the standing committee of the Supreme People's Assembly)    North Korea seemed to use China as a model in making laws  for  international economic openness, for example, by adopting in  1984 the `joint management law.' This is patterned after the  Chinese `sino-foreign joint management law'. They also enacted  a `land lease law' by copying the Chinese `temporary ordinance  on the conveyance and reconveyance of the right to use  government-owned land in cities.' (19 May 1990)    That North Korea highly praised this land lease law,  announced through the government-owned Korean Central News  Agency on 4 November as an `epochal' event, is seen as promoting  foreign investment by advertising economic openness. This  allows foreign businessmen to lease land even though North Korea  (government) does not allow its people to do so and by  advertising the alignment of statutes to support the law. This  intention can be also seen in that this law was announced just  before the second workshop on the industrial natural resource  field for the Tumen River Area Development Project to be held in  Seoul. (November 8-10)    This law prescribes the scope of application (Article 2), to  corporations and individuals of `foreign countries' and also  includes fellow Koreans who reside `outside the territory of the  Republic' in a separate section. This prescription that may  cause disputes on how to interpret the law in relation to South  Korean corporations and businessmen, and it attracts attention  on how North Korea would interpret the laws.  <H5>  The Conveyance and Collateral of Land Utilization Right </H5>   Land use rights obtained by lease contracts are prescribed  as  `property rights' and could be conveyed (by sale, sublease,  gift, or inheritance) or could be collateral as long as the  lease is effective. (Articles 15-27) The law appears to be  decided from consideration for fast turnover and transactions of  property rights, but the `sale' of use rights is an unfamiliar  concept under a democratic legal system. In the sale of use  rights, it seems to be difficult to convey them because the law  recognizes the preferential purchasing rights (Article 19) of  the `leasing institute, disallowing the lessee to transfer  freely the utilization right, and makes the change of the  business type impossible by requiring that the right be used  under the same initial purpose.    In the meantime, two different opinions were proposed on the  possibility of applying this law to South Korean corporations  (and businessmen).    One suggests the fact that this law prescribed `fellow  Koreans who reside outside the Republic territory' as within the  scope of application means that North Korea intends to include  South Korean corporations. This opinion is based on the fact  that this law has a different scope of application from the  `Joint Management Law' (1984). `The Joint Management Law' is  limited to `fellow Koreans who reside outside the Korean  peninsula' including businessmen in Japan, and clearly excludes  South Korean industries. This interpretation is also based upon  the theory that South Korean businessmen are included in `fellow  Koreans who reside outside the Republic territory' by pointing  out that North Korea recognized the range of its sovereignty to  the north of the truce line in the seventh Japanese-North Korea  amity meeting. (December 1991)    The other opinion stems from the fact that `the territory of  the Republic' means the entire Korean peninsula because North  Korea has insisted on the `One Korea' policy until now.  Accordingly, South Korean industries (and businessmen) are  excluded from the scope of `fellow Koreans who reside outside  the territory.'    China had enacted `a regulation that promotes fellow  Taiwanese investment (in China)' and had made clear that fellow  Taiwanese can be partners in joint management.    Some North Korean officials, including Vice Premier Kim  Tal-hyon, hoped several times that South Korean industries would  invest in North Korea, and it was reported that Hwang Chong-nam  (chief of the External Economic Cooperation Promotion  Committee), who participated in the UNDP Industry workshop, said  that he hoped South Korean industries would participate in the  construction of industrial complexes and direct investment in  the free economic and trade zone. It seems to be desperate  countermeasure tactics that North Korea has prescribed `the  fellow Koreans who reside out of the Republic territory' in the  law to leave open the possibility that the law's applicability  could be extended to South Korean economic corporations while it  takes the `one Korea' policy in politics. In the Japanese-North  Korea amity meeting, the representative from North Korea still  kept the `one Korea' policy not only by suggesting the  assumption of the `one Korea' theory, even though he recognized  the territory of North Korea to the `north of the truce line,'  but also by separating the South Korean government authority  from businessmen.    North Korea needs to make a prompt decision to withdraw the  `one Korea' policy as soon as possible in that the advance of  South Korean businessmen to North Korea can not be accomplished  smoothly in relation to the legal investment environment--such  as the `land lease law'--if North Korea keeps this kind of dual  stand.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] After the decision by the political class to set up  a single chamber parliament based on the head of state's  decision to allow the political class to reach a consensus on  ending the dual parliamentarian institutions as well as other  institutions of the Republic, the former High Council of the  Republic [HCR] established by the Sovereign National Conference,  has just agreed to endorse this new institution that will  include all former deputies, former HCR members, and former  advisors. During a special HCR session at the People's Palace,  which was attended by 368 members, 223 voted for the decision  while 80 voted against and 60 abstained.    As we can see, the political will expressed during the  negotiations has finally prevailed and each participant has  expressed his accord in line with his own views, sometimes with  different words or different procedures. The main thing,  however, is that the people have now understood and that the  entire political class is driven by a single ideal, that of  putting an end to dual Republican institutions, which is a happy  prelude to fair and free elections.</p>

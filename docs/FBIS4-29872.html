			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  said Wednesday that the yen's sharp rise against the U.S. dollar  stemmed from speculative buying.    "The yen's appreciation is speculative," the premier told  reporters in the Diet building and predicted the speculative  mood will not last long.    Hata called an emergency meeting of key cabinet ministers at  noon on Tuesday to exchange views on the Japanese currency's  surge.    Attending the meeting were Hata, Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii, International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata,  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, Economic Planning Agency  Director General Yoshio Terasawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary  Hiroshi Kumagai.    "I think it's important for the cabinet to grasp the  situation properly," Kumagai told a news conference.    The top government spokesman said the government should take  necessary measures to spur domestic demand and boost the  nation's sluggish economy so as to stem the yen's rise against  the dollar.    The dollar opened at a postwar low of 100.35 yen in Tokyo on  Wednesday, down 1.80 yen from Tuesday's closing rate of 102.15  yen.    The dollar's opening plunge against the yen followed its  overnight nosedive in New York, where the currency temporarily  hit a postwar low of 99.85-95 yen on reports of a widened U.S.  trade deficit for April.    The dollar's previous global low was 100.40 yen recorded in  Tokyo on Aug. 17, 1993.    The U.S. currency ended New York trading at 100.10-20 yen,  regaining the 100 yen level on technical buying amid fears of  central bank intervention.</p>

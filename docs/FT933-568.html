			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: TSB advances Banking group TSB moved ahead 6 to 217p, as volume rose to 6.7m, after two brokers upgraded profits expectations, a move which boosted sentiment in the sector as a whole. Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, and SG Warburg raised forecasts following a meeting with the board last Friday. Lehman increased its forecasts by Pounds 30m to Pounds 260m for this year and by Pounds 15m to Pounds 440m for the following year; while Warburg is now predicting that TSB will make Pounds 280m this year, against its previous projection of around Pounds 245m. Speculation that TSB had at last found a buyer for Hill Samuel, its merchant banking arm, was again heard. The positive mood on TSB, together with the strong market trend, helped other stocks in the sector. Barclays hardened 2 to 506p, while Lloyds appreciated 9 to 566p. Royal Bank of Scotland gained 6 at 313p. A squeeze in Forte sent the shares smartly forward to close 11 ahead at 240p. Leisure specialists said there was also a relief factor following weekend press reports that the group is unlikely to make a long-rumoured rights issue with its results tomorrow. Turnover was 1.9m. Presentations to analysts by Hazlewood Foods prompted a raft of slim downgrades, the shares reacting badly and finishing 8 off at 175p. BZW cut its profits forecast to March 1994 to Pounds 57.5m, with Smith New Court trimming to Pounds 59m. Analysts attributed the downgrades to general dull trading. Rumours of a more positive attitude towards Northern Foods after last week's downgrades left the shares 7 better at 257p. Food retailers rallied after last week's mauling which followed Tesco's results, some in the market believing the falls to be overdone. Tesco firmed 2 to 204p and J. Sainsbury 6 to 434p. Confirmation that Severn Trent is to lose its chairman in a board shake-up left the stock 7 lighter at 546p in a weak waters sector. A big seller of Boots set the stock back 4 to 479p. SG Warburg was said to be positive on Kingfisher, up 6 at 672p. Talk of continuing good sales at Marks and Spencer saw the shares add 3 at 379p. Hammerson was the odd stock out in a strong property sector as the shares reacted to dull results, the 'A' slipping 5 to 353p. Property specialists said that although the new management had started well, its hands were tied in a continuing difficult market. Land Securities climbed 6 to 678p and Great Portland Estates 7 to 211p. Engineering group Siebe gained 6 at 525p after both Kleinwort Benson and NatWest Securities came out with positive comments on the group. While saying it remained 'neutral' on the stock, NatWest said Siebe was one of the stocks that 'would do well in any year-end rally'. Positive weekend press comment, together with talk that a recent stock overhang had been cleared, saw shipbuilding and engineering group VSEL move up 9 to 857p. Brokers remained positive about British Steel, which ended 4 higher at 123 1/2 p on trade of 8.6m. In motors, GKN closed a penny down at 479p, with Kleinwort Benson said to have reduced current year profits expectations. Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel was back in favour with investors ahead of interim results due within a fortnight. The stock jumped 18 to 508p. Favourable sentiment in Mersey Docks following its recent acquisition of Medway Port continued to lift the shares, which added 9 at 388p. Bargain hunters were seen for P&amp;O shares, which have been underperforming since the group's recent disappointing figures. They put on 14 at 575p. Dealers said container rental group Tiphook remained friendless in an otherwise strong market, losing 7 at 257p. Shares in Prudential Corporation were boosted by a recommendation from SG Warburg and finished 7 ahead at 346p after trade of 1.8m. Steel Burrill Jones continued to languish after its recent poor set of figures, the shares receding a further 15 to 123p. A profits warning and the passing of the dividend from Andrew Sykes saw the shares tumble 30 to 75p. Reuters finished 6 stronger at 1538p, with sentiment boosted by news that the London International Financial Futures Exchange is to resume talks on joining Globex, the round the clock futures trad-ing system co-developed by Reuters. Dealers expect the shares to continue moving forward today following a presentation of the Dealing 2,000 system at Henderson Crosthwaite to institutional clients.</p>

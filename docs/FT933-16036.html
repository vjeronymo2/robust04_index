			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Hanging on by a thread: Tariff barriers and low foreign labour costs are driving Japanese textile production offshore When Toray, Japan's biggest textiles company, opens a Pounds 50m factory in the UK tomorrow there will be the usual ribbon-cutting and rice wine. But behind the razzmatazz lies a deep pessimism in the industry. Like many leading western industrialised countries, Japan has seen the production of textiles and clothing drift to countries with lower wages elsewhere in Asia. Unlike its western counterparts, however, the Japanese government seems unwilling to protect domestic companies with trade barriers against imports. An executive at Teijin, Japan's second-largest synthetic fibre textiles company, blames the lack of domestic protection on the US and the EC, both of which are pressing Japan to cut its trade surplus, set to reach Dollars 150bn this year. 'The government has problems with the trade surplus. We believe that the (domestic) textile and clothing industries will be sacrificed,' he said. But Japan's textiles companies are not prepared to be martyrs in the trade war. Unable to beat the importers on home territory, they are engaged in an unprecedented diversion of investment abroad. Overseas, they can take advantage of a combination of lower labour costs, lower transport costs to local customers and access to local markets that have import tariffs. Toray is typical of the new strategy. Sales from its domestic plants are worth about Dollars 3bn a year, three times as much as those from overseas plants. Over the next seven years, however, it plans to treble foreign production while maintaining domestic output at its current level. The UK plant is one of the several overseas ventures it has established to promote this process. Toray says it chose Britain because of the presence of one of its best customers: Marks and Spencer, the UK's largest clothes retailer. The plant will supply silk-like polyester fabrics to garment makers that supply M and S. The fabric produced by the plant is unique in the UK. The yarn is twisted in different ways during weaving to create a variety of textures. Demand for such fabrics in the UK is currently satisfied by imports: Japan exported polyester fabric worth Pounds 42m to the UK last year. Britain is not alone in Europe in winning inward investment from Japanese textiles companies. France's largest textile company, DMC, has signed a joint venture with Japan's fourth-biggest textiles company, Unitika, for the production and marketing of polyester fabrics near Grenoble. Production started this spring, and sales are projected to reach about Dollars 70m a year by the mid-1990s. At the same time, Unitika plans to cut output at its main Japanese cotton-spinning plant by half by next March as part of its winding down of domestic production. Despite recent commitments in the EC, the overwhelming bulk of Japanese investment is going to neighbouring Asian countries, principally Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and China. In common with European countries, they have developed garment industries that use imported Japanese textiles - but labour costs are significantly cheaper. The biggest names in Japan's textiles industry are involved: Toray has factories in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia and a joint venture in China. Teijin is reducing polyester output in Japan this year at the same time as investing Y25bn (Dollars 233.64m) in Indonesia and Thailand. Its Indonesian output is scheduled almost to double between 1991 and 1994. It also has factories in the Philippines, Thailand and Brazil. Last summer, Toyobo established its fourth cloth-manufacturing joint venture in Malaysia. This year, it is cutting Japanese output by 20 per cent by suspending production at 10 of its factories for between four and eight days. Kanebo is closing three of its five domestic cotton spinning and weaving mills this year. It may transfer its entire spinning and weaving operation overseas and is looking at China, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. Kuraray manufactures in Indonesia, as does Osaka's Mitsubishi Rayon, which is planning to expand in Thailand and the Philippines. The switch by Japanese textile makers from domestic production to overseas investment is seen in output figures from the International Textile Manufacturers Institute. The institute says textile production in Japan has fallen by 16 per cent in the past year. A further shrinking of Japan's domestic textile and clothing industries, as Teijin fears, would represent an extraordinary turnaround in the fortunes of what was once a classic export-driven Japanese industrial success story. In 1957, Toray and Teijin licensed a polyester fibre-manufacturing process from ICI. Within 20 years, Japan's manufacturing strength had triggered import controls by western countries in the form of the multi-fibre arrangement (MFA) which placed quotas on incoming textiles and apparel. In the early 1980s, ICI withdrew from polyester making. But during the decade rising Japanese prosperity began to add to labour costs, and textiles from the rest of Asia started to pour in. During the late 1980s, Japanese consumers also developed a taste for designer clothes and fabrics from Europe and the US. Without tariff barriers to protect it, and sandwiched between cheap Asian products and western designer labels, the Japanese market succumbed to a flood of imports. In the course of the 1980s, textile and clothing exports halved as a percentage of total exports. As recently as 1986, Japanese textiles and clothing ran a trade surplus. By 1991, the surplus had become an Dollars 8bn deficit, the third-biggest in the world, overtaking that of the UK. In textiles, South Korea, Taiwan and China have each outstripped Japan in synthetic fibre output, as the value of imports into Japan more than doubled during the 1980s to Dollars 4.1bn. In clothing, similar imports grew sixfold to Dollars 8.7bn during the 1980s and clothes made abroad are now the norm. In response, Japanese textiles and clothing companies are pressing the government to erect import barriers, but to little avail. 'We want the government to limit imports. But they are hesitating,' says Mr Nobuo Murakami, managing director of Kurabo, a large Osaka yarn and fabric maker. 'Personally, and in the industry as a whole, we are very dissatisfied with the government.' Mr Murakami has a lot to complain about. Kurabo specialises in cotton goods, a business that is hurting from increased imports more than synthetics: the manufacturing equipment is cheaper, and the skills and technology needed is simpler, so developing countries can more easily compete with industrialised rivals. Japan's cotton-spinning capacity, for example, has fallen by a quarter since the mid-1980s and will halve over the next few years, says Mr Murakami. More than half the present 54 companies producing cotton in Japan will merge with rivals or go bust 'soon', he says. Even this projection might be optimistic. One textile industry observer at a Tokyo stockbroker said: 'I don't see why cotton spinning in Japan should survive at all.' Mr Murakami draws a parallel with what happened in postwar Britain: Manchester, the capital of Britain's industrial north-west, was once known as King Cotton. Today, no large mills remain. 'We are like Manchester was,' he said. 'Under the hammer.' Two avenues offer some hope for the future: high fashion and high technology. As in the west, there is a small but prestigious business in high fashion garment making. Volumes are relatively small, less than 5 per cent of total garment sales, but margins are high. A few foreign investors have started to produce in Japan: Paul Smith, the UK menswear designer, manufacturers in 30 Japanese factories for its 78 Japanese shops. High technology can also help Japan's synthetics manufacturers. They have invested heavily in research and development to create fabrics that, so far, cannot be copied elsewhere. The latest microfibre fabrics, those with filaments finer than silk, have been credited with sparking a revival in the high fashion fortunes of polyester. Toray's main Japanese plant, at Mishima in the shadow of Mount Fuji, is working at full capacity on microfibres. But Japanese industrialists are aware that competitors will not let them retain their high-tech edge for long. 'Within 10-20 years, Korea and Taiwan will catch up,' admits Mr Hiroshi Maeda, managing director of Toray. 'We are not confident we will always be able to stay ahead of these countries.'</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Death of Nixon: Career to inspire both respect and unpopularity Richard Nixon, who died on Friday night, was the only US president forced to resign. To the end of his days he knew this single fact would be the outstanding feature of any account of his life. In consequence he spent the years after he left the White House in disgrace on August 9, 1974 in a protracted effort to rehabilitate his reputation. His purpose was to regain what political influence he could as an elder statesman. In this he was remarkably successful. Ruthless, and widely hated for it, he was nevertheless respected during much of his career, and most of all as he neared the end of his life. A genuine expert in foreign affairs, he was consulted by most of his successors at times of difficulty. He excelled in the nuances of cold war policy; his messy and bloody withdrawal of the US from the Vietnam war was perhaps the best that could be expected of a man of his character. The mood of Congress and the people at the time gave him little leeway. A man who became accustomed to seeing his life as a struggle against opposing forces, and whose political career was haunted by fear of failure, Richard Milhous Nixon was born of poor parents in Yorba Linda, California, and educated himself as a lawyer against considerable material odds. His political career began in 1946 when he unexpectedly carried California's 12th Congressional District for the Republicans, after accusing the incumbent of being soft on communism. It was a foretaste of the bitter campaign he was to pursue against Alger Hiss, a former State Department official under investigation by the Un-American Activities Committee, which first brought him national fame. To the end of his life, Nixon believed it was his handling of the Hiss case that first set the liberal establishment, and above all the media, against him. In his book, Six Crises, he spoke of 'a residue of hatred and hostility towards me . . . which remains even to this day.' Those words must have haunted him years later as the Washington Post and the New York Times relentlessly pursued their investigations of the Watergate break-in. In 1950, Nixon won a Senate seat in California after what many observers called 'the dirtiest campaign on record'. Again, he accused his opponent of being a semi-communist. Two years later, he was selected by Gen Dwight Eisenhower to be his vice-presidential running mate. As to campaigning style, Ike said, 'you take the low road, and I'll take the high road'. Nixon knew well how to fight low. Accused of personal misuse of campaign funds, he went on television, capturing an audience of 58m, the biggest yet of any broadcast. He denied the accusations, but admitted one gift, which he would not return. It was 'a little cocker spaniel dog' that 'our little girl - Tricia, the six-year-old - named ..Checkers.' This shameless appeal to emotion worked well. Messages to the Republican National Committee ran 350 to 1 in Nixon's favour. He used his eight years as as vice-president, and president of the Senate, to good advantage. By 1960 he was as knowledgeable about the details of US politics as that other great product of the upper house, Lyndon Johnson. He became familiar with every twist of policy, especially foreign affairs, an understanding of which he enhanced in close conversations with John Foster Dulles, and through constant trips abroad. He became the world's most celebrated anti-communist, at a time when such a stance was not universally popular. Overseas, his undoubted knowledge of events in most areas of the globe was a characteristic to be respected. In domestic political infighting, his chicanery with statistics, his sly innuendo, cynicism, and hypocrisy made him the most hated politician in America. Yet his solid conservatism, untainted by racial or religious bigotry, laid the foundations for his later capture of a large and respectable national constituency. In 1960, having served as Ike's loyal apprentice, he campaigned for the presidency, without his master's visible support, against John F Kennedy. He lost by a whisker. Historians will never cease to debate whether less questionable counting techniques in Texas and Illinois might have produced a different result, but Nixon had the sense to resist a prolonged period of inquiry and recrimination. Just 47 years old, his life then entered a dark phase, from which many believed it would never recover. His fortunes seemed to reach their nadir in 1962 when he failed to capture the Californian governorship, and his much vaunted political comeback collapsed in ruins. He had taken a beating from the media ever since the Hiss case 16 years earlier; now he allowed his feelings to tumble out. . . 'You won't have Dick Nixon to kick around any more,' he told reporters, 'because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference. . . Nixon joined the prestigious New York law firm of Mudge, Stern, Baldwin and Todd, where he made money, regained his self-confidence and kept his name before the public with a series of 'business trips' around the world. He stayed close to his family; there is no evidence of any scandal in his private life. He travelled widely in the US and campaigned actively for Senator Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election. He continued to work hard for the Republicans in 1966, and in 1968, calling in his accumulated IOUs, he was nominated for the presidency. He had thus outlived his reputation as a loser, partly by beating Governor Romney of Michigan and Governor Rockefeller of New York in the primaries. President Johnson, battered by anti-war protests, announced that he would not run again. Later that year, Nixon won by a narrow margin, causing him to remark ruefully to his defeated opponent, Hubert Humphrey, that he knew how it felt. So began the most controversial presidency of American history. He took over at a time of social discontent and frustration with the unpopular war in Vietnam. He succeeded in calming cities and universities, and extracting the country from south-east Asia on terms that did not send it pitching headlong into isolationism as many had predicted. Instead, with the aid of his talented adviser, Dr Henry Kissinger, he tried to set foreign policy on a new course, seeking better relations with Russia and China and a sounder world economic system. In time, these accomplishments may appear as a turning point, one that only a Republican with the stealth and intelligence to steal the opposition's clothing could have taken. At home, his accent on self-help and doubts about the high-spending social programmes of President Johnson were not challenged by his successors. If it was hard to defeat the populist Hubert Humphrey in 1968, victory over the amateurish radicalism of Senator George McGovern, his Democratic opponent for the presidency in 1972, was comparatively easy. Nixon's electoral margin in 1972 was overwhelming. Almost immediately, everything went sour. As the Water gate scandal unfolded, doubts that had been murmured in the past began to be shouted out loud. Long-standing suspicions about his personal integrity were discovered to have a foundation in fact as the full details of his financial dealings were revealed. His reputation for unscrupulousness was confirmed by talks of 'dirty tricks' and the activities of the White House 'plumbers.' When such disclosures were combined with his increasingly unconvincing efforts to vindicate himself, Richard Nixon was transformed in the public eye from a respected, if unpopular, leader, to one who seemed to have violated the confidence of the people and the standards of his office on a scale unparalleled in American history. (The venality of Kennedy and Johnson, who preceded him, was as yet unrevealed.) The final straw came when Nixon was forced to admit that he had lied continuously for two years. He had no alternative but to resign. President Gerald Ford, who took over the White House, brought an end to legal proceedings by pardoning him. More than two decades of efforts to rebuild his reputation followed. He travelled, wrote books, confessed error before the entire world, through a televised interview with David Frost. He came to be seen as history may regard him - unscrupulous, yes, but tough, decisive, disciplined, daring, evidently indestructible. He was, as all successful politicians must be, a consummate actor, untrusting and not to be trusted, but also highly intelligent. His self-set goal was peace through a balance of power or, better, containment of communism. Tricky Dicky he may have been in life; he is perhaps, better remembered as Richard resurgent.</p>

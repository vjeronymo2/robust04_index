			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zaida Pereira; from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast -- passages within quotation marks are recorded]    [Text] It is definite. Finance Minister Julio Sosa  Rodriguez will be questioned by the Chamber of Deputies plenary  at 1600 on Thursday. This decision was made by the Chamber of  Deputies after Deputy Ramon Guillermo Aveledo, head of the  Social Christian Party parliamentary faction, made the  respective proposal.    [Aveledo] "The position is to analyze the problem  responsibly  and seriously in order to contribute to solving the financial  crisis and to contribute to restoring confidence. That is why,  first, we will not state any position on a censure until we hear  the minister. He must appear before the Chamber of Deputies to  explain the government's policy and he must respond to questions  by the deputies so that we can reach an opinion on this subject."    Also, the questioning of Gustavo Roosen, presidential  commissioner for financial reforms, was requested. He was  harshly criticized by diverse deputies, including Social  Christian Party Deputy Luis Estefanelli.    [Estefanelli] "Dr. Gustavo Roosen has had, let us say, the  highest record of generating the flight of currency with the  remarks he has made. Every time he speaks, Mr. Roosen has  generated macroeconomic distortions in the system. We don't know  with what kind of intentions, whether it was good, bad, or  naivete. I must say that it is difficult to believe that a man  of his prestige would speak naively."    The proposal to question Roosen, however, has not been  approved. It could be voted on this Wednesday. For his part,  Luis Emilio Rendon, Democratic Action [AD] Party deputy,  expressed his party's political position on this.    [Rendon] "We have proposed the total removal of the economic  cabinet by President Caldera. We believe that, once the  financial and fiscal crisis of the country has been evaluated,  we must assess the efforts that have been carried out by the  economic cabinet. We think that we should not limit ourselves  only to censuring the finance minister, but should go even  further. The entire economic cabinet has turned in a negative  work effort, an insufficient balance in terms of the tasks  assigned to it. There are eight banking institutions that shut  down yesterday."    For Edgar Romero Nava, president of the Venezuelan  Federation  of Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry  [Fedecamaras], to request the resignation of the economic  cabinet is to bring on a crisis. The Fedecamaras president said  that everyone must be in agreement on economic matters, because  the country needs alternatives rather than criticism. He noted  that the censuring of the finance minister is political rather  than economic. He said it is essential to provide solutions and  this is what the political parties should strive to achieve.    [Romero] "I believe that we should all reach an agreement on  economic topics. Rather than broaching this in a negative  manner, why don't we sit down and make a concerted effort to all  get together to try enact the necessary laws. We have to reduce  ministries, we have to privatize, we have to review the social  security system. For instance, the United States has 12  secretariats, while we have 26 ministries. There are many things  that have to be done here. Let us see where we agree. Let us try  to inject the economic mechanisms into the country and boost  optimism among the Venezuelans."    Romero Navas announced that as of 17 July the 50th annual  Fedecamaras assembly will be held to analyze, among other  things, the government's economic package.</p>

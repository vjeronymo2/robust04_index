			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKEWOOD TO CURB NOISE IN JET TESTS;  </P> <P> REGULATIONS: THE ROAR FROM DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT'S ENGINE TESTS HAS ENGULFED THE  SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE CITY. THE FIRM SAYS IT COMPLIES WITH LONG BEACH'S NOISE  ORDINANCE.  </P> <P> The City Council Tuesday unanimously decided to draft a noise ordinance aimed  at curbing the roar from Douglas Aircraft's jet engine testing, which for years  has engulfed the southwest corner of the city.  </P> <P> "We feel there are ways to mitigate (the noise) that they are not doing just  because it is not convenient," Councilman Larry Van Nostran said after the  council meeting.  </P> <P> City officials said they do not know what provisions will be included in the  noise ordinance or when it will be completed by City Atty. John S. Todd.  However, they said, they are firm about wanting to force Douglas to protect the  neighborhood around the test site, at the north end of the Long Beach Airport  along Carson Street at the intersection of Paramount Boulevard.  </P> <P> Residents and business owners have complained about what they describe as  deafening noise pollution that causes blood pressure to soar and buildings to  vibrate whenever Douglas starts testing. At nearby Lakewood County Golf Course,  the testing position of the planes sends noise and exhaust directly over the  greens.  </P> <P> "If you're playing golf on that course, which I do," Van Nostran said, "that  noise is so deafening."  </P> <P> Donald N. Hanson, manager of public relations for Douglas, said it would be  "inappropriate" to comment on the City Council's action because he has no idea  what will be contained in the noise ordinance.  </P> <P> Hanson pointed out, however, that the company does comply with Long Beach's  noise ordinance, which allows Douglas to test engines between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m.  on weekdays. No testing is allowed before 9 a.m. on weekends.  </P> <P> Hanson also pointed out that aircraft engines today are quieter than in the  past. "We have done a lot as an industry and the engine-makers have done a lot  to produce quieter engines," he said. "That has been very effective."  </P> <P> Some city officials said they worry that Douglas will begin testing its newest  military plane, the C-17, and that its engines will be noisier than the  domestic passenger planes now tested.  </P> <P> Hanson said, however, that C-17 testing will be conducted elsewhere.  </P> <P> The Douglas plant sprawls at the runways of the Long Beach Airport. Built in  1940 as the nation was gearing up for World War II, the plant straddles the  border between Lakewood and Long Beach and employs about 35,000 people.  </P> <P> Most of the plant, which is in a peak production schedule with a backlog of  domestic and military aircraft orders to fill, lies within the Long Beach city  limits. However, the small parcel on which the engines are tested is within  Lakewood's municipal boundary.  </P> <P> "Long Beach gets all the money and Lakewood gets all the noise," Van Nostran  said.  </P> <P> In September, Lakewood hired a consultant, Thomas W. Fitzwater of Michael  Brandman Associates in Santa Ana, to recommend how Lakewood could make Douglas  a quieter neighbor. The consultant documented that the noise created by the  engine tests averages 10.6 decibels higher than normal background noise in the  neighborhood.  </P> <P> However, the council's decision to draft a noise ordinance goes beyond  recommendations that the consultant presented Tuesday night. His major  recommendation was that the city support a plan by the Long Beach Airport to  build a "hush house," a building in which airport operators, including Douglas,  could test engines.  </P> <P> Such a facility, which would have to be approved by the Long Beach City Council  during its budget deliberations next month, would cost $3.2 million. Most of  the money -- $2.5 million -- would come from the Federal Aviation  Administration, if the federal agency agrees that the new facility is needed.  </P> <P> The consultant recommended that both Lakewood and Signal Hill join with Long  Beach in lobbying the federal government for the money.  </P> <P> However, according to Chuck Ebner, Lakewood's community development and  planning director, it would be at least three years before a hush house could  be built.  </P> <P> "There's the potential for a new facility," Councilman Wayne Piercy said after  the council meeting, "but we have no assurance of when it's going to be done.  For the short term, we need to do whatever can be done. Long term, we support  construction of this hush house."  </P> <P> The council agreed to help Long Beach lobby the federal government for hush  house money.  </P> <P> In the meantime, before the facility is built, the consultant's report said,  the noise problem could be mitigated if Douglas would move its new planes out  to an engine run-up area in the center of the airport. The present test site is  alongside Carson Street, the only strip of land separating the test area from  the golf course and the rest of the neighborhood.  </P> <P> According to the consultant's report, the run-up area is large enough for  Douglas' new aircraft. If the company agreed to use the area, the report said,  noise from the engine tests would be reduced in the neighborhood from its  current high of 10.6 decibels above normal background noise to about 3 or 4  decibels above background noise.  </P> <P> "They don't have to test them in the place and the way they do," Piercy said.  "We want to work with them as good neighbors."  </P> <P> However, Piercy said, he and other city officials spoke with Douglas  representatives last year about the noise problem and were told that the  company did not want to use the run-up area because it was not convenient.  </P> <P> Piercy said city officials were "kind of surprised" to find that Douglas did  not take many steps to protect the surrounding areas from the noise. The  company had previously put up large concrete blast fences at the test site to  help deflect jet exhaust and sound.  </P> <P> The consultant noted, however, that the primary purpose of blast fences is to  screen off debris.  </P></p>

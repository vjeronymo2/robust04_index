			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kholodov report: "Generals Conquer Politics. </F> Appropriations Will Be Just Enough To Rename Something"]    [Text] Andrey Kozyrev will apparently soon have to make  way for other people on the international scene. Following an  active reform of the Armed Forces, the Defense Ministry risks  turning into a Foreign Ministry.    It seems that everyone at the military ministry is engaged  in  foreign policy. Colonel General Kondratyev, deputy defense  minister, is extinguishing "hot spots;" another deputy, Boris  Gromov, is responsible for communications with the CIS  countries. It is absolutely unclear who is handling army reform  at the ministry. Even the Military Organization and Reform  Administration is becoming the Military Policy Administration  starting 1 April, "switching over" to the analysis of the  NATO-proposed "Partnership for Peace" program. In addition,  there is the International Treaty Administration, which also  handles foreign policy matters.    People at the Defense Ministry have gotten used to renaming  things: some of its structures have thus been "reformed" five  or six times already within the past 18 months. For instance,  the Main Personnel Administration [MPA] has become the Main  Administration for the Training and Allocation of Personnel,  only to be renamed the MPA once again. To all appearances, it  is the renaming and cuts in the army, a process going on  independently of anyone, that all reform in the Armed Forces  will boil down to: the Defense Ministry has lost the battle for  the budget, having received only half of what it requested.  There is not enough money even to provide clothes for the  ministerial personnel and the General Staff -- the Defense  Ministry's warehouses are completely empty.    So, crying a lack of trench coats, trouser stripes, and  subordinates could not but give a boost to "the foreign policy  consciousness of the generals' masses."</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> In a Times story last Sunday about the Jack Dempsey-Tommy Gibbons fight in  Shelby, Mont., in 1923, it was pointed out that the purse split was $300,000  for Dempsey, $7,500 for Gibbons.  </P> <P> Actually, Gibbons wound up with much more than that, according to his son, Tom  Gibbons Jr., who writes:  </P> <P> "After the fight, Dad took me with him on the Pantages Theater (vaudeville)  tour for 20 weeks. He made $50,000 plus expenses -- in 1923 dollars.  </P> <P> "Dad was sheriff of Ramsey County, Minn., for 24 years. He was elected in 1935  because many were afraid of John Dillinger, the bank robber, and many other  crooks. But Dad could stand up to any of them."  </P></p>

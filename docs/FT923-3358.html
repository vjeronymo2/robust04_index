			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Tarmac to close four of its factories TARMAC, Britain's biggest construction and materials group, said yesterday it was closing four plants as well as cutting output of bricks by more than a third and production of concrete blocks by more than a tenth. The closures will lead to the loss of 300 jobs in addition to the 5,000 Tarmac has shed in the past 18 months. The mounting crisis in the construction industry was underlined yesterday by the decisions by two building groups, Evered Bardon and Lilley, to cut or cancel their interim dividends. Meanwhile, Environment Department figures issued yesterday showed a 5 per cent fall in construction output in Great Britain during the three months to the end of June compared with the corresponding period last year. The Building Employers' Confederation, the largest trade association in the industry, said the figures were disastrous for a sector that had already been in recession for at least three years. 'They would have been even worse but for an increase in public spending,' the confederation said. 'This shows how important it is that government should not reduce investment in construction in the autumn spending round.' The brick industry has suffered worse than most in the construction downturn because about 60 per cent of bricks are sold for housebuilding. The brick manufacturing workforce has fallen by 30 per cent since 1988 from 14,000 to fewer than 10,000. Nevertheless, the industry continues to suffer from serious overcapacity. More than 1.4bn unsold bricks, equivalent to six months' supply, were stockpiled by manufacturers at the end of July - enough to build 170,000 homes. Even after recent plant closures announced by Redland, Butterley and Tarmac, the industry will have the ability to manufacture 900m more bricks a year than it is selling, representing overcapacity of nearly a third. Mr Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac, said the closures were a response to an industry-wide affliction. He added: 'We do not expect to lose market share, and look to our competitors to follow this strong lead in reducing industry capacity in line with both current and foreseeable market demand.' The closure of four plants by the company will reduce its capacity from 270m to 170m a year. The plants are at Bothwell Park, Strathclyde; Campbell, Derbyshire; Severn Valley, Avon; and Kibblesworth, Tyne and Wear. The decision to close the plants comes seven months after Tarmac abandoned its attempt to merge its brick operations with Steetley. Steetley was eventually acquired by Redland, the country's second-largest brick manufacturer, which controls about 17 per cent of the British market.</p>

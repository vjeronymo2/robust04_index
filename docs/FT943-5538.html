			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / BAe chief sees more mergers to counter US threat: FT Conferences The European aerospace industry was warned yesterday that it will have to reduce its costs by about 40 per cent over the next few years and close down a significant number of surplus facilities to remain competitive, reports Paul Betts, Aerospace Correspondent. The warning, ahead of next week's Farnborough Air Show, came from Mr Dick Evans, chairman of British Aerospace, at a Financial Times aerospace conference. Mr Evans said more consolidation was inevitable in the European aerospace industry especially in the wake of the shake-up taking place in the US defence sector. In the commercial aircraft market, Mr Evans said, the European industry would eventually be polarised around the European Airbus consortium in the large airliner sector and another consortium in the smaller regional aircraft market. He also believed there would ultimately be only one significant defence producer in Europe, although consolidation in the sector would hinge on government polices because of their huge procurement power. 'We need a clear definition of strategy from governments if we are to go down the inevitable road towards greater consolidation,' he told the conference. Mr Evans said that in the regional aircraft market the most rational outcome would be a combination of UK, German and French aircraft activities into a grouping similar to the Airbus consortium. Although BAe has held extensive discussions over recent months with both Aerospatiale of France and Deutsche Aerospace, the German company controlling the Dutch Fokker regional aircraft manufacturer, the talks have so far failed to produce tangible results. Speculation had also been rife of a possible combination of BAe and the UK General Electric Company (GEC) to create a large UK defence contractor in the wake of the Lockheed-Martin Marietta defence merger in the US. However, it is understood there are no talks at this stage between BAe and GEC over the possibility of the companies forging a strategic link. The difficulties of forging cross-border defence mergers in Europe have also been highlighted by the slow pace of negotiations between BAe and Matra of France to combine their respective guided weapons activities. The negotiations have been dragging on for two years. Mr Arthur Zussman, president of Hughes Europe, told the conference that, if defence companies wanted to survive, they had to 'do something spectacular'. He said industry experts were forecasting that up to 80 per cent of the top 100 defence companies could disappear by the turn of the century. Although air travel was picking up and airlines were beginning to make money again, Mr Richard Turner, Rolls-Royce's marketing director and president of the Society of British Aerospace Companies, said the industry was not viable as currently structured. Mr Robert Dryden, executive vice-president of Boeing, the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer, said the company had committed itself to reducing its production cycle times by more than half in three years. 'The target is to have a six-month cycle time by the end of 1996 for the Boeing 737 and 757, and eight months for the 767 and 747 and eventually the new 777.'</p>

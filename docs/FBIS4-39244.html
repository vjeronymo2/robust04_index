			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 6 TASS -- Chechen opposition leader  Yaragi Mamodayev denounced Sunday's decision by the Chechen  government and parliament to ban former Russian parliament  chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov from the republic.    The decision also affects former Chechen communist leader  Doka Zavgayev.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Mamodayev said  that  "instead of seeking reconciliation, Dudayev's regime takes steps  causing the situation to worsen."    He also brushed off accusations of alleged involvement,  together with Russia, in preparations to remove Dzhokhar Dudayev  from power. "We do not want confrontation or opposition between  various parts of the Chechen population. We call for  reconciliation and political dialogue," he said.    Mamodayev stressed that the way out from the current crisis  is through a constructive dialogue and the soonest possible  economic reform.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COCAINE USE FOUND IN 18.2% OF N. Y. TRAFFIC DEATHS  </P> <P> A study of 643 people killed in New York City traffic accidents shows that  18.2% had used cocaine within 48 hours of the accident, researchers said  Thursday.  </P> <P> They said that of those 643, blood-alcohol and cocaine tests were available for  378 drivers, and 56% had used one or both.  </P> <P> "This will be a national problem," the lead researcher, Dr. Peter M. Marzuk,  said. "I think if you looked at driver fatalities in other large cities you  might find relatively comparable results."  </P> <P> Marzuk and his colleagues at Cornell University Medical College in New York  City and at the New York City medical examiner's office looked at records of  the 905 traffic fatalities of passengers or drivers from 1984 through 1987.  </P> <P> Appropriate autopsy findings were available for 643 of the traffic victims, and  18.2% showed evidence of cocaine use within 48 hours before the accident, the  researchers reported in today's Journal of the American Medical Assn.  </P> <P> Among the drivers -- 70% of the 643 -- the prevalence of cocaine use was 20%.  Of the drivers ages 16 to 45, the prevalence was 24.3%, the researchers wrote.  </P> <P> "That's high. That's the highest I've seen," said Steven Gust, a research  psychologist with the National Institute on Drug Abuse in Rockville, Md.  </P> <P> Previous studies had found prevalences ranging from 3% to 11%, he said, adding  that there are regional differences in cocaine use.  </P> <P> The authors cautioned that their findings do not prove that cocaine use caused  the accidents, but the study said that there are several reasons to suggest  that cocaine might compromise driving ability.  </P> <P> "Minutes after cocaine administration, users report feeling hyper-alert and  euphoric but can also report aggressiveness, irritability, psychotic  distortions and a tendency toward greater risk-taking," it said.  </P></p>

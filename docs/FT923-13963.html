			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / EC Court opens way for sale of cut-price UK books CUT-PRICE books could soon be widely available in Britain following a European Court ruling yesterday. Under the ruling, British booksellers will be allowed to reimport UK-published books from other European Community countries and sell them at a discount. Although the decision by the Court of First Instance, the lower EC judicial body, does not abolish Britain's 'net book' agreement (NBA), through which UK publishers set minimum retail prices for books, it could undermine it by allowing 'parallel imports' of British books to escape its restrictions. The court upheld a 1988 European Commission decision which forbade publishers from applying the NBA to sales of British books across EC frontiers. The ruling will have a particular bearing on Ireland, where imports of British books account for about 50 per cent of the market. Irish booksellers, previously subject to the British agreement, will now be allowed to cut the retail price of British books. But entrepreneurial book distributors will also be able to reimport books from Ireland - and other EC countries - into the UK, where booksellers could cut the 'minimum' price by up to half. The London-based Publishers Association, which represents most UK publishers and brought the case against the Commission, said yesterday it was considering an appeal to the European Court of Justice - the ultimate EC legal body - and would try to find ways to close the parallel import loophole. 'One of the first things we will be doing is discussing (with the Court and Commission) how that particular fiddle, if that's not too strong a word, could be frustrated,' the association said. But a spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, said: 'In general, the Commission upholds parallel imports as being good news for competition.' Supporters of the NBA are worried that if the agreement disintegrates, small booksellers will be driven out of business, and less popular books will either remain unpublished or be priced out of the market. Mr Terry Maher, an arch-critic of the NBA and chairman of Pentos, owners of Dillons bookshops which sells some books on a non-net basis, said the court's decision was 'devastating'. 'It sounds the death knell for the NBA . . . and I hope that this is quickly and graciously recognised by the Publishers Association,' he said. The association accepted it would have to modify the NBA, but believed this could be done by adding a codicil rather than redrawing the whole agreement. Irish booksellers said the ruling would not have an immediate effect on the market, but they were worried that eventually there would be less choice and fewer books on the shelves. 'We won't be able to stock the same range, and first-time writers will have a nil chance of being published,' said Ms Mary Fitzgerald, general manager of Waterstone's bookshop in Dublin.</p>

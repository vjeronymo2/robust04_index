			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: On your Marks for pensions Customers at Marks and Spencer will, from early next year, be able to buy pensions and life insurance as well as food and clothes. The UK's best-known retailer is to broaden its financial services - it already deals in unit trusts and charge cards - but says its financial advisers will be paid entirely via salary, not commission. The new service will be available at six stores initially, but the aim is that it should spread to around 50 during the year. ***** The public offer for the Kleinwort European Privatisation investment trust - the biggest UK launch yet of such a trust - was three times subscribed, so applications are being scaled back. The trust had set its maximum size at Pounds 500m, but meeting all applications in full would have increased it to more than Pounds 880m. Investors who applied for the minimum 2,000 shares will receive 700. Applicants seeking up to 2m shares will get about 31.45 per cent of that amount while applications for more than 2m will receive 31.45 per cent of the first 2m, and 25 per cent of amounts above that. Shares in the trust are partly-paid, with the remaining 50 per cent due on August 1. One warrant is being issued with every five shares. Interim certificates will be sent out on February 8, together with cheques for returned money. Dealings in the shares and warrants will start separately on February 9. The public offer for the similar Mercury European Privatisation trust closes on March 2. Its maximum size has been set at Pounds 575m, and Pounds 325m of that has been raised already through an institutional placing. Shares are to be fully paid, with one warrant for every five. ***** Guinness Flight is launching a unit trust specialising in global privatisations, the first of its kind. About 65 per cent of the Guinness Flight Global Privatisation trust will be invested in Europe, 25 per cent in the Far East and Australasia, and 10 per cent in other emerging markets such as South America. Andrew Couch, one of the managers, said companies owned by the state before being privatised tended to be asset-rich, have a large market share, and to be priced fairly cheaply because governments needed the sale to go well. Often, there were efficiency gains, particularly from reduced labour forces and the introduction of new technology. Initial charge for the fund will be 5 per cent, reduced to 3 per cent during the launch period of February 14 to March 4. Annual charge will be 1.25 per cent. The fund's holding of more than 50 per cent in European shares means it will be Pepable. Fees on the Pep are 2 per cent initial, 1.5 per cent annual, and a decreasing withdrawal charge of 3 per cent in the first year, 2 per cent in the second and 1 per cent in the third. ***** The second instalment on British Telecom partly-paid shares is about to fall due. Lloyds' registrars must receive cheques by February 24 so they can be cleared before the deadline of 3pm on March 1. The second instalment price is 140p a share except for those holding interim rights who qualify for the instalment discount. They will pay 130p on the first 1,000 shares. Investors who do not pay the second instalment on time may lose their right to the shares, together with any entitlement to dividends or incentives such as bonus shares. If the Treasury takes back the shares and sells them, defaulters may be entitled to a refund of 150p maximum a share. Shareholders who have not received a payment notice by Tuesday, February 8, or who have lost it, should telephone the Lloyds' help-line on 0903-503 733. ***** Alliance &amp; Leicester, Britain's fourth-largest building society, is to integrate personal customers of its Girobank subsidiary. But the only resulting novelty for Girobank's 1.4m personal customers will be a new logo  -GIRO - branding the services available to them. A &amp; L said Girobank customers would continue to have the same rates and services as they do now and could still use post offices and the Girobank telephone banking facilities. The society has acted already to cut any overlap in products. ***** If you have a Switch debit card, you could soon use it for a range of financial services such as buying travellers' cheques and foreign currency, share dealing - even paying utility and credit card bills. The organisation which runs Switch has ended its own rules against using the card for financial transactions, having been satisfied that security procedures are tough enough to prevent fraud.</p>

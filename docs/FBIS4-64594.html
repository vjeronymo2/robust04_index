			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Abel Matutes, European commissioner for </F> Transportation and Energy, by correspondent Jose Carlos Duque;  place and date not given]    [Text] Abel Matutes, 52, is the European commissioner  for Transportation and Energy. "I will serve in that capacity  until 18 April, the scheduled date of a Council of Ministers  meeting that is of fundamental importance to Spain. It is at  that meeting that the overall European plan for infrastructures  will be approved for the ports, airports, navigable waterways,  and so on...to be financed out of European funds." The former  senator, former deputy, and founder of the Baleares Liberal  Party...now heads the PP [People's Party] list for the European  elections and takes stock of the nearly nine years he has served  as a European minister. His conclusion: "I have gone to bat for  Spain a great deal in Europe."    [Duque] Are you going to leave the post of European  commissioner (European minister) of Transportation and Energy in  order to head the PP list for the European Parliament?    [Matutes] Yes. The Council of Ministers meeting scheduled  for  18 April will be my last. It will be decisive for Europe and  Spain because it will pass the overall European plan for  infrastructures: the ports, airports, navigable waterways, and  highways, putting Spain's projects in a position to be financed  by European funds. Although there is no incompatibility  whatsoever between my office as a commissioner and heading the  PP list for the European Parliament, I prefer to remove myself  in order to wage my campaign with complete freedom.    [Duque] You have been a European commissioner for nearly  nine  years, but what have you done for Spain in Europe?    [Matutes] I have always tried to pave the way for a soft,  painless arrival of Spanish businesses in the Community enabling  them to compete on good terms and ensuring that the framework  provided will facilitate that task. The understanding and trust  of the Spanish Government that I have enjoyed at all times have  been exemplary. I think that I have done my work conscientiously  and that it has been recognized, not only by the Spanish  Government, but by businessmen as well.... However, the great  battle of the Spanish economy will be won or lost depending on  whether or not it has good domestic policies. What will make us  able to compete on the big market is the framework of Spanish  fiscal policy, whether or not we promote savings and investment,  meaning whether we create jobs and competitiveness or penalize  such investments, whether or not we train good professionals and  specialists....    [Duque] And what is left for you to do as a European  commissioner if most of Spain's policy remains to be carried out?    [Matutes] There is a common area that increasingly affects  all of our lives, the policy on infrastructures, for example.  All of the projects now under way will be 80 to 90 percent  cofinanced out of European funds. In addition, agricultural  policy is dictated by Europe, as is the common transportation  policy, the environmental policy. VAT [value-added tax] rates  are also decided in Europe.... Just imagine how important that  is!    [Duque] What have you gained as a European commissioner?    [Matutes] These nine years have been years of very hard  work,  years when I have put in 14 or 15 hours a day on the average,  here in and abroad, on plans almost constantly. However, at the  same time, the work has been a thrilling challenge for me and a  very gratifying task insofar as I have been able to carry out  important missions for my country and Europe. During my first  term as a commissioner, I was entrusted with the task of  handling Credit and Investments, the Development of Financial  Engineering, Policy for the PYMES. I managed to get a favorable  policy for small and medium-size enterprises. At the same time,  I launched the ECU [European currency unit] on markets  throughout the world, in New York and Tokyo in particular....  During my second term, as the commissioner responsible for  Mediterranean Policy and North-South and Latin American  Relations, I achieved closer bonds with Latin America--which was  very low on the list of priorities--and strengthened ties with  neighboring countries, which are of prime importance for Spain.  Now, as commissioner of Transportation and Energy, I have  carried out the overall European infrastructure and transport  plans so essential to Spain. I am also completing the directive  for gas and electricity that will make it possible to integrate  those markets into a single European market, that of the Twelve.    [Duque] What does this mean in practical terms?    [Matutes] A drop in the price of gas and electricity.    [Duque] You will make it possible for the price of gas and  electricity to go down?    [Matutes] Yes. We are going to do so by introducing  competition into markets that are now national and governed by  monopolies and oligopolies. We are going to introduce free  competition on a Community scale.    [Duque] And do you think the average citizen will understand  this?    [Matutes] We often experience the problem that what is done  in Europe is done by governments and not sufficiently explained  to the citizens, but everyone realizes the importance of  introducing competition between companies operating in these  sectors. It will result in a drop in prices.    [Duque] That is fine, but what will a European minister tell  farmers who feel they have been deceived, hurt, and mistreated  by Europe?    [Matutes] They do feel mistreated and rightly so. For many  years, farmers were very well treated by the Community even  though they endured the protectionism of the EEC. Then, at the  precise time that Spain joined the EC, due to international  pressures aimed at a liberalization of farm markets and budget  austerity, the farmers had to endure the consequences of opening  the Community to outside markets and have less aid.... They are  having a hard time of it, but so are all European farmers. And  if we had to make a scale, I would say that all those who  enjoyed the most protection, the farmers in the north and on the  continent, are having the hardest time of all. I mean those who  grow grain and oil-yielding plants, along with many livestock  breeders. In contrast, those growing fruit and produce will not  be so badly hurt.    [Duque] That is true, but how will you explain it to them?  Is  it not a fact that Europe has a debt to most Spanish farmers?    [Matutes] Europe does indeed have a debt to those Spanish  farmers who have not benefited from the policy of "common  splendor"; that is a fact. We have to tell them that in the  Community, we will have to make an effort to support their  income. Without the farmers, Europe would not be this model of  political and social stability.    [Duque] What will your election program aimed at beating the  PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] be based on?    [Matutes] On a common platform passed by the European  People's Party meeting in Brussels on 8 and 9 December and  attended by Kohl, Lubber, and Aznar...the main European leaders.  It is a program of the European center right with a Spanish  "appendix" that seeks a better and more effective defense of  Spain's vital interests in Europe. It is based on improving  infrastructures, with solid economic aid...in a more active,  more dynamic Europe, with greater participation by businesses  and society...in a less bureaucratic, less interventionist  Europe, a Europe that is less expensive and that has fewer  taxes. These are the center-right programs of the governments in  the Community's most advanced countries, all except Greece and  Spain.    [Duque] Is the PP staking its future on these elections? It  is said that if you beat the PSOE, you could force them to move  up the general elections.    [Matutes] The PP now represents hope for millions of  Spaniards. A victory would be a confirmation of that hope and  trust which the PP awakens in society. Now then, this does not  mean that a victory by us in those European elections will imply  that we are asking that the general elections be moved up.  However, it will mean a confirmation of a serious, responsible,  competent alternative that can take over the reins of this  country and lead it down the path of recovery.    [Duque] And if you lose, will it be the end of Aznar, as the  Socialists are saying?    [Matutes] That is not part of our plans. Of course it will  not be the end of Aznar. He is not the one running, but the  pre-election polls show us winning....    [Duque] Fine. Aznar is not running, but the PP is, even if  it  is headed by you....    [Matutes] If we should lose, we would suffer the  consequences  of the errors we have made.    [Duque] Certain regional parties like the PAR [Aragon  Regionalist Party], which could support the PP in Europe, have  united behind a common candidate.... Will that take votes away  from the PP?    [Matutes] I do not see why a coalition of regional forces  with frequently conflicting interests would better defend the  interests of that region than a group of European deputies from  the same region who are on PP lists. I do not see the  improvement. Regional interests will be better defended by  people from the PP. For example, it was I who was behind the  approval of the Somport tunnel linking the Autonomous Community  of Aragon with France through the Pyrenees, as a project of  Community interest.    [Duque] Fine, but tell me what you have done for the  Autonomous Communities of Spain in Europe, one by one....    [Matutes] Fine! I have already told you about Aragon. In  Baleares, which does not have access to FEDER [European Regional  Development Fund (of the EEC)] funds because its per capita is  above the Community average, we succeeded in getting 5B funds  for farmers in the entire region. We also passed improvements  for the Ibiza, Mallorca, and Menorca airports.... In addition,  60 to 70 percent of the funds used for port improvements will  come from the Community....    [Duque] And what have you done for the Canary Islands?    [Matutes] For the Canary Islands, we passed the common  market  organization for bananas, protection for tomatoes from winter  imports, and aid for infrastructures.    [Duque] And for the Basque Country?    [Matutes] For the Basque Country, I obtained structural  funds  to finance conversions and fought very hard in the Commission  when the plan to reorganize the Spanish iron-and-steel industry  tried to take the little Sestao steel plant away from us,  leaving us without a single kilo of Basque steel....    [Duque] What about Asturias?    [Matutes] I have just passed the coal assistance code that  will enable coal mining to continue to receive enough aid to  make it to the year 2004, which is when the CECA [Economic Coal  and Steel Community] Treaty will have to be revised.... I have  not neglected a single Community and I could make a list. For  nearly nine years now, there have been many projects for which I  have fought and worked hard for the regions of Spain....    [Duque] What about Castille-Leon?    [Matutes] We managed to get FEDER funds for infrastructure  projects such as highways and helped protect cynegetic species.    [Duque] What about Fraga's Galicia?    [Matutes] It has benefited from all Community funds for  improving infrastructures.... I have worked to open up talks  with third countries so that Galician fishermen could conserve  and build up fishing grounds. We are now fighting to see that  cattlemen are not hurt by milk quotas throughout the northern  corner....    [Duque] And Andalusia, which will also hold autonomous  elections on 12 June?    [Matutes] I have supported all infrastructures built. The  famous highways, the Despenaperros Pass, were built with  European aid....    [Duque]] And what did you do for Madrid?    [Matutes] Well, since income is high there, it does not have  access to FEDER funds, but we did obtain it for the surrounding  belt of industrial towns....    [Duque] And Castille-La Mancha?    [Matutes] The same is true. Highways and infrastructure  projects were financed. The AVE, which benefits that region and  Andalusia as well, was built with Community financing....    [Duque] What about Valencia?    [Matutes] Like the Canary Islands, it continues to receive  FEDER funds despite its high income. Those funds were renewed  and certain fruit and produce schedules were extended to winter  periods....    [Duque] And Murcia?    [Matutes] The same is true. It receives structural funds,  funds for highways.    [Duque] And Catalonia?    [Matutes] We gave it aid from FEDER funds and it will soon  have the AVE connecting it with the center of Spain and the rest  of Europe....    [Duque] What about Extremadura?    [Matutes] There are the FEDER funds to improve the  infrastructure and the reforestation plan....    [Duque] La Rioja?    [Matutes] It also gets FEDER funds, help for wine....    [Duque] And Navarre?    [Matutes] The connection with France and the Community via a  direct highway, without going through Velate....    [Duque] And what about Cantabria? What have you done for  that  autonomous community that has become poorer with the EC, like  many other communities?    [Matutes] Cantabria has the same problem as Galicia and  Asturias, with the surtax on milk production. That is because of  the poor information which the government provided at the time  about real milk production and we are now paying the  consequences. However, we hope to rectify the situation, improve  its highways....</p>

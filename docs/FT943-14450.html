			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Sharp increase in activity helps Savills rise to Pounds 3.24m A sharp increase in activity in both the commercial and residential property markets last year helped pre-tax profits at Savills, the estate agent and surveyor, to more than double. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 3.24m (Pounds 1.44m) for the year to April 30 on an increase in turnover of only 26 per cent to Pounds 31.9m (Pounds 25.3m). The shares closed 2p higher at 83p. Mr George Inge, chairman, said: 'There seems to be some uncertainty within the financial markets generally, which may impact on investor sentiment, but so far has had little effect on our residential side.' The commercial division saw a 25 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 13.4m producing an 82 per cent rise in operating profit to Pounds 1.49m (Pounds 819,000). The investment team had a record year, and was involved in transactions worth Pounds 600m. Savills also benefited from the management contract for the Canary Wharf administrators. However, Mr Inge warned that it would be difficult for the division to exceed last year's earnings. The agricultural and residential division reported operating profits up by 2.5 times to Pounds 1.19m, on a 23 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 17.9m, helped by a sharp recovery in luxury residential prices. Savills sold Pounds 425m of residential property during the period, a Pounds 100m increase from 1993. Mr Inge said that foreign purchasers had accounted for 40 per cent of its London residential sales. The company also benefited from a nine month contribution from its new finance arm, which made profits before interest and tax of Pounds 221,000. Mr Inge said this would be an important area of growth. Savills is providing corporate finance and debt financing advice, but with Pounds 10m of cash on its balance sheet, it plans to start providing direct finance for transactions. It also intends to sponsor a number of property funds, in which Savills would be prepared to take a direct stake. The company recommended a final dividend of 1.5p, making 2.25p for the year, up from 1p. Earnings per share were 6.2p (2.2p).</p>

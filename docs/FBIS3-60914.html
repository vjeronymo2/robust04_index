			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique from Inoussa Traore Bouraima, Togolese Minister </F> of National Defense; in Lome on 6 January; from the "News in  Brief" program -- read by announcer]    [Text] Yesterday at exactly 1820, while President  Gnassingbe Eyadema and Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh were  holding discussions at the president's private residence in Lome  District 2, groups of terrorists lying in ambush along the  boulevard leading to the head of state's private residence  opened fire at the presidential vehicle, which was on its way to  the Togolese Inter-Arm Regime [RIT] camp. The vehicle was  struck by a rocket, in addition to many bursts of gunfire. This  vehicle -- which fortunately was not carrying the head of state  -- managed to escape. Soon afterward, more automatic gunfire was  heard in many places around the capital, mainly around the RIT  camp, at the Dove of Peace roundabout, on Hydrocarbon Boulevard,  and on the lower side of the lagoon, near Cinema Togo. In those  places, the terrorists, who were in plain clothes and driving  vehicles without any distinctive signs or license plates, shot  at everything that moved, sowing panic among citizens who were  mostly returning home from work. Security forces countered  these attacks immediately.    Another group of terrorists in a Nissan Patrol-like vehicle  were intercepted at the junction of Boulevard Jean-Paul II and  Akeyi Street, while heading to a private presidential residence  in Lome District 2, where the head of state and the prime  minister were holding discussions. The attacks [word  indistinct] concentrated on the RIT, (Avedougouome), and Rapid  Intervention Force [FIR] camps. Outside the FIR camp a Toyota  pickup vehicle was intercepted and its cargo seized. The cargo  consisted of a sizable amount of arms, including rockets,  defensive grenades, 7.62-caliber ammunition and propelling  cartridges [as heard]. A bus carrying attackers was intercepted  at (Doudogome), and its passengers were arrested and taken to  the gendarmerie. Another bus, which was following [words  indistinct] of their attackers was found on the Kara Boulevard  with only its driver, who was seriously injured. At the Aflao  customs post, a Peugeot sedan car, which was trying to force its  way into Ghana, was fired upon -- the driver was killed on the  spot. The attackers, who were routed around 0330, tried to  withdraw to the Ghanaian border. Clashes continued until early  this morning.    The provisional toll is as follows: Seven security forces'  elements, three civilians, and about 30 attackers were killed,  while 35 terrorists were arrested.    Issued in Lome on 6 January 1994.    [Signed] The minister of national defense.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Summary From Poor Reception] Finance Ministry workers  staged a sit-in strike in front of the ministry buildings this  afternoon in protest against the arrest of one of their  colleagues, Louis Fadognon, in connection with the publication  of administrative documents on the 10-million-CFA franc  diversion case involving Mrs. Rosine Soglo. The slogan for this  afternoon's sit-in was the "immediate and unconditional release  of our colleague." In a motion read during the sit-in, the  finance workers said they will pursue their action until they  obtain the "unconditional release" of their colleague.    A Finance Ministry workers' union executive committee member  spoke to the media about the conditions of arrest of their  colleague, noting in particular that "he was transferred from  Kalavi to the Territorial Brigade Department and was not allowed  any contacts." The brigade approached the human rights  committee, which confirmed that the accused "was notably  arrested in connection with the 10-million-CFA franc case" and  that the committee was working on the case. The union leader  further said: "We are mainly fighting for the security of  workers."</p>

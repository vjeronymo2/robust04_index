			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Need to achieve a better balance in social policy in Europe and the UK (3) Sir, Your call for a debate about worker rights is welcome ('Time to debate worker rights', December 22). The UK is almost the least-regulated of the OECD economies, without legal pay protection, limits to working hours or a statutory right to paid holidays. Yet recent evidence provided by both the European Commission and the employment department has demonstrated that the deregulation strategy has not created significant numbers of new jobs. Indeed, the UK's record of job creation is rather poorer over the medium term than that of other economies with far higher levels of social and employment protection. Employment secretary Michael Portillo's decision earlier this month to opt out of a European directive providing improved rights for part-timers and temporary workers is a case in point. While other EU governments consider that improved rights for part-timers will increase flexibility by encouraging more people to accept part-time employment, the UK insists that fewer such jobs will be created. The same arguments were used against the Equal Pay Act. If companies had to pay the same wage for women as for men, it was said, they would cease to employ people full-time if they were required to provide the same rights to part-timers. Your editorial calls for 'a framework of employment rights, which could make the two demands - flexibility and fairness - more visibly compatible'. The experience of the US, which pursued the same deregulation strategy as the UK during the 1980s, provides an important lesson. As Robert Reich, US labour secretary, has explained, the insecurity and uncertainty that deregulation created made people less willing to accept the changes that a modern economy requires. The lack of employment rights has resulted in less flexibility, not more. Fairness and flexibility are not incompatible: indeed, it seems unlikely that the latter can, in the long term, be achieved without the former.

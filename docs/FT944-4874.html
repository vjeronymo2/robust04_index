			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (5): Economy pauses for breath / A look at the reasons for the slowdown After a strong recovery in the first half of this year the Swiss economy is taking a breather. Most economic forecasters see this as merely a pause before more rapid growth next year - but some fear it signifies a more durable lack of stamina. The ascent of the Swiss franc this year, especially against the dollar, has knocked company profits, provoked squeals of pain from industry and reinforced concerns about Switzerland's long-term 'de-industrialisation'. Meanwhile, much of the government's 'economic revitalisation' programme, launched after voters rejected Swiss membership of the 17-nation European Economic Area in December 1992, is still on the drawing board. Ministers are also struggling with mixed success to mend tattered federal finances. On the face of it, the economy looks in reasonable shape after emerging from three years of recession, the longest since the war. National output touched bottom in mid-1993 and grew 2.3 per cent over the following 12 months. Investment in private housing and business equipment has bounded ahead, though industrial and commercial building remains depressed. Exports have been buoyant, boosted by renewed growth in Europe and especially in Germany which alone accounts for a third of Swiss goods sent abroad. Switzerland's habitual balance of payments surplus set a new record last year of SFr27bn or 7.8 per cent of gross domestic product. Inflation is expected to average under 1 per cent this year, an eight-year low. Registered unemployment, which reached a post-war high in January at over 188,000 - 5.2 per cent of the workforce - has since fallen steadily to below 160,000. The economic slowdown this autumn has been blamed on the postponement of investment into next year to take advantage of the new value added tax to be introduced in January. Under VAT, businesses will be able to recoup tax on investment goods which they cannot do under the present sales tax. The majority of forecasters are predicting export- and investment-led economic growth of 2.25-2.5 per cent next year, up from about 1.5 per cent in 1994. Some, however, such as Mr Hans Kaufmann of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich, believe the pause shows that industry is already being priced out of export and domestic markets by the resurgent Swiss franc. Bank Baer has accordingly slashed its growth forecast for next year from 2.5 per cent to just 1.7 per cent. Other clouds on the 1995 horizon are the uptick in inflation from the changeover to VAT, which could add 1.5-1.75 per cent to the consumer price index. Inflation is generally expected to average about 2.5 per cent next year, keeping real household incomes and spending subdued. Higher unemployment insurance contributions and a possible rise in mortgage interest rates will also have a dampening effect. Meanwhile, government spending is being restrained by the need to cut the budget deficit, now running at about 4.5 per cent of GDP for central and local government together. The federal deficit this year is put at just under SFr7bn, after a record SFr7.8bn in 1993. Heroic attempts to cut spending and raise extra revenues will still leave a projected gap next year of SFr6.5bn and smaller but still substantial deficits in future years. Although these deficits are not high by European standards, they are still worrying for a government which is used to balancing the books and which must submit key tax decisions to the electorate. For industry, however, the overriding concern is the strong Swiss franc. Largely reflecting its traditional haven role at times of political and economic uncertainty, it rose nearly 16 per cent against the dollar in the first 10 months of 1994, coming close to record highs touched two years ago. The impact on profit margins has been dire, prompting 80 small and medium-sized companies in October to appeal for an easier monetary policy to cap the currency. But the Swiss National Bank, one of Europe's most fiercely independent central banks, says it has no intention of relaxing its tight monetary stance intended to keep inflation low. 'I don't think a relaxation of the monetary reins would be in the interests of the export industry in the medium term,' Mr Markus Lusser, SNB president, said in October, arguing that it would risk rekindling inflation which would itself harm competitiveness. Indeed, many economists, including those of the OECD in Paris, believe the strong franc has paradoxically helped to boost the competitiveness of Swiss industry by forcing companies to cut costs and restructure production. Since 1991 rapid productivity growth has led to a fall in unit labour costs, making Switzerland more cost-competitive against key trading partners. And on most counts Switzerland still ranks among the world's most competitive economies, according to the latest report by the International Institute for Management Development and the World Economic Forum. The downside has been a 6 per cent drop in employment between 1992 and 1994. Unemployment, almost unknown for most of the post-war period, is set to become a permanent feature of the Swiss economic landscape though it remains well below that of neighbouring countries. At the same time, Swiss firms have been creating jobs abroad, not only in mass-production facilities but also, more worryingly, in high-tech activities. Mr Thomas Gasser, president of the Swiss Machinery Manufacturers' Association, points out that half the research and development spending of Swiss industry is now directed overseas, and that the production jobs that go with it are very unlikely to migrate back to Switzerland. Switzerland's December 1992 vote on the EEA has also removed much of its attraction for foreigners who might otherwise have found it an easy stepping stone into the European single market. Foreign direct investment in Switzerland, which was running at between SFr3bn and SFr6bn before 1992, fell to just SFr0.1bn in 1993. Meanwhile, to industry's dismay, the government's 'economic revitalisation' programme remains incom- plete, with delays affecting all three planks of the programme. Switzerland's slow-moving legislative procedures mean the Gatt world trade pact will not be ratified until the middle of next year, months after other nations have done so. Bilateral negotiations with the EU on such issues as transport, research and public procurement finally begin this month but are likely to be protracted. Important measures to stiffen competition and improve efficiency in the domestic market, notably by tackling Switzerland's numerous cartels, have yet to be considered by parliament.</p>

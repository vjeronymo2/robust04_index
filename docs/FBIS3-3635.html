			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hohhot, March 20 (XINHUA) -- In the next few years,  northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region aims to  improve its people's living standard to the front rank of all  China's localities.    That is the aim of a blueprint called "Stepping Into the  Front Rank," which will be implemented from this year, according  to the autonomous regional government.    Officials say the aim was made in line with one of Deng  Xiaoping's speeches in 1987 on the future development of the  autonomous region. Officials quoted him as saying that Inner  Mongolia might well "step into the front rank" in the future  since it has a vast grassland and a relatively sparse population.    Agriculture, animal husbandry, coal, electricity,  metallurgical industry, petrochemical industry, construction  materials industry, wool spinning industry and forestry will be  developed as leading sectors to boost the locality as one of  China's major producing areas in basic industries.    Officials say Inner Mongolia is facing a rare development  opportunity now as the central government, stressing the  development of remote areas inhabited by ethnic minority  nationalities, has brought in a series of preferential policies  for them.    In addition, they say enterprises producing raw materials  will become more competitive in national market as China has  freed the price of most energy and raw materials.    Other favorable conditions for the region's growth include  its closeness to Beijing and Tianjin cities and neighboring to  northeast and northwest China. And the past 40 years of  construction have laid a certain material basis, local officials  said.    According to the plan, this year the autonomous region is to  raise its total output value of agriculture and animal husbandry  to 20.5 billion yuan, up 6 percent over 1993. Grain production  will be maintained at more than 10 billion kg and heads of  livestock are to reach 56.50 million.    A dozen model townships and villages will be set up as  examples to become prosperous ahead of others.    By the end of this century, major bases for the production  of  corn, wheat, soybean and beef will be established.    A dozen major thermal power plants will be expanded to  convert more coal into electricity. The electricity will then  be transmitted to neighboring areas which now use most of the  coal rather than electricity shipped in from Inner Mongolia.    Further reforms will be carried out in state enterprises as  a  way to revive them. And more local specialized markets will  come into being, covering grain, fur and leather, meat,  medicinal herbs, wood, coal, iron and steel, construction  materials, oil and textile products.</p>

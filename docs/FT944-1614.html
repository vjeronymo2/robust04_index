			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (6): Officials fear wedge - Relations with Norway If you ask officials what course relations between Sweden and Norway will take in the wake of Sweden's 'Yes' last month to membership of the European Union and Norway's rejection of membership, 'status quo' is the united response, writes Karen Fossli. Privately, however, they express fears that a wedge may have been driven between the two countries by the different outcomes of their referendums on EU membership. Norwegian officials fear that at some point Sweden will be forced to ask itself 'What's in it for me?' when deciding between Nordic co-operation and EU loyalty. For Norway, a 90-year union with Sweden and before that a 434-year union with Denmark, were both forced marriages which partly explains Norwegians' icy response to joining anything resembling a union. Norwegians are quick to point out that during both unions the country lost its identity and the people lost their language. Norway relinquished neutrality following the occupation by Nazi Germany during the second world war and became a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato). Sweden, which was not occupied during the war, has maintained neutrality. In joining the EU, Sweden will attain observer status at the Western European Union (WEU), but the country is loathe to subscribe to full membership. Norway has WEU observer status. Norway says Sweden relies on its ties to Nato. 'This has always been vital for Sweden and has contributed to allowing the country to maintain neutrality,' one Norwegian official explained. In 1952, the Nordic countries established the Nordic Council through which co-operation has since been undertaken. Resolutions unanimously passed in the Council are binding for the Nordic governments but in some cases must be approved by their individual national assemblies. Foreign policy and security policy fall outside Nordic co-operation, however. Mr Carl Bildt, the former Swedish conservative Moderate prime minister, suggested last month that formal Nordic co-operation be dismantled in view of the broad Nordic expansion into the EU. But, Mr Ingvar Carlsson, Sweden's prime minister, has so far resisted such a move. 'There is a limit to what Sweden could do (to this end), if it was to do anything at all, because there would be a public outcry if Nordic co-operation was to end. . . and this gives Norway some protection,' a Norwegian official said. Last month, the Nordic Council agreed that co-operation should be reformed to take into account 'a wider international outlook'. Nevertheless, Norway fears that the Nordic Council might become obsolete, or take a back seat to the EU, now that all of the Nordic countries except itself and Iceland have become EU members. One of the most significant achievements of the Nordic Council is that of joint labour markets, set up 20 years ago, and the introduction of unrestricted passage between Nordic states. Swedes can work and live in Norway or other Nordic countries and vice-versa. Officials do not foresee interruptions in these agreements just because Norway is outside the EU but both sides see controls at the new EU Swedish-Norwegian border being tightened. Swedish customs officials say they have received no signals from Brussels that things should change. The Norwegians, however, fear that an existing drain of trade to Sweden at the frontier will become exacerbated by the new EU border. Norwegians have for years been motoring to Sweden where food prices in particular are significantly lower and are set to decline as a result of EU membership. Local Swedish authorities are already attempting to persuade Norwegian companies to relocate 'just over the border into the EU' and advertising campaigns spelling out the benefits are in full swing. Some local authorities are offering incentives such as free building plots and cash advances towards hiring staff. Norwegian officials plan to increase the number of customs officials posted at the frontier. Before it decided to become an EU member, Sweden planned to cut border staff but it may now have to increase staffing. Norway is deeply concerned about domestic companies relocating to Sweden. Already, some Norwegian fish processing companies have moved to Sweden, and others warn they will follow in order to benefit economically from not having to pay tariffs on processed fish exported between EU countries. Processed fish exported by Norway to the EU is subject to a complex system of tariffs. But another benefit for companies relocating to Sweden is that they can qualify for support from the EU's regional fund. Norway is therefore considering establishing a 'free enterprise zone' in specific counties at the EU frontiers of Sweden and Finland but has yet to give details. Officials in Sweden and Norway are disappointed with Norway's 'No' vote. Sweden and Finland counted had on Norway joining the EU because it would have meant that one in four of the countries around EU tables would have been Nordic. The Nordic bloc could have wielded considerable influence over EU decision-making. The Swedes and Norwegians say the European Economic Area trade pact, established in 1992 between the European Free Trade Association (Efta) - of which they are members - and the EU, will protect Norway to a certain extent once Sweden becomes a full EU member from January 1. But Norwegians concede that foreigners considering investment in the Nordic region will favour Sweden because of its EU member status. The irony of Norway's rejection of membership is that the country will become more dependent on Sweden to air Norwegian views in Brussels, a dependency which it has fought hard to shed since dismantling the union with Sweden 90 years ago.</p>

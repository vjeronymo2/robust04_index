			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Pink Snow (10): The best resorts in the world - Arnie Wilson's guide to the finest skiing, the warmest welcomes, and the wildest scenery FRANCE ALPE D'HUEZ Older, quieter and with more charm than its neighbour Les Deux Alpes, Alpe d'Huez has an even more extensive ski area. The Grandes Rousses massif has 86 lifts, 107 runs and 140 miles of pistes. And as Les Deux Alpes has a rustic 'back-door' to its ski area, Alpe d'Huez has two charming satellites  -Vaujany and Oz - to which skiers can retreat at the end of the day. The focal point of Alpe d'Huez is the Pic Blanc from which, the resort claims, you can see one fifth of France. Advanced and expert terrain (on and off-piste) radiates in all directions. These include the long and challenging Tunnel, and Sarenne, plus testing couloirs and faces around and beyond Pyramide, which should be skied with a guide. AVORIAZ Another purpose-built French resort with controversial architecture. One of the most dramatic French resorts, rearing up with its space-age tower blocks from its cliff-top eyrie above its stablemate, Morzine. Avoriaz is the gateway to the Portes du Soleil, a network of 13 ski areas along the French/Swiss border, including the French resorts of Chatel, Abondance, Les Gets and, in Switzerland, Morgins, Torgon, Les Crosets and Champoussin. The circuit has 228 lifts serving more than 400 miles of pistes. Even the longest route (about 30 miles) can be covered in a day by fast skiers. The most famous run of the network is Chavanette, better known as the Swiss Wall, from Avoriaz down to Les Crosets. CHAMONIX / ARGENTIERE Chamonix's Vallee Blanche is not the most difficult off-piste skiing on the planet, but the scenery is out of this world. It is also the only sensible way down from the Aiguille du Midi, a craggy eyrie that towers above the old climbing town of Chamonix. The 'alternative' North Face is so steep that it makes most skiers blanche. Building Europe's highest cable car to this summit was a preposterous idea achieved against impossible odds. Chamonix has many attractions, including half a dozen ski areas, but most 'serious' skiers are drawn either to the Aiguille du Midi or Argentiere's Grands Montets. Between these two massifs lies the Mer de Glace (the huge sea of ice formed where glaciers converge) which forms the basis for the main 22km Vallee Blanche descent. Keep an eye on your guide's progress to avoid the myriad crevasses on the Glacier de Geant. Your attention will be riveted by peaks, domes, needles, pyramids and pinnacles. The Grands Montets provides some of Europe's best skiing on and off-piste, with a huge vertical drop and one run - Point du Vue - which allows skiers to visit the portals of the seracs of the Glacier d'Argentiere. COURCHEVEL/MERIBEL Courchevel is an excellent ski resort, but why it is rated the most chic, up-market and the most expensive in France is not clear. The flagship village of Courchevel 1850 is not picture-postcard material. However, it has several four-star hotels. The less fashionable Courchevel 1650 has more rustic appeal: it is cheaper and has plenty of good skiing, including the excellent off-piste Les Avals itinerary reached after hiking from the top of Chanrossa. Well-heeled skiers would not be seen anywhere but 1850, highest of the resort's three main areas. Three of Courchevel's famous couloirs - Sous le Telepherique, Grand and Emile Allais (all reached from the top of the Saulire cable-car) are listed as black runs. Much of Courchevel's skiing is good intermediate fare. There is an abundance of nursery slopes. Courchevel links with Meribel, Les Menuires and Val Thorens to form the Trois Vallees ski region, probably the biggest expanse of skiing in the world. Meribel (Mottaret and Les Allues) - which shelters between Courchevel and Les Menuires at the heart of the three valleys - offers skiers wonderful choice. In one direction they can make for Courchevel; in the other they can head for Les Menuires, Val Thorens or St Martin de Belleville. Or they can stay in Meribel and enjoy acres of good skiing there. FLAINE Traditionally Flaine, in the Grand Massif, shared with Tignes the distinction of drawing more flak over its architecture than all the other purpose-built French resorts, with only the attractive old town of Samoens and the village of Les Carroz providing any real charm. Flaine is ideal for beginners and intermediates, with trails linking Flaine via Les Grands Vans with Samoens, Les Garroz and Morillon. There is excellent off-piste for the more advanced, but the mountains around Flaine are notorious for pot-holes. Take a guide. LA PLAGNE Brochure writers love to describe their resorts as 'an intermediates' paradise'. La Plagne is the genuine article. It is really a dozen hamlets and villages strung together in a vast maze of skiing. The flagship is Aime La Plagne, perched high above the resort. This space-age ski city houses accommodation, restaurants, shops and a cinema but is ugly. The skiing is so extensive that those obsessed with achieving a daily mileage can find their plans misfiring: there is a danger of spending too much time on the vast lift network, especially for those who set their sights on the Bellecote Glacier. LES ARCS When the French started to pioneer purpose-built ski resorts in the 1960s, the results varied from good to bad to indifferent. Les Arcs is reckoned a success, inspiring copy-cat resorts in other countries. The resort is split into three: Arc 1600, 1800 and 2000. The architecture is brave and imposing. The skiing is extensive and adventurous and dominated by the Aiguille Rouge (11,240ft) above Arc 2000. Runs lead everywhere from the top, including the celebrated 15km descent all the way to Villaroger, which starts off with black or red alternatives but mellows. Les Arcs is renowned for its off-piste skiing above and below the tree-line. Some of it verges on the extreme. The resort is famous for its ski evolutif (graduated length) teaching concept which allows beginners to start on very short skis, gradually switching to longer ones. LES DEUX ALPES/LA GRAVE Les Deux Alpes is a bustling, brash and booming ski area with a huge British following and an effervescent night life. Les Deux Alpes is a skiing factory. On the other side of the towering La Meije (13,065ft) is the silent and beautiful glacier kingdom of La Grave with almost none of the normal impedimenta of a ski resort. La Grave is a picturesque climbing village invaded by a few tough, thrill-seeking skiers there for the 7,000 vertical feet of steep, untracked terrain. Only a 15 minute walk separates the areas but is sufficient to discourage recreational skiers from wandering over from Les Deux Alpes. Les Deux Alpes works in reverse compared with most resorts - the lower you ski, the steeper the slopes. It has a rustic backwater: skiers can reach the resort from the spectacular valley below Venosc via an ancient two-seater gondola. St Christophe-en-Oisans below Venosc is also the destination point of a spectacular alternative to skiing La Grave. From the Dome de la Lauze a guide will lead you down the magnificent Vallon de la Selle, one of the most breathtaking descents in the Alps, though not too demanding technically. VAL D'ISERE/TIGNES The Trois Vallees and Portes du Soleil are bigger, but Val d'Isere (with the help of its neighbour Tignes, France's most famous summer ski area) may just be the best ski resort in the world - at least for adventurous skiers: the better the skier, the more extensive the challenging terrain. The resorts swarm with specialist ski schools, among the best of which are Top Ski (Val) and Evolution 2 (Tignes). With their guides it is possible to spend a fortnight skiing off-piste and scarcely touch a groomed run, except to ski from one off-piste area to another. There is also excellent couloir skiing. Intermediates can roam between the various areas - Le Fornet, La Daille and Bellevarde in Val, Le Lac, Lavachet, La Grande Motte Glacier, Brevieres and Val Claret in Tignes - without needing to ski a run twice, and both resorts have world class bump skiing. There is plenty for beginners. Tignes is purpose-built and not pretty, but Val d'Isere has an old quarter. The link between the two is manageable by most. Val d'Isere's big rival, Courchevel, tends to attract older, richer clients: Val appeals to younger skiers in search of challenging terrain and the liveliest nightlife. Dick's T-Bar has long been the focal point for British skiers. VAL THORENS/LES MENUIRES Val Thorens, Europe's highest ski resort, is a big, exciting but sometimes bleak ski area which like La Plagne and Flaine - is trying to soften its image. Both Val Thorens and its neighbour Les Menuires began as soulless collections of concrete apartment blocks, but in the late 1980s and early 1990s have added rustic touches. Val Thorens now has a copper and pink church and Les Menuires has attempted to make its satellite, Reberty, prettier. Further down the Belleville Valley and easy to get to on skis is St Martin - a traditional, large village with exhilarating roller-coaster runs such as Bethlehem and La Riondaz. St Martin's rustic atmosphere provides a welcome contrast to the space-age skiing of its higher neighbours. Val Thorens' big attraction is the Cime de Caron (10,480ft) and a 160-person cable car. The runs from the top are long and gruelling. SWITZERLAND ANDERMATT Andermatt is one of those ski resorts where the village, river and tea-rooms lull you into a sense of well-being, only to have it shattered by a mountain to test the mettle of the toughest skier both on and off-piste. The Gemmstock is a big, steep and uncompromising slab of rock: an awe-inspiring place to ski. The cable car half-way stage provides access to some of the limited intermediate slopes, but there are less than a dozen lifts and these include the satellite resorts of Hospental and Realp. For off-piste skiers, Andermatt provides some of the best terrain in Switzerland. There are classic off-piste itineraries, preferably skied with a guide, from the summit. The most reliable method of reaching Andermatt is by motor-rail. CRANS MONTANA Switzerland's largest ski area - perched above the Rhone Valley between the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc - has much exhilarating, picturesque, largely intermediate skiing on long, wide-open cruising slopes. The resort's lift system was upgraded for the 1987 world championships, and allows skiers to cruise for hours along 100 miles of groomed runs with few queue delays. There are three ski areas: Les Violettes has most of the high, open slopes; the glacier at Plaine Morte (9,840ft) has magnificent cross-country skiing and scenery (it is also used for summer skiing and as a starting point for ski tours); and Cry d'Err-Bella Lui and Aminona-Petit Bonvin have an assortment of slopes above and below the tree line. The resort's one official black run is above La Toula. Crans is newer, smarter and more expensive with the inevitable luxury boutiques. Montana is older and more rustic. DAVOS/KLOSTERS Davos is like a gentle giant (or perhaps something of an ugly duckling compared with its genteel smaller cousin) that puts up with the international notoriety of Klosters. Klosters depends on Davos for its skiing clout, though the notorious Gotschna Wang run is in Klosters terrain, with other spectacular runs such as Drostobel, a challenging black run which like the 'Wang' links the Davos slopes with Klosters. Davos, with its superb Parsenn area, has by far the most significant terrain. As Europe's highest ski town it has little of Switzerland's alpine charm, but the Parsenn-Weissfluh section - the size of Manhattan with long runs all the way down to Kublis, 14km away - is the envy of Europe. Jakobshorn and Rinerhorn have their own ski areas and provide good intermediate slopes plus challenging runs and good off-piste, while Madrisa offers sunny, easy skiing, and a ski touring route for excursions across the Austrian border to Gargellen. FLIMS/LAAX This is an unfamiliar part of Switzerland to most British skiers, and deserves wider recognition. The combined ski area of Flims and Laax is greater than the sum of its parts and is jointly marketed as the White Arena. The two ski areas - traditional rivals - are knitted together by La Siala, but the most popular link is at the bottom of a steep valley at Plaun. It is a sunny spot for lunch and a good cross-over point for better skiers. Higher up at Crap Sogn Gion, less experienced skiers will find a crossroads of blue runs. With almost 140 miles of pistes, it is a large area of mainly intermediate skiing, much of it above the tree line, where in good weather the skiing can be superb. In cold weather the slopes are very exposed, but skiers can always escape to the long runs through the trees lower down. On the Flims side there is tougher skiing in a huge open bowl from the top of the Cassons cable-car (8,775ft) which in powder is outstanding. In Laax, experts will enjoy the long black Sattel run from Vorab (9,900ft) and two long black runs from Crap Sogn Gion, Muladera and Fatschas. Bill Kidd is a gem for intermediates. It is only a blue, but hugely enjoyable. And the run from Vorab to Flims is almost nine miles long. GRINDELWALD/WENGEN Magnificent scenery more than compensates for bland skiing in this idyllic area of the Bernese Oberland that has long been a favourite with the British. Soon after the first world war - long before the first ski-lifts - they used the arrival of the mountain railway to provide a ride up the mountain to aid their madcap skiing antics. Here the spectacular trio of the Eiger, Monch (Monk) and Jungfrau (the maiden, guarded from the fearsome ogre by the monk as The Good Skiing Guide puts it) plus the impressive Finsteraarhorn and Wetterhorn are so close that they dominate the sky-line. The ski area's focal point is Kleine Scheidegg, a plateau mid-way between Grindelwald and Wengen. The skiing is extensive and good intermediate standard, with little to test the expert except occasionally good powder skiing. There is some of the best helicopter skiing in the world close by, and excellent off-piste terrain can be reached on skins via the Aletsch Glacier. SAAS-FEE Saas means meadow and Fee was once claimed to mean 'fairylike'. Once labelled 'the most abominable wild region of Switzerland', this very remoteness now attracts visitors to the 'glacier village'. In 1849 the parish priest skied on wooden boards to Saas-Grund to care for a dying man. They were the first ski tracks in Switzerland. Not until the road was built in 1951 - replacing travel by mule - did it become a serious ski area. The main reason for Zermatt's popularity is the Matterhorn; Saas-Fee has the Dom, the highest mountain in Switzerland. The resort's glaciers give it a unique appeal. The terrain is riddled with cavities: yawning crevasses and smaller, more rounded holes where marmots live. Marmots hibernate, but the Fee glacier never sleeps, moving relentlessly more than 20cm a day. The resort has superimposed an extensive ski area on the marauding ice. ST MORITZ/PONTRESINA St Moritz - where the British invented winter sports - is an institution that should be experienced in all its facets: a drink at the Palace, tea at the venerable (but not so glitzy) Kulm, with its glass-cabinets packed with Cresta trophies, lunch at the Marmite restaurant (specialising in truffles and caviar) at Corviglia - and then a hasty call to your bank manager to see whether you can still afford a lift ticket. St Moritz is expensive, but no more so than any big Swiss resort. The skiing is scattered among three basic areas: Corviglia (easiest slopes, easiest to get to from the town centre); Corvatsch (bigger, tougher better ski area, but a car or bus ride away with serious queuing at base area); and Pontresina (magnificent scenery, but can be bleak and windswept). ZERMATT With good snow and a blue sky, Zermatt is one of the world's most magnificent ski resorts. In bad weather, when the Matterhorn's glories are hidden in cloud, it can also be one of the bleakest. But the resort has so many mountain huts and restaurants that even the bad days usually turn out good and the town itself has plenty to offer skiers returning early from the slopes. Zermatt - particularly the Sunegga, Rothorn/Gornergrat area - has a lot of sunshine. However, it is nearly always cold on the Theodul Glacier (Zermatt's summer skiing area) and the run down to Cervinia from here or via the spectacular Klein Matterhorn cable-car for a plate of spaghetti across the Italian border can be a chilly and windswept experience. The Matterhorn dominates the resort and its legends, but it is only one of many important peaks in the area. You can gaze out across the Gornergletscher on a row of dramatic summits including Monte Rosa, the highest. It is best to ski only one of Zermatt's three principal ski areas each day or valuable skiing time will be lost in transit. The Good Skiing Guide sums up Zermatt's skiing: 'Good for experts, excellent for intermediates and ghastly for beginners.' That is a harsh judgment of Zermatt's nursery slopes, but certainly the stronger the skier, the more Zermatt has to offer. There is usually an easy alternative to the tougher runs. Skiers looking for the most difficult way down will relish runs such as National and Triftji, whether mogulled or mantled with fresh powder. The town is car-free, with electric carts or horse-drawn sleighs. Smart hotels, cosy tea-rooms and nightclubs abound. VERBIER Verbier is one of the world's greatest ski resorts, and this winter the area's one flaw - the lift queues that spring partly from popularity, partly from antiquity of one or two chief lifts - will be thinned out (though not eradicated) by the opening of the new 'jumbo' gondolas. Another way to enjoy Verbier without queues is to ski in the spring, when conditions are almost always superb but the crowds have vanished. Even without roaming around the area's 'Four Valleys' taking in Nendaz, Veysonnaz, La Tzoumas and Thyon (250 miles of skiing with almost 100 lifts), there is a wealth of skiing in Verbier itself. The strong skier will relish Verbier's terrain. The variety of challenges are almost endless: Tortin, with its tricky traverse followed by a face steep enough to give even experts a good work-out, the glorious plunging powder fields of Col des Mouches further round from Tortin, the Gentianes bump run, one of the toughest in the Alps, ditto Mont-Font (steeper but not as long). Verbier is also renowned for its glorious off-piste. VILLARS/DIABLERETS There are many skiers living in Montreux, Lausanne and other places along the north shore of Lake Geneva (or Lac Lemon as it is known by the locals) but apart from some small ski areas such as the Rochers de Naye and Jaman there are no big resorts until one reaches the far eastern corner of the lake where the Dents du Midi form such a spectacular backdrop. Bretaye (5,900ft) reached by the Eisenbahn Railway, is the hub of the ski area, with slopes on three flanks: Roc d'Orsay (also reached by gondola from the village), Grand Chamossaire (6,950ft) and Petit Chamossaire (both with excellent off-piste opportunities) on one side; Les Chaux and Crois des Chaux (6,625ft) opposite; and the Chaux de Conches chair below Isenau, the link with Diablerets, to the north. AUSTRIA ISCHGL Big ski area. Small town. Surprisingly small considering that Ischgl, after a late start as a significant ski area (its first cable-car was only constructed in 1963, bringing prosperity to a struggling community) is now as popular with the Austrians as St Anton and Kitzbuhel. The reason it has not sprawled farther along the Paznaun valley is simple: the avalanche danger is too great. The result is that Ischgl, in spite of its growing international reputation, remains unspoiled. The ski area, 125 miles of pistes served by 40 lifts, links with the duty-free village of Samnaun in Switzerland, and there is a long history of smuggling celebrated brazenly today with the 'Smugglers Cup' event in which participants are handed a 'secret' package to smuggle past customs officials. The slopes, set in strikingly attractive scenery, are in the so-called 'Silvretta Hole', which normally guarantees good snow. The skiing area - mainly long, swooping, well-groomed motorway runs - provides superb intermediate terrain but also plenty for beginners and experts. Unfortunately all this can be marred by serious queuing at peak times. Hemingway was a regular visitor in the mid-l920s. KITZBUHEL Kitzbuhel is a perplexing resort that is raved about by its fans but can also be slandered by its critics. With its medieval walled centre, pastel wash facades, cobbled streets, frescoes and decorative archways, 'Kitz' is perhaps the most attractive of the more substantial Austrian resorts. And with three distinct ski areas, plus the most feared World Cup downhill in the world, the Streif on the Hahnenkamm, it would seem to have a strong suit of skiing possibilities. And yet one great descent does not make a world-class ski resort (although few would deny that it is one). Kitzbuhel's detractors are quick to point out its flaws: lack of height (the town is at only 800m), fairly bland skiing; serious lift queue problems; and rowdy visitors who make the most of Kitzbuhel's 25 bars, pubs and discos. This year - not for the first time - Kitzbuhel was hit by a combination of low altitude and a hot March. Yet in other years it has often got away with a better snow record than its lowly altitude would promise. Although the various different areas are fairly widely spread, the bus service linking them is efficient and many skiers quite like the opportunity of trying a different area or approach route every other day or so. LECH/ZURS 'Top class elsewhere means nothing here.' This somewhat conceited boast of the Arlberg ski schools of Lech, Zurs and St Anton might also apply to the self-perceived grandeur of Lech's clientele. So what is so special about Lech, that this remote, impoverished hamlet, cut off during the winter, now attracts Europe's royalty (including, of course, the Princess of Wales) and so many millionaire skiers? The ski area, which with that of neighbouring Zurs provides an enjoyable and moderately challenging clockwise-only circuit, is good without being exceptional, although a guide will find you some excellent off-piste, particularly from the Rufikopf. Lech has the mighty slopes of St Anton, which its snootier clients find a double edged sword, on its doorstep. Zurs, although much the more recent of the two, has some history of its own: it was the location of Austria's first 'cable-operated hoist for ski users'  -draglift, in other words. The Zurs slopes are higher and entirely above the tree-line. Lech's tend to be more wooded and gentler. All in all, the epitome of a good Austrian skiing holiday. MAYRHOFEN/HINTERTUX Sex and snow seem inextricably linked at Mayrhofen, where the resort has taken to selling itself through innuendo. Beneath its catchy 'lead me into temptation' headline in the resort literature we see both a map of the extensive ski areas, plus a back-view of a topless skier sunning herself on a mountain top. Like Zermatt, Mayrhofen has become a victim of its own success, and has all but lost its original charm, in spite of its beautiful setting in the Zillertal. Yet it remains an excellent ski resort. In spite of its low altitude (the village is barely 2,000ft), the ski slopes are much higher. There are three different areas (Ahorn, Penken and Horberg/Gerent) with slopes as high as 7,380ft and almost 60 miles of groomed runs. Queuing can still be a serious problem, but a big investment in new snow-cannon at Penken and Hornberg started to pay off as soon as they were switched on last winter. However, even in the worst of snow years there is always the glacier at Hintertux, which also provides some of the best summer skiing in Europe which many of the national skiing teams take full advantage of. MONTAFON VALLEY Gargellen is 'ideal for ski tours'. True. It is right on the Swiss border and a highlight for skiers is the Madrisa tour to or from Klosters. For some reason (mainly a lack of sufficient beds), very few British tour operators pay much attention to this beautiful valley in the Vorarlberg. The valley is dotted with substantial ski resorts that all sound vaguely similar: Gaschurn, St Gallenkirch and Gortipohl are linked and market themselves as the Silvretta Nova (the mountain range dominating the valley) while Gargellen, Schruns and Tschagguns tend to go it alone. But the whole region is available on a joint lift pass, and linked by a free ski-bus service. Altogether the region has more than 100 miles of groomed runs served by almost 80 lifts, not counting the Madrisa tour or the heli-skiing areas, which makes it one of Austria's biggest skiing regions. OBERGURGL/SOLDEN These high-altitude resorts are not quite linked but close to one another and comprise the heart of the Otztal region, one of Austria's biggest year-round tourist attractions. Obergurgl is a classic British enclave (as many as a fifth of its regular clients are British) with perhaps almost as many faithful returnees as the Swiss resort of Wengen, with which it shares something else in common: a lot of intermediate cruising with little in the way of serious challenges. Perhaps this is the attraction] One run that can be a little daunting with poor or icy snow cover is the Hohe Mut at almost 9,000ft, served by an ancient single chair (the restaurant at the top is usually uncrowded and there are magnificent views) but in good snow there is a hugely enjoyable off-piste run off the back. With Hochgurgl, its close neighbour, Obergurgl is the highest ski village in Austria. In Europe, only Val Thorens in France's Trois Vallees is higher. Solden, linked with Obergurgl by post-bus, is a very different prospect: much busier, noisier and with a more international flavour. Like Obergurgl, it has a separate 'hoch' village but the skiing, which is mainly intermediate is properly linked. The resort has considerable snow-making, but in the event of a serious lack of snow its trump card is the glacier skiing at Rettenbach and Tiefenbach. SAALBACH/HINTERGLEMM For many British skiers, Saalbach-Hinterglemm was not just the first place where the slopes made them grin from ear-to-ear but the resort where the grin sometimes lasted all week. With a ski-circuit of 200km (skiable in both directions) linking the two villages and both sides of the valley, the area is a genuine intermediates' paradise. Even good beginners can manage easier versions of the ski-circuit, but there is also some quite challenging terrain (particularly on the Zwolferkogel) and some good off-piste, for strong skiers. With no fewer than eight ski schools, 30 four-star hotels and 65 restaurants, the resort has plenty of variety by day and by night: but it is not cheap. With tea-dances (sometimes the participants are still wearing their ski boots) and discos aplenty, Saalbach-Hinterglemm can also be something of a circus by night. Little of the original rustic ambience remains, and the two villages are effectively one and the same. ST ANTON St Anton may not be quite as pretty as Kitsbuhel, its main rival, but it wins hands down on its skiing, especially for the type of skier who likes a thigh-punishing, challenging day coupled with sublime scenery. At busy times, lift queues can still be a problem, but one has to adjust to the fact that the sort of queue that once made you groan when spotted from afar can melt away in three or four minutes when it is assembled at the entrance to a high-speed quad chair. Hence the recently installed Zammermoos quad makes mincemeat of lift-lines that used to clog up this vital artery to St Anton's prime skiing on the Valluga Grat and send you in retreat to ski Kapall instead. Apart from the Valluga - where everyone regarding themselves as good skiers wants to be - there is a huge network of cruising runs (160 miles of groomed runs in the St Anton/Arlberg region, plus almost as much off-piste). Do not miss the long run down to the delightful village of Stuben, and be sure to visit St Christoph (but not via the Arlenmahder]). Lech and Zurs are available on the same lift ticket, but you must get there by road unless you want to pay for a guide and ski one of the steepest and toughest runs in Austria off the back of the Valluga down to Zurs] SOLL Snooty skiers tend to dismiss - and bypass - Soll as a mass-market ski circus, yet the skiing is probably as good as that of Lech and Zurs where many snooty skiers ski. The best aspect of Soll's skiing is the joy (snow conditions permitting) of being able to ski the whole of the Ski-Welt Wilder Kaiser-Brixental region. You can ski from one resort to another, taking in Hopfgarten, Brixen, Going, Ellmau, Scheffau and Itter. The tour, never particularly difficult, can easily be accomplished in a day, and can be most rewarding for early intermediates who have never enjoyed the novelty of travelling from one village to another on skis. Faster skiers can take their pick from 90 lifts and more than 150 miles of pistes. Soll, with a much-improved flow of skiers to its middle-station since the installation of a modern gondola, has a considerable amount of good intermediate runs, and there are some challenging off-piste descents from the top of the Hohe Salve (7,000ft). ITALY BORMIO Bormio is traditionally the Italian resort that British skiers went to in the old days. It went off the boil after the 1985 World Championships, but with extended snowmaking there seems to be a revival of interest in this medieval spa town, which is part old world and part charmless suburb. Bormio's lift ticket also covers two other traditional British favourites, Santa Caterins and Livigno, as well as Valdisotto and and Valdidentro. The skiing, which strangely boasts 20 lifts but only 19 runs, is ideal for families and intermediates; extensive, but not very difficult, with a significant vertical drop of 5860ft (the longest run, Cima Bianca, a blue, is almost nine miles). A two-stage cable car takes skiers to the slopes of Monte Vallecetta (9,880ft). From here there are several options down to Bormio 2000. CERVINIA Most skiers know Cervinia as a day excursion across the Swiss border from Zermatt, but it is a destination resort in its own right, with good, uncomplicated high-altitude cruising, and mountain restaurants serving appetising if pricey fare. Cervinia also has good views of the 'wrong' side of the Matterhorn. Once known as Breuil, traditionally Zermatt's rival as a climbing centre, it was revamped by Mussolini, taking its new name from Mont Cervin, the alternative name for the Matterhorn. According to The Good Skiing Guide, Cervinia was 'once the showpiece of Italian ski resorts, a gleaming contemporary development where cable cars swept skiers to unprecedented heights and Italy's elite flocked to enjoy the novelty. Then they moved on, while Cervinia's lift system lapsed into disrepair.' There are signs of a comeback. The resort has been given a facelift, and a huge new cable-car was recently installed carrying 140 skiers to Plateau Rosa, the summer skiing area and link with Zermatt. (The links are not always open and can be very cold.) From Plateau Rosa the main run down is the celebrated Ventina, a five-mile descent which the whole family can ski. CORTINA D'AMPEZZO Cortina d'Ampezzo is a self-indulgent ski resort like Zermatt, Kitzbuhel, Megeve or Aspen where you can pamper yourself without ever needing to go near a pair of skis. That is reflected on the mountain: even when Cortina is packed with winter tourists, parading down the Corso Italia precinct in their fur coats and jewellery, there are rarely (unlike Zermatt and Kitzbuhel) queues on the slopes. With wonderful scenery, a cosmopolitan and picturesque town centre and excellent skiing for beginners and intermediates, it is a true international winter sports resort although since hosting the 1956 Winter Olympics it has not been at the forefront of international skiing. There is one more similarity with Zermatt: the skiing (up to almost 10,000ft) is spread out in three different areas in the mountains, and travelling between them all is inconvenient. It is best to stay in one or another, although you can at least get from Faloria, one of the most popular family areas, to Staunies (good steep skiing above Monte Cristallo) on skis. The nearest area to the town centre is Tofana/Socrepes. The third section of the cable car does not reach the ski slopes but provides a haven for sightseers and sunbathers. Cortina is close to but not fully linked with the Sella Ronda circuit of ski areas which makes an enjoyable and extremely scenic day-long tour. The link can be made via one of Cortina's small satellites, Passo Falzarego, along a seven-mile red run down to Armentarola near San Cassiano. COURMAYEUR For some skiers, Courmayeur is a delightful bijou resort with fun skiing and temptingly good mountain restaurants. For others the attraction is the challenge of the Italian side of Mont Blanc. Courmayeur, with a climbing history inextricably entwined with that of Chamonix, combines both images successfully. The main route to Courmayeur's skiing is in the resort's giant cable car to Plan Checrouit (5,600ft) where skis and boots can be stored. The short but challenging Checrouit runs - in a sizeable bowl - form the heart of Courmayeur's skiing. That area links with Val Veny, where the wooded, north-facing slopes tend to hold their snow better, and the runs are longer and more challenging. Another area, Cresta d'Arp has some good off-piste. This is good practice for Courmayeur's real challenge, the elderly three-stage cable cars that take you from outlying Entreves to Punta Helbronner (11,325ft). From here there are dramatic views around the Mont Blanc massif and all kinds of exciting options, all of which require the services of a guide. The obvious descent is the Italian version of the Vallee Blanche, returning by bus from Chamonix. The Toula Glacier back to Entreves is another popular itinerary, and there are several steep chutes and gulleys below the cable-car. SELVA Selva, also known as Wolkenstein, is the best known resort in an area of the Dolomites which has had something of a split personality ever since it became embroiled in bitter fighting when Italy entered the war against Austria in 1915, splitting the Tyrol. Towns that were part of the Austrian sud-Tyrol, acquired two names - one Italian, one German. Today, with its man-made snow system, Selva, in the Val Gardena, features early in the World Cup circuit. It is more famous, however, as the starting point in the Sella Ronda. This is a gentle, enjoyable jaunt on skis through or around as many as a dozen resorts in the four valleys surrounding the Gruppo Sella, a huge mountain surrounded by ancient pass routes linking dozens of old villages. The tour provides a scenic day out rather than a skiing challenge. The limestone Dolomites differ from the Alps: the monoliths tower above the ski fields, turning a dramatic shade of pink as the sun begins to set. Selva is also part of the vast Dolomiti Superski region which covers 38 resorts served by 464 lifts, all of which can be used on one lift pass. Most of the skiing traverses the contours of the Dolomites, but a few severe runs take a more vertical path and should only be skied with a guide. US ALTA, UTAH Alta is a cult ski area. Serious skiers speak of it in hushed tones. It may not be as big as Vail or have Jackson Hole's vertical drop, and it is not a destination resort, though less than an hour from Salt Lake City's airport. But when it comes to deep, dry powder it has few equals (one is Snowbird only a mile down Little Cottonwood Canyon). It has some good intermediate slopes such as Big Dipper and Rock and Roll, but Alta is famous for steep ungroomed chutes, on and off the trail map. The Greeley Bowls and the chutes off Spiney Ridge are attractions: to ski these in fresh powder - or even in falling snow - is the stuff of an off-piste skiers' dreams. High Rustler is another. Yet the resort has one of the cheapest lift passes in the Rockies. (Many old hands hike to secret powder caches.) ASPEN, COLORADO Aspen needs to be de-mystified. Although there is nominally no beginner terrain on Aspen's most famous mountain, Ajax, the skiing is not outrageously macho or difficult. It is a great mountain for anyone who can ski with a modicum of skill. The reason beginners are advised not to ski Ajax is because the homeward bound runs at the end of the day are like race-tracks. The town of Aspen may be pricey, but it is not snooty. There is not a single place in town - even the Caribou Club - where a tie is de rigueur. And film stars who turn up at local restaurants are treated like anyone else. The four mountains - Ajax, Buttermilk, Highlands (added to the Aspen Ski Company's portfolio last year) and Snowmass - offer diverse good skiing, with few rivals in the Rockies. BRECKENRIDGE, COLORADO Breckenridge carves out a big slice of the British ski market. Its attractions are easy to list: four different ski mountains (Peaks 7,8,9 and 10); a charming main street, with 350 original Victorian buildings renovated or reconstructed; good restaurants; and proximity to the other 'Ski The Summit' areas of Keystone, Copper Mountain, and Arapahoe Basin. It is also only 85 miles from Denver. The four mountains are quite different: Peak 8, the first to open, has terrain for all grades of skier, including Imperial Bowl, the highest in-bounds skiing in the USA at slightly less than 13,000ft. Peak 9 is more gentle (with a few nasty surprises) and Peak 10 has more difficult terrain. CRESTED BUTTE, COLORADO Crested Butte is a paradox: it is small yet marketed internationally, and has some of the gentlest and most challenging skiing in the Rockies. Its fame comes from its extreme skiing and two celebrities from very different backgrounds. Bill Johnson, America's first Olympic downhill gold-medallist (Sarajevo, 1984) and amiable enfant terrible, has been the resort's 'ski ambassador' for some years, and former president Carter and his wife Rosalyn are regular visitors. Crested Butte has one of the biggest programmes for disabled skiers in the country. It is also celebrated for its free skiing for all comers at the start of the season - a way of attracting skiers to spend money in the shops and hotels from mid-November to mid-December. (This gimmick is beginning to attract the wrong kind of clientele.) Few resorts can offer both such pussy-cat and petrifying skiing. HEAVENLY, CALIFORNIA Like the breathtakingly beautiful lake it overlooks, Heavenly ski area is intersected by the California-Nevada border, which gives the resort an odd stereoscopic ambiance. The two views from the top of Monument Peak are startlingly different (Lake Tahoe on the California side and the Nevada Desert on the other) and the base area of South Lake Tahoe also contrasts wildly. On the California side of the stateline, gambling is illegal. The Nevada side, however, is a Las Vegas-like miasma of light-bulbs announcing vast hotel-casinos and gambling joints. In winter, sunny California days often produce low temperatures at night. Heavenly makes the most of this with one of the biggest snow-making systems in the country. Two thirds of the area's boasted 150 miles of trails have snowmaking. Heavenly's terrain in both states is good intermediate cruising, but on the Nevada side Mott Canyon and the recently opened Killebrew Canyon provide an ungroomed enclave for experts. In fresh powder, Heavenly's skiable terrain expands further when tree skiing is possible among the stunted white-barked pines. JACKSON HOLE (WYOMING) Jackson Hole ski resort at Teton Village has built a reputation as one of the best ski areas in the US. It is not only the skiing, dynamic though it is, or the vertical drop of 4,139ft (not high by European standards, but the biggest in the US). It is the mix of slopes and scenery (the magnificent Teton mountain range); wildlife (moose, coyotes and America's largest elk reserve); wild-west atmosphere (wooden sidewalks and cowboy bars in the town of Jackson, 10 miles away); and wilderness (Yellowstone National Park is not far away) that provides Jackson's addictive atmosphere. Jackson is mainly for intermediates and experts in search of excitement and 'air' as the Americans describe 'lift off' on skis. Jackson's most famous chute is Corbet's Couloir, where skiers must leap anything from 12ft to 20ft. MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN, CALIFORNIA This ancient volcano is one of America's biggest ski resorts - six miles from one end to the other, divided into four areas. It is in a remote and wild part of the Eastern Sierras not far from Yosemite, arguably America's most beautiful national park, which you can visit from late May. There is often plenty of sunshine. Mammoth has dramatic scenery of its own, especially the jagged, toothy Minarets. The resort is 300 miles from Los Angeles where most of its clients come from. If it were much nearer, even Mammoth's extensive slopes (30 lifts serving almost 150 runs) would be in danger of being over-run. Many Los Angelinos and San Franciscans drive for six hours to get there at weekends. There is a lot of challenging skiing (Avalanche Chutes, Wipe Out, Paranoids and Gravy Chute) but plenty of easy-does-it cruising runs too, such as St Anton, Broadway and Forest Trail. A sister resort, June Mountain, with easier trails, is only half an hour away. Mammoth did not get its name as a result of being so spread out. During a gold rush in the late 1870s one mining company so dominated local claims that it was called the Mammoth Mining Company. SNOWBIRD, UTAH Snowbird has almost everything: excellent snow (500in a year); challenging bowls, one of the widest intermediate trails in the country (Big Emma); a large, fast cable-car (eight minutes to the top of Hidden Peak - 11,000ft); and attractive scenery: it is also only 29 miles from Salt Lake City international airport, which means that you can get a full day's skiing on your arrival day and leave late on your last day. If Snowbird has a flaw, it is its purpose-built architecture, dominated by the Cliff Lodge, a steel and glass monolith with 532 rooms: in European terms, Snowbird is more Flaine than Filzmoos. Snowbird's most challenging in-bounds skiing is in its steep-sided bowl areas: Gad Valley and Peruvian Gulch, where chutes serve as launching pads for those who like the 'free-fall' dimension of skiing. Those who prefer a quieter existence can still take the tram and ski Chip's Run, enjoying the same vertical drop and scenery as more aggressive skiers who opt for the Silver Fox or Primrose Path descents. Skiing Snowbird after a fresh fall of snow is exhilarating. SQUAW VALLEY, CALIFORNIA Of 15 ski areas scattered around the shores of Lake Tahoe - a spectacular stretch of water 12 miles wide and 22 miles long - Squaw Valley, at the North Shore, is the most challenging. Squaw's six mountains encompass every conceivable terrain: from the alarming moguls on the steep face of KT22 to the nursery slopes at High Camp on Emigrant Peak. Squaw also has some 'radical' skiing off the Pallisades, the setting for many of the leaps that end up in gung-ho ski videos. Squaw places emphasis on skiing more or less anywhere on 4,000 acres of open-bowl terrain rather than specific runs, but it does claim 100 miles of trails. KT22, Snow King, and Granite Chief provide almost entirely challenging terrain, while Squaw and Emigrant Peaks are benign. The other mountain, Broken Arrow, has a good mix of trails. Squaw claims to have the biggest fleet of grooming machines in North America, and its 33 lifts can carry almost 50,000 skiers an hour. SUN VALLEY, IDAHO Sun Valley is perhaps the only American ski resort with more mystique than Aspen. In its day, it had film stars, senators and celebrities flocking to its slopes like butterflies to buddleias. They came by train and stayed at the Sun Valley Lodge, often as guests of the resort. The resort was built by Averell Harriman, president of the Union Pacific Railway, after a long search to find a resort which would attract passengers during the lean winter months. Mount Baldy is a mountain with a good steep pitch and more than half a dozen bowls and a wealth of intermediate cruising runs. A chief snow-making programme and a luxurious new mountain restaurant, Seattle Ridge Lodge, have helped put Sun Valley back on the map. TAOS, NEW MEXICO Ernie Blake, a German-born Swiss who worked as an interrogator for Allied Intelligence in the war, invented this surreal enclave in the middle of New Mexico's Sangre de Cristo mountains 20 miles from the adobe town of Taos and the breathtaking Rio Grande Gorge. He invited the brothers Mayer to help him run the ski school and threw in a few British trail names. The result: an exotic mixture of cultural influences from European to Pueblo Indian that has made Taos a cult resort. There is a lot of good, steep skiing, but new arrivals can be daunted by the apparent steepness of Al's Pun. The easy skiing does exist: runs like Bambi and White Father are delightful. Then there are steeper runs than Al's. The reason good skiers come to Taos is for the steep, deep and ungroomed. The scalps that every 'serious' skier wants to collect are difficult to get to and to get down: the so-called Ridge Runs. One of the best is Thunderbird Trees. The most challenging skiing is off Kachina Peak, which is rarely open and involves a hike of at least an hour. Blake, who died four years ago, swore he would never ruin it by building lifts there. TELLURIDE, COLORADO Act One, Scene One: native American indians roam this wild but idyllic box canyon in a remote corner of South West Colorado. Scene Two: silver is discovered, the indians are dispossessed and a wild mining community springs up, huddled beneath the mighty San Juan Mountains. Boom turns to slump and thriving mining town becomes windswept semi-ghost town. Act Two - The Present: Telluride becomes a sophisticated cult ski resort and claims to be 'the most beautiful place you will ever ski'. Telluride, where Butch Cassidy robbed the San Miguel Valley Bank in 1889, with a red-light district which was never short of customers, has turned respectable - almost genteel. Yet in the old main street, dominated by the 'New' Sheridan Hotel, little has changed. The ski slopes, famously steep in places such as Gold Hill and the Face  - black-diamond trails off lifts 7,8 and 9 (you can see Telluride between your ski boots if you look down from The Plunge) - also have acres of carefree cruising such as See For Ever. San Joaquin Village is surrounded by some of the easiest skiing. VAIL/BEAVER CREEK, COLORADO For many, Vail is the best all-round ski area in North America. It is one of the largest, claiming to be the biggest single-mountain resort in the US. Critics who claim Vail's skiing is bland in spite of its size get a five-letter word in response: bowls. Vail has some of the best back-bowls in North America - seven altogether: Game Creek, Sun Up, Sun Down, Tea Cup, and more recently, China, Siberia and Mongolia Bowls. More open next year. These areas, shaped like large soup-bowls, are left ungroomed in the hope that they will be filled with fluffy powder or deep, soft snow. Vail is a young resort, which sometimes prompts its biggest rival, Aspen, to poke fun at it. Recently - with stagnation creeping into the American skiing industry - the two areas have developed a tentative alliance and are marketed as twin-centre resorts. Vail was built in the early 1960s in the image of a Tyrolean/Bavarian hybrid. The resort has a cosmopolitan atmosphere and varied cuisine. The skiing is a cruisers' delight, with more than two thirds of the 110 runs graded beginner or intermediate. The Summit County resorts of Breckenridge, Keystone, Arapahoe Basin and Copper Mountain are all within 30 or 40 miles. CANADA APEX Apex Resort, 5,200ft up in British Columbia's Okanagan Valley near Penticton, will be almost unrecognisable this winter: more than Dollars 10m has been spent on improving the ski area, developing its Wild West theme (the Gunbarrel saloon's speciality is coffee made with brandy and Cointreau flambeed into the glass down the double-barrel of a shotgun). The new Holiday Inn 'Sun Spree' resort hotel at Apex Mountain village will provide 89 rooms, and a new high-speed detachable quad to the summit - 'Quickdraw' - replaces two old chairs, cutting travelling time to less than six minutes. There are seven new trails, with names like Outlaw and Maverick, and a summer-grooming programme (removing rocks, widening trails, etc) has been carried out on existing trails like Gunbarrel, Magnum 22, Buckshot and flanks. Make My Day - a chute whose name was inspired by Clint Eastwood movies - will also be a smoother ski, but just as challenging. A new snowmaking system has also been installed. Apex now has 52 trails on its two mountain faces (Apex and Beaconsfield peaks) almost half of them intermediate grade, with 10 per cent novice standard and about a third of them in the advanced/expert category. With skiing up to about 7,200ft, the vertical drop is 2,000ft. BANFF/LAKE LOUISE Technically Banff/Lake Louise comprises three different ski areas (Mount Norquay/Mystic Ridge, Sunshine Village and Lake Louise itself) but as they are up to 30 miles apart, it seems arbitrary to try to 'link' them. Lake Louise is the showpiece, in terms of skiing (four mountain faces on Mounts Whitehorn and Lipalian, five bowls and more than 3,250 vertical foot drop) and outstanding scenery - there are more than a dozen peaks that reach 10,000ft or more. Each chair has an easy way down for novice skiers. Sunshine Village, which straddles the Continental Divide and the Alberta/British Columbia border, is a high altitude resort with good intermediate slopes above the tree-line. It can be bleak and cold in bad weather, but if you catch it on a good day, the scenery including Canada's 'Matterhorn' (Mount Assiniboine) is dramatic. Mount Norquay, now mystified with the prefix 'Mystic Ridge', is Banff's local ski area, and probably the oldest resort in Canada. Small but steep, a whole new upper-intermediate area with 12 new runs was recently opened up on 'Mystic Ridge'. But Norquay is still best known for a run called Lone Pine, described in The Insider's Guide to the Best Canadian Skiing as 'an unforgiving brute legendary for its unrelenting vertical and monster moguls'. Banff/Lake Louise is celebrated for its railway hotels built for Canadian Pacific passengers. The Banff Springs is perched above the town, while Chateau Lake Louise is in the most stunning lake-side location with views of five glaciers. BIG WHITE With a base elevation of 5,450ft, Big White, in the heart of the Monashees, is the highest ski resort in British Columbia. The terrain is unusually varied, with steep gulleys and bowls (the recently opened Parachute Bowl was the location for the Canadian Speed Skiing Championships three years ago) and there are good cruising runs like Roller Coaster, Speculation and Villager as well as tree skiing in Paradise Glades. The 1,000 skiable acres are divided between groomed slopes and bowls and glades. At higher elevations, snow on the trees often freezes, turning them into the so-called 'snow-ghosts' that are the hallmark of Canada's higher resorts. The Ridge Rocket Quad, which almost bisects the resort, is the main artery to much of the skiing. The terrain between the Rocket and Big White's other main quad, Bullet, is almost entirely lower intermediate and intermediate. The main expert terrain can be found off the Powder and Falcon chairs, at present on the outer perimeter of the ski area, although the resort has expansion plans. PANORAMA Panorama, which emerged as a significant ski area a decade or so ago, is now famous for three things: helicopter skiing, day trippers, and vertical feet. Recently the resort built a new lift (the Summit T-bar) up to its Top of the World area, giving it 4,300 vertical feet - more than Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the US's biggest vertical drop. All this, including 43 trails, is accomplished with only eight lifts. Panorama is long and lean; its vertical drop is achieved by having one chief spine-like ridge (served on one flank by the Quadzilla chair and on the other by the Sunbird triple chair) but few ribs. Although it is situated on the edge of the Bugaboos in the Purcell Mountains  -ranges well-known to helicopter skiers - Panorama relies on its snow-making system to keep its runs well-covered. Almost three quarters of its terrain is topped up with artificial snow, which makes many of the trails a little unforgiving, though good for strong intermediates and above who enjoy high-speed cruising. Panorama also provides the setting for helicopter skiing outings with RK Heliski, mainly from Banff, two hours away, and specialises in newcomers requiring 'easy pace' descents. RED MOUNTAIN If Canada has a low-profile cult resort legendary among the cognoscenti for being steep and deep, Red Mountain is it. Yet it has only four lifts serving the 30 trails on its two peaks. (Red Mountain is the original, easier mountain, and Granite, with a vertical drop of 2,800ft is by far the bigger.) Statistics tell you much about the resort's profile. Snowmaking: none (hardly ever needed). Expert terrain: 45 per cent. The Kootenay region between the US border and Revelstoke is home to three of the world's most famous helicopter skiing ranges: the Monashees, Purcells, and Selkirks. Skiing was introduced to the area a century ago by Norwegian gold miners in nearby Rossland, one of British Columbia's few genuine old mining towns turned ski resorts. The first ski competitions were held here before the turn of the century. These racers' pioneering efforts led to the Winter Olympic triumphs of Nancy Greene (1968) and Kerin Lee-Gartner (1992), two of Rossland's most famous ski racers. Apart from Red's many powder options, it has one of the best cruising trails in North America: Long Squaw. SILVER STAR Silver Star ski area, in the Okanagan Valley on the edge of the famous Monashee Mountains, changed itself from a friendly (really friendly: lift attendants sometimes hug skiers) 'ma and pa' ski hill, to a destination resort by developing the terrain it most lacked: 23 trails for advanced intermediates and experts at Putnam Creek Basin. That also doubled its size, making it the second largest ski area in British Columbia (after Whistler/Blackcomb) and increased its vertical drop to 2,500ft, the biggest in the Okanagan (famous for its wines). Putnam Creek and the original slopes at Vance Creek are linked by a long quad chair which enables skiers either to make continuous loops back into Putnam Creek or to return to base. Silver Star, with its brightly coloured imitation l890s architecture from the 'Victorian gaslight era' is one of the most attractive resorts in Canada. Many trail names reflect the area's mining history or echo its name: Lone Star, Milky Way, Constellation and Big Dipper are all easy cruising runs in Vance Creek. WHISTLER/BLACKCOMB For many skiers these two towering mountains that stand shoulder to shoulder near the western seaboard of British Columbia provide the best skiing in North America. They have the biggest vertical drop, with more than 5,000ft of skiing on both mountains, a full 1,000ft more than Jackson Hole, the highest in the US. Yet 30 years and some Dollars 600m ago there was nothing here except the mountains. Until then, the munificent snow caused by the moist Pacific air meeting the craggy mountain-tops fell silently and was skied only by the few prepared to hike up. Now Whistler's bowls and Blackcomb's glaciers - and the huge network of other trails in between (almost 200 in all) - are served by 24 lifts. One of Whistler's problems is the weather that produces so much good snow: in spite of its big vertical drop, the height of Whistler Village (purpose-built and car-free) is only 2,140ft (almost 500ft lower than Kitzbuhel, one of the lowest important resorts in Europe). That means it is often raining down in the village while it is snowing on the slopes. Rain is an off-putting sight to skiers weighing up whether to venture out on the slopes or not. In Whistler, it is nearly always worth giving the weather the benefit of the doubt. S AMERICA CHAPELCO (Argentina) Chapelco is an intermediate ski area that has sprouted horns. It started life in 1978, but like Gran Catedral, Bariloche, its more famous neighbour 75 miles to the south, it could not guarantee good snow. Skiers from Buenos Aires who once knew Chapelco for its gentle, tree-lined runs are now confused by Chapelco's more machismo image. They complain that while money is poured into the thrilling terrain on the upper slopes, they lack good snow below the tree-line at 5,000ft. The situation is aggravated by the fact that Chapelco's slopes face north (the 'wrong' way for a southern hemisphere resort). Chapelco is a substantial ski area: it has 10 lifts and 35 runs. EL COLORADO (Chile) With 16 lifts and 25 trails, El Colorado is Chile's biggest and arguably most popular ski area, at least at weekends, when day trippers flock here from Santiago, the capital which - pollution allowing - is at times visible in the valley below. El Colorado's cone-shaped peak, with south-facing slopes, has good cruising with excellent off-piste below the cliffs on the south-eastern edge of the resort. A guide is advisable and a pick-up vehicle essential. GRAN CATEDRAL, BARILOCHE (Argentina) There is much to like about this cosmopolitan resort on the banks of Lake Nahuel Huapi: but two things let it down. It has an unpredictable snow record, for which it can hardly be blamed, and it is not well organised. Indifferent organisation is often the fate of ski resorts which have lifts run by different companies. Bariloche is no exception. One manifestation is poor piste marking. In fresh snow, it is hard to tell poles indicating rocks from those marking the way down. That is a serious problem in a resort with 32 lifts, 50 trails, and a vertical drop of 3,280ft. Heini Kempel, director of the Gran Catedral ski school and formerly of Argentina's demonstration ski team, believes one day soon Bariloche - with its excellent cruising runs on the upper slopes, its chutes and bowls below Punta Nevada, and the Carlitos and La Hoya mogul runs - will live up to its reputation as South America's best ski resort. LA PARVA (Chile) La Parva may have the edge over Portillo as the best single ski area in Chile. Portillo has more dramatic terrain and scenery, but La Parva has more choice. It has the biggest vertical drop: 3,150ft. Such is the variety of skiing options and scenery that days on the mountain rush by. The problem with La Parva is that it is more a glorified ski club village than a resort. It has no big hotel. La Parva has 13 lifts, most of them going to interesting places, especially the new Barros Hegros chair, reputedly the longest quad in South America. There are 20 listed runs, but much off-piste skiing opens up after a good snowfall. LAS LENAS (Argentina) While Bariloche would like to think it has the most important skiing in Argentina, that honour probably belongs to Las Lenas. No other resort in South America has such an extraordinary choice of chutes, gulleys and other off-piste delights. Las Lenas has an unusual history: almost 20 years ago the then owners of the land (two brothers who ran a food and manufacturing company) were kidnapped by guerrillas who demanded a ransom of USDollars 60m. Released unharmed, the brothers sold to the present owners, who opened the resort in 1983. Many of lifts and hotels have astrological themes: Piscis is the best hotel, Geminis the smallest. Venus is a beginner chair, and Neptune accesses the most exciting and important lift in the resort, Marte (Mars). PORTILLO (Chile) Owned by the American Purcell brothers, this is probably the best-run ski resort in the continent and among the most spectacular, in a steep sided valley. It has introduced snow-making on a realistic level, its pistes are well-groomed and signposted, and it has expert avalanche control. The resort is dominated by the colonial-style Hotel Portillo, the emphasis on old-fashioned style, comfort, and values. The skiing is exotic and slightly eccentric. It is possible to ski to the lake, and to be rowed back or to ski back on the ice. The steep avalanche chutes are a big attraction: two are served by unique Va et Vient lifts. These have no lift towers, but drag skiers up on high-speed platters suspended in mid-air. The run kept open at almost all costs is the mile-long plateau run; a perfect pitch for most skiers, a classic cruising run with no awkward moments. TERMAS DE CHILLAN (Chile) There are several volcano ski areas in Chile's Lake District: most have exciting scenery but their skiing is compromised, either by wet or windy conditions. Termas de Chillan is perhaps the only one that manages to maintain reasonably good skiing conditions. The resort is 51 miles from Chillan, the birthplace of Bernardo O'Higgins, Chile's great revolutionary hero and first president. Its Don Otto chairlift, at 1 1/2 miles, is the longest in South America. From the top, skiers have a choice of some exquisite off-piste gulleys and ravines. VALLE NEVADO (Chile) Valle Nevado is pure deja vu: a French purpose-built ski area rising straight out of the Andes below the awe-inspiring peak of El Plomo (17,815ft). It was built and is owned by Spie Batignolles, one of France's biggest construction companies. Valle Nevado was completed in 1988 in the image of what international skiers might expect from a modern European resort. AUSTRALASIA CORONET PEAK (NZ) Queenstown's old ski area is across the Wakatipu Valley from the town's more recent resort, The Remarkables, and commands superb views of both the mountains and Lake Wakatipu. Snow-making has been extended and Coronet Peak now claims the most trails (10km) with snow cannon in New Zealand. Beginners have not been forgotten; there is a new novice area, Peak Meadows. Coronet Peak's trails provide a good mix for novices and intermediates, with a wealth of blue cruising trails like M1, Wall Street, Greengates and Shirtfront. In good powder, the runs to try are the Back Bowls and Sara Sue. MOUNT BULLER (Aus) Mount Buller is located in Victoria's High Country, three hours drive from Melbourne. It is Australia's biggest resort in terms of lifts and now it wants to build more on Mount Stirling, a cross country resort across the valley. The locals are indignant about Buller's plans to build lifts. The trails at Buller command some of the most breathtaking scenery of any ski area in Australia. MOUNT COOK (NZ) Not a ski resort as such (although skiing in South Island started here in the early 1920s) but the setting for flights by ski-plane to the outstandingly beautiful Tasman Glacier. Skiers are transported 11 miles or so from an air strip near Mount Cook Village by Swiss Pilatus ski-planes which land at the top of the glacier. MOUNT HUTT (NZ) Rising high above the Canterbury Plains, 90 minutes from Christchurch, Mount Hutt is one of the first ski areas in the southern hemisphere to open, with skiing from May to October. Severe storms can sometimes close the resort or make the long, precarious road (the highest in New Zealand) too dangerous to negotiate, hence its nickname of Mount Shut. But snow conditions are often excellent, with good powder. Mount Hutt has snow making facilities covering 100 acres. Beginner and intermediate trails such as Broadway and Morning Glory dominate the central section of the ski area, with most of the challenging black runs on both perimeters. With a vertical drop of 2,150ft (one of the biggest in Australasia), Mount Hutt has 900 acres of skiing served by 10 lifts. Helicopter skiing is also available. PERISHER/SMIGGINS (Australia) As you would expect from a ski area owned by Kerry Packer and run by his son James, Perisher markets itself aggressively. It needs to. The enemy is on both sides: Thredbo to the South, Blue Cow to the North. Perisher makes great play of having more than twice as many slopes above 5,400ft than any other Australian resort. Perisher Valley itself is flat, yet there is seriously steep skiing below Olympic Steppes (sometimes producing formidable deep-snow skiing, but more often great moguls) and some of the runs off Mount Perisher are challenging. THE REMARKABLES (NZ) When you first gaze up at the jagged, snow-encrusted teeth of The Remarkables, which dominate the Queenstown skyline, you cannot work out where there could possibly be any skiing. But The Remarkables offers good beginner and intermediate terrain in a large bowl scooped out on the benign side of the pinnacles. There is challenging skiing, although there are only three lifts (apart from beginners' tows): from the Shadow Basin chair at least 10 black runs can be reached. THREDBO (Australia) Thredbo has spent almost Pounds 30m on improvements in the last seven years (including a new express quad chair, The Cruiser) and this has probably turned it into Australia's best ski resort. At the foot of Mount Crackenback and less than four miles from Australia's highest peak, Mount Kosciusko, Thredbo has the most attractive village, the biggest vertical drop (9ft short of New Zealand's highest at Whakapapa) and a snow-making system claimed to be the largest in the southern hemisphere. Thredbo also claims the longest run in the country, the Village Trail (3.5 miles). TREBLE CONE (NZ) Some of the steepest in-resort slopes in New Zealand can be found at Treble Cone, beneath the flanks of New Zealand's Southern Alps. Strong skiers are attracted to the area, and will often walk the last 800ft to the summit to achieve fresh tracks in powder and a bonus to the 2,000 vertical feet the lifts offer. Recently the resort has been trying to encourage family skiers too. Treble Cone is well-known for its population of Keas, New Zealand's mischievous Alpine parrot. TUROA (NZ) New Zealand's second biggest ski area is on the same volcano as the biggest (Whakapapa). But Turoa's terrain is very different. Its main attraction is a series of long, undulating gulleys which can provide skiers with fine off-piste cruising. Turoa was conceived as recently as the 1970s as an overspill resort for Whakapapa. It is possible to traverse between the two resorts, but a complete link is unlikely because of environmental pressures. WHAKAPAPA (NZ) Even down-under, skiers are only beginning to be alerted to the qualities of this excellent resort. Whakapapa, probably New Zealand's oldest skiing centre, combines awe-inspiring terrain and scenery. It is built on the flanks of Mount Ruapehu, one of three dramatic volcanoes that rise from nowhere in the middle of North Island. From the Whakapapa side, a series of half a dozen individual peaks dominate the skyline. Between these peaks are a number of gulleys which can be negotiated by advanced skiers prepared to hike up to reach them. Below the gulleys is more extreme terrain which can be reached from the Valley T-bar lift. JAPAN HAPPO ONE The Hakuba Valley is probably the best skiing region in Japan, and Happo One is the jewel among its five resorts - seven if you count the tiny areas of Hakuba Minekata and Hakuba Highland across the valley. With a backdrop of serious peaks reaching almost 10,000ft, Happo One will stage the blue riband event of the 1998 Olympics: the men's downhill. It will also be staging the men's Super-G and ski jumping. (Shiga Kogen will host most of the remaining events.) Happo has 35 lifts and the prettiest resort village - a slightly Walt Disneyish collection of crenellated, mock Tudor buildings through which winds an attractive narrow street lined with shops and restaurants. The Hokuba Valley is one of the longer train journeys from Tokyo (3hr 25min by limited express, with an awkward platform change at Matsumoto) but well worth the effort. NAEBA Naeba, in Niigata prefecture is Japan's ultimate ski 'factory' and because of the huge numbers of skiers sometimes found on the mountain (41,000 was the record one Sunday a few years ago) it would not be the ideal introduction to Japanese skiing for tourists. It is extremely popular with Tokyo businessmen because it is relatively close to Tokyo and there are lifts open from 4.30am until 11pm. There are plenty of hotels in the area, yet some skiers sleep on the benches in the locker rooms for a few hours and then set off to ski at 4.30am. Naeba has 31 lifts, a substantial number of trails - mainly beginner and intermediate - and there are some good powder options. NOZAWA ONSEN Buses packed with skiers leave Tokyo before dawn for the long journey to this attractive ski area in the northern part of Nagano prefecture. Nozawa Onsen combines a delightfully traditional ski village with good skiing and - as the word Onsen denotes - hot springs. It has 32 lifts and a good variety of terrain: in the right conditions there is good powder skiing at the top of the area (reached by a five minute gondola ride) and some attractive tree-lined beginner slopes lower down. There is also night skiing available. SHIGA KOGEN Shiga Kogen, which will co-host the 1998 Nagano winter Olympics with Happo One, is a microcosm of Japanese skiing. It is an extraordinary patchwork quilt of small ski areas - 22 in all, sharing 75 lifts - which, rather like a Japanese version of the Portes du Soleil, can be visited on skis in a day or two at the most. But do not expect too much in the way of challenging skiing. Shiga Kogen is reached from Tokyo (Ueno station) by limited express on the Shin-etsu line to Nagano (just under three hours) followed by another train journey of 45 minutes to Yudanaka and a bus ride. ZAO The mountains of Japan's central highlands and the Japan Alps are numerous, and if you include the more remote and less crowded slopes of Hokkaido, Japan has an estimated 600 ski 'areas' (many very small, mostly medium sized) of which perhaps only 20 have an international flavour. Of these Zao, in the north-east of Honshu in Yamagata prefecture - a three-hour journey from Tokyo, followed by a 45-minute bus drive - is recognised as one of the best. As well as an astonishing number of lifts for a Japanese resort (42), Zao has all the prerequisites that western skiers imagine they will find in the Japan Alps: hot springs, night skiing and juhyo (tree monsters)] These are not demons that live in the trees, but the trees themselves that become so thickly coated with ice and snow that they form surreal, ghostly shapes. Forty per cent of the slopes are considered easy skiing, with just 20 per cent designated expert terrain.</p>

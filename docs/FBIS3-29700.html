			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kunachada Chaiphiphat under the "Viewpoint" </F> rubric: "Taking a Risk on `Holiday Diplomacy'" -- first  paragraph is THE NATION introduction]    [Excerpts] Taiwan President Li Teng-hui came to play golf,  but those very unofficial, very private chats he had with top  businessmen from three of China's regional allies certainly  roiled the waters. Was it worth it?    The so-called "holiday diplomacy" trip to Thailand by  Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui, which ended on Wednesday, has  prompted some tough questions here.    First, is the visit to be seen as a test of wills between  those who uphold Thailand's One-China policy and those who are  hearing Taiwan's money talk -- or was it aimed at garnering  political support from economic partners throughout the world?  Second, was the "one-metre march", as President Li described  his Southeast Asia tour, a signal that the island nation is  making a diplomatic move toward declaring itself a new state --  and will China use force to stop it? Third, what does Thailand  stand to gain from the visit? [passage omitted]    Elsewhere in Asean or the Indochinese states newly recovered  from wars and needing massive foreign investment, Taiwanese  businessmen always come in force and are invariably given a warm  welcome.    Save for promoting national identity to weld together the  mainland's plethora of diverse ethnic minorities and autonomous  regions, it seems pointless for China to try and stop her  neighbours from doing business with Taiwan. At the same time, it  is too early to say whether Taiwan will be able to successfully  swing political support over to its side.    A senior security official says China and Taiwan's  relationship will continue to be a classic display of diplomacy,  until the two sides settle their differences either by peace or  by force. "Taiwan's aspiration is to exist as a state separate  from China, in much the same way as North Korea and South Korea  co-exist."    At this point no country, not even the United States, which  helped separate the Korean peninsula, would put money on the  Taiwanese side. "The overriding interest of the United States,  in maintaining a peaceful presence in this region, is to  befriend China," said the expert.    Hypothetically, he said, if Li's provocative tour was a test  of world support for Taiwan declaring itself a new state, the  island's best hope would be that global support would prevent  China from using military force in response. This hypothesis  will have some basis in fact if what President Li told local  reporters when he returned home is translated into action. Li  jokingly said he needed to march a hundred metres in order to  gain world support. [passage omitted]    The same official said things will be much clearer after  Hong  Kong is handed back to China in 1997. "How China treats Hong  Kong will have far-reaching implications for Taiwan too."    Thai officials at the Foreign Ministry said the economic  gains to be made in allowing Li's visit are not evident. In the  Philippines, Taiwanese businessmen are keen to turn Subic Bay  into an industrial zone, while Indonesia and Taiwanese investors  are planning to build an aircraft factory in Bundung. A senior  official said the visit to Thailand was a gain for the  Taiwanese. "Taiwan can claim back home that it has surmounted  the Southeast Asian wall," he said.    Thailand, the official noted, has had both good and bitter  experiences with China in terms of history and culture. "Why  didn't China make as much noise in Singapore as it did here?" he  asked. [passage omitted]    It is true Taiwanese investment in Thailand appears to have  reached the saturation point. The choice of the Philippines and  Indonesia as the first two stops shows where the priorities of  Taiwanese investors lie. Board of Investment figures show that  Taiwanese investment here has dropped from Bt [baht] 6.4 billion  in 1991 to Bt5.96 billion in 1993. The turn-down has  contributed to the relocation of the investment market to China  and Vietnam.    So there are good reasons to encourage additional investment  and to welcome Li without "violating the understanding, reached  on the Taiwan issue", as China claimed. Moreover, even if  Taiwanese investment has peaked in Thailand itself, there is  plenty of opportunity for the Taiwanese to play a key part in  the newborn Growth Quadrangle and the yet-to-take off triangular  economic cooperation involving Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.  [passage omitted]    It is perhaps a bit unfortunate for Thailand to have been  the  last stop on Li's three-nation tour after so much propaganda  from Taipei. [passage omitted]    As it turned out, the personal nature of the visit to  Thailand was self-evident. The Chinese would only have to look  at the people who received Li -- Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai  Wirawan (known as Lin Ri Guang due to his business connections  with Taiwan), his cousins and a few Thai businessmen including  Utane Techaphaibun and Chatri Sophonphanit. They all had  business reasons for talking with the visitors. [passage omitted]</p>

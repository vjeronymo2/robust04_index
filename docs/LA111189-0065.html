			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WALL CRUMBLES;  </P> <P> GREAT ESCAPES  </P> <P> Thousands of people defied the Berlin Wall's concrete, barbed wire, guards and  automatic machine guns during its 28-year history. As many as 40,000 escaped.  Most of these, 25,428, fled in the first 14 weeks after the wall was built,  until Christmas, 1961. One hundred or more died -- most shot by East German  border guards, according to officials at the Wall Museum at Checkpoint Charlie.  Some of the most daring escapes:  </P> <P> On Nov. 14, 1961, five people escaped in an old Opel four-seat car that was so  heavy with scrap-metal armor plating it could hardly move.  </P> <P> By Christmas, 1961, 81-year-old East Berlin truck driver Erwin Becker, digging  alone, had completed a 100-foot tunnel from a basement close to the wall. He  led 28 people to freedom, then returned and organized another tunnel-digging  group. They started from his small garden near the border. Becker was by then  too weak to dig, but he stood guard, and all got out.  </P> <P> In November, 1962, 29 young people escaped through "Tunnel 29," dug starting  from West Berlin and running 395 feet. Solidly built, the tunnel could have  been used for a long time but was flooded when a water pipe burst.  </P> <P> In 1964, six people were brought out, one at a time, by contorting themselves  into a minuscule space created by removing the heater and manifold of an  Isetta, a tiny three-wheeled car.  </P> <P> The night of March 30-31, 1983, two men on the eastern side of the wall shot an  arrow -- the tip weighted with steel and trailing a thin nylon wire -- to a  lower rooftop in the west. A helper on the western side then hauled a stronger  steel wire across and the two men slid across on pulleys.  </P> <P> A girl in West Berlin made an imitation U.S. Army uniform, obtaining buttons  and insignia by saying they were for a theater production. She borrowed a Ford  sedan, stole U.S. military license plates and drove to East Berlin, bringing  back two friends who were engaged to marry.  </P> <P> In East Berlin, another young woman made Soviet Army uniforms for three male  student friends. They were respectfully saluted by East German border guards  when they drove over to West Berlin, the girl hiding in the trunk.  </P> <P> Truck driver Klaus Brueske became a hero when he used his truck to smash  through a frontier barrier and bring out family and friends. He was shot and  fatally wounded but kept driving until safely across.  </P> <P> "Tunnel 57," also named for the number of escapees, was the longest of all at  475 feet. It was also 39 feet underground at one point. It was dug by 36  students in 10 months from a toilet outhouse in East Berlin to a closed bakery  on the western side.  </P> <P> East German security forgot about a sewer leading from Gleinstrasse in East  Berlin to the western side, and more than 100 people used it before it was  discovered -- when an 18-year-old girl lacked the strength to replace the  manhole cover.  </P> <P> At the Luisen cemetery, students dug down through a grave, using the gravestone  to hide the entrance to their tunnel. About 200 people made it out before the  route was discovered by guards who noticed an empty baby carriage next to the  grave.  </P></p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Ferranti managers plan two buy-outs Management teams running different parts of Ferranti International will this week attempt two separate buy-outs from the receiver. One team wants to buy Ferranti's components division in Oldham, Greater Manchester. The other, based in Bracknell, Berkshire, wants to buy the software division and enter a supply agreement for hardware from Oldham. Arthur Andersen, the receiver, said yesterday there was outside interest in buying the business whole, which might prove more convenient and attractive. Andersen suggested potential buyers were not necessarily interested in manufacturing and might subsequently divest from Oldham, where 450 people are employed, possibly selling to the management. The Oldham buy-out team, led by Mr Angus Mincher, managing director, has made a bid after securing equity finance last week. Mr Ian Sinderson of Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm acting as the team's corporate finance adviser, said three banks were competing to provide loan and working capital. The Bracknell buy-out team is being led by Mr Phil Burton, the local chief executive. Finance is almost in place and the team expects to make a bid this week. The Ferranti group employs about 2,150 - a tenth of the payroll at its peak.</p>

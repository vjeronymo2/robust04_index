			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Investment fall hits recovery Japan's economic recovery is being constrained by a continuing decline in corporate investment, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister, warned yesterday, writes William Dawkins. The economy was out of the tunnel, thanks to a pick-up on corporate profits, personal consumption and housing investment. Yet structural problems remained. Mr Murayama's analysis was borne out by the latest batch of economic statistics yesterday, showing recovery overshadowed by a further, though decelerating, fall in corporate capital spending. Investment in plant and equipment fell an annualised 9.5 per cent in the three months to September, making a record 11 consecutive quarters of decline, the Finance Ministry's latest survey of 24,000 companies shows. Officials think the capital investment fall may be bottoming out, from a much steeper 16.8 per cent decline in the previous quarter. In previous recoveries, capital investment has recovered strongly. One reason for mild optimism is the recovery in pre-tax profits uncovered by the survey. They rose 28.9 per cent in the three months to September, from a year earlier, the first such rise in four years. This compared with a 0.2 per cent drop in the previous quarter. Japan's Economic Planning Agency said its monthly index of business conditions continued upwards. The EPA's coincident index, a basket of indicators measuring business conditions, stood at 70 in October, up from 60 in the previous month. It is the third month the index has stood above 50, the divide between growth and decline, and clear evidence the economy is recovering, the EPA said. The leading index, a pointer to conditions six months ahead, fell from 58.3 in September to 50 in October, breaking a nine-month period when it had hovered above the dividing line.</p>

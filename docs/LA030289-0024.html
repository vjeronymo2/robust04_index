			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: THEY'RE PUSHING TOO FAR  </P> <P> Butch van Breda Kolff, who has coached Picayune High School in New Orleans and  the Lakers, with a women's pro basketball team in between, is in the second  year of his second stint as coach at Hofstra University. He is more  disillusioned than ever.  </P> <P> "The NCAA has made it so the game is played for the spectator," he told  Newsday. "The NCAA wants to put on a show, TV, hoopla, hype. It's ceased being  a sport. It's a sham.  </P> <P> "Let's be honest. They don't want to blow the whistle. The game's too physical.  Bully-ball is what it's become. The fundamentals of the game are being  completely forgotten.  </P> <P> "All the kids want to be Dr. J, but nobody can throw a two-hand pass anymore."  </P> <P> Add van Breda Kolff: He last coached Hofstra in 1962, before moving on to the  National Basketball Assn. Since then, he admits, there have been changes.  </P> <P> "The biggest change I've had to go through is the change in bureaucracy," he  said. "When I started at Lafayette, I had no assistants. I did everything  myself, plus I coached soccer and lacrosse. I was a good soccer coach. But  lacrosse? Terrible. The first game I coached was the first I ever saw. We went  0-9 that year and I said, 'Well, we can't do any worse next year,' and then the  A.D. went out and scheduled 10 games."  </P> <P> Department of what goes around, etc: According to Duane Thomas' biography,  "Duane Thomas and the Fall of America's Team," Tony Dorsett was once heard  remonstrating about his unceremonious demotion in favor of Herschel Walker.  </P> <P> This was well in advance of Coach Tom Landry's own demotion, which was at least  as unceremonious.  </P> <P> "A guy shouldn't have to read it in the papers," Dorsett complained. "(Tom)  Landry or the general manager owes it to us. We should hear it first from  them."  </P> <P> Hall of Famer Whitey Ford got to calculating when Roger Clemens' contract with  Boston was announced.  </P> <P> "As I figure it, and I think I'm right, the Red Sox are paying Roger Clemens  $600 a pitch," he said.  </P> <P> This, the former New York Yankees star said, contrasts with his $16.60-a-pitch  season, when he earned $78,000.  </P> <P> Continuing to calculate, Ford worked out figures that showed Kirby Puckett will  earn $4,000 an at-bat this season. Fellow Hall of Famer Mickey Mantle,  meanwhile, made $200 per at-bat in his highest-salaried year.  </P> <P> Not ready for prime time: Others may have noticed it, but it took Phil Jackman  of the Baltimore Evening Sun to point it out.  </P> <P> "On the same day the NBA announced that 14 games will be broadcast in the  Soviet Union beginning next month, a station in Los Angeles said it was cutting  back on Clipper games," Jackman wrote.  </P> <P> There's a lesson there somewhere.  </P> <P> Attention, Whitey Ford: It might be comforting to all the old-timers to know  that Joe DiMaggio, though he never made more than $100,000 as the Yankee  Clipper, is now pulling down $5,000 an hour at baseball card shows.  </P> <P> What goes around, continued: UCLA Coach Jim Harrick, whose team scored its  biggest victory this season after a controversial goaltending call against  Louisville, was nevertheless complaining about the officiating recently.  </P> <P> "I haven 't seen them give us any breaks this year," he said, then paused.  "Well, except for one."  </P> <P> Quotebook  </P> <P> Fighting Irish football Coach Lou Holtz, after the shortest Morning Briefing  off-season ever, had this to say about Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson's moving on to  the Dallas Cowboys. "Better that than at Notre Dame."  </P></p>

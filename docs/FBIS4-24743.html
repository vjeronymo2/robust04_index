			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Today, the provincial CPC Committee and  government held a mobilization meeting on structural reform in  organs directly under the provincial authorities and the  implementation of a state civil service system to make  arrangements for pursuing a plan to create a state civil service  system in the Guangdong provincial party and government organs.  The plan has recently been approved by the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council. Zhu Senlin, provincial party  deputy secretary and governor, made an important speech at the  meeting. [passage omitted]    He pointed out: In our province, structural reform in  provincial-level party and government organs has advanced from a  stage of conducting investigation and study and carrying out  experimental work into a stage of full implementation. Our  experience has shown that the conditions for establishing and  pursuing the state civil service system have matured.  Therefore, the provincial CPC Committee and government have  decided that government organs at all levels throughout the  province are to fully implement the state civil service system  and fulfill this task within a few years. The provincial CPC  Committee and government have urged the relevant units to  properly perform the work of making arrangements for the  placement of those who lose their jobs due to reduced staffing  and link this work with the development of the social productive  forces. Structural reform and streamlining overstaffed organs  should be carried out through various channels and at all levels.</p>

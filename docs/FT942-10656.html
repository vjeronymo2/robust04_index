			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Foreign cash inflow lifts Hungary Hungary is much the most successful eastern European country in attracting foreign direct investment, accounting for a third of the Dollars 18.3bn (Pounds 12.3bn) total at the beginning of this year. More than Dollars 10bn, or over 55 per cent, went to just three countries - Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland - according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe* (ECE). The figures relate to the foreign component of paid-up capital, and do not include sums committed but not yet invested. The bulk of foreign capital in the region comes from western Europe, which accounts for about 77 per cent of overseas investment in Hungary and 92 per cent in Slovenia. Just over half the total has been invested in the manufacturing sector. The ECE says only Hungary has managed to attract substantial foreign investment into the important financial services sector, where it accounts for 11 per cent of all international investment in the country. Over 17 per cent of all Hungarian enterprises now have a foreign capital component, giving overseas investors a big role in the economy. By way of contrast, foreign-owned enterprises in the Commonwealth of Independent States account for a tiny 0.2 per cent of total employment. *East-West Investment News, No. 1 Spring 1994, available from UN sales section, Palais des Nations, CH-1211 Geneva 10, annual subscription Dollars 80.</p>

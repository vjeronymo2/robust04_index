			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Iran asked to reduce embassy Jordan has asked the Iranian embassy in Amman to cut down its numbers drastically amid fears that Tehran is strengthening its links with Moslem fundamentalists in Jordan and the West Bank. Security officials in Amman complained the size of the Iranian embassy far outweighed its 'normal' functions and the Iranian ambassador, Mr Ahmad Dastmalchian, is said to have played an active role in 1979's Iranian student takeover of the US embassy in Tehran and the 1983 suicide attack on the US mission in Beirut. Diplomats in Amman said Mr Dastmalchian is known to have played a key role in strengthening links between Tehran and Moslem fundamentalists abroad. The Iranian embassy in Amman has 30 staff, including 19 diplomats, compared with only two Jordanian diplomats in Tehran. Jordan's request came a few days after a bomb exploded in a cinema screening soft pornography in the northern town of Zarqa in which two people were injured. A similar device exploded five days earlier in a downtown cinema in Amman, injuring seven. Western embassies in Egypt are tightening security after warnings by Moslem militants that foreigners should leave Egypt, Reuter reports from Cairo.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> TENNIS TOURS FORM DRUG POLICY  </P> <P> The men's and women's tennis tours today announced a joint drug-testing policy  and adopted several identical regulations in their Codes of Conduct.  </P> <P> The men's Assn. of Tennis Professionals started drug testing in 1987, while the  Women's Tennis Assn. began a program last year.  </P> <P> "Today we have sharpened the focus of both our drug-testing programs by making  them essentially the same," said Mark Miles, ATP Tour's chief executive  officer.  </P> <P> The ATP tour does not disclose results of its random drug-testing program.  Rules call for an automatic nine-month suspension for performance-enhancing  drugs.  </P> <P> The suspensions would have to be made public, according to ATP rules. There  have been no such suspensions since the men's tour began drug testing.  </P> <P> The two tours also agreed on some on-court practices -- that the time allowed  between points shall not exceed 25 seconds and that there will be 90 seconds  for changeovers.  </P> <P> The so-called three-step Penalty Schedule (warning, point, default) will be  used for on-court code violations. Time violations are not part of the Penalty  Schedule.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Guo Peng (6753 7720): "Privatization -- Key </F> Issues in Enterprise Reform in 1994 -- A Conversation Concerning  Establishing a Modern Enterprise System"]    [Text] The "Directive of the CPC Central Committee  Concerning Issues in Establishing a Socialist Market Economic  System," promulgated by the 3rd Plenum of the 14th CPC Congress,  calls for changing the state-owned enterprise system and  establishing a modern enterprise system. Given such an agenda,  to answer the question how enterprises can best understand its  import and grasp the substantive issues involved in establishing  a modern enterprise system in order to effectively implement the  process of reform, this reporter called on several individuals  for a wide-ranging discussion: State Commission for  Restructuring the Economic System's Horizontal Coordination  Bureau director Lu Piao [0712 2613], an expert on enterprise  groups; State-Owned Property Administrative Bureau's Enterprise  Groups Department deputy director Zhou Fangsheng [0719 2397  3992], an expert on the system of production authorities; and  Beijing Junhe Consulting Company manager Li Su [2621 5126], an  expert enterprise consultant. The content of our discussion is  as follows:    [Reporter] The future direction of enterprise reform is  establishing a modern enterprise system -- privatizing  enterprises is the inevitable trend after over 10 years of  reform in establishing a new enterprise system by reallocating  production authorities and enterprise profits. How did the  impetus to establish a modern enterprise system come about?    [Li] It began in 1987; No. 2 Gas Plant, having had  experiences carrying out internal reforms, proposed the  establishment of a modern enterprise system -- an urgent request  toward privatization. At the All China Symposium on Enterprise  Groups held in Luoyang, then No. 2 Gas Plant director Chen  Qingtai [7115 3237 3141], after reporting the impressions of his  observation tour abroad, proposed that his plant be privatized  as a company under a modern enterprise system. Subsequently, we  made three separate trips to visit and study No. 2 Gas Plant,  and participated in its restructuring under comrade Chen  Qingtai's leadership.    [Zhou] In the earlier stages, concerned experts and cadres,  organized by the State Commission for Economy and Trade,  undertook a nationwide study of all aspects involved in  establishing a modern enterprise system; they collected and  reviewed a large body of data from both inside China and abroad  dealing with the practices, experiences and lessons of  enterprise system reform, and submitted an excellent proposal  that China proceed to establish a modern enterprise system.  Having taken part in the study and investigation which led up to  this proposal, we were deeply impressed by the spirit displayed  at the 3rd Plenum to act in a timely manner, a spirit  crystallized by over 10 years of enterprise reform.    [Reporter] There are many theories and explanations for a  modern enterprise system, how can its substance best be  summarized?    [Lu] The point of departure in establishing a modern  enterprise system is to break down all the original barriers,  and change the system of classifying different types of  enterprise by the source of production authority (people,  collectives, individuals, or foreign investors) to classifying  them on the basis of management responsibilities (by  individuals, partnerships, enterprises with unlimited liability,  companies with limited liability, or joint-stock enterprises  with limited liability). Enterprises operated by individuals or  partnerships have a long history, but the crux to a modern  enterprise system is a system of privatized enterprises with  limited liabilities. Therefore, in developing a modern  enterprise system, we are basically applying the limited  liability enterprise model to reform enterprises owned by the  state, people or collectives where the production authorities  are not clearly spelled out.    [Reporter] How would establishing a modern enterprise system  enable the state-owned enterprises to change their operating  system?    [Li] When we participated in restructuring the No. 2 Gas  Plant into a privatized enterprise, we took note of two major  difficulties which China encountered earlier in implementing the  reform policy of reallocating production authorities and  enterprise profits:    First, the contradiction between decentralizing and  centralizing authority. In the overall context of a planned  economy, strong administrative controls hampered flexible  operations of the enterprise; in the early stages of reforming  the system, however, the profits structure created was open to  strong pressure from the workers which also constrained the  enterprise from moving briskly forward. Both these types of  pressure were present in the No. 2 Gas Plant, resulting in sharp  contradictions between branch factories and subsidiary  enterprises demanding free reign to operate, and the  headquarters wanting to hold on to centralized operating  authority. A system of decentralized authority can lead to waste  of resources if not tied to a production authority; but if  centralization of authority goes too far, it will certainly  strengthen administrative controls which affect the forward  thrust of development. Given these factors, the contradictions  experienced by the No. 2 Plant in the early stages of  restructuring were similar to those confronting China's  enterprise reform, and the reform process itself continued to be  pulled in contradictory directions of decentralizing and  centralizing authority.    Second, there was the contradiction between competition and  alliance or integration. In a planned economy divided into  separate spheres, the various administrative monopolies created  tended to block operational mobility, and various government  managing departments acting like a large engine forcefully drove  subsidiary enterprises to produce according to plan, allocated  resources equally to different enterprises and divided the  existing contradictions equally among all enterprises. The  enterprise reform of reallocating authorities and profits  involves, in essence, breaking down the administrative  monopolies and reallocating production authorities and profits,  but there can also be negative consequences including disorderly  allocation of resources, duplication of investment, twisted  organizational structure, and the lack of macroeconomic  coordination, etc. To deal with this situation, horizontal  integration of enterprises and enterprise groups was carried  out. But, because of the enterprise structure, integrating  loosely linked or radically different enterprises could not  solve the contradiction of blind competition, while their  administrative integration can easily result in restricting  competition. The No. 2 Gas Plant led other enterprise groups in  China in terms of growth and development, and experienced  particularly keenly the contradiction between competition and  integration.    Looking at the situation from this perspective, the modern  enterprise system reform which the No. 2 Gas Plant has pursued  since 1987 involves changing the enterprise group into a  privatized enterprise, and at the same time resolving the two  obstacles in reform. In terms of the contradiction between  decentralizing and centralizing authorities, a system of  corporate management created by privatization, with its Board of  Directors, can prevent government departments from  administratively interfering in various levels of enterprise  management, can restrain subordinate enterprises from blindly  exerting pressure on top management or, by joining with workers  and staffs, putting pressure on the enterprise, and ultimately  develop an operating system which has both restraints as well as  safeguards. In terms of the contradiction between competition  and integration, a system of production authorities, which  legalize asset linkage of parent and subsidiary enterprises, can  strengthen control over subsidiary enterprises and help develop  the transactional mechanism for reallocating and transferring  production authorities and assets. Therefore, the establishment  of a modern enterprise system is of great strategic significance  in terms of changing the operating mechanism of state-owned  enterprises.    [Report] A modern enterprise system is not a simple system,  it involves an array of substantive details, which of these are  most important?    [Zhou] The foundation of a modern enterprise system is a  system of production authorities. Because the latter is basic to  a market economy, only after production authorities are clearly  established can we talk about commercial exchanges from which  evolved a series of complex market-oriented economic rules and  regulations. But at present, in the state-owned enterprises, the  line of production authorities is not clearly defined,  responsibility for production not clearly fixed, organizational  leadership system irrational and managerial methods not up to  par. The reform tasks are enormously difficult when the twin  functions of government are not completely separated, and the  mechanisms for transferring assets, organizing production  authority and allocating resources are not fully developed.  Among the collective enterprises, contradictions have surfaced  over abuse of authority and confused lines of responsibility due  to enterprises operating without clearly defined centers of  production authority. Therefore, a rational system of production  authorities is an indispensable condition for establishing a  modern enterprise system.    [Lu] One special characteristic of a modern enterprise  system  is the freedom to assign or transfer production authorities  within a system of safeguards, and the goal of developing a  modern enterprise system is to achieve unity of production  efficiency and safeguard in a market-oriented economy; because  the public nature of enterprise production authority is  increasingly being emphasized by the development of large-scale  stock-holding incorporated companies, these companies, unlike  the individual enterprises in the early days of reform, must  give priority to the unity of production efficiency and  safeguard. That is to say that in terms of the structure and  management in a modern enterprise system, enterprises must  operationally emphasize internal coordination, working with the  stockholders and workers through the corporate body (the  management). In terms of the enterprise's external concerns, the  enterprise and government should jointly promote and perfect a  social welfare system and ensure that enterprise managers have  the freedom to allocate corporate assets for this purpose within  a rational environment with safeguards.    [Li] In summarizing, it should be pointed out that  establishing a modern enterprise system involves establishing a  system with eight major features, as follows:    1. A system of production authorities designed to meet  conditions of market-oriented transactions; this is the  foundation of a modern enterprise system characterized by,  first, a clear definition of production authority; second, the  freedom to exercise that authority; and third, the ease in  exchanging or transferring production authority.    2. A system of incorporation based on a modern system of  credits; this is the symbol of a modern enterprise system  characterized by, first, a production authority governed by  stock and bond transactions; second, personification of  enterprise management (in the independence of a new body of  stockholders); and third, public accountability for enterprise  management.    3. A system for acquiring enterprises based on a market for  trading in stocks and bonds; this is the trend of a modern  enterprise system characterized by, first, the freedom to buy  and sell shares; second, lowering the controlling share ratio;  and third, simplification of transactions of key asset factors.    4. A system for stratifying enterprises based on a system of  macroeconomic coordinations; this is the essence of a modern  enterprise system characterized by, first, competition among  large monopolistic enterprises; second, government coordination  and control at different levels of the enterprise; and third,  linking or merging of medium and small enterprises.    5. A system of association or merger of enterprises based on  a strict system of laws and regulations; this is the form of a  modern enterprise system characterized by, first, limited  liabilities on the part of parent and subsidiary enterprises;  second, lively and free purchase or transfer of components of  enterprises; and third, standardization of business management  practices in branch companies (supervising asset managements of  subsidiaries).    6. A system of finance based on a system of public  accountability and supervision; this is the linkage of a modern  enterprise system characterized by, first, transparency of  enterprise accounting practices; second, balanced earnings from  assets; and third, rational allocation of financial assets.    7. A system of personnel governed by social welfare  regulations; this is the essence of a modern enterprise system  characterized by, first, intensification of personnel  competition; second, market determination of the value of labor;  and third, socialization of personnel attribution and  replacement.    8. A system of enterprise management based on a consolidated  approach to education; this is the safeguard of a modern  enterprise system characterized by, first, blending of personnel  trained in science and technology and the liberal arts; second,  consolidation of management departments; and third,  systematization of managerial techniques.    [Reporter] Summarizing what has been mentioned above,  establishing a modern enterprise system is not something  enterprises can accomplish by piecemeal reforms; its development  must be systematic, and involves various ramifications and  varying intensities which go beyond the reform policy of  reallocating authorities and profits; this is a gigantic  systemic task which cannot be accomplished in one fell swoop,  but only by painstaking labor of a generation. This year is a  year for major efforts in China's reforms and we must press  ahead systematically and steadily and tackle the tasks from the  simple gradually to the complex; with emphasis on reforming the  current enterprise system, we begin by changing the state-owned  enterprises into enterprises with limited liabilities, would  that be a fair summary?    [Lu] It is, because the publicly organized joint-stock  companies with limited liabilities can now operate only within a  limited sphere, while a series of reforms dealing with  enterprise bankruptcy, exchange or transfer of production  authority, strengthening of management and expansion of  enterprise groups are closely related to the restructuring of  the state-owned enterprise system.    [Zhou] The reform of the state-owned enterprise system  should  be coordinated with the operation and management of components  of enterprise groups, including those operating with state-owned  assets, which are in the process of reallocating production  authorities. As for privatizing existing enterprise groups, we  should make a clear distinction between two groups of  enterprises, the nuclear enterprise and the close-knit,  multi-layer enterprise, pursue privatization separately with  each group, and step by step shape the parent- subsidiary  relationships that exist between the two groups.</p>

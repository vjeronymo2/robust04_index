			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Leading Japanese construction groups named in bribery case THE FIRST trial in Japan's spate of construction industry scandals opened yesterday, as prosecutors arrested two more executives from a leading contractor. Mr Toru Ishii, former mayor of the northern town of Sendai, admitted receiving Y100m (Pounds 625,000) from four leading construction companies - Shimizu (Japan's largest), Mitsui Construction, Hazama and and Nishimatsu Construction. However, Mr Ishii refused to answer charges of accepting a bribe. He is one of nearly 30 people charged in the widening scandal, in which local government politicians are suspected of accepting large amounts of cash in return for helping construction companies obtain contracts. Earlier, Mr Kozo Igarashi, the construction minister, said his ministry would 'assume responsibility' for officials' failure to prevent the bribery cases. 'Top officials cannot be exempt from responsibility,' he said. This is believed to be the first time a ministry has made such an offer. The latest to be detained are two accountants from Kajima, the second largest and most politically influential construction group. They were suspected of destroying evidence of illicit payment to politicians after the arrest last March of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former political godfather of the then ruling Liberal Democratic party. Those charged to date include two mayors and two prefectural governors, plus executives from six construction companies, including Japan's top three. So far, no national politicians - apart from Mr Kanemaru - or central government officials have been charged in the bribery cases, despite the huge amount of information prosecutors are expected to have collected from those arrested. The likelihood that national politicians or officials could be implicated increased with the recent arrest of Mr Shinji Kiyoyama, vice president of Kajima, which counts many former bureaucrats on its staff. As in previous scandals, the final decision depends on how far prosecutors feel it necessary to go to assuage public opinion.</p>

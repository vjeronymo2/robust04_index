			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Travel (France): Up-country retreats - Practical Traveller / Nicholas Woodsworth offers some out-the-way alternatives to the heat and bustle of Provence in summer My father-in-law, Rene Luc, is 81 years old, Provencal through and through, and has never lived anywhere else in his life. A passionate fisherman, he admits that the region is somewhat short on decent trout streams. Apart from that, he reckons Provence is just about as fine a place as anyone could want to live. But come July and August, the months when visitors from all over the world crowd into every nook and cranny of Provence, Dordogne and the Riviera, Rene is rarely to be found at home. For decades now he and his wife Odette have retreated up-country for their summer holidays, to areas of southern France that are virtually ignored by French and foreign holiday-makers alike. It is not just the lack of crowds, cars, stressed waiters and over-subscribed facilities that attract them there. Like most locals, they find the northerner's love of sitting in the blazing Midi sun somewhat potty: Provence is simply too hot in mid-summer to be comfortable. The places they choose - none more than three or four hours' drive away - are all cool, green and 1,000m high or more. Here in villages and unspoiled countryside they get all the sunny character of the Midi in summertime without the exhausting heat and crowds. Their second objective is to come away from an enjoyable holiday without paying an arm and a leg for it. Accommodation up-country might not be as sophisticated as along the Cote d'Azur but it has its compensations: hosts that are almost always friendly and hospitable, generous offerings of high-quality country cooking, and bills that by European standards can be astonishingly low. Chambre d'hote and table d'hote - accommodation and food provided in private homes, usually farms and country houses - are always one possibility. For longer stays, my parents-in-law generally find auberges located in small towns and villages more convenient. There are still many such establishments where demi-pension (accommodation and two vast meals) is offered for little more than Pounds 20 a day. Where, then, are these areas? Not long ago I cornered Rene in his garage as he was digging out trout flies and dusting off his fishing rod in preparation for the summer season. Here are some of them from his little black book. The Cevennes (see above). One of the wildest and least populated areas in France, the steep hills and valleys of the Cevennes have also discouraged the development of all but the simplest tourist facilities. But for the beauty of its landscapes, for its remote stone-built hamlets, rugged walks and a way of life that has changed little over the centuries, it is well worth a visit. The Cevennes is marvellously refreshing when most of the Midi lies hot and panting. For those seeking comfort, the small market-town of Florac is probably the best bet. It is also the gateway to the high, lonely plateaux of the Causses and the spectacular Gorge du Tarn, a descent of which is inspiring by car, and thrilling by canoe. In Florac, the Hotel du Parc (tel: 66 45 03 05) offers most facilities, including pool, and an excellent restaurant. For those prepared to put up in more rustic accommodation, lists of chambre d'hotes are available in the syndicats d'initiatives, or tourist offices, of local towns. For a night on a remote Cevenol hillside farm (goats and donkeys included), nothing could be more genuine than La Deveze in the Trabassac Valley (prop: Marie-Claude Charbonnier, tel: 66 44 74 41). L'Aubrac. Less than 100km from the enclosed valleys of the Cevennes, the Aubrac region, on the border of the departements of Lozere and Cantal, is a vast sweep of high, open plateaux. Treeless, and stretching to an empty horizon, it is spectacular and dramatic. Carpeted in drifting snow in winter, it is an open range for cattle in summer. The village of Nasbinals, just to the west of these great open spaces, is the easiest place to stay to take advantage of the walking, lakes and fishing in the area. The Hotel de la Route d'Argent (prop: Pierre Bastide, tel: 66 32 50 03) provides comfortable accommodation and a splendid country kitchen for very reasonable prices. For those with more sophisticated tastes and thicker wallets, the small town of Laguiole is only half-an-hour's drive away. In addition to making some of the best cutlery in France, it is the town chosen by celebrated chef Michel Bras for the freshness and purity of its products. But beware: his restaurant here is a favourite summer pilgrimage of Paris politicians and other luminaries; reservations are often made a year in advance. Le Queyras. Entirely different again, Le Queyras is an area sitting high up in the departement des Hautes Alpes, near the Italian border. It includes the old, picturesque and rather touristy village of Saint Veran, reputed, at more than 2,000m, to be the highest village in Europe. But the real attraction is the classic and wholly uncluttered alpine landscape. Walks here look out on to some of the most spectacular mountain scenery in France, with few of the crowds to be found in Chamonix, Mont Blanc or other celebrated places. You will eat less well and more expensively here than in the Aubrac, but there are still many establishments offering good value. There are a number of hotels on the route N-547 leading to the Belvedere de Cirque, a magnificent place to gaze out on to an alpine giant, the 3,800m Mont Viso in Italy. Other good bets include: L'Hotel-Restaurant Les Veyres (tel: 92 45 01 91) on the road from Guillestre to Ceillac, a pretty little village high on an alpine plateau, and L'Hotel- Restaurant Le Chamois (tel: 92 45 83 71) in Moline, on the road to Saint Veran. Cantal. There is no rural countryside in France quite as peaceful as the departement of Cantal. These are rolling hills full of old slate-roofed villages, untold numbers of cows, and restaurants offering some of the most interesting and ridiculously cheap regional cooking in the country. There are many picturesque towns to stay in, including Saint Flour, Murat, and Puy Mary. The most arresting, though, is the old medieval village of Salers, a place of castles, battlements, old houses and winding streets. L'Hotel des Remparts (tel: 71 40 70 33) in Salers offers both good food and lodging. Further south, on the border between Cantal and Aveyron, the Lot River Valley offers a splendid route eastwards to Cahors and on to the Dordogne. Haute Provence. This area offers an alternative to Provence proper. It is higher, drier, and wilder - only goats, lavender and honey do well in this harsh and arid climate. But it has many beautiful Provencal villages not yet spoiled by crowds. From a base in the towns of Sault or Sederon, both with good hotels, circuits might include Aurel, Montbrun-les-Bains, Aulan with its Provencal chateau, Banon, reputed for its leaf-wrapped cheese, and the very scenic Simiane-la-Rotonde. Rene has no addresses for this area - it is too close to his own home and his wife's unmatchable Provencal cooking. But I plan to explore it in detail this summer and report later. Trout streams or no, I recently bought a house in the hills on the edge of Haute Provence, and think it about as fine a place as anyone could want to live.</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DANIEL BOONE NOT A FRONTIERSMAN; HE'S A LEFT-HANDER FOR BALTIMORE  </P> <P> Coonskin Cap Day at Memorial Stadium?  </P> <P> It could happen if the Orioles succeed with their latest Triple A addition,  left-hander Daniel Boone, whose seventh great-grandfather was John Boone,  brother of the famous pioneer.  </P> <P> "That's stuck with me since elementary school, when everybody would be singing  songs about Daniel Boone," Boone said. "I've had a lot to overcome in my life."  </P> <P> The team announced the signing today.  </P> <P> Boone, 36, hasn't appeared in the majors since 1982. Until joining the  Bradenton Explorers of the Senior League this winter, he hadn't pitched  professionally since 1984. "That's how you get sleepers," said Orioles General  Manager Roland Hemond.  </P> <P> The knuckle baller finished 4-3 with a 3.16 earned run average for Bradenton.  Eight of his 13 appearances were starts, and three were complete games.  </P> <P> He appeared in 57 games with San Diego and Houston in 1981-82, but his last  professional team before Bradenton was Pittsburgh's Triple A affiliate in  Vancouver in 1984.  </P></p>

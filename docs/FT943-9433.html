			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Making sanctions work in Iraq Sanctions can work. They played a part in convincing white South Africans that apartheid was not a tenable long-term solution for their country; and President Milosevic would not even be pretending to apply them to the Bosnian Serbs unless he were seriously anxious to get them lifted from Serbia. In Iraq, sanctions are clearly 'biting'. Western visitors report a bleak economic picture, with minimal activity and no hope of change. Moreover, Iraq has complied, to a surprising extent, with the conditions imposed on it by the UN Security Council, including acceptance of long-term monitoring of its nuclear and chemical disarmament. With Iraq, as with Serbia, the question arises whether compliance should be rewarded by a partial lifting of sanctions. For the moment there seems to be a consensus among the five permanent Security Council members that lifting the sanctions now would be 'premature'. All agree that Iraq must accept Resolution 833, demarcating the Iraq-Kuwait border, and co-operate in investigating the disappearance of Kuwaiti subjects on Iraqi territory, in addition to concessions it has already made. But whereas France and Russia might be satisfied with this, and advocate setting a fixed timetable after which the council should consider allowing Iraq to resume oil sales, the US and UK have a longer list of demands, including an end to human rights violations and to alleged sponsorship of assassinations. They fear that to set a fixed period would fatally undermine the sanctions by encouraging both Iraqis and foreigners to assume that they are being phased out. Undoubted hardship There is no humanitarian argument for lifting sanctions on Iraq. The undoubted hardship suffered by the Iraqi people is caused not by sanctions (which specifically exempt food and medicine) but by Saddam Hussein's refusal to sell oil under the terms of Resolution 706, which would place the proceeds in an escrow account and spend part of them on humanitarian relief in Iraq under UN supervision. To let him sell oil and use the proceeds at his discretion would be the opposite of humanitarian: it would increase his ability to oppress the people of Iraq and to undermine the liberated area in the north with car bombs and other forms of sabotage. The strongest pressure for lifting sanctions comes from Iraq's neighbours, notably Turkey and Jordan. They have a case in that sanctions bear much more heavily on them than on the members of the Security Council. This is true also of Yugoslavia's neighbours. Article 50 of the UN Charter provides for states 'confronted with special economic problems' arising from measures taken against another state to 'consult the Security Council with regard to a solution of those problems'. The council needs to respond much more imaginatively if it wishes to maintain sanctions long enough for them to work. Broader strategy Here as elsewhere, though, sanctions can only work as part of a broader strategy. The lack of such a strategy is made painfully obvious in the Iraqi case by the fact that sanctions are being applied not only to the area under Saddam's control but also to the north from which western powers have obliged him to withdraw. The argument is that to treat different parts of Iraq differently would infringe its territorial integrity, by giving de facto recognition to a separate Kurdish state. But there is a way out of this, which is to give support to the Iraqi National Congress (INC). This body represents Iraqis from all parts of the country, and aspires to liberate Iraq as a whole. It has established a temporary base in the north, and its authority has been strengthened by its mediation between the Kurdish parties during their recent clashes. Last year King Fahd of Saudi Arabia urged the INC leaders to proclaim a provisional government in the area they control. It is a suggestion they can only take up with western support, but that support should be forthcoming. So long as it is withheld, the impression persists that the west does not really wish to see Saddam replaced, and that sanctions are intended not to drive him from office but to punish the Iraqi people as a whole.</p>

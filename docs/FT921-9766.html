			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Salomon plans big changes in Europe SALOMON BROTHERS, the scandal-struck Wall Street securities house which was caught rigging US Treasury bond auctions last year, is to announce a shake-up in the management of its European operations today. Mr Deryck Maughan, chief operating officer at Salomon Brothers, is due to announce the promotion of Mr Dennis Keegan and Mr Stephen Posford to the position of joint heads of the London-based European business. Mr Jim Massey will step down from his position as head of Salomon Brothers' international business (which included Tokyo and Europe), and will take over responsibility for both Salomon Brothers' own investments and special projects. He will not be replaced in this capacity. Mr Maughan is expected to tell staff today that Salomon's London-based Europe operations can no longer be run from New York, in view of their importance, and that a decision has been taken to set up a local management team. Mr Posford, who is English, and Mr Keegan, an American, were recently appointed joint heads of Salomon's equity and fixed income business in London in the wake of fall-out from the Treasury bond scandal. They have worked closely together at Salomon's bond trading desk in London for several years, a working relationship which, according to one Salomon employee, has earned them the nicknames 'Tweedledum and Tweedledee'. The rise of Mr Posford and Mr Keegan, who both have backgrounds in proprietary bond trading (trading on the company's account rather than for a particular client) has been interpreted by some employees as a sign that the senior management wants to focus more on this business area. One Salomons source said revenue on the proprietary trading side amounted to 'over Pounds 100m' in 1990 at the company's London operations. However, Salomon Brothers yesterday denied there was any intention of focusing on proprietary trading at the expense of other business areas. 'It has been made very clear to everybody that there isn't more emphasis on proprietary trading. The emphasis on clients and client business will be stronger than ever,' said Mr Lee Bruce, press spokesman for the company. The announcements regarding senior staff changes come as Salomon Brothers is still suffering from the repercussions of the Treasury bond rigging scandal. Both in London and New York, the company has lost several members of staff, including some senior and well-respected analysts and desk heads, either as a result of redundancies or voluntary departures. One former employee claims: 'The London trading floor is half empty these days, so many people have left, they have even started to fill some of the vacant places with settlements people.' However, a spokesman for Salomon strongly denied the claim and said the company had begun interviewing replacement staff. Mr Massey will remain on the Salomon Brothers executive committee (chaired by Mr Maughan) and on the board of directors of Salomons Inc. In his new job he will have an overview of the firm's investments, such as its 5 per cent stake in Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the Italian banking group.</p>

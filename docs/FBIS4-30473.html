			<p>BFN     [Text] There is a growing concern within the government  over the impact of the en masse resignation of the Hata cabinet  on Japanese diplomacy. A Foreign Ministry source said: "The  act indicates that the cabinet has given no importance to  diplomacy. This will impair Japan's reputation." The anxiety  has arisen because Japan has to deal with many  diplomatically-important international meetings next month.  These include the Japan-U.S. summit, the Naples summit (G-7  summit talks), and the "ASEAN regional forum," where the first  Asia-Pacific region security talks will be held.    At a 25 June news conference, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa  said: "It is very regrettable that at this juncture, we cannot  deal fully with important diplomatic issues because of political  confusion at home." In particular, the government is concerned  about the upcoming G-7 summit. Last year, (then) Prime Minister  Kiichi Miyazawa was already a "lame duck" when he attended the  Tokyo summit because he was forced to dissolve the House of  Representatives for a snap general election immediately after  the summit ended. The same Foreign Ministry source expressed  anxiety, saying that the political confusion occurring just  before the summits for two consecutive years "will had a  detrimental effect on Japan's position in the international  community."    G-7 summits are an ideal place to promote diplomacy among  the  leaders of the industrialized nations. Thus, the source said:  "Repeated changes of government make it difficult to establish  relations of trust between the Japanese prime minister and the  leaders of other G-7 nations." Immediately before the G-7  summit, the Japan-U.S. summit meeting is scheduled to mend  bilateral ties, which have worsened since the breakdown of trade  negotiations in February. Therefore, if elections for the next  prime minister are delayed and as a result, if the government  has to deal with the summit meeting with the virtual "absence of  a prime minister," this will apparently be disadvantageous to  Japanese diplomacy.    Many people question the idea of electing the new prime  minister from among the members of the Social Democratic Party  [SDPJ]. A top Foreign Ministry official said: "In view of  diplomatic consistency, the idea is questionable." In  particular, it is questioned whether the government will be able  to take concerted actions with the United States in dealing with  North Korea's suspected nuclear program if the SDPJ takes power.  It is a crucial period for Japanese diplomacy. The nation has  to deal with issues concerning the Japan-U.S. security system  and its bid to become a permanent member of the UN Security  Council. Thus, there is a strong call for establishing a stable  government for the sake of Japanese diplomacy.</p>

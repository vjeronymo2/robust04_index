			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUPERINTENDENT OF CAPISTRANO SCHOOLS DENIES COVER-UP  </P> <P> The superintendent of the Capistrano Unified School District on Monday denied  charges of a conspiracy to cover up use of district funds in a special election  campaign last year and challenged the district attorney's office to bring the  matter to trial.  </P> <P> Supt. Jerome R. Thornsley said the district provided "a wealth of information"  to prosecutors detailing its involvement in the campaign for Measure A, a 1989  ballot initiative, including opinions from the district's lawyers and the  Orange County Department of Education allowing the district to promote the  election.  </P> <P> Thornsley questioned why charges in the case have not been filed despite the  yearlong probe.  </P> <P> "They (prosecutors) have the attitude, and I don't know whether it's  politically motivated or not, that you're guilty from Day One and we're going  to find the evidence," Thornsley said.  </P> <P> "We bent over backwards to give them all of the material during the first year  (of the investigation). If they felt we were violating the law, fine. Let them  take action, and we'll defend our position."  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade, who is conducting the investigation, was  not available for comment. He is investigating charges that the district  misused public funds in approving a secret "bonus incentive plan" for school  principals who brought out the necessary two-thirds vote needed to pass Measure  A, which would have raised property taxes for new school construction in the  district. The measure failed at the polls.  </P> <P> Thornsley acknowledged that principals who "worked hard on the election" were  considered for bonuses, but denied that bringing in "yes" votes was a  prerequisite for extra pay.  </P> <P> "I talked to the D.A. extensively about that," Thornsley said. "One of the  things we made clear (to principals) was that they were not to advocate a yes  vote. We thought we could reward anyone who worked hard on any issue. Where in  the law does it say that you can't give merit pay for a particular issue?"  </P> <P> But Thornsley did not dispute prosecutors' charges that he tried to keep the  incentive plan secret. He said he feared that public knowledge of possible  bonuses would "contaminate" the election and that opponents of the measure  "would make that the whole issue of the campaign."  </P> <P> Minutes from the school board's closed sessions revealed Thornsley's  recommendation to cancel the bonuses "should the incentive pay issue become  public."  </P> <P> Those minutes also noted that the Board of Trustees voted "unanimously to  authorize the superintendent to recommend (principals) for incentive stipends  during 1989 as a result of (them) achieving 66 2/3 yes votes in their areas."  </P> <P> Michael Grob, a Sacramento attorney representing the district, said that the  Board of Trustees only authorized Thornsley to tell principals that the board  might consider campaign work among other criteria used during bonus and salary  review and that district records do not indicate that bonuses were paid based  on yes votes within a principal's jurisdiction.  </P> <P> "To the best of my recollection, Thornsley said that they reviewed people for  their salary increases, and in some cases (campaign work) may have been a  factor they discussed," Grob said.  </P> <P> Thornsley said the district's actions were based on legal opinions from the  Sacramento law firm of Kronich, Moskovitz, Tiedemann &amp; Girard, and from  Ronald Wenkart, a senior attorney for the county Department of Education. The  Sacramento firm advised the district that the state Education Code "allows the  school district to expend public funds for special elections," but Thornsley  said Wenkart advised him against using district funds to advance the district's  position, Thornsley said.  </P> <P> "We took the position that we were going to follow (Wenkart's) opinion, that we  would promote the election, but we would assiduously avoid advocating a yes  vote," Thornsley said. He added that all brochures prepared by the district  were forwarded to Wenkart for review. Wenkart was not available for comment.  </P></p>

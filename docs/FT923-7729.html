			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Writ queries cash card security SEVERAL UK cash dispenser networks do not employ a critical security measure to protect the secrecy of personal identification numbers, according to a writ issued this week on behalf of eight customers who claim phantom withdrawals have been made from their accounts. The writ lodged in the High Court, but not yet served, names four banks and one building society which it claims do not properly use computerised security modules in their automatic teller machine (ATM) networks. It says these modules should make it impossible for anyone to get into the systems and learn a customer's PIN - the code a customer must key into an ATM after inserting a plastic card in order to carry out transactions. Instead, the writ says Barclays, Midland, TSB and Lloyds banks and Nationwide Building Society allow their staff to input the master keys which activate their systems. This means the institutions named in the writ 'rely upon the honesty of their own staff' to keep the codes secret. The Association for Payment Clearing Services (Apacs), which represents all ATM network providers, refused to comment on the allegations before its members are served with the writ. Barclays and Lloyds said the writ had not yet been served on either of them and that they had nothing to say yet. Apacs, Barclays and Lloyds would neither confirm nor deny whether the security modules are installed. The multi-plaintiff, multi-defendant writ was applied for in the High Court on Thursday by Keith Park and Co, a firm of solicitors in St Helens, Merseyside. The writ says plaintiffs will also rely on an admission by Barclays in a letter dated April 29 of 'faults in a computer program which wrongly identifies the branch at which withdrawals are attempted and made'.

			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CAMP PENDLETON NAMED ON AIRPORT SITE LIST  </P> <P> An Orange County site-selection group has chosen three potential locations for  a new regional airport, and one of them is in San Diego County.  </P> <P> The suggested south Camp Pendleton site, about 3 miles north of Oceanside,  would be an international airport serving 10.3 million passengers annually  beginning in the year 2010, according to a proposal drawn up by Orange County  Airport Site Coalition. The coalition is looking for a site to relieve crowding  at Orange County's John Wayne Airport.  </P> <P> The consultants envision a passenger terminal with 14 gates, as well as cargo  and general-aviation facilities. The 3,190 acre facility would cost $5.496  billion. Funding was not spelled out.  </P> <P> Along with the Pendleton site, the group chose Norton Air Force Base in San  Bernardino and a location in the Cleveland National Forest northeast of San  Juan Capistrano as finalists. The Cleveland forest location, a plateau called  Potrero Los Pinos, is the only one of the three finalists within Orange County.  </P> <P> Orange County officials also are considering a second San Diego County site,  McClellan-Palomar Airport in Carlsbad, as one of five backup locations in case  the Camp Pendleton site or the two other finalists they identified last weekend  -- prove unfeasible.  </P> <P> There is general agreement among government officials in San Diego County that  both Camp Pendleton and McClellan-Palomar are off limits as replacement sites  for San Diego's Lindbergh Field, and Marine Corps officials say they are  adamantly opposed to giving up part of Camp Pendleton.  </P> <P> "Local policy is very clear on both of these sites," said Jack Koerper, special  projects director at the San Diego Assn. of Governments. "It would be very  difficult to do politically in San Diego."  </P> <P> On Monday, Sandag released a study saying that San Diego would have one of the  nation's most congested airports and lose billions of dollars in forfeited  economic growth if no new airport for San Diego is built by 2010. The study  compared the long-term economic impact of a new airport to that of Lindbergh  Field, but did not endorse either.  </P> <P> Proposed alternatives to Lindbergh include two sites in and next to the Miramar  Naval Air Station and one along the U. S.-Mexican border on Otay Mesa.  </P> <P> "San Diego is attempting to find solutions to its airport question inside the  San Diego region," said Koerper, who headed the study made public Monday, a  continuing Sandag report of San Diego's airport system.  </P> <P> "Orange County, or the Los Angeles area, has taken a different point of view,  especially Orange County, by looking both inside and outside Orange County for  solutions to air carrier problems."  </P> <P> Gunnery Sgt. Stan Pederson, a Marine Corps spokesman at Camp Pendleton, said  Tuesday that senior officers there are sticking by a January statement saying  they would "strenuously oppose all proposals to locate a regional airport" at  the base.  </P> <P> "We will take every measure necessary to prevent this from happening," Pederson  read from the statement.  </P> <P> "People are just tossing these ideas around," said an aide to San Diego  Councilman Ron Roberts, a major proponent of a new San Diego airport. "It just  goes to show you the measure of desperation when it comes to air transportation  planning in Southern California. It's critical."  </P> <P> The president of the Orange County Airport Site Coalition, meanwhile, said the  group was "site-neutral" when it chose the three potential locations for a new  airport at a meeting Saturday in Irvine.  </P> <P> "We're only concerned with alleviating the year 2010 demand of more than 22  million air passengers a year in Orange County," Leland Oliver said Tuesday.  </P> <P> In case any of the three chosen sites proved unworkable, the coalition  fashioned a backup list that included McClellan-Palomar and four other  possibilities. The group is sanctioned by the Orange County Board of  Supervisors and has been aided by professional planning consultants.  </P> <P> The supervisors are not required to adopt the coalition's final recommendations  or choose any site. However, Oliver said Saturday that the group will work to  build political pressure on behalf of its final recommendations.  </P> <P> Among the sites dropped from consideration was El Toro Marine Corps Air Station  because the coalition's staff concluded that selection of the military base  would face significant political opposition and that there would be major costs  in relocating military operations elsewhere.  </P> <P> McClellan-Palomar was projected to be a "short-haul," as opposed to an  international airport with three gates for up to 2.3 million passengers a year  beginning in 2005. Though it would continue to handle general aviation traffic,  it would not have cargo service, according to the consultants. They estimated  it would cost $619.85 million to expand that airport.  </P> <P> The consultants' projections for all locations assume that the process of  obtaining money and government approvals would get under way in 1990.  </P> <P> John Wayne Airport now serves a maximum of 4.75 million passengers annually,  with a new ceiling of 8.4 million when a new terminal and parking garages are  completed.  </P> <P> Although many studies of airport sites have been filed over the years, a new  search was required under terms of a 1985 court settlement between Orange  County supervisors and the city of Newport Beach over planned expansion at John  Wayne.  </P> <P> The coalition's final report is due in December, Oliver said.  </P></p>

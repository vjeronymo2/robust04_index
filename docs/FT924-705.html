			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Sindy to undergo facelift after angry legal spat with Barbie SINDY, once Britain's favourite doll, is to undergo plastic surgery to settle a long-running international legal dispute with Barbie, her older and more successful American rival. Hasbro, manufacturer of Sindy, agreed yesterday to re-model her head to distinguish her from Barbie, made by Mattel. The settlement was reached shortly before a copyright battle between the two US companies was due to go to the UK High Court next month. The dispute began after Hasbro acquired the licence to Sindy from Pedigree, the UK toy company, in 1986 and set about altering her appearance. The previously demure tweed-clad Sindy suddenly acquired a more glamorous face, while her body acquired shapely curves. Mattel responded with a barrage of lawsuits, charging that Sindy had become an imitation of Barbie. Earlier this year, stocks of Sindy were seized after a French court ruled that the doll violated Barbie's copyright. Mattel has also won cases against Hasbro in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Barbie, who is sold in a variety of models and costumes, is believed to be the most successful toy range of all time. Since she was launched 33 years ago, more than 700m Barbie dolls have been sold in almost 70 countries, and Mattel expects sales this year to be worth a record Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m). According to Mattel, a Barbie doll is sold every two seconds, and 98 per cent of American girls between the ages of 3 and 11 own one at some point. Sindy, born in 1961, has always sold mostly in Britain, where she had the market to herself until the late 1970s. Today, her sales in Britain are estimated to be three times greater than the roughly Pounds 8m achieved by her rival. Mattel said yesterday that it had agreed to drop all outstanding lawsuits relating to Sindy and Barbie around the world and that the two companies would pay their own legal costs. Just how much difference Sindy's planned facelift will have on sales is uncertain. According to Mr Barry Walker, deputy chairman of the British Association of Toy Retailers: 'It's only crusty old blokes in toy showrooms who care about these things. The kids don't notice.'</p>

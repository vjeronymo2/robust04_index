			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Australia backs Gatt compromise package AUSTRALIA's Labor government yesterday approved the compromise package proposed by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to bring the Uruguay Round to an end, Kevin Brown reports from Sydney. Mr John Kerin, Australian trade minister, said the cabinet had accepted his recommendation that the package provided an acceptable basis for concluding the Round. Mr Kerin said the package fell short of the demands for liberalisation of agricultural trade put forward by the Cairns Group of 14 agricultural exporting nations, which is chaired by Australia. But he said it contained 'elements of a positive nature,' including provisions for an agreement on trade in services, and protection for intellectual property rights. The Dunkel package was designed to break a deadlock on agricultural trade between the European Community (EC) and the US, which was broadly supported by the Cairns Group. The Cairns group sought cuts of 90 per cent in EC export subsidies and 75 per cent in internal support, both over 10 years. Under the compromise package, export subsidies will fall by 36 per cent and internal support by 20 per cent, both over six years. Also, most barriers to trade in agricultural goods will be converted to tariffs, and most signatories to Gatt will have to open at least 3 per cent of domestic market sectors to imports, rising to 5 per cent after six years. The cabinet decided to support the package in spite of disappointment over the size of proposed reductions in EC subsidies and the smallness of improvements in access to protected markets in the EC, the US and Japan. Ministers said the package was the best obtainable in the face of continued EC opposition to more significant changes to the Community's Common Agricultural Policy. Australia and other Cairns Group members had earlier threatened to refuse to accept a deal unless substantial progress was made in liberalising agricultural trade. Mr Alexander Downer, Australia's shadow trade minister, said the conservative opposition parties would support the deal in the Senate, where the government is in a minority. However, Mr Downer said the package would not prevent the extension of EC and US export subsidies to new markets, and would allow Japan to use tariffs to exclude Australian rice exports. 'The Dunkel proposals do not amount to a major breakthrough for our farmers, although importantly, the proposals do establish for the first time ever the mechanisms to transform international agricultural trade over the long term,' he said. Australia's reluctant acceptance of the Dunkel proposals follows the government's failure to persuade the US to reduce its Export Enhancement Programme for agricultural products. Australian farmers claim the programme has reduced global grain prices and forced them out of traditional markets, especially in the Middle East. President Bush sympathised with the farmers during a visit to Australia last week, but offered no changes to the programme.</p>

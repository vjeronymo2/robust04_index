			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: McCain arbitration hearing opens An arbitrator has begun hearing evidence in the Canadian province of New Brunswick to determine the future of McCain Foods, the international potato-chip and frozen-food processor which has been riven by a row among McCain family shareholders. The closed hearing is the culmination of a long feud between Harrison and Wallace McCain, the two brothers who are McCain Foods' joint chief executives and between them control two-thirds of its shares. The arbitration, including an appeals mechanism to which both sides have agreed, is expected to be completed by the end of April. The dispute has dragged on for more than three years since Mr Wallace McCain defied his brother by appointing his son Michael as head of McCain's US operations. Wallace has also proposed splitting the company along geographic lines, with his branch of the family controlling the North American and Australian operations, and Harrison taking over the European side. Harrison and other board members insist the company should remain one unit.</p>

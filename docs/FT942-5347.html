			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Travel: The lost wonder - David Pilling rides a slow train along the Andes to Macchu Picchu When Yale professor Hiram Bingham stumbled upon Machu Picchu in 1911, he had confounded his sceptics by overcoming the absence of accurate maps of the Peruvian highlands, the toughest of terrains and 300 years of jungly growth that had all but obscured the stone ruins. Worst, he had endured the scepticism of his fellow academics, who doubted that the so-called Lost City of the Incas ever existed. Modern-day tourists have had to confront a different hurdle - terrorism. Since the founding of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla movement in the early 1980s, Peru has been embroiled in a ghastly civil war that has claimed the lives of at least 26,000 people. For much of the time the Cuzco highlands, where Machu Picchu is located, have been practically out of bounds. Even during lulls in the conflict, Peru's reputation for bombs, bullets and bandits kept all but the hardiest travellers away. Machu Picchu, lost for 300 years, vanished for another decade. But things may be changing. Since the capture of Abimael Guzman, the intellectual founder of Shining Path, there has been a slowdown - though not a halt - of terrorist activity. And tourists are tentatively returning to Machu Picchu. They are being encouraged by the reputation of the Lost City of the Incas, fed by lyrical descriptions such as the one in the preface of Bingham's book: 'In the sublimity of its surroundings, the marvel of its site, the character and the mystery of its construction, the Western Hemisphere holds nothing comparable.' If the ancient capital grips the imagination, the modern one, Lima, seems to leave most visitors under-enthralled. It bears all the scars of economic as well as terrorist catastrophe. There are slums, diesel-thick air and swirling garbage. Armoured guards loiter on many street corners, and there are battered tanks discreetly parked alongside important buildings and windowless skyscrapers patched up with wooden sheeting in the aftermath of car-bomb explosions. Fortunately for those with little inclination to seek out Lima's more delicate side - colonial architecture, treasure-stuffed museums and imaginative cuisine - the Peruvian highlands lie just 45 minutes away by air. It is from the regional capital of Cuzco, former centre of the Inca's sprawling empire, that modern travellers begin their pilgrimage to Machu Picchu. I made the trip recently, catching the tourist train from the central railway station at 6am and clapping my hands to keep warm in the highland chill. We set off precisely on time, but progress thereafter was less than bullet-like. The steep-sloped terrain obliged the train to zigzag as it dragged itself from the valley floor, first lurching forwards, then backing up, before manoeuvering ahead again. The same house or tree or sheep would appear in the window, slipping behind, before appearing again as we zigzagged ahead. The crawling pace, though, did afford more time to sponge up the views of bulging mustard-brown hills, the unfolding plains and the glimpses of snow-packed mountains. Although Machu Picchu is at a lower altitude than Cuzco, which lies at 3,310 metres, the impression was that the train was inching higher, breaking into ever-more remote valleys of sun-seared grass and grazing animals. The tourist train, three carriages of clicking and clattering Japanese camera equipment, was said by the authorities to be the safest way to Machu Picchu. But it was difficult to understand how - bolted into the carriage as protection against thieves, I felt like a participant in canned target practice, crawling at enticing speed up the mountainside. It was perhaps an indication of Peru's catastrophic economic state that thievery, to which so many people have been driven, was considered a greater threat than one of the world's most determined guerrilla armies. After a couple of hours the landscape changed with almost indecent abruptness. The neatly-ordered scorched yellows turned to luxuriant, rowdy plant-life as the train was swallowed by jungle. The change of scenery brought with it a change of mood. Sunny and light became brooding and mysterious. We went on, edging into the heart of this strange jungle, before stopping at a little station. Here, we swapped the rattle of the train for the drone of a bus, which heaved itself up the plant-entangled mountainside. The train station disappeared below. Suddenly, unexpectedly, the pilgrimage ended. Just over there was one of the world's most extraordinary sights: Machu Picchu. The postcard image was instantly recognisable: a stone city labyrinth with a ribbed, dinosaur-backed mountain in the background; Inca terraces; ruined palace walls; even a llama. But Machu Picchu, unlike the pyramids of Egypt or the Great Wall of China, was not diminished by reality. What celluloid images fail to capture is the tremendous tumble and jostle of jungle-infested mountains soaring skywards and plunging valleywards to the Urubamba river below. What the postcards miss, too, is the highland silence, the humidity, the drilling heat and the atmosphere of centuries undisturbed. Most importantly, pictures could not convey the essential beauty of Machu Picchu: the almost organic harmony with which the stone city appeared to grow, with the same ease as a bush or a tree, from its mountain saddle. So perfectly carved were the stones that they seemed to nuzzle together. The conquistadors never found Machu Picchu, and it is still not known precisely what it was for. It may have been a fortress, a pilgrimage centre or home to the 'chosen women' of the Inca. Bingham thought it was the principal city of the last four Inca rulers who retreated to the impenetrable hide-away following the arrival of Spanish aggressors. Whatever, it is now one of the wonders of the world. Peru's president, Alberto Fujimori, thinks so, too. Aware of the importance of a good press, he is fond of telling foreign journalists about the growing number of visitors to the Lost City. For that, says the president, one can thank him and the success of his war against Shining Path. Peru, insists the president, is now as safe a destination as London or New York. There is no need to be frightened, he says. However, readers who are familiar with those two cities may take only limited comfort from his assurances.</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Britain set on closer EC ties BRITAIN yesterday signalled that it intends to join its EC partners in closer European political and economic co-operation if Denmark rejects the Maastricht treaty in next month's referendum. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, made clear that there was no question of Britain joining Denmark outside the EC in the event of a second Danish 'No'. Speaking in Denmark at the end of a two-day meeting of EC foreign ministers, Mr Hurd said if the Danes rejected Maastricht next month, the treaty would not proceed. But he added: 'Of course, I am not saying we would not take part in further arrangements.' Mr Hurd's position echoed the UK government's recent enthusiastic pro-European line, which matches a growing confidence that the Tory Euro-sceptics are on the run and that the treaty is likely to be ratified at Westminster by the end of the summer. Mr Hurd made clear yesterday that he expected the Danes to support the treaty in the May 18 referendum - a view supported by recent opinion polls showing a clear lead for the Yes campaign. At the Edinburgh summit last December, France, Germany, Belgium and Spain all warned the UK and Denmark that failure to ratify Maastricht would prompt other countries to launch new treaty arrangements. Mr Hurd's explicit commitment to closer European co-operation contrasts with a much more guarded approach to future EC treaty arrangements last year, when the UK suggested that it might not take part in a future EC effort to recreate or expand on Maastricht in the event of a Danish or British rejection. Philip Stephens, Political Editor, adds: Mr John Major has made it clear that there could be no question of Britain pressing ahead with ratification of Maastricht if the Danes vote 'no' on May 18. But Mr Hurd's comments will nonetheless inflame the anger of the Tory Euro-sceptics. In the past the government has sought to limit the size of the Conservative rebellion against Maastricht by insisting that it would not allow the rest of the Community to leave Denmark behind.</p>

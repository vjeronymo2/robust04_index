			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> MULLIN SIGNS 9-YEAR WARRIORS PACT  </P> <P> Chris Mullin has signed a nine-year contract with the Golden State Warriors,  the NBA team announced today.  </P> <P> Terms were not disclosed.  </P> <P> Mullin, 26, averaged 26.5 points, 5.9 rebounds and 5.1 assists last year in his  fourth season. Only Chicago's Michael Jordan and Portland's Clyde Drexler had  higher averages in all three categories. He was named to the All-Star team and  All-NBA second team.  </P> <P> The Warriors' first-round draft pick out of St. John's in 1985, Mullin became a  restricted free agent following last season. There have been repeated rumors  throughout his career that the Brooklyn native might eventually sign with the  New York Knicks as a free agent, but the signing precludes that. Mullin's  salary was $700,000 last season.  </P></p>

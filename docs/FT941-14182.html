			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Arts: Distant echoes of long lost civilisations - Susan Moore admires the Ortiz antiquities currently on show at the Royal Academy In an age in which every businessman who makes the odd foray into Bond Street or Park Avenue acquires the soubriquet 'collector', it is heartening to discover the collection of George Ortiz. The works of art on show at the Royal Academy in London - their first public airing in the West - represent the cream of a collection that has been singlemindedly amassed and honed over 44 years. Ortiz belongs to that all but extinct breed of passionate, self-taught connoisseur-collectors fortunate to have the means - his grandfather was Bolivian 'Tin King' Simon Patino - to pursue his passion and the eye to utilise it. To say that he has formed the world's finest antiquities collection in private hands is almost to miss the point. Each piece speaks for itself. You do not have to know anything about ancient civilisations to respond to objects such as the commanding copper bust of the 12th Dynasty Pharoah Amenemenhat III, the handful of tiny Babylonian haematite shell and frog weights or the elegant curves of an Anatolian Bronze Age stag. George Ortiz's response to art has always been instinctive and emotional. He learnt by looking, by feeling, and then comparing. For the unveiling of his collection of 282 exhibits from some 27 different cultures, Ortiz has assumed the role of a team of curators and technicians. He has not only selected and catalogued the exhibits, previously confined to his home in Geneva, but supervised their packing and display down to the design and exact dimension of each showcase. Rusty Culp and his assistant have been flown in from the US to light the show; some Pounds 35,000 of new equipment has been donated to the RA. From first glimpse, it is apparent that this is no typical museum exhibition. A number of exhibits are left free-standing, unencumbered by the barrier of glass. Although ordered by chronology and region, the display favours juxtapositions determined more by aesthetics than by any archaeological purism. A lively bronze bowman from 7th century BC Crete stands before a much earlier, probably Athenian krater painted with a centaur of startlingly similar angular features. The comparison adds to our appreciation of both. Elsewhere two Nuragic warriors from 9th-7th century BC Sardinia find themselves locked in an accidental embrace, joined by a root that chose to grow through them. In a museum the root would have been removed and the figures separated. Most strikingly, each item is shown to its best advantage and given the requisite space to speak with its own voice. These are luxuries that overcrowded and underfunded museums cannot afford. In return for lending 280 pieces from his collection - this exhibition in effect - to the Hermitage and Pushkin museums, Ortiz was allowed the privilege - and every museum curator's dream - of trawling museums across the USSR to mount his own loan exhibition of ancient art from Eurasia. The show was staged in Zurich and Kyoto last year. Unlike many museum curators, he is also free to acquire antiquities that come without a provenance. Greek art forms the bulk of the Ortiz collection, ranging from the Neolithic to the Byzantine and from the Greek mainland to Sicily and beyond. Not to be missed is the infinitely subtle marble torso that so assuredly marks the transition from the stylised severity of the Archaic style to the naturalism of the classical period. Or the glorious group of partially gilt silver rhytons or drinking vessels that take the form of stag and doe's heads and the twin-faced Janus. But no less remarkable are the far less familiar survivors of more distant civilisations. There is the monumental alabaster Sumerian bull-man from 3rd millennium BC Umma, the spirited patinated bronze chariot fittings in the guise of wild asses from Early Zhou dynasty China, the imposing Ghandara head from present-day Pakistan believed to represent the Prince Siddhartha, the first Buddha. The spiralling gold armlet from Bronze Age France is pure sculpture. It is the smaller pieces and figurines that more often beguile us with their purity of form, line and expression. The best exude a vibrant human spirit that breezes effortlessly across continents and millennia. Art of the Ancient World continues at the Royal Academy of Arts, London W1, until April 6.</p>

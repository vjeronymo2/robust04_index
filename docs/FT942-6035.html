			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures came under renewed selling pressure, taking their cue from international bond markets, writes Steve Thompson. A steady opening at 2,941 by the June contract on the FT-SE 100 quickly gave way as big sellers moved into the market. This followed a slide in German bunds and UK gilts after news that the Bundesbank had withdrawn the bund issue scheduled for this month. With selling pressure building up during the mid-morning period, June fell sharply to trade at a discount of 30 points to the cash market, reaching a low point of 2,901 around lunchtime. This level triggered substantial bear closing and a squeeze developed. June was subsequently driven up to a closing level of 2,959, a discount of 14.5 points to the cash market, with sentiment helped by a better than expected opening on Wall Street. Dealers described the market as extremely nervous and driven by worries of increasing inflation in the US and the UK. Turnover in the June Footsie future reached a heavy 21,246 contracts. Traded options were dominated by the FT-SE 100 and Euro-FT-SE contracts, which together accounted for 26,019 trades out of a total turnover of 38,302 lots. J. Sainsbury was the most heavily traded stock option.</p>

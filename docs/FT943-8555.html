			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Serbs fire from UN arms zone Serbs fired at Bosnian government forces with an anti-aircraft gun supposedly under United Nations control in a depot near Sarajevo, a UN military spokesman said yesterday. The incident was provoked by a machine gun barrage into the Bare weapons-storage point from Bosnian army positions not far away and was the latest in a series that have eroded the integrity of a 12-mile UN security zone around the Bosnian capital. Moslem-led government troops targeted the Bare site on Monday evening, the spokesman said, and Bosnian Serb troops staying in a house on the unfenced rural site ran out, grabbed a 40mm anti-aircraft gun supervised by French peacekeepers and fired back. Meanwhile, Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic is resisting efforts to deploy international monitors on Yugoslavia's borders with Bosnia. The despatch of observers would be an important signal that Belgrade's commitment to the embargo against the Bosnian Serbs is genuine. Mr Milosevic imposed the embargo on August 4 after Bosnian Serb leaders rejected the international peace plan for Serbs to give the Moslem-Croat federation a third of the 70 per cent of Bosnia they currently control.</p>

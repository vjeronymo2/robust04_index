			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Leaders want to speed up Yugoslav aid EUROPEAN Community leaders agreed last night to speed up their help to the hundreds of thousands of people in the former Yugoslavia facing death and starvation as winter approaches. A declaration by the 12 heads of government underlined the importance of providing winter shelter and ensuring the delivery of relief supplies. It said EC aid worth Ecu213m (Pounds 167m) was ready for immediate disbursement. It includes 120,000 tons of food, medicines, shelter and 40 trucks. Member states said they would immediately provide further staff and resources, practical and financial, to strengthen the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' capacity in the region. The Community would also immediately establish a task-force to support the efforts of UNHCR to deliver humanitarian aid. To make aid more effective, the European Council called on the UNHCR to set up next week a meeting of technical experts on emergency aid and, next month, a stock-taking conference to assess the effectiveness of the operation and recommend further measures. The heads of government called on other international donors to make a commensurate effort to support the UNHCR appeal. Laura Silber adds from Belgrade: Mr Dobrica Cosic, the federal president of Yugoslavia, yesterday called for Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's resignation, intensifying pressure on the controversial socialist leader. Mr Cosic, a writer who has wielded tremendous influence in Serbian politics, for the first time appears to have drawn battle lines between Serbia's ruling socialists and the federal government.</p>

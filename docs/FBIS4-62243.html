			<p>BFN     [Text] A considerable part of deputies of the Ukrainian  parliament do not share the opinion of President Leonid Kravchuk  concerning the postponement of presidential elections scheduled  originally for 26 June. This was said in an interview with  INTERFAX-Ukraine by member of the temporary presidium of  parliament Vasiliy Durdynets who was commenting on Kravchuk's  proposal.    Durdynets noted that in the issue of elections "there are a  number of questions which should be seriously discussed" in  permanent parliamentary commissions and then the issue should be  put to the vote. "I hope that the deputies will show enough  responsibility and common sense," he said.    Leader of the Ukrainian Conservative-Ukrainian Party Stepan  Khmara believes that the deputies will not back the president's  proposal to put off the elections. In his opinion, the  president's appeal makes him "seem simply weak and helpless,"  "his unconvincing arguments are simply ridiculous."    "We consider it necessary to postpone the elections until  the  end of the year, because the presidential campaign today could  disturb peace in the country," chairman of the All-Ukrainian  Society Prosvita Pavlo Movchan stated. However, that does not  mean that Prosvita supports Kravchuk's candidacy, he added. "He  has made enough mistakes and senseless actions."    One of the leaders of the Ukrainian Communist Party Boris  Oleynik said that there is a certain sense in arguments in favor  of the postponement. In his opinion, that may violate the  balance in society.    At the same time, Oleynik said, the faction of Communists  believes that "there should be no violations of the law--the  elections should take place."    "In the president's proposal we don't see the main thing we  are looking for--an explanation of what he is going to do before  the elections if they are postponed," leader of the major  faction of the old parliament Novaya Rada Ivan Zayets told  INTERFAX-Ukraine. In his opinion, the elections will not be  postponed.</p>

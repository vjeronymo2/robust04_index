			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Viktor Serov report: "Vasiliy Kiselev, Vice Governor of </F> Novosibirsk Oblast: `We Are Duty Bound To Resolve the  Nonpayments Problem'"]    [Text] Novosibirsk--The decline in production in  Novosibirsk Oblast in January constituted 35 percent, and this  rate continued in February. One-fourth of the workers are  without a job, practically. And these figures characterize not  only the military-industrial complex, what is more, but also the  production of consumer goods and food, of which there can be no  question of a surplus. Enterprise mutual arrears are at the  two-month output sales level. They have grown one-third and  constitute almost R200 billion.    This means that simple methods of influencing inflation (by  way of a cutback in the issue of credit, for example) will not  work. The enterprises are reacting to this with mutual commodity  credit. There are no payments to the treasury here, no money for  wages, and so forth. The unpaid wages are today approaching a  month's arrears. Thus the pressure in the pot is growing.    "Unfortunately, at the enlarged session of the government,"  Vasiliy Kiselev said, "I did not see specific mechanisms of a  resolution of this problem. And unless a solution is found  within two or three months, the entire Russian financial and  economic system will explode.    "But we have an opportunity for another version of events  also," the vice governor continued. "I cannot fail to mention  with satisfaction the actions of the Ministry of Finance. This  most unitary department is engaging in clearly expressed  federalist actions. I am sure that as of 1 April the Ministry of  Finance will introduce to the system of transfer relations of  the budgets of the territory and the federal budget [sentence as  published]. This means that there will be the nonspecific,  unstipulated transfer of funds from one budget to another for  the purpose of equalization of budget and financial support for  the territory.    After all, it is obvious that the inequality of Russia's  regions from the federal budget viewpoint could rupture the  unity of Russia faster than any talk about separatism or  unitarism. But why, tell me, did per capita expenditure in  Novosibirsk Oblast in 1993 constitute R96,500, in Omsk Oblast  R184,000, and in Kemerovo Oblast R294,000? The answer is clearly  not economic!... So as of the second quarter of the present year  this approach will, with the emergence of the appropriate  prescriptive base, be eliminated. And it will not be necessary  to crawl around offices of the capital and ask for budget  handouts.</p>

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Japan and the global crunch READERS may well be confused to the point of indifference by the reports about Japanese financial activities. It's time to get this straightened out. As will appear, the Japanese crunch will have international effects but only indirectly on the securities markets. The basic facts have just heaved into view, out of the murk of Japanese bank accounting practices, with the leak of a Japanese bank estimate of potential problem loans in the Japanese banking system. The problems are mainly domestic, but they are huge. The trust banks, which tend to specialise in property lending, are naturally the hardest hit. Out of total loans of Y59,300bn (say Dollars 420bn), Y7,300bn to Y9,800bn (Dollars 50-70bn) are regarded as potentially suspect, or 12-16 per cent, in round numbers. The 11 biggest commercial banks have lent a combined Y236,900bn; non-performing loans are put in the Y13,700bn to Y18,300bn range: Dollars 85-125bn, or 5.7-6.4 per cent. These numbers have been published in Tokyo, and appear to be accurate. What this means is that although the Japanese banks are still doing some cautious lending, the whole system is dangerously vulnerable to any further fall in property values, or any second leg of the stock market slump. The banks themselves are among those helping, not altogether successfully, to support the stock market; property, especially in such areas of wild excess as Osaka, are like those in London, a matter of tightly-crossed fingers. In any other country, such a banking crisis might signal an immediate slump; Japan, with its enormous flow of savings at the personal and national level, is more resistant. But loans are tight, with the main effect, as here, being felt by the small company sector; and since the market rigging is widely suspected, savings have been flowing overseas. Hence the heavy buying in New York and London by Japanese insurance companies and savings institutions. There has also been a secondary effect in foreign credit markets. Japanese banks, for so long among the most aggressive lenders, are drawing in their horns, and their loans books in some places are actually shrinking. This is only a marginal constraint in Europe (including Britain); but it will tend to hamper growth or recovery in some of their main areas of activity - notably south-east Asia, where the Japanese have been providing up to 90 per cent of foreign capital; and also California. California is perhaps the most interesting case; for while the Asians can expect continued large flows of corporate capital from Japan, investors like Sony, Matsushita, and the major Japanese property developers have not had a happy time on the west coast. The Japanese banks now control more than a third of all business lending in California, and nearly a quarter of other commercial lending. The current Japanese lending slowdown has been hampering any recovery from the west coast recession for some time. Post-riots, recovery has retreated far into the future. Defence cuts are making things worse. Actual liquidation by the Japanese-owned banks could cause a regional slump. This means that the Tokyo banks are not just a Japanese problem; Mr Bush is now running second to his businessman challenger Ross Perot in the region, and the White House is getting actively concerned. This means that the US authorities have fully woken up to a fact which does not seem to disturb the happy dreams of the bulls and regulators on this side of the Atlantic: the fact that in a global market, troubles in the main source of capital must effect everyone. In most countries Japanese debt deflation, provided that the system as a whole is preserved, is just one more factor assuring that any recovery will be slow; but in some regions, it is a much more pressing menace, and one which will effect more distant regions through trade. It is little good comforting ourselves with the thought that the leak is not at our end of the boat.</p>

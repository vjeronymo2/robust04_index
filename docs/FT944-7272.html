			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Arts: Ballets Jazz de Montreal - Dance It all depends on what you mean by 'ballet', and by 'jazz'. And, I must add, on how tiresome you find the combination of these elements. Les Ballets Jazz de Montreal are at Sadler's Wells this week on a return visit. I saw the first of two programmes - or rather, as much of the first as I could bear to watch on Tuesday. It was an evening more catatonic than jazzy, and hardly balletic at all. Three pieces of choreography; 13 dancers; dull design; a toothless feel to it all - no bite to step or score. And the bland played on. The best came first: James Kudelka's Ghosts, set to songs by the Beatles, with an eccentric edge to the dance which matched what was audible of the lyrics. A lot of brightness from the performers did not help, but Kudelka has an ingenious way with their bodies. The succeeding Lovers, by Jennifer Muller, claimed to be 'inspired by the paintings of Gustav Klimt'. This statement needed to be amplified by the announcement that Miss Muller is the rightful Grand Duchess Anastasia. We were treated to a tinkling piano score by Keith Jarrett which proved as maundering and vexing as Miss Muller's four duets, whose theme was He Needs Her And She Needs Him. The rest of the news was that the dances and the dancers looked anxious but uninteresting, and dragging Klimt's name into these goings-on was an insult to the fair name of Viennese painting. Mauricio Wainrot's Swing the Cat ended the evening. The title was promising  -something like tossing the caber? - but the dance was not. A collection of musical nullities from Simon Jeffe's Penguin Cafe Orchestra found an exact counterpart in innocently awful little outings for a group of bathers. After four numbers, with not even a kitten having been swung, I left - a disappointed man. At Sadler's Wells until November 27.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / World Trade News: New textile rules 'pose threat to Caribbean' CLOTHING exporters in Central America and the Caribbean say they will be damaged if proposals for new rules governing the textile and clothing trade are implemented, Canute James reports from Kingston. The producers, which ship mainly to the US, say their industries will be damaged if quotas are phased out over 10 years, as proposed in the current negotiating text for the industry in the Uruguay Round of trade talks. The producers say their fears have been compounded by the conclusions of a report prepared by the Fiber, Fabric and Apparel Coalition for Trade, a combination of US textile and clothing groups. 'The report projects severe damage to the US industry, which would decline by 40-60 per cent in the face of unfettered competition by Asian economies, including China,' the producers said in letters sent to the White House and US congressmen. This would occur by the year 2002 if quotas were phased out over the 10-year period proposed in the text tabled by the chairman of the negotiating group on textiles and clothing. Much of the region's clothes trade with the US is based on bilateral treaties where clothes are assembled and re-exported. Producers say proposed changes could cut jobs in the US industry from 1.74m to 780,000.</p>

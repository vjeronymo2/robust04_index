			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: BEP falls to Pounds 4m and board changes planned BOARD CHANGES are likely soon at the Bristol Evening Post, the regional newspaper in which Sunday Sport publisher Mr David Sullivan owns a 10 per cent stake. Along with the announcement of a 15 per cent fall in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.06m, Mr Michael Gay, chief executive of BEP, said top managerial changes would be announced later this month 'which would lead to possible board appointments'. Mr Gay said the changes had come as the result of an 'internal reappraisal'. The candidates - who could come from outside the company - are unlikely to include Mr Sullivan, who was thwarted in his attempt to win a seat on the board at an extraordinary meeting in August. Mr Sullivan, a multi-millionaire who made his fortune through the sale of a string of sex shops in 1981, was also blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission from taking a controlling stake in the middle-market tabloid in 1990. The advertising recession continued to weigh heavily on BEP over the year ending March 31. Mr Gay said a sharp decline in advertising - 67 per cent of total newspaper revenues - had been the main reason for the profits decline. Sales were flat at Pounds 61.4m. Employment advertising was hardest hit, with revenues down by 36 per cent to Pounds 3.5m. Mr Gay said there was no sign of an upturn in advertising, and any recovery would be 'very long term'. Newspaper profits fell from Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 800,000. Sales of the flagship paper rose by 2.5 per cent to 102,000 average daily circulation. The increase had been achieved by becoming more 'popular', Mr Gay said, and not by moving down-market. BEP retained 83 retail outlets, although it was still planned to reduce this to 50 confectionery and newsagent shops. The retail division had been disappointing, with profits down almost 32 per cent to Pounds 463,000. During the year, BEP reduced staff from 937 to 810, while 72 employees took pay cuts of up to Pounds 3,500. Net savings of Pounds 1m were achieved as a result. Mr Gay said cost-cutting would save a further Pounds 2.1m in the current year. The redundancies resulted in an exceptional cost of Pounds 3.2m which was offset by the sale of 357,800 Reuters shares for Pounds 3.3m. BEP retains 525,000 shares, representing Pounds 6.2m at yesterday's close. The company has Pounds 2.7m cash in the bank. Earnings per share fell from 13.54p to 12.44p. A maintained final dividend of 7.75p makes an unchanged 11.5p total.</p>

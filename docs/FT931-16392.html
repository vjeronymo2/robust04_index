			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / London bombings claimed by IRA THE IRA claimed responsibility yesterday for planting incendiary devices that exploded in four central London stores. The pre-dawn explosions caused serious damage to one shop and followed telephoned warnings to the BBC and Sky TV of 'numerous bombs' in the capital. No one was hurt in the attacks and Oxford Street and Trafalgar Square, which were closed while police searched for more devices, were re-opened before yesterday's morning rush hour. Three devices exploded in stores in Oxford Street, while another caused damage to a bookshop in The Strand.</p>

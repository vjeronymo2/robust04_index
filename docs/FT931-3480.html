			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: Outside advice - Legal Briefs An independent survey commissioned by City lawyers Taylor Joynson Garrett of Britain's top 1,000 companies shows that 68 per cent are using more or the same amount of legal advice from outside law firms this year compared with 1992. In-house legal departments are still contracting, however, with 53 per cent of companies saying they would be employing the same number or fewer in-house lawyers this year. Lawyers working in medium-sized companies with smaller legal departments are particularly at risk, with 15 per cent of companies in this category expecting to make cuts in their in-house legal teams in 1993. The survey also showed that 20 per cent of the top 1,000 companies had recently taken advice on corporate recovery matters, and that 10 per cent had sought advice on issues connected with the future viability of their businesses or part of them. The companies all agreed that law firm fees were 'very high', but that cost was only the fifth most important factor when choosing legal advisers. Specialist expertise came top.</p>

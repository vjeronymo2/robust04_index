			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / There's no option but to take Courage With its asset write-down yesterday, Foster's Brewing Group took a step toward solving several strategic problems it faces in the UK in brewing and pub retailing. On the brewing side, Courage, the second largest UK brewer, is suffering like the rest of the industry from declining beer consumption and intense competition. Some industry observers have even questioned whether Foster's would stay the course. On the pub side, it stands over the next few years to lose supply agreements and ties to pub estates that account for some 25 per cent of its output. It thought it had found the solution to these problems four years ago in a complicated agreement with Grand Metropolitan, the UK food and drinks group. Foster's would commit itself to brewing while GrandMet would concentrate on pub retailing, allowing each group to play to its self-confessed strengths. To that end, GrandMet sold its brewing activities such as the UK production of Carlsberg Pilsener and Budweiser to the Australian group to enhance Courage's portfolio. GrandMet and Foster's combined their pubs in a 50-50 joint venture, Inntrepreneur Estates (IEL) which GrandMet essentially runs. Inntrepreneur was dogged from the start by its financial structure. Both parties loaded it with debt so they could extract cash from the transaction. But asset values fell rapidly during the recession, forcing Foster's and GrandMet to put in more equity to maintain banking covenants. IEL, which has an estate of some 6,500 pubs, has also found trading difficult. Foster's shed a ray of hope on it yesterday,saying that IEL would achieve 'a modest profit' for the first time in the year to September thanks in part to lower interest costs. 'IEL is motoring along quite favourably,' Mr Bob WIlliams, managing director of Grand Metropolitan Estates,which effectively runs the joint venture, said yesterday. Despite this pick-up, Foster's has to address two questions: Its agreement to supply beer to IEL runs out in 1998; Grand Met has indicated it would prefer to focus on IDV, its international spirits business, and food activities such as Pillsbury. 'IEL is not a key part of that strategy,' Mr Williams said. More urgently, Foster's will lose next year an agreement to supply beer to the Chef and Brewer pub and restaurant chain bought last year by Scottish &amp; Newcastle from GrandMet. Although Foster's will continue to supply beer to bigger Chef and Brewer outlets for a further five years, S&amp;N will clearly want to increase sales of its own beers. Despite attempts by the UK government through its 'beer orders' to bring greater separation of brewing and pubs, all large British brewers except Courage and Guinness still have estates. But Guinness is a special case because its strength lies in a powerful international brand. Foster's will say only that it is reviewing all its strategic options in the UK. For many industry observers, however, buying a large chunk of the IEL estate would at least guarantee some sales volume. Price, however, could be an issue. Foster's and GrandMet now value their combined equity in IEL at Pounds 225m. In addition, they have more than Pounds 500m of IEL debt or loans on their books. Therefore, Foster's might have to pay about Pounds 500m to buy a majority of the pubs, leaving the rump to be sold to a management buy-out or to newly established pub chains. Fortunately for Foster's, its year-end results announced yesterday carried a good operating contribution from Courage. The UK brewer contributed operating profits of ADollars 174.4m, down from ADollars 208.3m a year earlier. They were essentially flat, however, allowing for the impact of a change in excise duty in the UK and currency translations. Courage's sales fell to ADollars 2.19bn from ADollars 2.39bn but it increased its market shares by maintaining its beer volumes in a declining market. 'Courage has delivered some of the best beer numbers the industry has seen in the past year,' said Mr Geoff Collyer, an analyst with NatWest Securities. The UK performance was helped by cutting some ADollars 50m from of Courage's annual operating costs of ADollars 900m, part of an effort to increase productivity. Courage still has plenty of work to do on repositioning some of its brands and cutting some of its capacity. Its Webster's Yorkshire bitter, competing against its brother-brand, John Smith, is a case in point. Moreover, the industry background remains highly unfavourable. Beer consumption is falling by about 2 or 3 per cent a year, lower margin off-licence sales are draining pub sales, and imports are growing - both direct imports by brewers and consumer imports across the Channel. Overall, the industry has to make big cuts in both brewing capacity and the number of pubs. Foster's indication yesterday that it will stick with the UK might only prolong the agony for all.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Observer: Hard graft Reformed Japanese gangsters are finding it hard to convince potential employers that they can now toe the line. It seems that gangsters wanting to quit their gang, following Japan's recent crackdown on underworld activities, find that they often have to forfeit a little finger as a punishment. As a result, many would-be good guys say that their missing digit makes them particularly vulnerable now that they are being forced to look for legitimate employment. However, an entrepreneurial doctor from the north of the country has offered to graft a toe in the place of the missing finger to make the problem less obvious. So far, 20 repentant mobsters have mended their ways.</p>

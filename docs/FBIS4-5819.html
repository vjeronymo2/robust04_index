			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a military source, the U.S.  imperialists on 10 and 11 April mobilized and deployed 20-odd  military planes of various types in South Korea from overseas  bases, thus committing a crime.    Formations of assault planes and pursuit-assault planes that  took off from bases in Japan on 11 April flew into U.S. Air  Force bases in South Korea. Prior to this, on 10 April, various  types of military aircraft, including F-15, F-4, FA-18, AV-8 and  EA-6, were mobilized and deployed to South Korea from U.S. bases  in Japan and the Pacific area.    In addition, on 10 and 11 April, C-5 ultra-large strategic  transport airplanes carrying a large number of troops and lethal  equipment from bases on the U.S. mainland and the Pacific region  and C-130 and C-141 transport airplanes landed in U.S. Air Force  bases in South Korea and airlifted troops were mobilized and  deployed to the operational zones and war equipment was supplied  to these zones.    Our people and the People's Army are watching with vigilance  the war preparation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South  Korean puppets. If the rascals perpetrate an act of aggression,  we will deal a resolute punishment to them.</p>

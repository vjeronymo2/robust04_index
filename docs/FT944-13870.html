			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Consumer confidence shows fresh dip in US Consumer confidence weakened again this month while new data on employment costs showed wage inflation still very subdued, helping to offset the impression created by economic statistics last week that the US economy was about to accelerate again. The Conference Board, a New York-based business organisation whose survey of consumer confidence is widely watched, said its index dropped this month by two points to 87.6 per cent. This is the fourth monthly drop in succession, but the board said the index had still fallen by a total of less than 5 points from its peak in June. Mr Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's consumer research centre, said the survey suggested 'continued economic growth in the months ahead. Respondents to the survey said they were more worried about job prospects and less optimistic about their own financial situation than in previous months.' Although the decline in the confidence index has been modest, it was much larger than economic forecasters had anticipated, and served to dampen concern that the economy might again be showing signs of overheating. That concern was fuelled last week by strong housing starts data. Data on sales of existing homes published yesterday showed more weakness, though sales still rose 1 per cent in September. The Labour Department said its employment cost index rose by just 0.7 per cent in the July to September quarter, after rising 0.9 per cent in the second quarter and 0.8 per cent in the first. This left the annual rate of increase in employment costs stable at 3.2 per cent, the slowest rate since the index began in 1982 and arguably the slowest in the last 30 years. Wages and salaries rose by 0.8 per cent in the third quarter, producing an annual increase of 2.9 per cent, but benefits, including health insurance, rose by 1.1 per cent in the quarter for an annual increase of 4.0 per cent. The Labour Department said wage increases in major collective bargaining agreements signed in private industry during the July to September period averaged 1.9 per cent a year.</p>

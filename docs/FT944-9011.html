			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / People: No flies on Merrill Lynch's Owen The average age of members of Merrill Lynch's London office has taken a dip this week following the retirement of John Owen, 60, the longest serving member of London's US stockbroking community. When Owen joined Merrill's London office in 1961 as a Pounds 1,450-a-year trainee broker, Merrill had a staff of 10 and was the sort of outfit that was prepared to challenge the City establishment by advertising its services. Lord Dundee of the London Stock Exchange gave us a 'very hard time', says Owen. Today, Merrill employs around 1,800 people in the City and many of them got their job because they caught Owen's eye. Owen went trawling for new recruits long before it became fashionable for stockbroking firms and merchant banks to do the 'milk round' at universities. Many still work at Merrill but others who have gone on to greater things include Richard de Lisle, managing director of equities at Dean Witter, Geoffrey Bunting, first vice president of Prudential Bache Securities, Jonathan Laing of JP Morgan Securities, and Richard Spring, the Tory MP. A former chairman of the Association of New York Stock Exchange Member Firms in the City, Owen has bumped into most of the big investors during his City career. There will be plenty of people who still recognise the name of Jim Slater, the wealthy investor who once ran Slater Walker Securities. But how many, like Owen, dealt with go-go investors such as Gerry Tsai or Bernie Cornfeld? Owen refuses to accept that the City is less fun than it was when he started. His advice to young stockbrokers is to get an egg-timer. If the sand has run out and you are still talking, you are not doing your job. His final tip: never believe a broker who says that it's different this time. 'In my experience it is never different,' says Owen, who plans to use his retirement to improve his fly fishing.</p>

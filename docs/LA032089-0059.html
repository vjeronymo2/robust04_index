			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: TO THEM, IT WAS AN ASTRONOMICAL UPSET  </P> <P> What do you do when you're hurtling through space and want National Collegiate  Athletic Assn. basketball tournament results?  </P> <P> Radio Mission Control.  </P> <P> The astronauts aboard the space shuttle Discovery did exactly that last week  and received a scorelist from Mission Control in Houston.  </P> <P> Michael Coats, Discovery commander, did a double take when he noticed that  Siena had upset Stanford, 80-78.  </P> <P> "Is that a misprint?" Coats asked Mission Control's David Low.  </P> <P> Low, a Stanford graduate, paused and then slowly replied: "As painful as it for  me to report, that is not a misprint."  </P> <P> Silent partner: Bobby Bonds and George Foster, former teammates on the San  Francisco Giants, are good friends, but their friendship started on an odd  note.  </P> <P> When Bonds and Foster roomed together, Foster was silent the first two weeks.  </P> <P> Finally, Bonds exploded.  </P> <P> "You've got to start talking or there's going to be trouble," Bonds told  Foster.  </P> <P> "For a second, I thought George would choose trouble," he said. "Then he  smiled, and after that we got along great."  </P> <P> Swim like the dolphins: The Northern Michigan women's swimming team visited the  Dolphin Research Center in Marathon, Fla., recently.  </P> <P> Did they plan to take lessons from the dolphins? No, but close.  </P> <P> "We are students of propulsion in the water," Coach Ann James said. "Who better  to learn from than dolphins, the natural experts."  </P> <P> Campaigning for a cabinet post: After enduring an awful season, USC basketball  Coach George Raveling was asked if he'd retain his job.  </P> <P> "I think I'll be here unless President Bush wants me to help him with  international inflation," Raveling said.  </P> <P> "I'd be interested in being the drug czar. I'd probably leave coaching for  something as meaningful as that."  </P> <P> By the numbers: When the Pittsburgh Pirates were issuing uniforms in training  camp, a rookie drew No. 7.  </P> <P> While the equipment man was affixing the number to his hat, the rookie said, "I  wear 7 1/4."  </P> <P> Mr. Nice Guy: Sean Elliott, Arizona All-American forward, was trailed by  autograph-seekers in Boise, Ida., where the Wildcats played in the West  Regionals.  </P> <P> Some fans even camped out at his hotel. Elliott didn't mind the attention.  </P> <P> "I'm a nice guy, I don't bite," he said. "I'd probably have done the same thing  when I was a kid and the NCAA came to town."  </P> <P> Lute Olson, Arizona coach, wishes Elliott would just say no to the fans. "We  held the bus up for 20 minutes while he tried to escape," Olson said.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Doug Moe, Denver Nuggets coach, after his team played poorly in a  victory over the San Antonio Spurs last week: "They out-awfulled us."  </P></p>

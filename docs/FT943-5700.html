			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Brussels may delay moves on EU media ownership The European Commission is considering delaying proposals to harmonise rules on media ownership in the EU, amid concern about a backlash among member states worried about intrusive Brussels regulation. A decision to delay would be a setback for Mr Vanni d'Archirafi, the Italian internal market commissioner, who would like to introduce a new EU directive at the end of this year or early 1995. But majority sentiment in the Commission seems in favour of a 'softly softly' approach. Under a compromise that emerged in late July at a meeting of chiefs of staff of the 17 commissioners, the Commission will be asked this month to consider supporting an 'initiative' on media ownership, pending fuller consultation with member states. 'We think we need to do something, but we don't want to prejudge the question of legislation,' said one official. 'This is a very important, very touchy subject.' Mr d'Archirafi argues that investment in Europe's single market is being held back by the patchwork of media ownership rules. He believes that an 'initiative' - however it is dressed up - must lead to an EU directive if it is to be effective. The Italian commissioner has also argued, with some success, that the EU must position itself quickly to exploit advances in broadcasting technology which are paving the way for pay television, video on demand, and the proliferation of specialised TV channels. Germany's Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, supports this view. But Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, has raised questions about the need for EU-wide legislation, fearing it could infringe the principle of subsidiarity - devolving decision-making to the lowest appropriate national or regional level. The problems created by differences in media ownership surfaced during a consultation exercise the Commission last year. For example, in the Netherlands, newspaper publishers with a market share of more than 25 per cent cannot own a television channel, but in Italy the threshold is 16 per cent. In the UK, newspapers can not own more than 20 per cent of terrestrial channels, but there is no limit on ownership of satellite channels.</p>

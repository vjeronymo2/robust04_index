			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V.F. Fursenko and I.M. Kaplunova, candidates of </F> technical sciences, and N.N. Zhukova, engineer, Rostov Institute  of Railroad Transport Engineers]    [Abstract] For a long time, the only equipment designed in  Russia to scrub gases released into the atmosphere by industrial  and power generation facilities was ash- and dust-trapping  equipment. Most of the pieces of gas- and dust-trapping  equipment that were designed had comparatively low trapping  coefficients. It has been estimated that hundreds of billions of  rubles in ``emergency capital expenditures'' are needed to  achieve current maximum permissible one-time concentrations of  various toxic substances (including sulfurous anhydride and  nitrogen dioxide) in cities throughout Russia. Two indicators of  maximum permissible concentration of toxic substances are  currently in use. The maximum permissible one-time concentration  is determined by air sampled over a 20-minute period at the  level of the respiratory organs, and it refers to effects on the  threshold of reflex activity (sense of smell, light-headedness,  bioelectric activity of the cerebral cortex). The maximum  permissible average daily concentration, on the other hand,  refers to a 24-hour sampling at the same level in a given area  in which an animal could go 3 or 4 months without experiencing  any observable toxic or other related effects on its body. The  maximum permissible one-time concentration is thus an indicator  of human comfort, whereas the maximum permissible average daily  concentration is a criterion of the nontoxicity of a given  concentration of pollutant for humans. In the case of sulfurous  anhydride, the current maximum permissible one-time  concentration is 10 times higher than the maximum permissible  average daily concentration, and in the case of ash and dust,  the current maximum permissible one-time concentration is 3.33  times higher than the maximum permissible average daily  concentration. These standards, while possibly economically  justified in the case of existing gas-scrubbing equipment and  facilities, will only result in the need for new ``emergency  capital expenditures'' in the future if they are applied to  equipment and facilities now being designed and constructed. The  need to revise current maximum permissible concentrations used  in design standards is evident from calculations performed for  actual thermal electric power plants. The pollution levels  permitted by current maximum permissible one-time concentrations  are unsafe and have been calculated without consideration for  various exacerbating meteorological factors such as high air  temperature and extended periods of calm or very low winds. It  must also be remembered that some Russian population centers  experience these meteorological conditions 3 or 4 months each  year. If future waves of ``emergency capital expenditures'' are  to be avoided, existing standards governing the technological  design of thermal electric power plants, the Construction  Standards and Rules [SNiP] governing boiler units and thermal  electric power plants, and the respective standards governing  other sectors must be revised. Specifically, these documents  must begin using the maximum permissible average daily  concentration in specifying standards for gas-scrubbing  facilities and equipment. The additional up-front costs will  more than be made up for in the long run. Figures 3; references  6 (Russian).</p>

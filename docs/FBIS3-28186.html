Seiji Yoshida, one of the Japanese responsible for the  forcible drafting of "comfort women for the army," at a press  interview said the then patriotic labor service bureau of great  Japan was in charge of the forcible drafting of Koreans and he  himself directly commanded the forcible drafting of some 1,000  "comfort women for the army".    The Belgian paper SOLIDAIRE said that during World War II  the  Japanese Army forcibly drafted Korean women and used them as its  sexual playthings. After gratifying their carnal desire  Japanese soldiers unhesitatingly committed brutal atrocities  which would make even beasts blush with shame, such as  dismembering and burning them en masse, it said.    The Nepalese paper NAYA HANGK said that the drafting of  nearly 200,000 Korean women as "comfort women for the army" is  the most diabolic of the crimes committed by the Japanese  imperialists.    The Japanese authorities must apologize to mankind for the  sexual crimes and compensate to the Korean people, the paper  wrote.    Ridi Alajandro, general secretary of the new progressive  union of the Philippines, said Japan must be brought to justice  for drafting a large number of Korean women and forcing them to  serve as "comfort women for the army" during the Second World  War.    The Malaysian paper NEW STRAITS TIMES said that Japan must  immediately apologize for the criminal acts it committed against  the "comfort women for the army" and pay adequate compensation  to the victims. If Japan refuses this, it will face strong  denunciation and a stern judgement by the world public, it said.</p>

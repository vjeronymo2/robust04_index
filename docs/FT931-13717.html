			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Chambers stress need to foster recovery THE ECONOMY is still in recession but started to show signs of returning to growth last month, according to the latest quarterly survey by the British Chambers of Commerce, the umbrella body. The survey, carried out between December 1 and December 18, found that manufacturing industries' UK orders and deliveries were still falling although at a slower rate. Mr Richard Brown, the organisation's director of policy, said the service sector seemed on the point of growing again. Export sales for manufacturers and for service companies were at their highest for 2 1/2 years, reflecting a good response to the increased competitiveness resulting from sterling's devaluation. Higher export order books pointed to 'modest and seemingly sustainable growth'. But the chambers voiced 'extreme concern' about the state of the UK domestic market. 'With the exception of a negligible growth in the second quarter of 1992, manufacturers have not seen growth since the beginning of 1990 and are still forecasting further decline as we start 1993,' the report said. 'The need to foster domestic economic recovery remains strong.' The good news in the survey - the strongest rise in manufacturers' export performance since the surveys began in 1985 and improved business confidence  -was offset by a continued high loss of jobs. The survey of 9,061 companies employing more than 1.2m points to further redundancies this year. The percentage of manufacturers planning to reduce their workforces further in the current quarter exceeded by 19 percentage points the portion planning an increase. Among service companies the portion planning to reduce staff levels exceeded those planning staff increases by 9 percentage points. Capacity utilisation remains low. The percentage of manufacturers working at full capacity crept up to 20 per cent in the final quarter of last year from 17 per cent in the previous quarter while full capacity working in the service sector was barely changed at 19 per cent, up from 18 per cent. As a result employers have no incentive to take on staff or increase investment. The survey found a marginal increase in investment nationally in plant and machinery in the past quarter. But the inclination to spend more varied widely across the regions. The organisation said it did not expect a large upward revision of investments in the near future in spite of incentives announced in the Autumn Statement. It forecast some revival in the third quarter of this year provided confidence continues to rise. Business confidence has bounced back strongly after a steep fall at the time of Britain's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism last September. But the revival of expectations for profits and turnover has only restored confidence to the levels of mid 1991. The organisation said it would take 'another stable three months' to bring confidence to the point where companies would consider new investment and increased employment. The survey highlighted differences between the regions. The north-east was the best-performing region. Exporters of manufactured goods fared particularly well, but companies still planned to shed labour. The Yorkshire and Humberside areas, with one in four companies at full capacity, had more at full capacity than anywhere else.</p>

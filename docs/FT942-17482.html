			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Doubt cast on Bosnian peace talks Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian prime minister, yesterday said a new wave of 'ethnic cleansing' in the Serb-held north of the country had put a resumption of overall peace talks in doubt, writes Laura Silber from Belgrade. Mr Silajdzic also attacked the United Nations Security Council for not acting to stop a Serb artillery and tank offensive against the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, despite its status as a UN-protected safe haven. The UN commander for Bosnia, General Sir Michael Rose, said he would visit Gorazde tomorrow to take a look at the situation.</p>

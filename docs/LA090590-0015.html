			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE WORD'S THE THING AT POMONA  </P> <P> Ever since television came to rule communications, concerned watchers have  claimed that its pungent pictures are sabotaging the power of spoken and  written language. You know the kind of thing. A tough TV reporter asks the  President when he is going to stop sending arms to some Third World tyrant. The  President pretends he can't hear over the roar of Helicopter One, smiles and  swoops away amid fluttering flags and smiling children. Everybody out in TV  Land promptly forgets the tough question, sees the pretty, patriotic picture  and imagines all is well in the world.  </P> <P> On the face of it, you wouldn't think such cultural manipulation would have  much to do with the fine visual arts but, on evidence, it does. After all,  artists watch the tube too and apparently with some sense of envy and  competition. But Arthur Artist knows he can't beat CBS, so it has become his  practice in modern times not to emulate the dominant media but to play the role  of its poor relative, taking the dross of its castoffs and attempting to  recycle them alchemically into the gold of timeless art. This has been going on  ever since Picasso affixed the first popular song sheet to a painting or Kurt  Schwitters immortalized a gum wrapper.  </P> <P> So if electronic culture wants to trash the written word, art, by golly, will  rescue it.  </P> <P> All that is the subject of "Crossing the Line: Word and Image in Art" at Pomona  College's Montgomery Gallery (to Oct. 14) in Claremont. At least I think it is.  With 106 works by 70 artists from Saul Steinberg to John Baldessari, the  exhibition is as muddled as it is ambitious. Curator Mary Davis MacNaughton  tries to make it cover the three decades since 1960 and in her brochure essay  refers repeatedly to the "variety of media, the diverse ways artists have  reflected modern experience through the fusion of word and image." Such Noah's  Ark compendiums have the advantage of open-handedness (as against narrowly  focused theme shows that try to indoctrinate), but they are so open-ended that  viewers are virtually left to make up their own story. Here, evidence suggests  that words crept playfully into contemporary art in the Pop and Photorealist  imagery of the '60s.  </P> <P> Pop, in its celebration of everyday life, was accessible, witty, entertaining  and a refreshing antidote to the bohemian-aristocratic posture of earlier  modernism. Sometimes it is revealing of the character of the artist, as in Roy  Lichtenstein's "Crak," where his use of French predicts his eventual status as  the Cole Porter of Pop art. Often Pop had a kind of insidious social insight  that now appears downright precognitive. Ed Ruscha's 1966 "Standard Station"  was a red, white and blue celebration of our gas-guzzling, energy-careless  culture that looks downright mordant in the light of today's Middle East  headlines. In 1965, Robert Dowd made a lithograph that suggested the face of  Vincent van Gogh replace George Washington on the dollar bill, predicting the  radical commercialization of great art. Robert Cottingham's 1975 "F.W.  Woolworth" may be the subtlest and saddest of all. It sees the demise of homey  dime-store America and is rendered in loving, old-fashioned etching technique.  It seems to mourn visual arts that would become progressively less visual.  </P> <P> The pendulum swung in the bleak '70s when art became stark, inbred and so  conceptual that there was often nothing to see at all except complicated inbred  art jokes, like Nam June Paik's "Prepared Typewriter." It offers only a few  moments of art historical puzzle-solving until we connect it to a covered  typewriter by Marcel Duchamp. Lawrence Weiner digests even faster in a work  called "Earth to Earth, Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust," which is nothing more  than those words lettered on the wall.  </P> <P> In the '80s, all this was reordered into what MacNaughton calls  "Neo-Conceptualism," where images and words combine into various forms of  cultural advertising and self-promotion. Mitchell Syrop offers a  poster/painting lettered with "This is one of those great masterpieces that  will go unrecognized in its own time," and goes on to urge the viewer to do  himself a favor and buy it. Barbara Kruger is represented by one of her  yup-pified Russian avant-garde agit-prop posters showing a huge blow-up of the  face of Howdy Doody and the motto, "When I hear the word 'culture,' I reach for  my checkbook." It's at least as amusing as a New Yorker Hamilton cartoon but  seems a trifle oblique as the feminist protest it is supposed to be.  </P> <P> One of the insistent mysteries of this show is its inclusion of numerous  artists for whom the use of words is not a central issue. Enlisting talents  like George Herms, Mark di Suvero, Betye Saar and Roland Reiss seems odd until  we realize that they tend to share a common profile as visual poets. Armed with  this clue, we notice that the artists represented by the largest numbers of  works are Ruscha, Alexis Smith, Allen Ruppersberg, Jasper Johns and Andy  Warhol. All of them are visually interesting and capable of making rhyming  juxtapositions of words and images. The single best unfamiliar works in the  show are Ruppersberg's two big logs, which bear the carved mottoes "Love  Unafraid" and "The Three Ages of Love."  </P> <P> Poetry equates with painting in its ability to evoke pictures in the mind,  create physical sensations and suggest the slippery mysteries of real human  existence as opposed to the coercive limitations of ideology or technology.  Conceptualism lost when it assumed that the pictures on television somehow made  artists' pictures obsolete. TV imagery creates no resonant residue of memory,  offers no incentive for repeated contemplation. It cannot study or record the  language of the visual with the nuanced care of the fine artist. Intentionally  or not, the exhibition broadcasts the message that art still only works as  itself.  </P></p>

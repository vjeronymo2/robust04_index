			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Yeltsin in talks on Abkhazia refugees President Boris Yeltsin of Russia will today meet the leaders of Georgia and its breakaway region of Abkhazia as Russian peacekeeping troops are scheduled to begin resettling Georgian refugees returning to Abkhazia after being driven out in fighting last year. The official Russian news agency Itar Tass said that Mr Yeltsin would meet Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of the Georgian parliament, and Mr Vladislav Ardzimba, head of Abkhazia, in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. The Abkhazians, a minority in the region bearing their name, succeeded in defeating Georgian troops during a long-drawn out conflict - a defeat which was followed by an exodus of many thousands of the Georgians who made up the majority of the region. Near-riots broke out in Tblisi, the Georgian capital, over the weekend as the price of bread rose by nearly 300 times and other commodities and services also rose by huge amounts.</p>

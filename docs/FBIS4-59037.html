			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Dr. Hasan </F> Rowhani, Ayatollah Khamene'i's deputy on the Supreme National  Security Council, by an unidentified RESALAT correspondent in  Tehran; date not given]    [Excerpts] [RESALAT] As the secretary of the Supreme  National Security Council, what image of domestic and external  security would you project for the Islamic Republic of Iran?  What would constitute the most serious threats at home and  abroad?    [Rowhani] The image of national security is wonderful,  although not ideal. We are talking of the security of a country  in which there were changes in every area 15 years ago, when a  rare kind of revolution reached fruition. This revolution has  numerous enemies. Similarly, we have put behind us a prolonged  and major war that lasted eight years, the marks and effects of  which have not been obliterated. We are constantly encountering  the mischief-making of the counterrevolutionary groups.    Compared with our Northern, Eastern, and Western neighbors,  our security is remarkable. The condition of our Southern  neighbors is different and a vast array of foreign military  forces is present. We should view their situation differently.  In those areas, security is provided by others and for their  own interests.    We still have some centers of insecurity in the west and  east  of the country. In the West, Iraq is the root cause of  insecurity. In Kordestan, the vestiges of lackey grouplets  remain active. A country that has borne the brunt of war for  eight years, a war that has included security issues, cannot  efface them fast. [passage omitted]    In the eastern regions we have pockets of insecurity  stemming  from the problem of narcotics. The issue of combating drug  smugglers is tackled mostly for human considerations.  Generally, the smugglers do not want to distribute drugs in  Iran. They mostly want their goods to transit through Iran.  The center for manufacturing narcotics is in a region outside  Iran, between Pakistan and Afghanistan. They want to use Iran  as a route to convey the drugs to Europe and the United States.  The primary users of drugs are the Americans and then the  Europeans.    The main drug dealers and smugglers are also in the United  States and Europe. At times, even Western officials are  involved in this smuggling, which was exposed during recent  humiliating discoveries in Europe and the United States.    If the corruption in Europe and the United States and the  straying of their youth were not important for us, we could  ignore our campaign against the smugglers and, naturally, the  eastern regions of the country would become completely safe.    It is because of our sense of responsibility toward the fate  of mankind that we continue this struggle against these death  peddlers. Unfortunately, the Westerners are not only ungrateful  to our self-sacrificing forces, they castigate us for our  treatment and execution of the smugglers and label it human  rights violations.    But we consider ourselves beholden to the fate of humans, as  the happiness, health, and good fortune of our fellow beings is  one of our mottoes. Thus we can say that we have two centers of  insecurity, one of which relates to Iraq and the other to  narcotics. [passage omitted]    [RESALAT] If possible, let us get to the second part of the  question, that is, what is the most important threat?    [Rowhani] We perceive no real threats, whether at home or  abroad. Every country plans its security around potential  threats, which we also face inside and outside the country.    In a discussion regarding internal security, a potential  threat could be that the people become indifferent to the system  and the aspirations of the revolution. The day the people  become indifferent and do not feel that this country and  revolution belong to them, or that the burden of this revolution  is on their shoulders, will be the day when we should feel  danger. People are the greatest repository of the strength of  the country's system. If the people do not remain active in the  political, social, and economic arenas, we will face  difficulties everywhere.    The enemy has invested much in this regard and constantly  seeks--by disseminating innuendo, fallacious statistics, and  rumors--to project the impression that the revolution has done  nothing for the people, deliberately downplaying its  achievements and magnifying minor problems. They want to  deprive the revolution of its greatest asset, that is, the  people. [passage omitted]    In the sphere of foreign threats, while we are not in a  state  of war, a potential threat does exist. There are so many  foreign warships alongside our water. They can provoke  countries and even attack us and initiate a war.    We perceive the prime factor in terms of a foreign threat in  the United States, which is a real threat for us. This threat  is the powers of world arrogance spearheaded by the United  States and its lackey in the region, that is, Israel. Israel  implements the United States' instructions. If today we have no  real threat we should still be wary of malicious enemies.  [passage omitted]    [RESALAT] By changing the political geography of Iraq, the  powers of world arrogance are seeking to create an area under  Kurdish domination that will ultimately lead to the  establishment of a greater Kurdistan. Is this not a danger to  our security?    [Rowhani] We are opposed to the dismemberment of Iraq and  basically all kinds of changes in the political geography of the  region. This is something we have proclaimed frequently. It is  unlikely that this will seriously happen in the region. Even if  it does, it will pose no threat to us.    First, I should explain that there is a great difference of  opinion among the Westerners in this regard. Europe believes in  one thing, the United States in another. Even among the  Europeans, there is no consensus of opinion. Turkey has a  specific viewpoint. The issue is not so simple that in northern  Iraq they can so easily create a country called Kurdistan. The  countries in this area are very sensitive about this issue,  especially Turkey.    If we were to hypothesize that one day Iraq is dismembered  and a Kurdish government is set up in northern Iraq, this would  not be a threat to us. The people of our Kordestan have  realized--with this experiment in autonomy in northern Iraq--the  problems that have been generated. They know the hands of the  colonialists want to manipulate them constantly and use them in  ploys and as puppets. Our Kords have realized that the  colonialists seek only their own interests.    We do not differentiate among the Kurds, Turks, or Farsis in  Iran. There is no restriction anywhere in Iran, neither in the  universities nor in the Majles. Any Kord can be a candidate and  become a Majles deputy and participate in the legislative  decisions like all the other deputies. In some countries,  people are not even ready to mention the term, Kurd. The  country that has the most Kurds refers to them as mountain Turks  and is not willing even to use the word "Kurd." They have  problems but we have no problems right now. Apart from some  residual activity by grouplets affiliated with the colonialists  and great powers and Iraq--and their number is quite  negligible--we have no security problem. You witnessed the  dazzling presence of the Kordish people in the 11 February  marches in the Kord-inhabited cities.    The people of Kordestan came of their own accord and  expressed their sentiments toward the system and the revolution.  The participation of people in the Kord-inhabited cities during  the elections is never less than in other areas. We have never  felt any sense of danger from these areas.    [RESALAT] You mentioned threats from the United States. You  know that last year economic relations between Iran and the  United States increased considerably. German officials said  that the United States is Iran's main economic partner. Isn't  this closeness to the United States a threat to our interests?  What is your opinion?    [Rowhani] Our relations with the United States were severed  in the diplomatic, military, and cultural fields and there is no  contact of any kind between us and the United States in these  areas. Our economic contacts are not official, merely continuing  since 1359 [year beginning 21 March 1980]. Economic relations  between [Iranian] companies and American companies were never  severed. These relations have occasionally been weak, even  moderate, especially in the area of the purchase of oil by  American companies.    Nearly anytime we sold oil on the international market the  American companies bought it. The high figure that is sometimes  quoted is a two-way figure, much of it pertaining to the  purchase of our oil by American companies.    [RESALAT] What is the figure?    [Rowhani] I have no precise figures but mostly it concerns  the purchase of oil. Last year the volume of exchanges with us  increased, with a very positive result. This is because the  United States constantly exerted pressure on Europe and Japan to  reduce their volume of trade with Iran. The Americans asked:  Why do you not reduce the level of your trade relations with  Iran? Why do you purchase goods from Iran and make its economy  flourish? The announcement of these figures has now floored  them completely.    Now most of the G-7 countries openly attack the United  States  and ask: Why did you ask us to reduce the quantum of our trade  with Iran when you yourself have increased your trade relations  with Iran? This topic has generated serious discord among  them. I believe that the ploy the Americans had in hand and  wished to use against the Islamic Republic of Iran has been lost.    It is to our benefit that our real trading partners, namely  Japan and Europe, should know that there is another competitor  and this gives our companies greater strength to maneuver in  international economic relations.    It is clear that in this rivalry, we have a greater choice  in  our hands, which will bring prices down, raise the quality, and  ensure greater facilities. We must consider our own interests  in trade relations. I think the United States has been exposed  before the Europeans and the Japanese and a blow has been dealt  to its credibility.    [RESALAT] But there is another danger. If there comes a time  when only American companies are the buyers of our oil or of  much of it, and if they suddenly decide not to buy the oil, this  will undoubtedly cause us a lot of problems. Will it not?    [Rowhani] You should see who buys our oil in the market. In  any case, a considerable percentage is bought by the Americans  on the international market. But we have never relied on this  purchase. The volume of our sales is not such that it could  generate problems for us.    The basis of the policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran has  always been to diversify and not depend on one source. If a  problem arises, we will have room to maneuver and solve our  problem. But in the case of the United States, our sales from  American companies should be restricted to what is absolutely  necessary. Nothing else.    [RESALAT] No clear answer has been received from our  officials on our debts, that is, on why and how we ran up such  debts. Who is responsible for this and what will be our  situation?    [Rowhani] We have few problems with debts.    [RESALAT] Would this not be a question of security?    [Rowhani] In this context, every issue can become a security  issue from a particular perspective, be it political, cultural,  economic, or even educational. I wish to state that our debts  are not high, no more than expected. Our debts are what was  envisaged in the first Five-Year Plan. We permitted the  government to make the pledges.    [RESALAT] The period for repaying foreign debts will expire  in the next two or three years. Do you not think that this will  create a serious problem for the next president?    [Rowhani] There are two factors for the next presidential  tenure: One is that the main projects in which we have invested  in recent years will become operational and the future president  need only inaugurate these projects. [second factor not  mentioned]    Of course there is the problem of debts but these are not  expected to reach a very mind-shattering level, so we foresee no  serious problem.    If we depend only on oil then we will always have this  problem.    [RESALAT] The projection was $27 billion but we have now  pledged over $30 billion. The nature of the debts varies.    [Rowhani] We will manage one way or the other. The volume  is not such that it would be very amazing. Our commitments are  below $30 billion, that is, nearly the amount envisaged in the  Plan. They do not overstep the prescribed limits and are within  the volume projected.    To have foreign commitments worth 20 plus billion dollars is  not a very big deal. It is quite natural for a country with an  income of $20-25 billion to have foreign commitments on the same  level. This is lower than the international norm. If the  projections in the Plan had been envisaged in foreign exchange  earnings, these problems would not have arisen.    For example, we predicted in the Plan that the quantity of  our nonoil exports should be approximately $18 billion. We  viewed this in the context of our total income. But the export  of our nonoil products is not within our control such that we  can incorporate it in our programs.    Our other problem was the slump in oil prices, which created  problems with regard to our reimbursements. Oil prices are very  inappropriate as there is too much of a difference from the OPEC  base price.    Another problem is the parity of the dollar. The  fluctuations the dollar has had in the course of the first  Five-Year Plan have cost us $6 billion, because we sell against  the dollar and buy mostly against the mark.    That we have $25-30 billion of foreign commitments poses no  problem, in view of our income. Our problem stems from the  collective repayment falling due soon. Our problem is not the  commitment but the cash flow. We made short-term commitments,  which would have caused no problems had they been medium or  long-term ones. So it just happened that some repayments fell  due all at the same time and created this situation.    Some may say our foreign exchange management is weak and  that  we could have organized it better. But it is not easy to pin  down who is to blame, as most of the decisions are made  collectively by the Supreme Economic Council and the Cabinet.  [passage omitted]    [RESALAT] The necessary forecasts should have been made.  Again this makes the management answerable.    [Rowhani] True, the government, the Central Bank, and the  Majles should have anticipated this situation but the fact is  that when the Five-Year Plan was being compiled, there was no  way of foreseeing that the oil price would plummet so much. No  one could have thought that oil prices would reach the level  they reached in 1353 [year beginning 21 March 1974]. (The value  of the dollar is under 10 percent of what it was then).    [RESALAT] In view of its experiences in 1372 [year beginning  21 March 1993], the Majles has presented a more realistic budget  for 1373 [year beginning 21 March 1994], applying much caution  and thought. For example, it is specified how much will be  allocated to the repayment of commitments from our anticipated  income. The Majles made this allocation and included different  scenarios with a different plan to be followed in each case. As  for our commitments, I can sum up briefly:    1. The volume of the outstanding debts did not exceed what  was envisaged in the Five-Year Plan.    2. All the problems that arose were not the fault of the  management. If the oil price had not slumped and we had not had  a cashflow problem, this situation would not have arisen. I am  optimistic that with the attention the Majles and the president  will pay to this issue, we will have no similar problems in  future. Of course, we have found some specific solutions for  the repayment of our debts and the problem of careless debts has  almost been solved.    But because of the caution by the Majles, the budget for  this  year is rather tight. Ministers don't usually favor such  budgets.</p>

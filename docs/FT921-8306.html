			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Skilled blue-collar workers 'winning big rises' SKILLED blue-collar workers are receiving pay increases well above the rate of inflation because employers fear skill shortages when the recession ends, according to a survey of operative and clerical pay rates, Diane Summers writes. Increases averaged 9.3 per cent last year for blue-collar workers in administration, catering, distribution, engineering, personnel and production, according to the survey of more than 1,000 companies carried out by Reward, the pay research group. The report says skilled workers are being looked after well by their employers. 'Employers appear to be saying 'those we keep, we will pay well to ensure that the organisation does not stall its growth when the recession ends'.' Examples of big rises include: 17.7 per cent for warehouse supervisors and 15.4 per cent for skilled warehouse staff; 22.5 per cent for driver/packers; 16.2 per cent for some grades of skilled craft workers; 21.2 per cent for semi-skilled plant maintenance workers and 12.7 for production supervisors. Clerical pay has risen less sharply, with an average rise of 6.6 per cent. Reward forecasts a steady decline in pay increases for clerical staff over the coming months, with an average of 5 per cent until September this year. Central London clerical pay remains the highest in the country at 41.4 per cent more than the average. South Wales is lowest, where clerical pay is 14.2 per cent less than the average.

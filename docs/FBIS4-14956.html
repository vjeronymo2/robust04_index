			<p>BFN     [Text] The Georgian parliament continued on April 5  debating the documents on a peaceful settlement to the conflict  in Abkhazia signed earlier in Moscow.    Just like at the closed session on Monday, a large group was  formed of those deputies who oppose the documents. For example,  Nodar Natadze, leader of the Georgian People's Front, accused  the parliamentary majority backing Eduard Shevardnadze of  betraying the national interests. The opposition suggested  debating the issue on the powers of the Georgian delegation  currently staying in Moscow. The Abkhaz deputies in the Georgian  parliament opposed the documents.    Leader of the parliamentary faction called The National  Democrats, Irina Sarishvili, told Interfax that the signed  documents are "humiliating for Georgia." She believes they mean  for Georgia the loss of Abkhazia.    Sarishvili said it appears that the Georgians who fought for  their land in Abkhazia were posed as aggressors, while the  Abkhaz as fighters for the freedom of their Motherland.</p>

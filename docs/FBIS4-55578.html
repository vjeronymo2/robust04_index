			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 17 May (TANJUG) -- Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic today received David Owen and Thorvald  Stoltenberg, cochairmen of the conference on the former  Yugoslavia, immediately on their arrival in Belgrade. As  expected, the talks focused on the recent ministerial meeting  (Russia, United States, EU) in Geneva and the agreement on  ending hostilities in the whole of the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was confirmed by David Owen, who gave  a brief statement after the talks with Slobodan Milosevic, which  lasted almost three hours.    David Owen, who was in an unusually good mood, which is not  completely irrelevant in such situations, first described the  talks with Slobodan Milosevic as "very good."    "The talks focused on ending the hostilities in the whole of  Bosnia," Lord Owen said, adding this was "the highest priority  issue." According to Owen, Gorazde is currently the biggest  problem, because, as he said, the agreement was still being  violated there. "We hope these problems will be eliminated  within the next 24 hours and that the belligerent sides will  attend talks with the UN secretary general's special envoy,  Yasushi Akashi, on ending hostilities, to which they had almost  agreed.    The two cochairmen will discuss these and other problems  this  afternoon with president of the republic of Srpska Radovan  Karadzic. Lord Owen said he would "probably" hold talks with  Karadzic, but did not specify where. It is unofficially  reported that they are to meet in Zvornik. Owen said he would  discuss the proposed 51:49 percent territorial division and the  maps with Karadzic.    The issue of sanctions was also discussed in the talks with  Slobodan Milosevic. Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg  reiterated the position contained in the Geneva communique that  "sanctions will be eased after the withdrawal of the Bosnian  Serb forces from the agreed positions."    "There is a very clear link between the agreement on ending  the hostilities, the withdrawal of troops, and the easing and  lifting of the sanctions," Lord Owen said. Asked about his  opinion of the controversial decision by the U.S. Senate  regarding the lifting of the arms embargo against the Bosnian  Muslims, Lord Owen said the decision was "contradictory in some  way."    "It remains to be seen whether this proposal will appear  either before the House of Representatives or the Senate itself.  I believe that this will probably not happen," he added.    After the talks with Karadzic this afternoon, the cochairmen  of the conference on the former Yugoslavia are returning to  Belgrade. According to Owen they are to travel to Zagreb  tomorrow, where they will meet Croatian President Franjo Tudjman.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 5m profit forecast by David Lloyd DAVID LLOYD Leisure, the tennis and fitness club which is coming to the market, is forecasting that pre-tax profits will rise from Pounds 3.01m in the year to October 1992 to more than Pounds 5m this year. The profits growth follows the introduction of five new clubs during 1992 to add to the four existing centres opened since the former Davis Cup tennis player started the company in 1982. During the 1993 financial year David Lloyd Leisure expects to open no new centres. In December, however, it added a 20-lane bowling alley to its existing centre at Raynes Park and will accrue 10 months' benefit from it this year. Mr David Gray, finance director, said the uptake of memberships in January had exceeded targets. After the flotation, which will value the group at about Pounds 50m, Mr Lloyd, chairman, said the group would be in a position to open two centres a year from the proceeds of the float, the strong cash flow and existing bank facilities. Operating profit for 1993 is forecast to be up 33 per cent to at least Pounds 6m, on sales up 15 per cent at Pounds 18m, while the return on sales is expected to increase to more than 33 per cent. After the float the group is expected to have debt of about Pounds 6m and gearing of about 15 per cent. The issue will be priced on March 4 and trading begin on March 19.

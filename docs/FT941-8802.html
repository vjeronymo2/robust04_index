			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Bundesbank takes a gamble with the D-Mark: Conservative bankers say the interest rate cut presents a risk to the exchange rate The Bundesbank's snip at the discount lending rate yesterday appeared to be something of a gamble for an institution apparently so concerned with the stability of the D-Mark. As the more conservative among banking and industrial associations warned, the cut of 50 basis points to 5.25 per cent was not without its risks to exchange rates. Many observers had also previously written off any change this week on the basis of Bundesbankers' repeated insistence on controlling growth in the M3 measure of money supply - the central bank's most-trusted barometer of future inflation. In the light of the latest figures, which showed 8.1 per cent annualised M3 growth in December and an expansion rate in the last quarter of 1993 almost one percentage point above the upper 6.5 per cent limit of the central bank's target range, there seemed little prospect of a cut, however much economists and industrialists felt it was overdue. A further element of risk was the danger of appearing relaxed about the overall situation and thereby sending the wrong signals to the truculent IG Metall engineering union which is currently preparing to call a strike ballot in pursuit of its 1994 wage claim. But in the event, and in the light of encouraging noises on pay, public deficits, money supply and inflation emerging recently from the bank's headquarters, the central council decided that it could justify a resumption of the tip-toe progression which has characterised its policy since the discount rate started downwards from its 8.75 per cent peak almost 18 months ago. The scale of yesterday's reduction of 50 basis points was wholly in keeping with the ultra-cautious process in which the bank has made nine cuts since September 1992 to shave just 3.5 percentage points off the discount rate. The progression has run roughly in parallel with a series of economic and monetary developments, which - despite some hiccups - appear closely to match the Bundesbank's stringent requirements. As it pointed out in its latest monthly report, published earlier this week, seasonally adjusted consumer prices have been rising for the six months to the end of January at just 2.5 per cent, compared with the 2 per cent the bank regards as acceptable. Despite a tax and levy-induced month-on-month surge of 0.9 per cent last month, the headline annual rate of inflation was 3.5 per cent, continuing the uninterrupted erosion of inflation which has now been under way for more than a year. Federal and regional government paymasters have also clearly taken Bundesbank strictures to heart. As the bank's monthly report noted, underlying federal spending last year increased just 2 per cent after exclusion of the burdensome effects of recession and unification, while the average inflation rate was 4 per cent. Meanwhile, wage settlements so far have been far below the expected rate of inflation for 1994, and the external value of the D-Mark has been 'fully corrected', according to the bank, after its marked appreciation following last summer's widening of the fluctuation bands within the European monetary systems. With key indicators apparently moving in the right direction, and the D-Mark back where it belongs in the currency constellations, the bank clearly felt itself able to take a modest gamble on its belief, restated yesterday, that the recent ballooning in M3 is a 'temporary disturbance'. One side effect of the move, which the introspective central bank customarily insists plays a less than central role in its considerations, is expected to be a further stimulus to economic recovery outside Germany. Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria all responded promptly with rate cuts of their own yesterday. By the bank's own reckoning, the domestic economy is still not free of recession. By the reckonings of German industrialists, since domestic demand among private, industrial and public sector consumers will remain weak for the foreseeable future, the only reliable route from the bottom of the economic cycle lies via improvements in export markets. Any actions which serve to increase confidence abroad will directly benefit the internal situation, but as the Bundesbank tirelessly repeats, its job is managing monetary policy, and it can do that effectively only if the conditions outside its Frankfurt headquarters are right. It made its move yesterday in the full knowledge that total public sector debt will approach DM2,000bn this year: equivalent to 60 per cent of gross domestic product. With protest strikes continuing around the engineering industry, it needed no reminders that the 1994 pay round is far from complete. Signs of budgetary relaxation - a particular risk in an election year - or of inflationary pay awards to metal workers or public sector employees are likely to lead to the bank's retiring once more into its shell. And if it is wrong in its belief that money supply growth will fall this spring back towards or to within its target range, it may well stay there for some time to come.</p>

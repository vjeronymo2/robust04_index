			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Tapping a liquid market Of all the dogs which have failed to bark this year, the feared shortage of institutional cash is the most noticeable by its absence. With the stock market near record levels, it is difficult to argue that funding the public sector borrowing requirement has sucked the life blood of liquidity from equities. Unit trust sales are running at Pounds 1bn a month - and portfolio investment from overseas at four times that amount - so it is clear where the transfusion has come from. The worry is that neither source can be relied upon for support should the going get tough. True, yesterday's CSO figures show UK institutional cash flow on a rising trend. Pension funds in particular will have more to invest as contribution holidays come to an end. The one-off costs associated with early retirement should also diminish as companies emerge from recession. It comes as no surprise that investment by pension funds was lowest in the dark days of last summer. Life companies will have plenty of free cash so long as sales of single premium investment products remain strong. Even so, UK institutions cannot meet the funding requirements of both companies and government single-handed. Their holdings of cash and overseas bonds have already been run down in favour of equities and gilts. UK financial assets will simply have to be priced to attract overseas buyers. The lion's share of foreign investment goes into fixed-interest securities, so gilts are most likely to take the strain. The widening of the yield differential between gilts and German government bonds ahead of next week's auction suggests the market knows as much.</p>

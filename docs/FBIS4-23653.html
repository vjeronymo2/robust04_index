			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  WEEKEND STAR </H8>   Better, Not Distorted, Public Service -- The Minister of  Public Service has "tackled the task of revamping the public  servce" by targeting "under-represented groups" for "immediate  employment," an editorial in Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in  English on 11-12 June on page 8 notes. However, increasing a  service "already viewed as bloated by most people -- with  another 1,000 posts" does not make "his reassurances that  budgetary will not be exceeded" convincing. His statement that  "while the new posts are aimed at under-presented groups,  persons from `other groups' are welcome to apply...smacks of  reverse discrimination....There is a real danger that the  programme, unless carefully handled, will compound  inefficiencies and lead to harmful discontent."  <H8>  RAPPORT </H8>   Affirmative Action Program -- "One of the worst forms of  apartheid, race classification, has made its reappearance in an  ironic manner, less than two years after the ANC-dominated  government came into power. A comprehensive affirmative action  system will be applied to the advantage of blacks in both the  private and public sectors," begins a page-14 editorial in the  Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 12 June. "So-called  `monitoring mechanisms,' taking race and gender into account,  will be put in place to ensure that the civil service reflects  the composition of the population. This means the appointment  of `race police' who will also peep over the shoulders of the  financial institutions. They will have to ensure, for example,  that black businesses and clients receive loans. Businesses who  do not tackle `socially acceptable' projects will be forced to  do so....The ANC government is impatient. Within six years, for  example, the entire civil service must reflect the composition  of the population. In certain cases this will happen within two  years....This is a recipe for disaster. Equally disconcerting  is the ANC's once hidden socialist program, which is suddenly  becoming more visible. Its intention to interfere with the  operation of financial institutions is a deliberate attempt to  manipulate the laws governing the free market....This new type  of discrimination is not just a case of two wrongs not making a  right, it is clearly playing with fire."  <H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>   Truth Commission -- "No matter what the Minister of Justice,  Mr Dullah Omar, does about his truth commission, the search for  the truth about the crimes of appartheid will go on," states an  editorial in the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 12 June  on page 20. "The question is not whether the truth must be made  known, but how it must be made known, or if it becomes another  mechanism (of the many!) to suppress the truth....Most recently,  the luckless Defense Minister, Mr Joe Modise, was persuaded by  the generals to try, by interdict and press gag, to prevent the  publication of information that might cast light on the time of  `dirty tricks.'...The first two waves of indemnity, which  occurred in secrecy and amid the great confusion," released  ordinary criminals and "cast no light on the past." There is a  "suspicion" casting "a shadow over the question of  reconciliation," whether some National Party or Cabinet members  "had complicity" in crimes carried out by "instruments of  apartheid repression." Two principles must guide the process of  dealing with these suspicions: disclosure of the crime, but not  a "Nuremberg trial" or "McCarthy-ite inquisition." "Those who  seek indemnity must be assured of forgiveness if they specify  their crimes; those who think they can conceal their past must  run the risk that they will be exposed, sooner ot later, by the  wider search for truth."  <H8>  ILANGA </H8>   Why not Ulundi -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu on 9-11 June in a  page-6 editorial notes: "The issue of where the capital for  KwaZulu/Natal should be seems to be generating a lot of heat  under the collar among those who are opposed to Ulundi as a  possibility....Our question is, what's so wrong with Ulundi,  anyway? Isn't the ANC in the North-West Province working from  the offices of the former government of Bophuthatswana? Isn't  the ANC in the Eastern Cape Province is working from the offices  of the former Ciskei government, with the province's premier,  Mr. Raymond Mhlaba, even living in the same house occupied by  former President Sebe and later by Brigadier Gqozo? When is the  ANC going to stop speaking with a forked tongue?"</p>

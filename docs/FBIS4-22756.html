			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Petrovich Rasskazov, deputy chairman of </F> the Board of the All-Russian Exchange Bank, under the rubric  "Viewpoint": "The Central Bank of Russia Should Establish the  Rules of the Game"]    [Text] The theory and practice of world economics  confirm that when changing a political and economic system in  any state, the first stage of reforming the entire economy  should be a reform of the banking system. As soon as the banking  system in Russia really adapts to the market economy and assumes  civilized features, the economic reforms will be set in motion.  This is the opinion of the author of the article published  below, who in the recent past was deputy chairman of the Central  Bank of Russia and is now deputy chairman of the All-Russian  Exchange Bank, Vladimir Petrovich Rasskazov.    How should the banking system be in our country? Recently  the  newspaper BIZNES I BANKI ran a well-researched article which  contains an answer to this question (A.V. Molchanov and A.M.  Tavasiyev, "The Banking System of Russia: What Should It Be?",  BIZNES I BANKI No. 2, 1994). The article's authors sketch out  the basic features of the banking system toward whose creation  we should strive, perceiving it as having two levels with a  certain amount of specialization of sublevels. They also  indicate the requirements for individual parts of this system.  While fully supporting the concept presented there, I would like  to touch upon several important aspects of our banking future.    In order for the banking system, like the state of which it  is a part, to be monolithic, it must have a foundation that can  bring all of its parts together into a unified whole. Such a  foundation--the financial-monetary system--of course, is  unified, with a unified currency, and unified rules of the game  pertaining to money. And these rules can only be established by  the Central Bank--the sole regulator of the system.    If everything is more or less comprehensible regarding  commercial banks as parts of a unified system, in my view there  are many problems with the Central Bank. Let us begin with the  fact that the Central Bank has 85 of its own administrative  entities in various areas and regions of the country. And this  means that the Central Bank is practically uncontrollable.  Therefore significant changes are needed here. Why not do this,  for example: Have the main branch of the Central Bank in Moscow  and a maximum of 9-12 regional branches, each of which, in turn,  would have direct jurisdiction over 8-12 subregional  branches--according to the principle of the Sovnarkhozes  [Soviets of People's Commissars] of Khrushchev's time.  Incidentally, the Federal Reserve System of the United States  was built according to this principle. As for the apparatus of  the Central Bank, it can be cut by at least half--because its  structures are poorly controlled as well. They are bloated with  auxiliary personnel, they have a tendency toward further growth,  and there is a duplication of control and management functions.    Today our Central Bank has not yet ceased to be remind one  of  a former branch of the USSR Gosbank [State Bank]. We must  prohibit it from directly extending credit to financed entities.  Yet to this day the Central Bank has an investment  administration. It should not have such subdivisions--after all,  the Central Bank should engage in refinancing commercial banks.  If the state decides to build something or implement some large  program, the Central Bank should issue special-purpose credit to  the state or transfer these funds to commercial banks, and they  will do the direct investing. But since the Central Bank issues  credit, it should have a powerful organ controlling the activity  of commercial banks. And here is where conflicts arise between  the Central Bank and the commercial banks. The latter do not  like it when somebody carefully oversees them. Recently, for  example, the leaders of one well-known bank stated that they  would not allow anybody from the outside into their bank,  including representatives of the Central Bank. This, of course,  is wrong because our Central Bank, like central emission banks  throughout the world, has every right and obligation to oversee  the commercial banks with respect to any aspects of their  activity. How else could it be? When the Central Bank grants  permission for the opening of a commercial bank, how can it tell  its future clients that, having decided to open this bank, it  takes responsibility for it and therefore they can invest money  in it without worrying. And if the Central Bank acts as the  guarantor of the commercial bank, it must know everything about  it. Protection of confidential information received by the  Central Bank from the commercial bank is another matter--here  the parties must reach some kind of agreement between  themselves. In any case, this can be regulated today.    With all the achievements in the regulation of relations  among the parties, dissension among them will not cease until  there is a law directly regulating these relations. I have in  mind a so-called bank act which defines the problem of banking  secrets and the nature and procedure whereby commercial banks  convey information to the Central Bank. In other words, this  document must determine the entire policy for overseeing the  activity of commercial banks and all procedures for relations  among the parties. In my view, it would not be out of place to  create such a legislative document regulating relations between  commercial banks and their clients as well. Only then will the  Central Bank become a guarantor of the protection of the rights  of clients, including the right reimbursement for damages caused  to them. And the Central Bank, of course, must have special  insurance funds and reserves in the event that the commercial  banks go bankrupt. That is, these funds could guarantee the  operation of the entire banking system. And no commercial bank  could even think of encroaching on these funds. Moreover, the  Central Bank, like the commercial banks, must bear  responsibility if there are cases of "laundering" of money used  in criminal activity. And all this should be backed by  legislation.    As concerns the credit-monetary policy, I see the main tasks  here as implementing it through the establishment of norms for  reserves, liquidity, currency regulation, the discount rate for  centralized credit (and it should be at least higher than the  rates of inflation at any given moment) and others. As one of  the authors of banking legislation, the Central Bank must  establish these norms for commercial banks, and in order to  control them effectively it must have feedback in the form of  statistical information. Consequently, the country's main bank  must constantly be gathering and generalizing statistics on the  banks, which at the same time will serve as a basis for  management of the national economy. Central Bank statistics are  the most precise and accurate figures with valuation in rubles.  Incidentally, the Central Bank should introduce centralized  norms for banking statistics, since sooner or later Russian  banking institutions will have to "merge" into the world banking  system. Of course, this must be preceded by a transition to  unified international bookkeeping standards. And it is still  just being started, but even now we have a strange picture: Each  commercial bank has its own plan for accounts, and sometimes  they are extremely far removed from what is recommended by the  Central Bank. It is hardly necessary to convince any specialist  of the importance of introducing standardized international  accounting and reporting documentation. And it is also necessary  to standardize documents not only in form and content but also  in size so that they will be "readable" by all machines--in  Russia and abroad. I have had occasion to hear from leaders of  certain commercial banks that they intend to introduce their own  methodology for settling accounts. This cannot be allowed. The  Central Bank must provide this methodology for the other banks.  Otherwise this will be like creating some kind of separatist  state with its own laws within the framework of our country.  Therefore proponents of this kind of "banking separatism" are  either incompetent people or people who are deliberately trying  to make it easier to conduct certain illegal operations.    The interests of the matter demand also the development of a  system of economic indicators which would be included in the  primary accounting documentation and the settlement-payment  documents, including checks and credit cards. These indicators  should become the basis for statistical reporting as well.  Without doing this the Central Bank cannot solve a single  important problem, including the problem of nonpayments. This is  the basic preparation of the so-called software. Unfortunately,  as it were, this matter is not even off the ground yet.    The next important problem is the organization of  settlements. I am convinced that there is no longer any  alternative to cash settlement centers. But we must immediately  start to optimize and standardize them. But sometimes things are  reduced to the absurd. For example, in Leningrad Oblast, with a  population of approximately 6 million, there are four to six  cash settlement centers in operation that complete settlements  in three days. But in Krasnodar Kray, with a comparable  population, there are 38 cash settlement centers which cannot  complete their work within acceptable periods of time. The  picture is the same in Altay and also many other places. The  quantitative distribution of cash settlement centers throughout  the oblasts of the country has a striking lack of uniformity:  from three to 54! And, after all, cash settlement centers, from  the standpoint of common sense, should span rayons, with one  center for every three to four rayons. They should have  communications for delivering settlement documents taking into  account the availability of storage facilities for cash  reserves, transportation mainlines, and information networks.  The Central Bank must not give anyone a system of settlements.  In the event that alternative centers are created, copies of all  postings must still be entered into the central computer of the  Central Bank. What are alternative centers? I will explain with  an example. Let us say that three or four banks create a  clearing center on the basis of one of the commercial banks and  process clearing documents for a group of commercial banks in  one of them. A duplicate of all postings must then be sent to  the Central Bank. Otherwise it will not be able to get an idea  of the condition of monetary turnover, the situation with cash  money, or how things are going with credit in the country. And  as a result it would be impossible to establish an optimal  discount rate or a realistic exchange rate for currencies. And a  realistic exchange rate for currencies must be established with  a special information system (analogous to the REUTER one) which  would include all commercial banks working with currency and  each day (and best of all in real time) would submit all  information on currency operations to the Central Bank. The  procedure followed now for establishing the exchange rate  through the exchange creates preconditions for manipulating  currency exchange rates in the interests of particular political  and financial groups.    I must not fail to touch upon several more essential  aspects.    Today many commercial banks (about 90 percent of them) are  largely state banks. Their charter capital was formed, as a  rule, from funds of state enterprises. I think it is time to  solve the problem of privatization of these banks and return of  state funds to the budget or to the state treasury--taking into  account the inflation index during all the time of the  withdrawal of state funds. We must not forget that the money  lying in these banks as charter capital is our public money.  Nothing terrible will happen here--after all, these banks have  gotten fairly firmly on their feet. But here it is up to the  Central Bank and parliament, which must adopt the corresponding  legislative provisions. And the funds returned by the banks will  be sources of investment in industry.    In order for our Central Bank to operate normally I think it  has to have in its structure a powerful analytical subdivision  which would analyze the national economy and the economy of the  commercial banks. Moreover, it would be expedient to create  under the Central Bank a public supervisory council with the  right to make recommendations--consisting of representatives of  science, industry, and commercial banks. The task of the council  would be to conduct expert appraisals of important decisions of  the Central Bank as is done abroad. I am categorically against  the idea put forth by certain commercial banks of turning the  Central Bank into a joint-stock company. In the present  transition stage with our unruly market environment the Central  Bank must remain a state institution. The Savings Bank of  Russia, with more than 50 percent of its shares belonging to the  Central Bank, is another matter. It is a monopolist subject to  immediate privatization with the formation of regional,  municipal, or territorial banks based on it. But today it seems  to be advantageous both to state bureaucrats and to the Central  Bank to have this kind of pump for extracting money from all of  Russia, and they certainly do not spend all of it on the  regions. And in the regions, because of the shortage of monetary  resources, separatist sentiments are arising.    We absolutely must define and create a system of strict  currency regulation. So far we have passed up important elements  of this system--access of foreign banks for operation on Russian  territory. And we should have done this for two reasons. First,  hard currency would not then leak out of the country. What is  the point in transferring it, say, to France if this money could  be put in the Russian branch of the same French bank. The result  would be the same, but it would be achieved at less cost.  Second, foreigners would create healthy competition on our  domestic market for banking services and would demonstrate the  art of working, which would be to the advantage of domestic  banking. But this step must be accompanied by a certain  protectionism of these banks on the part of the Central Bank.  Allowing foreign banks on our territory should be restricted and  the privilege should be granted to only certain banks with good  reputations that are significant and have a developed world  infrastructure. Moreover, these banks could help their Russian  colleagues to train bank specialists.    We will not change much unless we adhere in practice to the  well-known administrative postulate: A new business must be  created by new people; reforms cannot be conducted through the  hands of those who are interested in retaining old procedures.  It is necessary, for example, to promptly renew the  administrative apparatus of the Central Bank, bringing in young  talented and highly educated specialists. Chiefs of oblast  special bank branches who have been working in this system for  15-20 years, as a rule, are fairly conservative people. Their  mentalities were formed at a different time and they will never  become market players in the best sense of the word. The  Americans say that if you are 35 years old and you do not have  experience working with a computer, you will not acquire it  because you are simply afraid of the computer. Thus for these  people the "fear effect" will not allow them to master new  banking technologies.    Now about work with cash money. The Central Bank should make  some changes in this area as well. In my view, the Central Bank  must return to the "Russia" checks. But they should be  introduced gradually, being used at first in settlements with  the population for durable goods only within the autonomous  formations: The city or at most the oblast, when the main  administration (city or oblast) is capable of developing a  mechanism for the introduction of the checks and monitoring  their migration. As for credit cards, for now they are  acceptable in Russia only for businessmen and people who are  simply rich. These cards will not soon become widespread in  Russia. In order for credit cards to be in mass use it is  necessary to have many things. For example, they must be  produced in large quantities; it is necessary to have fairly  costly devices--automatic teller machines; in stores, kiosks,  cafes, train stations, airports, etc. there must be special  devices for reading the information from the credit cards. All  this will take a minimum of eight to 10 years. And the Russian  mentality is not ready for them. That is, there are no  alternatives to checks in Russia so far.    Incidentally, in the area of the introduction of an  electronic payment system, like electronics in general, the  Central Bank must show patriotism. It should not provide money  to support foreign firms by buying their technical equipment,  but this money should be used to convert domestic enterprises so  that they will master the output of mass banking equipment. And  not only computation equipment but also automatic teller  machines, devices for reading credit cards, and the main  thing--sorting machines for processing checks.    We will have to switch to international standards in  electronics. And if representatives of the European Community  gather in Geneva to develop a technical policy and particularly  to decide which banking equipment to buy, we are resolving this  problem with extraordinary ease: Each bank buys whatever it  sees. Whatever country its representatives have managed to get  to, there they make their purchases. But this is fatal for  Russia. We need standards for technical policy. Otherwise we  will get ourselves tightly involved in an electronic system of  settlements without really understanding it.    And the last thing. Today we are discussing the problem of  reducing the budget deficit by having the Ministry of Finance  sell precious metals to the Central Bank. I think that in this  case the Central Bank would only increase the liquidity of its  capital by issuing empty money or, rather, at the expense of its  long-suffering taxpayers. In my view this is a political  solution that will harm the country's economy.</p>

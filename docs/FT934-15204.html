			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / People: Lessels adds Tilney to boardroom duties Norman Lessels has added another arrow to his quiver of non-executive directorships by becoming chairman of Tilney &amp; Co, the private client stockbrokers, who resumed an independent existence earlier this month. Lessels, 55, is a professional non-executive chairman and director. Though he is the senior partner of the Edinburgh chartered accountants Chiene &amp; Tait, his boardroom activities take up 90 per cent of his time. Lessels' career as a non-executive director began in 1980 when he left the accountants Ernst &amp; Whinney, who did not encourage its partners to sit on boards. He is chairman of Standard Life, the Edinburgh-based mutual, and of the quoted Scottish companies Cairn Energy and Havelock Europa. He is also chairman of several unquoted companies, and on the boards of Bank of Scotland, Scottish Eastern Investment Trust, Bupa and the Securities and Investment Board. He has never been a rescue chairman. 'My biggest agony is trying to get my diary into shape,' says Lessels, a calm, friendly and precise Edinburgh man who went to the Edinburgh Academy, an incubator for the Scottish accountancy and legal networks. Though Tilney's base in Liverpool is out of his usual area, he says it is convenient for Chester, where he sits on the board of NWS Bank, a Bank of Scotland subsidiary, and for Wilmslow, Cheshire, where he is director of General Surety and Guarantee, an offshoot of Swiss Re.</p>

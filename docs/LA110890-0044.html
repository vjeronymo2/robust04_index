			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> NEW ERA SEEN AS LAGERQUIST WINS VACANT COUNCIL SEAT IN LAWNDALE;  </P> <P> VOTING: ELECTORATE ALTERED BY INFLUX OF NEWCOMERS FAVORS PRO-BUSINESS CANDIDATE  OVER LONGTIME RESIDENTS WITH HIGH NAME RECOGNITION.  </P> <P> Aerospace engineer Norm Lagerquist swept into a vacant seat on the Lawndale  City Council in an election Tuesday that may signal a realignment of city  politics in favor of business interests and also appears to reflect a shift in  the city's demographics.  </P> <P> Lagerquist, 35, a relative newcomer to Lawndale politics who campaigned on a  pro-business platform, was elected to the council with 40% of the vote, easily  defeating three opponents, including two longtime residents with high name  recognition.  </P> <P> Development consultant Gary McDonald, 30, placed second with 24% of the vote,  followed by purchasing agent Ron Maxwell, 27, who won 22%, and machine shop  owner Bob Cerny, 72, with 13%.  </P> <P> Lagerquist's victory was not entirely a surprise. Vice president of a local  homeowners group, he campaigned vigorously and amassed an impressive array of  endorsements, including those of council members Carol Norman and Bill Johnson  and Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson).  </P> <P> Although most of the candidates chose to spend election night quietly with a  small group of campaign workers, Lagerquist and about 40 supporters gathered  for a party at the home of Lawndale school Trustee Bob Kruse. Confident of  victory, they celebrated with champagne and cake after Lagerquist's lead topped  200 votes around 1 a.m.  </P> <P> Lawndale recreation coordinator Linda Zirpoli said a majority of the city's  50-odd employees supported Lagerquist because he is a fresh face and because  they believe he will focus on the issues and bring more professionalism to city  politics.  </P> <P> "People are tired of hearing, 'We're broke, we're in the hole, the city's  mismanaged,' " Zirpoli said. "I think everyone in Lawndale just wants a  change."  </P> <P> Lawndale, which has long been a working-class community with a large base of  elderly, long-term residents, has recently seen an influx of younger couples,  many of them employed in the aerospace industry. For the newcomers, Lawndale's  affordable housing has made it an attractive alternative to the beach cities.  </P> <P> The radical shift toward a younger, white-collar population "is providing a  different electorate as well as a different base from which to draw  candidates," Lagerquist said.  </P> <P> Lagerquist's top challenger, McDonald, lost a bid for a council seat in April  by seven votes. He was endorsed by Mayor Harold Hofmann and Councilman Larry  Rudolph. A lifelong resident of Lawndale, McDonald initially was considered to  have an advantage because he is a "local boy."  </P> <P> Although McDonald frequently claimed to have saved the city money and to be the  strongest anti-gang candidate, some supporters said he was relying too heavily  on name recognition and his past accomplishments as a civic watchdog and former  planning commissioner.  </P> <P> McDonald's campaign took a decisive turn for the worse last weekend when the  Southern California Caucus, a regional political group that supports  businesses, issued a mailer raising questions about his personal scruples.  </P> <P> The mailer told voters that McDonald had two outstanding state tax liens  pending against him as well as an arrest warrant for failing to appear in court  on a traffic citation.  </P> <P> Although both allegations were confirmed by state authorities, McDonald said  that the tax liens were a mistake and that he was unaware of the arrest  warrant. He called the mailer "the worst example of mudslinging and dirty  politics" he had ever seen and blamed it for his poor showing at the polls.  </P> <P> But even McDonald's staunchest supporters conceded that the mailer wasn't  solely responsible for his defeat.  </P> <P> "I think it was a combination of the hit pieces against Gary and obviously that  Norm (Lagerquist) presented his case out there better than Gary did," Rudolph  said. "When you get that much of the vote, you must be telling people things  they want to hear."  </P> <P> According to unofficial tallies with 100% of the precincts reporting,  Lagerquist received 1,357 votes, McDonald 837, Maxwell 746 and Cerny 449.  </P> <P> Lagerquist will serve for 17 months, the remainder of the term Hofmann vacated  when he was elected mayor in April.  </P> <P> The showing by Maxwell and Cerny, who both ran as unaligned independents and  who together earned nearly as many votes as Lagerquist, was perceived by some  to be a rejection of the bloc voting and partisan politics that have marked the  city in recent years.  </P> <P> "If (Lagerquist) gets in, it'll be 3-2 (votes on the council) all the time,  with him and Johnson and Norman" voting together, Cerny predicted.  </P> <P> But Lagerquist insists he doesn't owe anything to his supporters.  </P> <P> "I'm there to make good decisions, and I think the reason (council members  Norman and Johnson) supported me is not because I'm committed to vote with them  on any issue but because of the way I make decisions and also because of my  values," Lagerquist said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Lagerquist acknowledges that improving relations between the city  and its fledgling business community is at the top of his agenda. He said he is  likely to vote with Johnson and Norman to restore funding to the Lawndale  Chamber of Commerce and to remove parking restrictions along some residential  streets near Hawthorne Boulevard, the city's main commercial thoroughfare.  </P> <P> Although Rudolph and Hofmann backed McDonald, both said they expect to be able  to work well with Lagerquist.  </P> <P> "My personal feeling is that after (Lagerquist) makes his political paybacks,  we'll eventually get back on track," Rudolph said. "I don't think I'll have any  problems working with him after that."  </P> <P> FINAL RETURNS: B6  </P> <P> </P> <P> LOCAL RESULTS  </P> <P> Inglewood  </P> <P> Mayor  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.76IN:1.67IN:1.34IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 100% Precincts Reporting  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Votes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> %  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Edward Vincent*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9,219  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 62  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Anthony Scardenzan  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3,153  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 21  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Virgle P.

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Technology: Rearranging the office furniture - Claire Gooding continues a series on getting the most out of software by showing how computer-aided design can open up new lines of communication / Software at work When an important customer recently asked for a special order, Carleton Furniture responded within hours. The speed of response - just over a year ago it would have taken a week and a half - won the Pounds 150,000 order. The detailed specification of a desk, drawn and fully costed, had taken half a day. Even more important, the specification put together at such speed actually worked. The people who had to execute the design by cutting the metal and fitting parts, knew their system would not design something that could not be built. In the opinion of Steve Dodds, group finance director, the most remarkable achievement at Carleton Furniture is the way it has connected its activities. In the past two years he has seen the company evolve to a point where it is not just healthy, but expanding its services. He says: 'We've invested in the system at a time when most companies are putting their heads in the sand until the recession lifts. When it does, we will be able to offer a better customer service as a consequence of that investment.' Carleton designers rely on a computer-aided design product, but design is only part of the story. The Cad software has become part of a communicative process, which feeds into all aspects of Carleton's operations, and has opened up new horizons for the company. Its services interconnect: designers, engineers and space planners talk to one another as never before. Each of the production companies seats its designers and planners together on one 'island', and even planners working at the showrooms are linked through the computer system. Carleton has capitalised on its ability to produce quick Cad drawings to launch a specialist service in space planning. This has opened up a lucrative line in 'cradle to grave' care for organisations for whom buying, refurbishing and locating furniture is a headache. The next step - as yet not implemented - is to provide a bar code service, so that each item is tagged for inventory purposes. Dodds has no background in information technology, but feels strongly that line managers must get involved in IT buying and specification. 'The knowledge and experience which resides in people who work in the business is an essential part of the input: you can't expect IT experts to absorb it, although they can advise you on technical matters.' Only two tasks - furniture design and space allocation - were the original goals of the the Cad system sought by Carleton Furniture Group two years ago. Carleton's specialist requirements narrowed the choice down to four systems. User-friendliness was a priority, along with considerations of price, and a reliable supplier who would keep upgrading and supporting the package. Linking with other systems was always part of the plan. From the beginning, Dodds recognised the importance of using a supplier who would understand the business objectives. 'I needed someone who would listen and go through the heartache with us. I would rather have 80 per cent of what I required, done well, than the ability to do 99 per cent but only achieve 60 per cent. Dodds rejected the bafflingly complex, and those he considered difficult to use. He found that Hewlett-Packard's engineering package Mechanical Engineering 10 (ME-10) could cope with both the engineering design and the more artistic space-planning work, but it was the skill of the supplier, Cadtek, that carried the day. Dodds says: 'I felt Cadtek was capable of taking us on the journey. They have supplied much of the integration with other packages, and that's where the real benefits lie.' The chosen system was 18 'seats' of Hewlett-Packard's ME-JO software supplied by Cadtek. A central database on the computer in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, is fed from the various companies in the group. This in turn feeds the Unison administrative package. In the past, there were often difficulties in translating the drawn design into real material requirements: there was a 'perception gap' about what materials were really needed. The drawing office produced a design manually, which was then translated into a bill of materials planning, and material requirements planning on the shop floor. Now, instead of separate computer systems, the designer names the product, names the parts and produces a bill of materials automatically. Every database entry is tagged with a specific part number, which ties it to a technical drawing, an associated bill of materials and even the assembly manual which goes with the finished product, all of which makes production much easier. 'Everyone sings from the same hymn sheet, so there are fewer mistakes,' says Dodds. Cadtek was responsible for writing the links between systems, working closely with the supplier of the Unison package, Sam System Services of Manchester. 'There are advantages in dealing with a single source supplier, too - only one ear to bend,' he adds. Dodds considers the aesthetics of the drawings are now better, and that all four drawing offices have cut down development time. The next step is to graduate to a three-dimensional software package, Solid Designer, which will allow more detailed on-screen testing of the prototype design. The designer will be able to check the drawing from all angles. The A1-sized print-outs produced at the office at Heron Quays in London's Docklands show minute details, such as the clearance span needed to open cupboard doors. Planners would formerly have to count the various 'footprints' manually: now the computer lists and numbers the items in a plan. Dodds is happy to cite other instances where the Cad capability has clinched the deal. A recent Pounds 800,000 order was won because the company was able to produce a space-plan within a very tight deadline, partly because it could read in existing measurements from the client's own AutoCad package. Dodds offers some emphatic do's and don'ts for companies setting out to implement Cad software. 'Don't underestimate the culture change that needs to take place within the business,' he says. 'It's taken us a year longer than we expected. Do make sure you get on with your suppliers. 'At the end of the day you're investing a great deal: if you can't get on with them, don't do it, however good the software.'                         *      *      * BUZZWORDS COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN installations measure their size in seats. The term is used to describe workstations because they are rarely used on a one-per-desk ratio: the seat is a shared resource used by several different people within a workplace. ENGINEERING DATA MANAGEMENT is a software tool to manage all product definition data (specifications, engineering drawings, analysis results, process plans, images).</p>

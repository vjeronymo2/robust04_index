			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--Just a day before the first monthly  anniversary of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's April 5 austerity  measures, official sources disclosed the second highest  inflation figures in the history of the Turkish Republic.    Turkey's monthly wholesale inflation soared to 32.8 percent,  pushing the 12-month rate to 125.3 percent, the second highest  level since 1939, when Turkey started to produce price indexes.  The State Institute of Statistics (DIE) revealed on Wednesday  [4 May] that consumer prices rose 24.7 percent, sending the  year-on-year consumer inflation rate to 107.4 percent.    Back in February 1980, the peak of an economic crisis,  consumer and wholesale prices had risen by 26.9 percent and 29.3  percent respectively. The annual rates in February 1980 were  133.7 percent for consumer and 133.2 percent for wholesale  prices.    Other peak rates are 104.4 in 1946 and 107.2 percent in  1980.    The coalition government's original program target for the  entire 1994 was an inflation rate of 54 percent. Year-end  consumer and wholesale price inflation rates were 71.1 and 60.3  percent in 1993.    In March, consumer prices rose 5.2 percent and wholesale  prices 8.5 percent. They went up 4.4 percent and 2.6 percent  last year. A dramatic price surge for the month of April was  expected already. Premier Ciller, as part of her economic  recovery program, dropped a bombshell of public sector price  hikes that were followed by the private sector firms.    "Several private sector firms have already raised prices by  more than 100 percent in order to protect themselves from  inflation and to minimize losses from a shrinking market,"  explained one former Treasury chief.    "It is not possible to survive under the circumstances. At  the end of the year's second quarter, 60 percent of Turkish  manufacturers will be suffering from payments problems, and at  the end of the third quarter 90 percent," said Sozer Ozel,  chairman of the Ankara Chamber of Industry (ASO).    He predicted to the TURKISH DAILY NEWS that things would get  progressively worse in the economy during the rest of the year.  "There is already a large number of company closures. I do not  want to talk of the possible picture by the end of the year,"  Ozel said.    Some businessmen are remaining calm.    "If the correct steps are taken, the Turkish economy could  overcome the crisis within a month," said Besim Tibuk, chairman  of the Net Holding company.    Economists have been warning of possible stagflation. They  say three-digit inflation, as expected, could couple with a  drastic decline in industrial activity, making stagflation  inevitable in the medium term.    ``There has been hardly any economic activity since the  start  of the financial crisis this January. We have inflation rates  above the 100 percent mark. One does not have to be a genius to  combine these two and conclude that stagflation is in the  offing,'' said one Ankara professor of economics.    ``The important thing is to establish confidence in the  government's policies,'' Ozer Ertuna, economics professor at  Bosphorus University and former chief adviser to Ciller, told  REUTERS. "Bankruptcies will be seen if it cannot be provided."  Observers say the economy is heading into recession after last  year's consumer-driven 7.3 percent growth.    "Production is declining, prices are rising and consumption  is falling rapidly. The economy is being dragged into  stagflation," said Atalay Sahinoglu, chairman of the Istanbul  Chamber of Commerce (ITO).    Three small banks and eight brokerage houses failed last  month, and some companies in the telecommunications, car and  textile industries have suspended production.    There were reports on Wednesday that Turkey's manufacturing  industry grew by a negative 1.4 percent in March compared with  the same period of last year. Capacity utilization in the  industrial sector is 72 percent.    Some economists are still optimistic.    "It is normal that prices rise extremely fast in the first  months of a stabilization program," said Professor Cafer Tayyar  Sadiklar, former finance minister and the central bank governor.  He predicted that inflation would fall noticeably in the coming  months.    Opposition politicians were angered by the disclosure of  inflation figures.    Main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP) leader Mesut Yilmaz  said this was a sign that the economy had gone out of control.  Republican People's Party (CHP) Chairman Deniz Baykal said that  Turkey had now entered a period of three-digit inflation  figures, predicting that the financial crisis would soon turn  out to be a production crisis, forcing several factories to  close down.    Meanwhile, Turkish financial markets reacted calmly to  Wednesday's news that the annual inflation had hit three figures.    The Istanbul stock exchange index firmed 285.08 points to  finish at 15,130.98, bringing the two-day recovery to 6.6  percent following a 37 percent plunge since April 15. The  Turkish lira firmed to 35,600 to the dollar from 36,200 Tuesday.</p>

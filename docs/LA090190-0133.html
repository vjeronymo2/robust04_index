			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EPISCOPAL DIOCESE WON'T TAKE ACTION AGAINST PRIEST  </P> <P> The Episcopal Diocese of Newark, N.J., plans to take no action against a  controversial gay priest who says he will perform "gay marriages" even though  his bishop has ordered him not to function as a priest.  </P> <P> The Rev. Robert Williams of Jersey City, who gained nationwide attention early  this year when he made widely publicized comments disparaging monogamy and  celibacy, announced that he would be available to perform "blessing ceremonies  for same-sex couples."  </P> <P> Archdeacon Leslie Smith, spokesman for the Diocese of Newark, said Tuesday that  the diocese would not respond to Williams' announcement -- continuing a policy  the diocese has taken ever since Williams was forced to resign his position as  director of The Oasis, a diocesan ministry to homosexuals based in Hoboken.  </P> <P> Smith said Williams' announcement was "non-news" and called his actions "just a  continuation of a pattern Robert has been in since February of this year."  </P> <P> Because neither the Episcopal Church nor the state recognizes the blessing of  same-sex couples as a legal marriage, there is some question as to whether  Williams is fulfilling a priestly function in performing such ceremonies.  </P> <P> Asked if a policy of ignoring Williams' actions could lead to a breakdown of  ecclesiastical authority, Smith said, "I am not worried about that. We don't  have a problem with authority in this diocese. . . . It is not a diocese that  is awash with disobedience or uncooperative priests."  </P> <P> In his statement, Williams said he was making himself available to bless  same-sex unions because The Oasis has decided not to bless gay unions as a  result of pressure from church conservatives.  </P> <P> "This is an important ministry that many gay and lesbian couples want and  need," Williams' statement says. "Since the most liberal diocese of the most  liberal mainstream Christian denomination has refused to respond (to) this  need, I want it to be known that I, as an individual Christian priest, will  continue to respond as I have been all along."  </P> <P> Smith disagreed that The Oasis has decided against same-sex union ceremonies.  He said the The Oasis is exploring the possibility "very carefully" with a view  to setting up appropriate guidelines.  </P> <P> Bishop John Spong ordained Williams in a highly publicized ceremony in December  -- despite a resolution by the church's General Convention that calls  ordination of practicing homosexuals "inappropriate."  </P> <P> Angered by Spong's actions, laity, clergy and bishops have called for  disciplining the Newark prelate. The House of Bishops is expected to address at  least some of those calls when it meets Sept. 15-20 in Washington.  </P></p>

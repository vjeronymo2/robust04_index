			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> THE BOY JUST WANTS TO HAVE FUN  </P> <P> Heavy metal rock star Ozzy Osbourne says he's not into Satanism or drugs. He  just wants to have fun.  </P> <P> "All I really do is have Halloween every night I'm on stage," Osbourne said in  an interview scheduled to air today on Channel 1, the Whittle Communications  news and information program for teen-agers that began broadcasting into  schools March 5.  </P> <P> In a sermon earlier this month, Roman Catholic Cardinal John J. O'Connor said  that heavy-metal music spiked with satanic lyrics created an atmosphere  conducive to devil worship and demonic possession.  </P> <P> Osbourne said it wasn't so. "There's no demonic message or anything freaky  about it. It's just a bit of fun for the night and why not?"  </P> <P> The rock star also said he condemns drug use.  </P> <P> "It's bad because you're living in a total fantasy world," he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> $930,000 LIBEL SUIT SETTLED  </P> <P> The satirical magazine Private Eye, threatened with closure by a massive libel  suit by the estranged wife of one of Britain's most notorious mass killers, won  a reprieve today when the case was settled.  </P> <P> Private Eye appealed successfully last month against the size of the $930,000  damages awarded by a jury to Sonia Sutcliffe in May. It was the largest libel  award ever made in Britain.  </P> <P> Today Private Eye told the Court of Appeal that it had agreed to pay one-tenth  of the award and legal costs to Sutcliffe, wife of the murderer nicknamed "The  Yorkshire Ripper."  </P> <P> The magazine, which has made its reputation by lampooning politicians, royalty  and public figures for almost 30 years, was ordered by the High Court to pay an  additional $155,000 in settlement of a second libel suit brought by Sutcliffe.  </P></p>

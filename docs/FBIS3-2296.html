"Strengthening the collection and management of taxes"  and earnestly preventing the loss of taxes have become a  consensus among the people. This author holds that there are  many causes of the serious loss of taxes, but the existing  excessively backward mode of collecting and managing taxes can  only be said to be one of the important causes. Therefore, the  way out is to reform, according to the demands of the socialist  market economy, the existing outdated mode of tax collection and  management and to modernize, socialize, and legalize tax  collection and management.    For more than 40 years, China has been implementing the  system of special tax administrators administering enterprises,  that is, one special administrator administers a certain number  of enterprises and the administrator completes all by himself  the work of giving instructions on paying taxes, tax payment  assessment, tax declaration, handing over taxes to the treasury,  and tax payment inspection. This mode of management once played  a positive role, but it has increasingly greater difficulty in  meeting the needs of the development of economic life at  present. To explore a rational mode of tax collection and  management, various localities across the country have, since  the middle of the 1980's, carried out one after another the  reform of tax collection and management which mainly separates  tax collection and management from inspection. However, this  reform is mainly a readjustment of the internal work  relationship of taxation organs and cannot solve problems in the  relationship between taxpayers and tax collectors. Also,  because taxpayers continue to pay taxes at taxation departments  as before, the workload of taxation departments increases day by  day and the problem of the loss of taxes remain serious.  Therefore, making efforts to explore how to deepen the reform  of the tax collection and management structure in the socialist  market economy has become a very pressing task. The Haikou City  Taxation Bureau used international common practices for  reference and in 1992 started the reform of the existing tax  collection and management structure: It has abolished the  special tax administrators system and has universally asked  taxpayers to make tax declarations on their own; it has changed  manual management, which is characteristic of voluntariness, and  has universally used computers, which "pay no attention to human  feelings," for management; it has changed its management  function of doing all the work by itself and has asked social  intermediate organs to act as tax agencies; and it has  strengthened tax inspection and taxation judicial work.  Practice has proved that this reform is a useful attempt to  deepen the entire tax collection and management structure.    1. Taxpayers make tax declarations on their own.  Taxpayers submitting tax declarations to the taxation bureau on  their own within a certain time limit is a common and feasible  international practice. The Americans, for example, are nervous  on 15 April each year because that is the deadline for  individuals to report to the federal government how much income  tax they have to pay. On that day, people mail their  declarations before the clock strikes midnight so as not to pay  a fine for delay. At present, before the seventh of each month  [as published], the people in Haikou go to various taxation  offices to make tax declarations on their own. The former  practice of special tax administrators going from door to door  to provide "service" has gone forever. The crux of this reform  is not just a change in the method of collecting taxes, but a  demand that the taxpayers must be responsible for making their  own tax declarations. With the exception of special cases in  which the declared amounts have to be examined and verified,  taxation organs usually collect taxes in accordance with the  declarations of the taxpayers. In case false declarations are  found during inspection later, investigation will be carried out  and legal responsibility will be affixed.    2. Taxation management work is divided according to  different types of work. The Haikou City Taxation Bureau  has used the tax collection and management practices in Hong  Kong for reference and former special tax administrators are  grouped under three major categories--collection of taxes at  counters, tax assessment, and tax inspection. The tax  collection group is responsible for establishing files on  taxpayers, handling tax declarations, handling tax collection  formalities, sending out letters to taxpayers whose tax  declarations are overdue notifying them of deadlines for tax  declarations and tax payments, checking and ratifying tax  amounts, punishment for violations of tax regulations, and  preparing taxation forms, statistics, and reports for the higher  level. The assessment group is responsible for collecting and  filing taxation data, picking out and handling taxpayers who  have ignored letters notifying them of deadlines for tax  declarations and tax payments, and carrying out investigation  and assessment of taxes on enterprises whose tax declarations  are not true and whose accounts are not sound. The inspection  group is mainly responsible for the investigation and handling  of various cases of violation of tax laws and rules and  referring such cases to judicial organs for trial.    3. Tax collection is carried out with computers.  Computers are characterized by high storage capacity, a high  degree of automation, and a fast, simple, and accurate manner of  handling data. Therefore, taxation departments of all developed  countries and regions of the world have attached great  importance to the development, management, and utilization of  computers and have used computers to replace manual operations  in a bid to lower costs, improve efficiency, and reduce  voluntariness in taxation work. At present, the Haikou Taxation  Bureau has preliminarily set up a computer network for  management and its network is connected with a network of  various tax collection points (taxation offices), subbureaus,  and the city bureau. Information can be speedily passed along  across the city. At present, computers are used for taxation  registration, tax collection, taxation statistics, tax  declarations, notification of overdue tax payments, and other  work. The computer network is also linked with those of banks.  Tax declarations and handing over taxes to the treasury can be  carried out at the same time, and taxation service is integrated  with bank service.    4. The taxation agency system is instituted. The  practice of professionals such as tax consultants, registered  accountants, and auditors handling tax payment and other  taxation affairs for others is quite common around the world and  taxation agencies have been praised as "economic policemen who  are not paid by the government." Such a practice has been tried  in Haikou. At present, several hundred enterprises have  entrusted taxation agencies with making tax declarations on more  than 3,000 occasions, and these agencies have corrected nearly  1,000 mistakes in tax declarations of enterprises. The taxation  agents have also visited enterprises to provide services and  have succeeded in urging more than 50 enterprises whose tax  payments are overdue or whose tax declarations are incomplete to  pay overdue taxes amounting to over 1.8 million yuan. This  reform has added a middleman between the tax collector and the  taxpayer, giving rise to a system in which the three cooperate  with and condition one another.    5. Taxation inspection and taxation judicial work are  strengthened. Viewed from taxation management abroad, all  countries and regions in which taxpayers make tax declarations  on their own have paid great attention to taxation inspection  and taxation judicial work. On the one hand, efforts are  concentrated on strengthening inspection. On the other hand,  special judicial organs are established to try cases involving  taxation. In the course of the reform of tax collection and  management, Haikou City has changed the past situation of paying  attention to management while belittling inspection, reorganized  taxation personnel to provide more people for inspection,  strengthened the means and law- enforcement authority for tax  inspection, and established taxation courts. Legal means are  used to strengthen administration in taxation and to try in good  time taxation administrative lawsuits, tax evasion cases, and  cases of taxation organs' applications for enforcement.    In the reform of the tax collection and management  structure,  Haikou City has achieved remarkable results in the following  three aspects: The first is that the citizens' sense of paying  taxes has been greatly strengthened and 95 percent of them have  made tax declarations in time of their own accord. The second  is that tax evasion has been effectively curbed and the amount  of taxes collected has increased by a big margin. The third is  that honesty in taxation departments has been strengthened and  opportunities for abusing power to seek personal gain have been  reduced as a result of structural improvement. We can believe  that the deepening and perfection of this reform will bring  about thorough changes in the entire taxation work, including  ideological concepts, tax collection and management procedures,  the building of organizations, and changes in functions,  gradually bring taxation work into the orbit of modernization,  socialization, and legalization, bring taxation work in line  with international practice, and effectively promote the  management of taxation according to law.</p>

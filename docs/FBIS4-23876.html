			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The French foreign minister, Mr. Alain Juppe,  yesterday announced that France is going to intervene militarily  in the Rwanda conflict, together with its European and African  allies. Mr. Juppe announced that France will send in 2,000 to  3,000 of its troops currently in Somalia. This, he said, will  be done ostensibly to stop the massacres in Rwanda, and in the  event the OAU brokered cease-fire is not implemented.    Mr. Juppe's utterances have left the whole world wondering  whether France has taken over the role of the United Nations and  the OAU, because the action seems unilateral. What has surprised  the world even more, however, is the irony of this pretend  action by France, since the French Government is directly  responsible for the massacres and genocide that have taken  place, and are still taking place, in our country. In the past  and in the present, France has aided the Rwanda dictatorial  clique directly. The very people who are killing men, women,  and children in Rwanda have got the support of the French  Government.    Even before the armed conflict in Rwanda broke out, France  was training the Rwanda Government forces, who have had a major  role in the killings in Rwanda. Mr. (John Kabonera), a  Frenchman and human rights activist, recently lamented that it  was shameful for France that its Rwandese military cadres were  the very ones who killed, raped, and looted in Rwanda. To use  Mr. (Kabonera)'s words, it is a pity our students are the ones  doing all this.    Immediately after the outbreak of the war in 1990, France,  committed to the murderous regime, sent to Rwanda troops to prop  up the regime against the onslaught of the superior, better  organized RPF combatants, who not only had a just cause, but  were sure to expose the French backed dictatorial clique to the  Banyarwanda [Rwandans] and the rest of the world. Alongside its  legionnaires, France supplied millions of dollars worth of arms  and ammunition to the Kigali clique, but all this to no avail.  France went into an all-out diplomatic war against the RPF on  behalf of the Kigali murderers and lobbied for the Kigali  clique, but as expected the Rwandese people and the  international community did not pay heed to France's  machinations on behalf of the murderers.    The French troops in Rwanda then intensified their military  campaign on the frontline alongside the Rwanda Government  forces, but lost heavily at the hands of the RPF combatants.  The French legionnaires in Rwanda man roadblocks in the  country, identifying Tutsis, anti-government Hutus, or arrests  and harrassments.    The French troops in Rwanda, along with government forces,  trained the dreaded Interahamwe [Republican National Movement  for Democracy and Development, MRND, militia], armed them to the  teeth, and posted them throughout the whole country in  preparation for the present day holocaust. The French  legionnaires in Rwanda raped Rwandese women and were allowed to  carry themselves around in the undisciplined manner that  characterizes them, as if it is the payment for the support of  the murderous clique of MRND-CDR [Coalition for the Defense of  the Republic]. It is common knowledge that French troops in  Somalia, who Mr. Juppe claims will come to Rwanda, raped and  misbehaved in Somalia and may be responsible for the animosity  accorded to UN troops by Somalis.    Despite its obvious support for the murderous clique, the  French Government pretended to moderate talks between the RPF  and the Rwanda Government. But because the French Government  was not genuine, the talks failed, until finally the OAU and the  rest of the international community openly categorized France as  a party to the conflict, and therefore not credible as a peace  talks organizer. The talks were then organized by the OAU, with  the blessing of the UN. France was not, of course, happy, and  although it had observer status at the Arusha peace talks [words  indistinct] in August 1993, France backed the late Habyarimana  in all his moves to block the implementation of the Arusha  accord.    France helped to arm and train Interahamwe militias, and  supplied millions of dollars worth of arms and ammunition to the  Habyarimana clique, and this is what facilitated the murderous  Interahamwe to carry out the genocide and massacres in Rwanda.  Even after the death of Habyarimana, France rushed to evacuate  the family and close associates of the late president.    France was the first country to recognize, and granted visas  to, Jerome Bicamumpaka and Jean-Bosco Barayarwiza, who are known  killers, and who had left instructions at home that hundreds of  thousands of innocent lives [words indistinct].    France is still supplying arms through the Rwanda Embassy in  Cairo to the murderous clique in Rwanda, as evidenced by fax  messages from Cairo to Rwanda. [passage omitted]    Having said this, it is very clear that France is incapable  of making the situation in Rwanda better. The only thing it can  achieve is to aggravate the situation. France cannot stop the  genocide and massacres it has helped to put in action. France  is the mentor of the very clique which is carrying out the  killing.    The only way it can stop the killing is to [words  indistinct]  its support for the murderers. Why should France undermine the  UN and OAU? The UN and OAU should make their stand clear, and  show that they are world bodies with authority. They should not  allow France to marginalize them. The intentions of France are  very clear. France intends to fight for the murderous extremist  clique calling itself government, which is on the run, in the  pretext of stopping massacres.    After hundreds of thousands of innocent lives have been  lost,  the French Government, which is responsible for this loss of  life, now claims it will send in troops to stop the killings.  The intention is clear: The French troops will come to protect  the murderers. The French minister claims that France will come  with its European and African allies. One wonders who these  allies are.    France has always been alone and on the wrong side as  regards  the Rwanda question. It is not about to get allies now.  Whatever allies it will get, it cannot in any way replace the  UN and the OAU. It will still be a unilateral action by France.  Whatever action [word indistinct] France takes, will not  absolve France from its contribution to the genocide and  massacres which took place, and are still taking place, in  Rwanda today. France has no moral authority [word indistinct]  to intervene in the conflict in Rwanda.</p>

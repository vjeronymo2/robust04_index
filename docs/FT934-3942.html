			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Budget worries slow consumer credit rise Consumer borrowing slackened ahead of the Budget due to concerns about large tax increases, government figures suggested yesterday. Net lending to consumers by finance houses and building societies and on credit cards in the Visa and Mastercard systems came to Pounds 311m in October, compared with Pounds 489m in September. The figures provide a warning that the recent strong growth in consumer activity could run out of steam should people start to worry about the effects on their disposable incomes of the Pounds 8.1bn tax increases coming into force in April. Before last week's Budget many people were concerned that the government might impose still greater tax increases than the Pounds 1.4bn announced in addition to the Pounds 6.7bn of tax increases already in the pipeline for April. Between August and October lending reached Pounds 1.025bn, up from Pounds 535m in the previous three months and the highest three-month figure for nearly three years. A feature of the three months to October is the degree to which consumers increased borrowing from finance houses. The net lending taken on in this period from this source came to Pounds 983m, up from Pounds 519m between May and July. This underlines people's keenness - aided by lower interest rates - to spend more money in recent months, which has helped to underpin the economic recovery of the past year. The Treasury said that, even allowing for the sharp fall between September and October in the seasonally adjusted lending figure, the October total was the second highest since April 1991, showing a 'continued upswing' in consumer activity. Although the Central Statistical Office lending figures do not include mortgages, the figures are considered a reliable guide to consumer behaviour. Net lending by finance houses increased slightly from Pounds 336m in September to Pounds 349m the following month, with much of this cash going on durable goods such as cars, carpets and cookers. A net Pounds 31m was repaid on credit card loans in October, however, indicating a move away from using cards to finance new spending. The repayment followed a net increase in card loans of Pounds 106m in September. October also saw a net repayment on loans taken out through building societies. Consumers paid back Pounds 7m in October, after boosting borrowing by Pounds 47m in the previous month. The amount of new credit advanced to consumers - which does not take repayments into account - came to Pounds 4.39bn in October, down from a record Pounds 4.848bn in September.</p>

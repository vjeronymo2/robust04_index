			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: American Express to cut card division costs by Dollars 1bn AMERICAN EXPRESS, the financial services group, yesterday announced plans to cut annual operating costs at its card division by up to Dollars 1bn. The plan to cut almost 11 per cent of the annual Dollars 9.4bn costs at the travel related services (TRS) division, was unveiled by Mr Jim Robinson, the American Express chairman. The TRS division, which suffered a 23 per cent drop in earnings in the first quarter of 1992, has been hit by losses in the Optima credit card division. Last year the division's credit loss provisions jumped by Dollars 697m at the pre-tax level, half of the increase caused by Optima. TRS has also been faced by protests from numerous retail merchants in the US and Britain over fees that are much higher than those of competitors such as Visa or MasterCard. The embattled Mr Robinson, who has been forced to reorganise the Optima business, yesterday told shareholders at the American Express annual meeting that costs at TRS would be cut by Dollars 500m to Dollars 1bn over the next three years as a result of 're-engineering efforts.' Mr Mike O'Neill, a spokesman for American Express, said the effect of the cuts on the staffing levels at TRS would be 'minimal.' TRS employs 55,000 of the group's 110,728 workforce. Mr O'Neill said the cuts would be achieved by way of reduced spending on marketing and business development and lower credit loss provisions. But the American Express official said he could not explain how American Express could confidently predict that its credit provisions over the next three years would be reduced sufficiently to ensure overall cuts of up to Dollars 1bn a year by 1995. Meanwhile, Mr Robinson was on the defensive yesterday as he sought to counter allegations that he was more actively involved than previously known with company operatives who ran a late-1980s smear campaign against Mr Edmond Safra, the Swiss-based banker. In 1989 Mr Robinson apologised publicly to Mr Safra and acknowledged that persons acting on behalf of American Express had been the source of 'untrue and defamatory' media stories about Mr Safra. American Express agreed to donate Dollars 4m to Mr Safra's charities after it admitted its personnel had been responsible for 'an unauthorised and shameful effort' to use the media to malign Mr Safra and Republic National Bank of New York, which Mr Safra controls. A book to be published this week claims Mr Robinson initiated an American Express investigation of Mr Safra in 1986 that spawned the smear campaign and received several briefings from an aide who was deeply involved in the anti-Safra campaign. The book, 'Vendetta: American Express and the Smearing of Edmond Safra', is by Mr Bryan Burrough, the Wall Street Journal reporter. In the book Mr Burrough quotes Mr Harry Freeman, a former top aide to Mr Robinson, as saying it was 'a one hundred per cent probability' that Mr Robinson was briefed in detail about the smear campaign. Mr Freeman, who last month launched a Dollars 50m libel suit against Mr Burrough and The Journal over a 1990 article about the Safra campaign, yesterday said through his lawyer that his comments had been 'ripped out of context'. Mr Robinson said yesterday: 'I was not aware of, did not authorise, nor condone any effort to smear Edmond Safra or his associates.'</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Open sesame, system: Computer hackers are less of a risk than lax security over passwords Shadowy figures answering only to bizarre pseudonyms; secret meetings in lonely cellars at dead of the night; electronic black boxes dialling endless sequences of telephone numbers in the hope of making a connection. This is the stuff of hacker mythology, the heroes of the computer revolution whose main aim in life is to break into computer systems. Their motivation, it seems, is not personal gain but to test their ingenuity against the best defences computer scientists can build round their systems. This week, hackers were in the limelight once more with a report from The Independent newspaper that British Telecommunications' principal computers, used to store its customer records, had been hacked into. Some of the country's most sensitive unlisted telephone numbers - including MI5, MI6, Downing Street and Buckingham Palace - were found and sent to a freelance journalist, Mr Stephen Fleming, over the Internet, the global information superhighway. It was hardly the first time a telecommunications operator had been compromised. In 1988, a hacker nicknamed 'Prophet' broke into BellSouth's centralised automation system in Atlanta - Prophet was eventually sent to prison after being caught with incriminating material. But the BT case has been unusually public. Not since the Duke of Edinburgh's el-ectronic mail box was hacked into in the early 1980s has there been so much of a furore over the security of computer data. And computer abuse has grown considerably since then. Earlier this year, the Audit Commission reported a 300 per cent increase in the past three years in all forms of computer abuse, including fraud, theft, hacking and the unauthorised disclosure of personal data. BT accepted that information had been taken from its system, and instituted an immediate review of its security measures. But it denied that its computers had been 'hacked'. This position depends to some extent on a definition of hacking. Most people take it to mean using clever methods to overcome the system's defences. But Mr Fleming, who obtained temporary employment at BT, is quoted as saying: 'To my amazement I found passwords were openly distributed.' Computer security experts everywhere will have shaken their heads wearily at these words. The BT affair has confirmed, yet again, their collective view that poor password discipline is the biggest single cause of computer security breaches. People like to believe in the hacker mythology; they like the mystery and the taste of electronic wizardry. But it serves to distract attention from the fact that computer security in most commercial organisations is poor or non-existent. KPMG Peat Marwick, the business consultancy, surveyed some 138 large companies this year; the results show that almost 30 per cent of companies either did not report or investigate breaches of computer security. Many could not even say with certainty whether their systems had been attacked. Some 27 per cent were either unsure or stated categorically that their networks were not secure from unauthorised use. Mr Gerry Penfold, KPMG partner with responsibility for computer audit, said: 'It seems that companies continue to be oblivious of the commercial risks they are running, choosing to ignore obvious dangers.' BT now faces an investigation by the data protection registrar. Under the principles of the Data Protection Act, any companies with personal information about customers on their computers have to take reasonable care to keep that information confidential. Breaking a principle of the act is not in itself a criminal offence; but if a company ignores the registrar's advice on future security procedures, it could be liable for prosecution. Such security is largely a matter of commercial compromise. Companies can have as much security as they are prepared to pay for. These levels are spelt out in the US in the Department of Defence Orange Book and in Europe in the EU's White Book. A password provides some security. The addition of a call-back mo-dem, so that users are called back by the computer, provides more. And double, triple or greater combinations of passwords offer more security still. The most sensitive government computer systems also have boxes built around each terminal to stop people using a scanner to read the radio frequencies that they emit. But, essentially, systems are at most risk from their users. A virtually secure system is possible, but the expense and inconvenience of guaranteeing password discipline is usually impracticable. Most organisations settle for password combinations. And in practice, groups of people often share passwords to make administration easier. Others write them down - not unreasonably, in some cases. Professor Henry Becker of Zergo, a security consultancy, cites a bank with 40 passwords and identity codes. The problem is really a cultural one. There is a lack of awareness of the need for security. People who would never think of going out for lunch leaving the cash drawer open, leave a computer terminal on and unattended without a second thought. As the Audit Commission has said: 'As information technology becomes a normal part of the employees' work pattern, there is a risk of almost casual disregard in protecting data. Managers and users must understand the value of data and protect it before it gets lost or damaged - deliberately or accidentally.' If the message gets home, hackers will have to win their spurs the hard way.</p>

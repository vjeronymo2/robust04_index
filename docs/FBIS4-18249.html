			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Narcis Serra Believes Gonzalez Is </F> Congress' Main Winner"]    [Text] Madrid -- Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra  asserted yesterday that "if anybody could say that he won this  congress, because it proceeded as he forecast and the leadership  he secured is the one he proposed, that somebody is Felipe  Gonzalez, but he will never do so."    In statements to the Spanish Radio Broadcasting Company,  Serra said that the 33d Socialist congress "gave its support, by  96 percent, to theses and a leadership team vastly different  from the previous one, which will carry out those theses because  it is perfectly attuned to Gonzalez and because it is a team of  people with influence in the party and the ability to mobilize  it."    The deputy prime minister also highlighted the support that  the party gave at the congress for the government's activity.  "The government's policy, including the labor reform policy,  our proposals for emerging from the crisis, the democratic  impetus proposal -- all this was fully endorsed at the congress.  The new Federal Executive Committee is better able to  coordinate activity with the government and to listen in the  government."  <H5>  Support Gonzalez </H5>   In Serra's opinion, the congress is an extremely clear step  forward toward cohesion in the party, which acquires a powerful  and representative Executive Committee that supports the  secretary general's decisions. "I believe that for many years  we have not had a means to resolve the problems that arise in  any party," he added, referring to the new Executive Committee.    Brand-new Organization Secretary Cipria Ciscar also assessed  the congress' consequences on the following day. Ciscar said  that he prefers "to be called a Socialist as such, and that is  enough. I do not consider exactly the numbers in the Executive  Committee, because that committee has people who are very  representative of the party," he said.    Ciscar agreed with Serra that at the Federal Congress  "Felipe  Gonzalez' arguments won, since renewal went ahead, and there  were important changes; he wanted party integration and  cohesion, and that is what won."    In statements to Onda Cero, Ciscar also stated that "we must  be glad that we all believe that we won, because that also shows  that there is a desire to work satisfactorily."    Ciscar said that the formation of the Executive Committee  was  "an important change," and added that there was a "basic renewal  in the sphere of ideas, which establishes a clear connection  between party and government policy."    The new organization secretary stated that Jose Maria  Benegas, his predecessor in the post, "is somebody who has  worked hard and has his own political significance," and added  that he "is glad about that," but this "causes no complex."    He asserted that there have been problems over the past two  years and that the precongress process was "lively," but  following this congress, he added, "I believe that the agreement  that occurred and the commitment to work in the Executive  Committee are sincere, and it should be loyal."</p>

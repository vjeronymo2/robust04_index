In response to the proposal, Khanitson Nawanukuro, deputy  director-general of the Business Economics Department, said  Asean senior economic officials will bring up the issue at their  upcoming meeting in Jakarta Jan 27-28 to sound out opinions. He  said apart from the copyright issue, Asean senior officials will  discuss how to reduce tariffs on pulp under the Asean Free Trade  Area (Afta) programme to a maximum of five per cent this year  instead of within eight years as previously agreed.    Afta requires its members to cut tariffs on pulp to  zero-to-five per cent over an eight year period. But Khanitson  said Asean members will try to move faster on the tariff cuts to  make Afta a reality as soon as possible.    Earlier, the Afta working committee studied the  harmonization  of product codes for customs purposes in a drive to lower  barriers to trade. They concluded that Asean nations should  accelerate tariff cuts for pulp, among others because it would  be most beneficial to the member countries.</p>

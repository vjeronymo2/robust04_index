			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LANDSCAPE LAW WOULD SAVE WATER AND ENERGY;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: THE PROPOSED IRVINE ORDINANCE THAT CALLS FOR GROUPING PLANTS WITH  SIMILAR NEEDS WOULD EXEMPT SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES.  </P> <P> The city that declared war on chlorofluorocarbons has a new enemy: turf grass.  </P> <P> Under a plan that city officials say could help save the environment, lush  lawns are out and landscaping is in. The city that seems to put a premium on  conformity is now working on an ordinance that would regulate landscaping right  down to what types of plants can be grown side by side.  </P> <P> Research has shown that all the mowing, mulching, fertilizing and watering of  turf grass is ultimately more harmful to the atmosphere than the benefits  derived from the oxygen-producing greenery, city officials say.  </P> <P> The proposed ordinance, yet to be finalized, could apply to new businesses and  portions of condominium developments but would exempt single-family residences;  public land would also be regulated. City officials say it promises to reduce  energy costs, pollution, water use and landfill waste while also cutting back  on costs for materials and equipment used to maintain turf grass.  </P> <P> It also calls for grouping together plants that have the same climate, soil and  maintenance needs.  </P> <P> Planners say there are simply more water-efficient and environmentally  sensitive ways to landscape the city than the way it has been done up to now.  For example, to install and maintain just one acre of landscaping each year,  Irvine uses four acre-feet of water (1.3 million gallons, equivalent to a  year's supply for eight families of four), applies 250 to 300 pounds of  fertilizer and uses 102 gallons of gasoline for mowers to cut grass.  </P> <P> "I think our primary thrust is to say that turf grass does not make good  environmental sense in our area," said Robert Perry, a Cal Poly Pomona  professor of landscape architecture who helped write the ordinance.  </P> <P> Perry said that just as people want to keep their cars, they want to keep their  lawns. But that might not be the best thing for the environment, he said. "The  landscape is just another way of manufacturing pollution," because of the way  we maintain it, Perry said.  </P> <P> The plan, proposed by Councilman Cameron Cosgrove, grew out of a City Council  directive last year aimed at water conservation in landscaping. While other  areas of California, such as Santa Barbara, have written ordinances concerning  landscaping in response to drought conditions, Irvine's is likely the most  comprehensive, city planners believe.  </P> <P> Under the plan, there will be three basic plant groups for ornamental  landscapes: subtropical, Mediterranean and temperate.  </P> <P> Bougainvillea, for example, will be clumped with blue dracaena, because they  are both subtropical plants. But one would not plant a lavender starflower, a  subtropical shrub, next to a weeping willow, a temperate tree, because the  starflower prefers warmth and humidity while the willow prefers cold  temperatures and moisture.  </P> <P> Some areas along creeks and natural drainage swales will be allowed to remain  wild.  </P> <P> "There is great difficulty in directing and maintaining a landscape that is  comprised of so many elements. This diversity is not desirable when there is no  sensible order to it," the draft report said. "In fact, a great number of  conflicts between plant tolerances and preferences occur. A more logical method  of plant organization is to select and combine various species on the basis of  climactic and habitat adaptations."  </P> <P> Landscape designers say they have begun incorporating drought-resistant plants  in some of their plans because they need less water and thus are often cheaper  to maintain.  </P> <P> "Everybody's getting on the bandwagon," said Gus Puertas, who works for the  Tustin-based landscape architecture firm Frank Radmacher &amp; Associates.  "That dominoes down the line."  </P> <P> But there are problems finding enough drought-resistant plants because many  nurseries don't carry them. Clients also sometimes have their own ideas about  how they want a landscape to look and must be persuaded to explore other  options.  </P> <P> "It's an ongoing challenge," Jason Umemoto, a landscape designer, said of  persuading clients. He added that using drought-resistant plants "doesn't mean  you have to have rocks and cactus."  </P> <P> But planners for the master-planned city say the ordinance will encourage  diversity because so many different kinds of plants can be used and because  developers would be encouraged to use something different rather than an old,  water-guzzling standby.  </P> <P> "More than likely, you'll have the ability to put more color into a landscape,"  said Tim Kirkham, the city's landscape architect.  </P> <P> But Perry said that doesn't mean Irvine necessarily will look all that  different.  </P> <P> "We would say that in terms of its character and appearance, it's going to be  very similar . . . ," Perry said. "We're not going to have a desert look."  </P> <P> Mayor Larry Agran added: "The ordinance simply represents a growing sensitivity  to the need to landscape in ways consistent with the climate of our region.  </P> <P> "There was some concern, of course, that we somehow would be providing for a  barren and brown sort of future for ourselves, which of course is not the case.  </P> <P> "Careful selection of plant species actually provides for a much richer  landscaping but at a lesser cost."  </P> <P> The ordinance, which will be considered by the council next month, would also  require that new developments' landscapes not have more than 25% turf grass;  20% of them must be designed to use composted organic matter, and 40% of paved  surfaces within parking lots shall be shaded by "parking lot trees."  </P> <P> And there are directives about water. New landscapes will not be allowed to use  more than two acre-feet of potable water or more than three acre-feet of  reclaimed water per acre each year.  </P> <P> "We'll be able to use less water and still make the landscape look really  good," Kirkham said. "Irvine didn't hit a crisis point and say 'Gee whiz, we're  running out of water, let's enact an ordinance.' What we'd say is if we haven't  planted grass yet, let's consider how much we want to plant."  </P> <P> City planners say if the ordinance is adopted, developers who refuse to comply  would not be given permits. They are still trying to decide what enforcement  action would be taken against those who refused once their projects were  completed.  </P> <P> "It's kind of an apple pie and motherhood issue," Kirkham said. "No one wants  to achieve an uglier urban environment."  </P> <P> Like the city's ordinance clamping down on the manufacture of ozone-eroding  CFCs, Irvine planners say the new "Sustainability in Landscaping Ordinance"  will be at the forefront of similar plans in other cities.  </P> <P> "This is the new direction that certain communities are going to," Perry said.  "I think Irvine will rise to that challenge."  </P> <P> But will the community buy it?  </P> <P> "I think they will," Perry said. "I think that people are becoming more  sophisticated" about the way communities can impact the environment.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Maria Newman contributed to this report.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev by </F> Sergey Dorenko en route to Brussels on 24 May; from the  "Details" program--recorded]    [Text] [Dorenko] The Details camera is on board a  specially-equipped plane bound for Brussels. We have  interrupted Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev at his papers  three hours before his speech at NATO to ask him to comment on  his tactics with regard to a rapprochement with NATO,  exclusively for the viewers of the Details.    [Grachev] What Russia could gain by this is the following:  First, confirming to the international community our  contemporary views on security and our adherence to the policy  of strengthening our strategic union with the West; second, that  this would make it potentially possible for us to obtain more  information about NATO's military-political intentions, plans,  and actions, as well as other states involved in the Partnership  for Peace, and to influence them in our interests to a certain  extent.    [Dorenko] But will they not turn us into their southern  flank? These kinds of worries have been voiced in the press:  that they will make us fight against the Islamic  Fundamentalism, and if relations with China become aggravated....    [Grachev, interrupting] I understand your question. You are  trying to find out what negative implications our cooperation  may have. No, though theoretically perhaps we will be attached  to NATO in some way. Our state is a superpower with enormous  economic and military potential, and of course we will not tow  NATO's line, act as they tell us to, and take an extreme stance  on anything. No, in fact, the program we will propose for  signing will spell all of this out. If it becomes necessary for  Russia and some NATO countries to take some collective actions,  that decision should be made collectively, on the basis of  suggestions and deliberations. Only should an unequivocal  decision be made, which should be beneficial to Russia and the  NATO countries. That would be a fair decision.    [Dorenko] A question from daily life: In old times, the USSR  defense minister was chief of staff of the Warsaw Treaty and not  the United States the NATO leader. Now they will turn out to be  your commanders.    [Grachev] Well, that is a question of secondary importance.  Actually, no, this will not be so.    [Dorenko] What if Ukraine completes its transition to the  partnership faster than Russia, and, if the conflict with  Ukraine becomes more acute, NATO turns out to be on the  Ukrainian side?    [Grachev] If Ukraine joins this partnership before us and if  the NATO countries attempt, together with Ukraine, to put  pressure on us--well, this cannot be serious, and these states  will not take such a step for political reasons. This is the  first point; and second, why should they put pressure us? Are  we threatening Ukraine, or do we have some extremely tense  relations with Ukraine?    [Dorenko] This happens occasionally.    [Grachev] Well, you know, that is what strategy is for. We  have to resolve all misunderstandings and conflicts by political  means.</p>

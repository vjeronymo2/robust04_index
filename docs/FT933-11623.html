			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Recruitement: Stupidity - and how to learn from it - What matters is not how many mistakes you make, but the spirit in which you make them 'WHY are we waiting . . . again?' is all that is written on the postcard sent from Bristol. Even so, the Jobs column knows not only what it refers to, but who the sender is. The card is written in the same hand as the set of five, each asking just 'Why are we waiting?', which arrived at monthly intervals between the May and the September of 1986. The sender called herself Amelia Bulstrode, which is hardly the sort of name one forgets. What she was asking about was the Laws of Organisational Stupidity, which I'd previously promised to list in full only to let the next five months pass without doing so. As enduring readers may recall, the laws describe types of idiotic goings-on which seem to bedevil organisations of all kinds everywhere, an example being Parkinson's First which states: Work expands to fill the time available. And in 1986 there were a dozen laws in the canon. Now, oddly enough, in March this year I again promised to give the full code which, with the help of new examples sent by readers, had grown to 23. So I pledged to list them 'chunk by chunk, spaced over the next few weeks'. This time I've at least done rather better, managing to deal with 13 laws by the end of last month. But the list has since gone no farther, and Amelia Bulstrode presumably wants to hear about the other 10. If so, she's by no means alone, because colleagues as well as myself have lately had less subtle requests for the whole series. The failure to finish the listing is due less to laziness than to a development bound up with the nature of the laws. The idea behind them isn't just to comfort frustrated high-achievers by showing that their sufferings are shared by their counterparts the world over. Behind that lies the hope of helping management researchers to trace the causes of the stupid occurrences that so regularly snarl up organisations' attempts to be effective. Accordingly, each law is intended to describe a specific kind of idiocy which is essentially different from any of the idiocies depicted by the other laws in the code, and thus can be presumed also to have a different cause which needs to be pinpointed. Take for instance Professor Jerry Harvey's Abilene Paradox, one of the 13 already listed, which states: People in groups agree on decisions which, as individuals, they know are stupid. That seems different from Macaulay's Buck-shifter, also listed before, ruling: Initiative declines with increasing ease of communications. So until last month, there I was confidently setting out the supposedly differently caused stupidities - which went perfectly well for the first 12 examples. But then came the 13th, and with it came trouble. By contrast with the previous dozen, which had all been in the code for some time, it was newly discovered. It is named after Harvard University's Professor Chris Argyris who in his latest book* points out that much of the counter-productive politicking that goes on in organisations is rooted in a type of individual action which all of us have been *Knowledge for action.

It is to respond to any problem that threatens to land us in hot water by first finding a way to by-pass it, then covering up the by-pass, covering up the cover-up . . . and so on. As a result, far from being solved, the problem is not even admitted to exist. It becomes, in the professor's terms, increasingly 'undiscussible'. Hence Argyris's Archetype which says: The more threatening a problem to those responsible for solving it, the deeper it will become ingrained under ramifying layers of camouflage. The trouble was that, having discovered it, I realised that it destroyed the idea that each law in the code denotes a separate kind of stupidity with its own separate cause. For the Archetype accounts for several of the other idiocies formulated as laws. For example, the tendency to by-pass problems explains the Buck-shifter. With high-speed communications, people faced with personally risky decisions can more easily by-pass them by referring them to someone higher up. Much the same applies to the Abilene tendency for people in groups to agree on what they individually know are stupid decisions. It is explained by the fact that the wiser courses of action which need to be taken are undiscussible, since none of the group members dare broach them for fear of losing their job. That left me wondering how many more of the supposedly self-standing laws were in fact mere effects of the Argyris rule. The answer, alas, is certainly several, although I've not yet examined the implications deeply enough to give a precise number. Fortunately, however, there are some which clearly still stand alone. And they're exemplified by one which also illustrates the debt the whole laws project owes to readers' help. Another postcard that arrived in 1986 came from one Peter Kelly in Dublin, who proposed a law reading simply 'Errors breed'. But while they certainly do so in some circumstances, there are clearly others in which errors merely arise intermittently with no connection between them. One thing that struck me as likely to explain the difference was the American psychologist David McClelland's division of people into two broad kinds. The first are those motivated by a need for positive achievement, who tend to look on their errors as an opportunity to do better next time. The others, motivated by fear of failure, are typically preoccupied by the need to avoid making mistakes. So, in my role as the self-appointed codifier, I extended the proposal into what is now named Kelly's 'Katabolism' (a faulty life-support system that kills the organism affected). The law says: Errors breed as concentration on avoiding them increases. What's more, it is true. Anyone who doubts me need only consult psychologist Michael Frese of Giessen University in Germany who besides having studied mistake-making in detail has developed ways of much reducing the bad effects. His research suggests that when people are put under pressure to avoid doing anything wrong, the stress they feel on finding they've made an error tends to fluster them into making more. The remedy he proposes is to scrap training consisting of step-by-step procedures which people are told to follow strictly and, if they do something wrong, to call the instructors who will put things right before again showing them what they should have done instead. His studies indicate that it's better to set trainees tasks so complicated that they are bound to make mistakes and, when they do, respond with 'Great - you can now learn something really useful by finding out how to put things right yourself'. The result, he finds, is not only that they tend to learn more complex skills faster. No less important is that, although they make more mistakes than people trained in the other way, their errors are far less likely to have damaging consequences because they're better equipped to take corrective action in good time. Which said, the Jobs column is off on holiday. I hope to meet you all - including Mrs Bulstrode - again on September 8.</p>

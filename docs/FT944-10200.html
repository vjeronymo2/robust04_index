			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Siemens Nixdorf programmed for change If Mr Gerhard Schulmeyer is worried about his company's accumulated losses of DM2.25bn (Dollars 1.5bn), he does not show it. The new president and chief executive of Siemens Nixdorf (SNI) seems more concerned about units of time than D-Marks and dollars. The Siemens group has ample funds and profits to maintain the transfusions into its ailing information technology subsidiary which started when the acquired Nixdorf business was clumsily grafted on to its own mainframe operations in 1990. However, time is a different matter and, as Mr Schulmeyer said yesterday, the years which in normal circumstances would be needed to complete the job of renewing SNI's culture are not available to him. 'Changing a corporation's mentality usually takes three to five years, and we don't have it,' he told a press conference called to review his time - 132 days, as he pointed out - at the company. 'We cannot think in terms of two-year or five-year plans. We have to think of days,' he said. 'If you don't have a major technical feature change every six months you start to look old. You must revamp your entire product range every 12 months or you begin to look out of step.' Mr Schulmeyer, formerly head of Asea Brown Boveri's American operations, and fresh from six months of teaching management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, admitted the processes he was trying to introduce were alien to Germany, but insisted they were essential for the success of a high-technology, market-driven business. 'Classical functional organisational structures, in Germany especially, inevitably lead to a fragmented way of working with all the attendant penalties of delay, inflexibility and high overheads,' he said. Such conflicts figured large among the well-publicised problems which afflicted SNI from the outset, and which Mr Schulmeyer suggested yesterday had still not been properly resolved. Insufficient attention was paid during the unification process to reinforcing the relative advantages of the two cultures, he said. 'The new culture - if we can speak of one at all - was thus a chance development. 'SNI has not yet achieved a well-formulated cultural dimension,' he said. 'Siemens is still dreaming of its mainframe days and Nixdorf is still in its mid-range mentality. 'We managers have to learn to take risks otherwise nothing will happen,' he said. As for the risks of his failing in his main ambition, Mr Schulmeyer said he had given himself only a 60:40 chance of successfully changing the SNI culture when he arrived. Since then he had met or addressed 11,000 of the group's employees. Young managers had been sent off for training in the US. He had employed hardened restructuring experts with experience in cases such as Citibank and American Airlines. All in all, he felt the odds on his success had improved to 70:30, he said. SNI was not teetering on the brink of disaster. It was on a healthy recovery path, he claimed. In the current financial year, when Europe's computer price wars would cost the group even more than last year's DM900m, the company would make an operating profit, although further restructuring charges would leave it with another deficit on the bottom line, he said. Sales were expected to grow by 4 or 5 per cent and productivity was planned to increase 15 per cent. Although SNI lost DM350m last year, the situation had improved in the second half when turnover rose 23 per cent. Over the whole year, personal computer sales had increased 50 per cent compared with 1992-93. The PC division had gained a 10.4 per cent share in Germany, was lifting sales faster than the market, and was no longer a 'headache financially'.</p>

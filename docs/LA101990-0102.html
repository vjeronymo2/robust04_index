			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC/DANCE  </P> <P> Berkeley Returns Rare Music: Rare manuscripts of music by composers Wolfgang  Amadeus Mozart and Franz Schubert taken from an Austrian monastery at the end  of World War II and thought to be lost forever were returned to Austrian  officials Thursday by UC Berkeley. The university bought the manuscripts from a  former prison guard for $1,400 in 1976 and was unaware of their origin until  contacted by officials of the 800-year-old Benedictine monastery, who noticed  them in a catalogue.

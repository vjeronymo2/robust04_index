			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Forte to sell its catering unit and expand in Europe FORTE is this week expected to move closer to its aim of becoming a more internationally-based hotel and restaurant group with the sale of its Gardner Merchant catering division, the acquisition of a chain of French motorway restaurants and the conclusion of an agreement to run 18 hotels in Italy. The sale of Gardner Merchant to a consortium led by CinVen, the UK's second largest venture capital investor, for Pounds 400m could be announced today or tomorrow. The Gardner Merchant management will have a small stake in the business. An attempt by the Gardner Merchant management to acquire the business, backed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), the New York-based leveraged buy-out specialists, failed earlier this year, as did a takeover proposal by the Compass catering group. CinVen approached Forte shortly after the breakdown of negotiations with Compass last July. CinVen, which has stakes in several Forte hotels, will not be buying the group's airline catering interests. Forte is also expected to announce that it is to pay Pounds 65m to Pounds 70m for more than 40 motorway restaurants in France. The restaurants were acquired by Accor, the French hotels to luncheon vouchers group, when it bought Wagons-Lits, the Belgian travel company, last year. The European Commission instructed Accor to sell the restaurants last April because they would have given the group too dominant a position. The Wagons-Lits restaurants operate under the names of Relais, le Petit Cafe and Truckstore Cafe. Forte is also likely to announce in the next few days that it has concluded an agreement to manage 18 hotels in Italy as part of a joint venture with Agip, the state-owned petrol company. The hotels are mostly at motorway junctions. Forte is expected to start building early next year the first of a network of 100 hotels and motorway restaurants in Spain in a deal with Repsol, the Spanish state-owned energy group.</p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / The Long View: Tory twists and turns NEXT WEEK'S will be the 14th Budget statement since the Conservatives came to power in 1979, and it could be their last for a while. If the advance publicity is correct, and Norman Lamont reduces taxes at a time of rapid rises in public borrowing, it will also be uncharacteristic of what we have become used to - although no doubt the word 'prudent' will figure as prominently as ever. It is revealing to make comparisons with the very first Budget of the series, Sir Geoffrey Howe's post-election effort in June 1979. In some respects, the economic parameters were rather similar, with public borrowing (if you include asset sales) forecast at about 5 per cent of GDP - very much the same as Lamont is likely to project for 1992-93. But interest rates were somewhat higher than they are now, and the inflation rate substantially so. Labour had been in power for 11 out of the previous 15 years, and great weight was placed by Howe on tackling the failures of the supply side of the economy. He focused on reducing the role of the state, after the overdose of interventionism, and he aimed particularly to cut back the financial demands of the public sector. Cheekily he quoted the famous remark of the former Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan in 1976, which is again worth repeating in full. 'We used to think,' said Callaghan, 'that you could just spend your way out of a recession and increase employment by cutting taxes and boosting government spending. I have to tell you in all candour that this option no longer exists.' It seems that we are likely to get a very different viewpoint from Norman Lamont next Tuesday. Cutting taxes and increasing spending will indeed figure in his proposals. And in all candour I suggest that we will not hear very much about the failures of the supply side, although it is deeply depressing that in the single month of January the UK should have sustained a visible trade gap of more than Pounds 1bn even though the economy is arguably in the worst recession for perhaps 60 years. However, there is a crucial difference in that the overall public debt burden of the economy is now much lower. Howe was reacting to the public borrowing binge of the 1970s, which had taken the national debt up to nearly 50 per cent of GDP by 1979. Today that proportion is down to about 27 per cent. Howe was forced to clamp down on the private sector - which he did by raising interest rates by two points and extending credit controls - in order to finance the public sector without fanning the flames of inflation. Lamont does not need to worry in present circumstances about an explosion of private sector credit. Even so, it is impossible to reconcile the positions of the two chancellors. Thirteen years ago the Tories were entranced by the idea that the private sector, once set free, would bound ahead. But the response in the early 1980s proved disappointing. There was a certain amount of growth, but unemployment continued to rise until 1986. Income taxes were slashed so as to improve incentives, yet the economic benefits appear to have been disappointingly ephemeral. It was only when Nigel Lawson abandoned monetary controls, devalued sterling and cut interest rates that the private sector responded with any great vigour. But it was a candyfloss boom which brought little permanent benefit and which collapsed when anti-inflationary measures were applied. The remarkable Conservative theory in the mid-1980s was that private sector borrowing could not be inflationary. Deregulation led to an enormous expansion of bank lending but the dangers were ignored. Soaring house prices, in fact, were regarded as entirely desirable, and any link with general inflation was ruled out. There was a kind of symmetry to the Tories' approach: while the public sector debt burden rose declined sharply during the 1980s the private sector debt mountain swelled alarmingly, reaching 80 per cent of GDP by the end of the decade. It remains dangerously out of proportion to the ability of borrowers to service it at high real interest rates. It did not begin like this. In fact the Conservative government made a lot of good economic decisions in its early years. Since 1985, though, policies have nearly all been disastrous: the abandonment of monetary restraint, disregard for asset price bubbles, slowness to react to the economic overheating and then the pegging of sterling to the DM at the wrong time. Last year the government was sitting around waiting for a phantom recovery. Now it is embarking upon a borrowing binge which could impede the eventual recovery of the private sector. Lamont should allow for the risk that the government will have to assume responsibility for a large slice of private sector debt through bailouts of financial institutions. Already it is propping up the market in repossessed homes. Immediately ahead of the election, unfortunately, the errors cannot even be acknowledged, let alone responded to or corrected. Some day, perhaps, Tory theorists will get around to working out how it all went wrong. My own conclusion is that the deadly touch of the Treasury is at the centre of much of it. It is not just that its forecasts have often been comically bad. More fundamentally, far too much emphasis has been placed upon centralised economic policies. Even if these were executed properly - as they generally were up to 1985 - they could not liven up the economy very much. It must be time to downgrade the Treasury. And this is more than a question of handing over responsibility for monetary policy to the Bank of England. The whole idea of chancellors producing new ideas out of a red box every year is flawed. In any case, within the EMS and the Single Market, monetary and fiscal policy - even down to tax rates  - will increasingly be determined by what the rest of Europe is doing. The ministerial pecking order in Whitehall has to be revamped. The industry and employment departments must become much more important centres for the development of economic policy. But we must not expect the kind of miracle which was proclaimed by the Treasury in 1988. Just a few good ideas will do.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (3): Prudent lending policy pays off for shareholders - Profile of Danske Bank Both of Denmark's largest banks, Den Danske Bank and Unidanmark, are the result of the merger, in 1990, of the country's six largest banks into two domestic giants. But there the similarity ends. Unidanmark (a merger of Privatbanken, the savings bank, SDS, and Andelsbanken) has been plagued by heavy losses. The bank is now recovering under the management of Mr Thorleif Krarup, brought in from outside in late 1992, and after a highly successful international equity issue this spring it has been well-placed to take advantage of the coming upswing. Danske (a merger of Danske Bank, Copenhagen Handelsbank and Provinsbanken), on the other hand, has emerged from the recession years as the biggest, strongest and most profitable of the larger banks. Danske's assets at the end of 1993 were DKr356bn compared with Unidanmark's DKr242bn. Danske made a net profit of DKr2.4bn in 1993 to Unidanmark's DKr885m. Even more striking is a comparison of profits over the entire recession period, 1987-1993. Danske made profits of DKr5.7bn, while Unidanmark made losses of DKr2.6bn. Danske's equity capital peaked at DKr22.5bn in 1989, slipping to DKr20bn in 1993. Unidanmark's peaked at DKr18.6bn in 1989 and was down to DKr11.5bn at the end of last year. The difference lies in their respective lending policies. Danske (when it was known as Landsmandsbanken) collapsed in 1920 and had to be rescued by the state. It appears to have been permeated by a conservative ethos ever since. This has shown up in the loss provisions as a percentage of loans and guarantees, which peaked at just over 2 per cent in 1990 and fell to 1.4 per cent in 1993. Unidanmark's peaked at 4.5 per cent in 1992 and were down to 2.7 per cent in 1993. With a 35 per cent share of the domestic market (measured by assets), Danske does not wish to become larger - except by organic growth - according to its chief executive, Mr Knud Sorensen. But the bank is not, therefore, without ambitions. Mr Sorensen electrified listeners at a banking conference held in Copenhagen recently by business newspaper Borsen, when he declared: 'With regard to new business areas, insurance and mortgage credit, we see no reason why, over a period of years, we should not obtain a market share which is equivalent to our share of the banking market.' Mr Sorensen says that by this he also meant organic growth, and he was not intending to say that Danske plans to take over the Baltica insurance group, although he does not rule that out. If other buyers for Baltica cannot be found, Baltica may land in Danske's unwilling lap. Barring acquisitions, Danske has a long way to go to win a one-third market share of either insurance of mortgage credit. Its market shares in accident insurance, life and pension assurance and mortgage credit are still under 1 per cent. Nevertheless, the bank's insurance and mortgage credit operations (it has two wholly-owned insurance companies, a life and accident company, as well as a general insurance company jointly owned with Codan) are a sign of the times. Danske - together with the other larger banks - is meeting competition for its customers' money by offering customers the opportunity to do insurance and mortgage financing with the bank. (The insurance companies, of course, are doing the same, setting up banks in order to attract savings accounts from their insurance customers.) Mr Sorensen's lecture was an interesting expose of the bank's basic approach to business - a contribution to the growing literature which takes exception to the strategic planning approach to business management. 'The world is unpredictable, forecasts are usually wrong,' said Mr Sorensen. 'Instead of plans, which can never be kept, we try to maintain a permanent preparedness to meet change . . . to react constructively to unexpected developments, exploit opportunities which suddenly appear.' But, he went on, there is only one form of growth that interests the bank: growth in profitability, with net profits as a return on capital of about 10 per cent as a desirable level. The bank achieved a return on equity last year of 13 per cent - 'But I am afraid to say that in 1994 and the immediate years to come we cannot expect to obtain a return of anything like the same level,' he said. 'A given level of business, including the number of branches and staff, is in principle only desirable if it brings a satisfactory return on the capital which our shareholders have made available to us,' he added. It may sound routine to Anglo-Saxons, but it sounds notably hard-headed to Scandinavian ears, where the interests of shareholders are often balanced against those of the employees and the community at large.</p>

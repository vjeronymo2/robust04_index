Companies promoted from the FT-SE Mid 250 to the FT-SE 100 will be replaced in the FT-SE Mid 250 by those companies excluded from the FT-SE 100. Companies excluded from the FT-SE Mid 250/FT-SE Actuaries 350 will be included in the FT-SE SmallCap. The Committee also approved the inclusion of the following new issues in the FT-SE SmallCap and the All-Share with effect from December 20 1993: Carpetright, Crockfords, Field Group, Phonelink, RJB Mining. The next quarterly review will be held on March 9 1994. The Committee has now completed its consideration of the future treatment of enhanced scrip dividends (ESDs). As from December 31 1993, the ESD will be split into two components; the value of the gross cash dividend will be treated as income and an adjustment will be made to the capital index to reflect the difference between the gross cash dividend and the ESD. This will mean that the capital index will fall on the ex dividend date to reflect the value of only the gross cash dividend.</p>

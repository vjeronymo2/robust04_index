			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Secured bonds to be repaid at discount LONDON &amp; Provincial, the West End property company, yesterday asked holders of debentures, or secured bonds, to take a loss on their investment in what would amount to the first failure in the debenture market since the 1970s. The company will offer Pounds 95 for every Pounds 100 of bonds to the 76 insurance companies and pension funds which hold its Pounds 135m of debentures. The move followed a halving in value since June 1990 of the company's office and retail property investments in exclusive parts of London. Experts in the debenture market were hard-pressed yesterday to recall when a secured bond issue last failed to repay at face value, although some pointed to Mitchell Construction, whose bonds went into default nearly 20 years ago. Companies that issue debentures - typically property companies - agree to provide security worth substantially more than the value of the bonds, giving investors a cushion against any fall in property prices. London &amp; Provincial was due to make an interest payment to its bond holders of Pounds 5m net of tax yesterday, but would have been unable to do so without the support of its banker, Citibank. Instead, the company said it was proposing to pay off the bonds at below face value, together with all accrued interest, with facilities provided by the US bank. The deal, if accepted by at least 75 per cent of the bond holders at an extraordinary general meeting on February 1, will lead to Citibank putting up Pounds 134m, on top of Pounds 7.7m it has already lent the company. In addition, the bank has lent Pounds 216m to other parts of the Randsworth Acquisition group, owner of London &amp; Provincial and itself in receivership. Although yesterday's announcement brought grumbles from a number of investors, the offer was better than most had expected. The latest valuation of the properties backing the bonds shows them to be worth Pounds 121m, with a further Pounds 22m in cash available to the bondholders. The offer has already been informally accepted by three insurance companies, Prudential, Standard Life and Scottish Amicable, which between them own Pounds 45m of the bonds. Lex, Page 16</p>

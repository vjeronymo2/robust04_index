			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Scottish Metropolitan makes Pounds 26.8m cash call SCOTTISH METROPOLITAN Property, the property investment company which incurred a heavy loss in 1991 and fired its managing director, is to raise Pounds 26.8m through a rights issue. The company reduced its property portfolio in the last 18 months to cut borrowings, but now intends to expand again with acquisitions of about Pounds 5m each in Scotland. It has abandoned speculative development which led it into loss. ScotMet incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.78m in the year to August 15 1993 on the basis of FRS 3 accounting which it has now adopted. This compares with a loss of Pounds 3.91m on a restated basis for 1992. Net asset value per share was 82.4p, compared with 108.1p a year earlier, reflecting a deficit of Pounds 21.33m on valuation of investments at August 15 1993, and a one-off adjustment of Pounds 5.63m because of the accounting policy change. A final dividend of 1.1p per share (nil) making an unchanged 1.5p for the year is propopsed. After selling property worth Pounds 31.1m in the 1993 financial year, ScotMet last month sold Saltire Court in Edinburgh for Pounds 53.1m, a Pounds 6.5m surplus on book value. Mr Scott Cairns, managing director, said that the sale unlocked the company's new strategy and enabled it to have a 'voluntary refinancing.' ScotMet's rights issue is on the basis of 1-for-3, priced at 85p each, a 20 per cent discount to Tuesday's closing price of 105p. Irrevocable acceptances have been received for 44.7 per cent, and the balance is underwritten by Kleinwort Benson. The rights issue and the Saltire Court sale will leave ScotMet with borrowings of Pounds 68.6m compared with Pounds 170.3m in August 1992. Instead of borrowing from 18 banks, bank debt will be Pounds 5m and the company has arranged a Pounds 57m facility from 10 UK banks. COMMENT The rights issue is the only way forward for ScotMet which strayed disastrously from investing in existing properties, mostly in Scotland, into speculative developments of inappropriate scale. Saltire Court brought prestige but accounted for 20 per cent of its assets and took ages to fill up. The fall in nav per share disappointed the market and with the rights issue news, the shares dropped 9p to 96p. But property values are rising and earnings per share next year could be 2.75p. That would give a prospective p/e of about 35, roughly in line with the sector. The new ScotMet is not going to be exciting but should be more reliable. The rights should be taken up.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANN LANDERS: OUT OF STEP ON THE DANCE FLOOR  </P> <P> DEAR ANN: My wife is a terrific person. She excels in almost everything. Her  one area of deficiency is ballroom dancing.  </P> <P> I'm not bragging when I say I'm an excellent dancer. Women often ask me to  dance with them. But I cannot dance with my wife. "Charlotte" holds her head in  the wrong position and her left arm is like a 10-ton weight on my right  shoulder. Good dancers glide along, taking horizontal steps. Charlotte prefers  to do her own thing. Instead of following me, she leads.  </P> <P> P.S. When I told Charlotte I was writing to you for help, I was relieved to  find that she was not at all upset. -- MR. FOX TROT, Highland Park, Ill.  </P> <P> DEAR MR. TROT: I hope you won't be upset to learn that Charlotte wrote to me,  too. Here is her letter:  </P> <P> DEAR ANN: My husband is a wonderful man in all respects except one. Whenever we  go dancing he ends up mad because he doesn't like the way I dance.  </P> <P> I enjoy dancing but I don't take it as seriously as my husband does. He insists  on giving me lessons, tells me how to hold my head, what to do with my arms, do  this, don't do that. It takes all the fun out of the evening.  </P> <P> I have danced with many men through the years, and no one has ever complained.  In fact, I've been told that I'm a good dancer. But whenever my husband and I  dance together we end up arguing.  </P> <P> I love this man dearly and would appreciate any suggestions you might have on  how to solve this problem. It really has caused a lot of trouble in our  marriage.  </P> <P>  -- TWO LEFT FEET?  </P> <P> DEAR FEET: You two need an impartial third party to mediate this small war. I  suggest a dance instructor.  </P> <P> Take a few lessons together and let the instructor decide where your arms  should be and how you should hold your head. Since the inability to dance  together seems to be causing so much trouble in your marriage, lessons would be  well worth the time and money.  </P> <P> DEAR ANN: My problem is my son. "Bruce" weighs at least 350 pounds and is  headed for 400. He keeps getting fatter and fatter, although he knows I  desperately want him to get down to normal weight. He doesn't seem to care.  </P> <P> I sent Bruce to the very best schools and he is highly intelligent. He seems to  be doing OK professionally, but in his line of work looks count, and I'm sure  he could do a lot better if he lost 100 pounds.  </P> <P> I have two other sons who are in good physical condition. Tell me if there is  anything that can be done to bring Bruce to his senses before the heart attack  comes. Sign me . . .  </P> <P>  -- DISTURBED MOTHER SOMEWHERE IN FLORIDA  </P> <P> DEAR MOTHER: I can understand your concern, but take my word for it, Mother,  losing weight is the original do-it-yourself project.  </P> <P> Begging, nagging or threatening will not work. Unless Bruce decides of his own  volition to get serious, nothing will happen, even though his obesity is  life-threatening. He needs counseling to find out why he is doing this to  himself -- and perhaps to you.  </P> <P> The problem is not what Bruce is eating but what is eating him. I wish him the  best of luck.  </P> <P>  Lonesome? Take charge of your life and turn it around. Write for Ann Landers'  new booklet, "How to Make Friends and Stop Being Lonely." Send a  self-addressed, business-size envelope and a check or money order for $4.15  (this includes postage and handling) to: Friends, c/o Ann Landers, P.O. Box  11562, Chicago, Ill. 60611-0562. (In Canada send $5.05.)  </P></p>

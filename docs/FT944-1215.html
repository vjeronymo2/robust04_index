			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc to sell acetics operation Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals group, plans to sell its European acetics business to Acetex, a newly-formed Canadian chemical company. The deal is part of the French group's strategy of moving out of low-margin basic commodity chemicals. Acetex was recently formed by Mr Brooke Wade, former head and founder of Methanex which has become the world's largest producer of methanol, the raw material used in making acetics. The latter substance is used in textiles, adhesives, paint, perfume and other products. The planned sale includes Rhone-Poulenc's manufacture of acetic acid and monovinyl acetate at Pardies in south-west France with annual capacity of 480,000 tonnes. In addition, there is a franchise to buy the output of Rhone-Poulenc's solvent factories in eastern and central France, which will stay in the French group's hands, and its 40 per cent stake in Erkol, a Spanish company which makes polyvinyl alcohol. Neither Rhone-Poulenc nor Acetex would put a price on the sale, which for the moment excludes the former's smaller acetics business in Brazil. This operation has an annual capacity of 130,000 tonnes of acetic acid and monovinyl acetate. Total turnover of Rhone-Poulenc's European and Brazilian acetics operations is about FFr2bn (Dollars 369m) a year. Acetex said it might be interested in buying the Brazilian operation but this was not under negotiation. Last August, Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman of Rhone-Poulenc, said he hoped by the end of 1995 to sell Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn worth of assets, mainly in basic commodity chemicals, to reinforce the group's presence in specialised higher-value 'performance' products. Yesterday, the company said that although it was the third largest world producer of acetics, it was well behind Hoechst of Germany and British Petroleum, and that to improve its position would require large resources which it preferred to use else- where. Rhone-Poulenc recently announced the sale of its TD1 polyurethane foam business to Arco, the US chemical group. Lex, Page 22</p>

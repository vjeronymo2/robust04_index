			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Witness tells of Walker quandary The integrity of Brent Walker, the property and leisure group, would have suffered if the company had been forced to announce that profits had been wrongly declared, a former non-executive director said at the Old Bailey yesterday. Mr John Lewis, a board member for most of the 1980s, was giving evidence in the trial of Mr George Walker, the company's former chief executive, and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former finance director. The two men, accused of fraudulently boosting the company's profits by Pounds 17m between 1984 and 1987, deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring to falsify accounts. Mr Lewis said that in the 1980s boom, unlike today, property companies were judged less by their profits record and more by their total asset value. He agreed, however, with Mr Peter Rook QC, prosecuting, that the bulk of Brent Walker's property acquisitions were in the late 1980s. Had the company announced in 1988 that earlier profits had been overstated then the markets' reaction would have been adverse, Mr Lewis said. Earlier, Mr Lewis told the court how Brent Walker's banks always put pressure on Mr Walker to use his personal wealth to back the company's expansion. This occurred in cases such as the development of Brighton Marina. Mr Lewis said he had always opposed this policy, arguing it was wrong for a public company to operate in this way. He said: 'Whenever I learnt about it I objected to Mr Walker both on the basis of the company's interest and his own. 'I did not think it was right for a public company with outside shareholders to need to call on one shareholder's resources to support a business proposition. 'It could either stand up or it could not.' Mr Walker ignored his objections. Mr Lewis said: 'I thought he was being silly. I told him that many times. His attitude was that the banks required it and that we could not do the deal without him putting up money - to which my retort was perhaps we should not be doing the deal.' Mr Lewis was the last of 71 witnesses to give evidence in the trial. The jury was told that Mr Aquilina had decided not to go into the witness box to give evidence. The trial continues on Monday with the prosecution's closing speech. The jury is set to retire to consider its verdicts on October 17.</p>

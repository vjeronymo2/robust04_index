			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: VIDEO . . . WHAT'S NEW;  </P> <P> REVIEWS  </P> <P> ***** "Early Summer"  </P> <P> Sony. $59.95.  </P> <P> Shot two years after his masterpiece, "Late Spring" (1949) -- and, like it, a  winner of the Kinema Jumpo "Best Film" poll -- Yasujiro Ozu's drama of a family  in flux, and the elaborate machinations around the betrothal of their eldest  daughter, is very much a variation on a theme. Once again, Setsuko Hara must be  pushed out of the nest to marry. Once again Chishu Ryu does the pushing. Once  again we get a bittersweet sense of loss: the marriage dubious, the family  forever disrupted. Once again, Ozu's script, co-written with constant colleague  Kogo Noda, is a marvel of organic detail and deceptive naturalism. Ozu's late  style -- the serene, easy flow, the smooth succession of floor-level interior  shots, the quietly restrained acting, the mastery of intimate psychology and  the subtle portrayal of Japanese society in transition -- are all in place.  Newcomers to his work, however, may be mystified; they should start with "Late  Spring" or "Tokyo Story."  </P> <P>  Videos are rated on a scale of one star (a loser) to five stars (a classic).  </P> <P> MICHAEL WILMINGTON  </P></p>

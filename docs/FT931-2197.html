			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Russia in Turmoil: 'I am counting on understanding for my actions' The following are extracts from President Boris Yeltsin's address to the nation on Saturday. 'In June 1991 you elected me President, entrusted the government of the Russian Federation state to me. Then, for the first time in the thousand-year history of the country, a choice was made, a choice of head of state and a choice of the path which Russia should follow. 'The choice was extremely tough and responsible - either, as before, head down the communist dead end, or begin deep reforms so as to take the road of progress, along which all civilised humanity is moving. . . 'The Congress is trying to limit the president, his strivings to give land to the people and to preserve Russia. Possibilities of a search for accord with the conservative majority of the deputies' body are completely exhausted. . . 'The Congress refused to listen to the voice of the country, it refuted the opinion of the overwhelming majority of voters, but the Congress is not the state, the Congress is not Russia. 'In these conditions the president is obliged to take on himself the responsibility for the fate of the country. On me as president lies the state obligation, in the conditions of major changes which Russia is undergoing now, to furnish observation of the very bases of the constitution, and first and foremost of people's power, federalism, the division of powers, and human rights and freedoms. . . 'I have given the order to the Ministry of Defence not to allow the use of the army for political ends. 'I confirm that henceforth concern about the armed forces, about servicemen will be one of the most important tasks of the Russian state. I especially want to stress that my order guarantees the observation of human rights in its full measure. . . 'Esteemed citizens of Russia, I will be frank: I am minded to act resolutely. I think that there is no other way in the situation that has taken shape. 'If political squabbling is not halted, if no resolute measures are taken to resolve the political crisis, if no powerful momentum is given to the economic reforms, the country will be pushed into anarchy. Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Council of Ministers, has been instructed to present, within two days, a list of priority economic measures. 'The list should provide first for measures to resolve the land question; a simple and understandable mechanism for handing land over to citizens as private property is needed. 'I am counting on the support of the country's main political groupings. I shall continue my dialogue with them on a draft for a new constitution and implementation of economic reforms, and on how they can work together with the government. 'Esteemed fellow citizens, I am proposing a way out of the crisis that is civilised and based on the fundamental tenets of the constitution, without extreme or arbitrary measures, without tanks or barricades, without street rallies or strikes. 'You yourselves, the citizens of Russia, will decide everything by your vote. This will be your choice, the choice of the people. I am counting on understanding for my actions and I ask you to support your president. I believe I have your support.'</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: PM denies rift with Lamont over finance MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday insisted that a re-elected Conservative government could combine the return to a balanced budget with modest year-on-year reductions in taxation. As the state of the country's public finances remained at the centre of the election debate, the prime minister rejected suggestions that he was at odds with his chancellor over the outlook. Mr Major insisted that Mr Lamont's warning earlier this week about the very limited scope for either tax reductions or public spending increases had been directed at Labour's spending plans. Mr Lamont said on the BBC's Election Call programme yesterday that the government could extend the new 20p rate to more taxpayers during the next parliament by making small adjustments to the rate band that would be less expensive than the Pounds 2.3bn it would cost to cut the 25p basic income tax rate by one 1p. Although he repeated his view that the government's financial room for manoeuvre was limited, he said that there was some room in the government's plans published at the time of the Budget for a modest cut in the basic rate of tax later in the 1990s. However there was not sufficient scope for Labour's spending programme, which he had costed at Pounds 38bn. Mr Major dismissed the gloomy report by the accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, prepared for The Independent newspaper. He said a resumption of growth in the economy would take the public sector back to 'broad balance' by the end of the next parliament. The suggestion in the report that a Conservative government might be obliged to raise income tax in order to balance the budget rested on economic assumptions not accepted by the government. Mr Lamont reaffirmed his commitment to balancing the budget over the business cycle and was optimistic Britain would return to the growth rates of the 1980s. He admitted that the UK's national debt would increase slightly in the next few years but insisted Britain had a very low ratio of debt to gross domestic product compared with other EC states. He was 'very determined' to achieve a balanced budget and would maintain tight control over public spending. He also forecast that unemployment would fall and that the economy would once again grow as fast as it did in the 1980s. Speaking on Channel 4 News last night, Mr Lamont pledged that there would be no tax increases - either direct or indirect  - within two years of a Conservative government returning to power. He said: 'We will not have to increase taxes. I cannot see any circumstances in which that would be necessary. I believe our borrowing will fall as the economy recovers.'</p>

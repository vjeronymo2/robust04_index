			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL REPORT THE DROUGHT;  </P> <P> MANY CITIES SAVE WATER WITHOUT PENALTIES  </P> <P> As the Los Angeles City Council prepares to vote Friday on a mandatory  water-rationing ordinance, many Southern California cities already are  conserving an average of 12% by using less stringent water-saving approaches,  according to the giant Metropolitan Water District.  </P> <P> From San Diego to Glendale, water officials reported that usage has dropped by  8% to 16% under largely voluntary programs since officials asked residents four  months ago to conserve water in the face of a fourth year of drought  conditions.  </P> <P> In Orange County, consumption was down 5% to 8% during June, compared to the  same month last year and following adjustments for population growth and  temperature differences, according to the Municipal Water District of Orange  County.  </P> <P> Even without rationing, Los Angeles' current program is one of the most  successful, with consumption down 15.5% during June compared to the same month  in 1986, according to the city Department of Water and Power.  </P> <P> The success of voluntary programs -- and limited mandatory restrictions such as  bans on daytime lawn watering and hosing down driveways -- has convinced the  largest water agencies in the Southland that rationing is not necessary this  year, according to interviews Monday.  </P> <P> "You've got to use the carrot before the stick," said Carl Boronkay, general  manager of the MWD, which serves 27 agencies stretching from Ventura to the  Mexican border. "Save the stick if you think we can accomplish this without it  . . . and I think we will."  </P> <P> The MWD has asked water agencies to cut water use 10% this year to make up for  a projected shortage in supplies.  </P> <P> But water agencies have been using about 12% less, according to an MWD study  obtained by The Times.  </P> <P> In Orange County, several water agencies report that customers are heeding the  call for voluntary conservation. The Moulton Niguel Water District in Laguna  Niguel, for example, reported that it has experienced a 10% reduction in usage  for both the months of May and June.  </P> <P> "You have to be deaf, dumb and blind not to realize there is a water problem,"  said Jim Smith, director of operations for the district that covers much of  South Orange County. "I think people are being very conscious how they use  water."  </P> <P> At the Irvine Ranch Water District in Irvine, officials say the public's  response to voluntary conservation is evidenced by the fact that customers have  snapped up about 1,000 water awareness kits in recent weeks. Many more  customers are also asking for water audits to see how they can better conserve,  said Joyce Gwidt, public relations manager for the district.  </P> <P> In Long Beach, Water Department General Manager Dan Davis said residents are  conserving at about the 10% level, when figures are adjusted for population  growth and weather changes. In addition, the city gets about 7% of its water  supply from reclaimed sewage.  </P> <P> "We're encouraged that the water conservation ethic is here," said Davis. "Long  Beach has certainly done its part. . . . If everyone else does, we'll get  through this year."  </P> <P> And Davis, like most other Southern California water officials interviewed,  said he believes they can get through the year without rationing.  </P> <P> Bradley has called on the MWD to follow his lead and encourage its members  agencies to adopt rationing programs, but even Los Angeles' eight  representatives on the MWD board of directors have ignored the mayor's call.  </P> <P> Some Los Angeles directors have approached Boronkay informally about the  rationing idea, but they dropped it in the face of apparent strong opposition  from the other member agencies.  </P> <P> "We just know it would never pass," said Marilyn Garcia, a Bradley appointee to  the board.  </P> <P> So far, in this fourth year of drought, rationing has been implemented in only  a few hard-hit areas of Southern California that have special water supply  problems, such as Santa Barbara and San Clemente.  </P> <P> Many central Coast cities not connected to the state water project have adopted  rationing, and in the north, San Francisco implemented rationing several months  ago.  </P> <P> Los Angeles would be the first city in the south with a ample supply of water  for this year to adopt rationing. Initially, Bradley warned residents that if  they did not cut use by 10%, they would face rationing.  </P> <P> Since that first call in April, city residents have responded, according to  figures complied by the DWP. Besides the 15.5% cut in June, water use dropped  11.7% in May and 12.2% in April, compared to the same months in 1986.  </P> <P> But Bradley has pressed for rationing, arguing that residents will backslide  once the issue drops off the front pages and evening news programs. "It will be  impossible to keep up the steady drum beat of publicity," said Mark Fabiani,  Bradley's chief of staff. And besides, he said, if saving 10% is so easy, only  those who are not cooperating will be snared by the program's surcharges.  </P> <P> Under Bradley's proposal, residents would be limited to using 90% of the water  they used in comparable periods of 1986 -- before the drought and  city-sponsored conservation efforts began.  </P> <P> Residents and businesses using more than their allotment would face a surcharge  of $3 per billing unit of excess use, plus 15% of the water bill on the first  violation. A second violation would cost $3 dollars per billing unit, plus 25%  of the bill, and a third violation would boost the surcharge to $4 per excess  billing unit and 75% of the bill. A billing unit is 748 gallons; the average  family uses between 300 and 500 gallons a day.  </P> <P> Implementation of rationing would cost more than $1 million dollars and all  residents would face a 9-cent per billing unit increase -- about $2 to the  average residential bill -- to cover the costs of the program and the reduced  water sales.  </P> <P> With rationing, Fabiani said, Los Angeles will be better prepared than the rest  of the Southland should the drought drag on into a fifth year. A 10% cut this  year, he said, may keep the city from having to adopt a 25% rationing plan next  year if the drought continues.  </P> <P> The prospect of rationing has kept the issue in front of residents and  contributed to the high rate of conservation, Fabiani said.  </P> <P> Ironically, the two largest Southland cities -- San Diego and Los Angeles --  have the highest rates of conservation and have achieved them through opposite  approaches.  </P> <P> Los Angeles has carried the banner for mandatory rationing, arguing that it  will be necessary in the long run.  </P> <P> Boronkay of the MWD, which wholesales water to both agencies, said Monday, "We  just want the goal accomplished. However that is done is OK with us."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Jim Carlton contributed to this report.  </P></p>

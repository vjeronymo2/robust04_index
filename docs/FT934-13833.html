			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Sweden buys firs from Shropshire TIMBER farmers in Shropshire and the Welsh borders have secured a 'coals to Newcastle' export deal with an order from Sweden for fir trees, the Forestry Commission said yesterday. Rundvirke Stab, a pole manufacturer, turned to the UK for supplies of Douglas firs because Scandinavian producers do not have trees large enough. The company, which needs the timber for 80ft poles to support power lines, has placed an order worth Pounds 75,000 with Forest Enterprises, the business arm of the commission.</p>

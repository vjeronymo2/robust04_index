			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais restructures management Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French bank, is restructuring its international management team as part of the new strategy being implemented by Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman. Mr Peyrelevade, who last month announced details of the loss-making bank's FFr44.9bn (Dollars 7.7bn) govern-ment-backed rescue deal, has created new positions at the top of its operations in the UK, US and Japan. Mr Bernard Darmayan, former head of Credit Lyonnais' currency activities in Paris, takes charge of its UK business. Mr Robert Cohen becomes head of its US operations and Mr Bernard Mignucci adopts the same role in Japan. Both Mr Cohen and Mr Mignucci were previously general managers of Credit Lyonnais in those countries. Meanwhile Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, whom Mr Peyrelevade replaced last autumn as chairman of Credit Lyonnais, yesterday appealed to the Conseil d'Etat, the government body, to challenge the legality of his dismissal last week as chairman of the Credit National banking group.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: J P Morgan-Banesto connection probed US congressional investigators have launched an inquiry into the involvement of J. P. Morgan's Corsair Fund with Banesto, and are questioning the overall safety of 'vulture funds' that invest in troubled banks, writes George Graham in Washington. Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House of Representatives banking committee, wrote this week to Mr Dennis Weatherstone, chairmanof J. P. Morgan, and to Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, to demand an explanation of Corsair's links with Banesto and of how the Fed supervises bank vulture funds. 'The Corsair Fund was the first vulture fund approved by the Federal Reserve, and it invested solely in a bank that later failed. The committee wants to know exactly what happened to Corsair's investment in order to determine if future vulture funds should be approved,' Mr Gonzalez said. Morgan describes Corsair as a long-term investor in undervalued banks and financial institutions, not as a vulture fund, which usually buys the securities of companies already in trouble. Corsair invested Dollars 175m in Banesto. Mr Gonzalez has already launched an investigation into a Dollars 255m deposit with Banesto made by US Central Credit Union, a Kansas-based institution which actsas a sort of central bank to other credit unions.</p>

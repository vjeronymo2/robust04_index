			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Ingham at Pounds 1.9m and plans car parts growth Ingham, the York-based motor parts, worsted spinning and property group, reported profits of Pounds 1.91m for the year to March 31 on turnover of Pounds 25.3m. The car parts division contributed profits of Pounds 1.47m and turnover of Pounds 19.2m despite the recession and a move to wholesale sales which cut margins. The company is seeking to expand the division through acquisitions. In the previous period, for the 15 months to March 31 1993, group profits were Pounds 838,000 on turnover of Pounds 11.2m. However, the two companies making up the parts division were not acquired until September 1992 and May 1993. The company said the spinning company enjoyed a much better year and property was showing signs of improvement. Earnings per share were 8.2p (8.9p). A proposed final dividend of 3.25p makes a 5p total, against 6p for 15 months.</p>

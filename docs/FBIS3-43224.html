In an interview with AFP on 29 December, the  French cooperation minister commented on the political situation  in Congo. He said, among other things, that there are no  national armed forces in Congo and described as unbearable the  fact that French nationals living in Brazzavile are being  harassed.    Michel Roussin asked President Pascal Lissouba to take the  necessary measures in order to show his abilities as a leader.  The reaction was swift. The Congolese Foreign Ministry  described the statement as discourteous. Francis Tamalax has  details:    [Begin Tamalax recording] At a time when national forces  need  to harmonize their actions with the mediation activities of our  friends, (Machiavel Tadikisa Massanga), spokesman for the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that Congo was surprised at  the unfriendly attitude of a French political authority. This  attitude introduces a discordant note in the good relations  existing between Congo and France. Brazzaville nonetheless has  reiterated its faith by taking care of its friends during the  disturbances experienced by the country, notably France, whose  political commitment in favor of Congo has never wavered. The  Congolese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said that, except for  some minor incidents that it regrets and strongly condemns,  foreigners living in Congo have been safe from the violence  which led to the deaths of about 80 people in the south of  Brazzaville, the capital, from 10 to 14 December. [end  recording]    One of the consequences of the political violence in Congo  is  the fear that is gripping French nationals. In recent days  several French nationals, including two diplomats, have been  attacked or mistreated by unknown individuals in Brazzaville.  About 30 French technical assistants are planning to leave  Congo in the coming days and will follow about 40 others who  recently left the Congolese capital with their families and  possessions.    On the economic level, things are no better. The disruption  in rail traffic between Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire following  the political violence has resulted in an increase in prices for  essential goods and the scarcity of some products in the  Congolese capital. Bread is becoming scarce due to a scarcity of  flour, and the price has risen from 50 to 75 CFA francs.  Similarly, a portion of cassava, usually sold for 500 CFA  francs, now costs 1500 CFA francs at the city's largest market.  Chinchards, the sea fish that is the most widely consumed by  Congolese, can no longer be found. The price of a kilo of rice  has doubled from 200 to 400 CFA francs, and bananas have  disappeared from most markets. These scarcities are attributed  to the proliferation of black market deals organized by Zairians  who cross the river in canoes loaded with cassava flour.    Apart from foodstuffs, Zairian clandestine fuel traders,  nicknamed al-Qadhdhafis, sell fuel at 1000 CFA francs per liter,  compared to the 300 CFA francs on the official market.    Congo-Ocean railroad traffic, the only permanent link  between  the capital and the Pointe-Noire port -- the main economic  center of the country -- has been interrupted for 10 days.  Opposition supporters have erected barricades on the rails to  denounce political violence in the Congolese capital.</p>

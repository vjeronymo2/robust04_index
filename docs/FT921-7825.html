			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Rabin set to take over as party chief MR YITZHAK RABIN last night toppled Mr Shimon Peres in a contest for the leadership of Israel's opposition Labour party. He was set to head Labour's challenge to the ruling Likud party of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in the June 23 general election. Labour party officials said unofficial results showed Mr Rabin had won 40.6 per cent of the votes cast in a ballot of party membership, just beating the 40 per cent barrier needed for outright victory in the first round. Mr Peres won 34.5 per cent. Final confirmation of the result will not be announced until later today, but there appeared little doubt Mr Rabin had won. Mr Rabin is a former prime minister who lost the party leadership to Mr Peres in 1977. Mr Peres said last night he accepted the party's decision and congratulated his longtime rival, who has consistently been shown by opinion polls to be capable of turning around Labour's dismal record in recent elections. In a tense evening at Labour headquarters in Tel Aviv, Mr Mr Rabin several times saw his support tip over the 40 per cent barrier that he had to pass to avoid a run-off election against Mr Peres on February 26. Several times it slipped back again, before firming up. Two other candidates, Mr Israel Kessar, leader of the Histadrut trade union federation, and Mrs Ora Namir, a veteran MP, trailed well behind, with 19 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively. Opinion polls have consistently shown that under Mr Rabin, Labour would have a much greater chance of closing the gap of some five points by which it trails the ruling Likud party of Prime Minister Shamir. Mr Shamir himself faces a challenge to his leadership of the ruling Likud party tonight from Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, and Mr Ariel Sharon, the housing minister.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISTRIAL RULED IN ASSAULT ON JOHN WAYNE'S DAUGHTER  </P> <P> A mistrial was declared Thursday in the case of Dr. Thomas A. Gionis, a  physician charged with ordering an assault on his ex-wife, the daughter of the  late actor John Wayne.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Christopher J. Evans said that because nine of the 12 jurors voted for  conviction, he intends to prosecute Gionis again.  </P> <P> "It shows I am still innocent," Gionis said after the deadlock.  </P> <P> Prosecutors contend Gionis wanted to "teach a lesson" to Aissa Wayne on the eve  of a 1988 custody trial over their two-year-old daughter.  </P> <P> The three holdout jurors said the prosecution's case was damaged when a  district attorney's investigator admitted on the witness stand that "it looked  like" he perjured himself in testimony about Gionis' whereabouts before the  assault.  </P> <P> Sharron Cooley of Anaheim, one of the holdouts, said, "had (his) information  been accurate, it would have been a very easy case."  </P> <P> One of the jurors who voted to convict blamed the mistrial on "just a couple of  opinionated people" who "threw reason out the window." The juror declined to  give her name.  </P></p>

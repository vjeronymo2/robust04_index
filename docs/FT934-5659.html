			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Observer: Grecian earn Beware of gift-bearing-Greeks, particularly politicians. Constantine Mitsotakis, no longer Greece's prime minister but merely a humble backbencher, is getting a grilling over who or what provided his impressive private collection of antiquities. While in office his daughter - Dora Bakoyiannis - served as culture minister, fending off archaeologists' allegations that part of her father's collection of Minoan vases and Cretan jewellery - more than 1,000 items - derived from a looted ancient cemetery. Mitsotakis probably won't face formal accusations of antiquity stealing; since 1979 he has had a private collector's licence. But Melina Mercouri - she of the 1980s campaign to get the British Museum to return the Elgin Marbles to Greece - is now the new culture minister. Mercouri is renewing the Elgin war; and she is also investigating the Mitsotakis mystery.</p>

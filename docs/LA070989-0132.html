			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OLD SOAP FACTORY BEGINS FALLING TO WRECKING BALL  </P> <P> The empty shell of the old Procter &amp; Gamble soap factory met its date with  the wrecking ball last week. Chunks of concrete, clung together by steel  reinforcing rods, began falling amid dust and rubble as a wrecking crew went to  work. Below, Mike Gilliland of Bragg Crane Service makes sure the wrecking ball  is securely fastened to its cable. The 34-acre property on West 7th Street has  been sold to the Port of Long Beach and is being cleared for a new shipping  terminal.  </P> <P> The factory was built in 1930 and opened in 1931. Its first product was  Flakewhite shortening, followed by Oxydol and Dash soaps. The plant survived  the Long Beach earthquake in 1933 and steadily expanded its capacity and  products through the years, reaching its height in the early 1980s when the  average daily production was 22,000 boxes of synthetic detergents, 13,000 cases  of bar soap and 14,000 cases of food products. But on June 19, 1987,  announcement was made that the plant would close, a victim of company economic  strategy influenced by brand shifts, deregulation and competition from more and  better manufacturing technologies. Procter &amp; Gamble ceased operations on  Oct. 2, 1988. Demolition by Diamond Pacific Co. is estimated to take about five  months.  </P></p>

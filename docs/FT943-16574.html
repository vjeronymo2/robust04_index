			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Games Blockbuster plays In the mid-1980s, two friends working in a garage could produce a perfectly acceptable video game. Today, says Robert Devereux, chairman of Virgin Communications, teams of 12 to 20 people have to work on games for up to 18 months. Devereux says: 'We very rarely develop anything for less than a seven figure sum. We've got Dollars 40m of product in development at the moment. You can make half a dozen mid-priced movies for that.' Devereux's company is developing a basketball video game called Hoops. It will have 19,000 frames of animation. The data storage systems required for these games are increasingly complex and expensive, he says. The escalating cost of making video games is one of the reasons why Devereux welcomes last week's announcement that Blockbuster Entertainment of the US is to increase its stake in Virgin Interactive Entertainment (VIE), Virgin's video software subsidiary, from 20 per cent to 75 per cent. VIE develops games and entertainment software compatible with Sega and Nintendo hardware systems. It also devises games for personal computer and compact disc read-only memory (CD-Rom) systems. It will shortly release games based on the Walt Disney film of the Jungle Book and the animated feature movie the Lion King. Blockbuster, which is the world's biggest video rental company, is to sell its entire VIE stake to Spelling Entertainment, the Hollywood film production company in which it has a majority stake. Devereux says Blockbuster admits it knows little about the development of video games software. That is why VIE will be owned by Spelling, which is more familiar with entertainment production. The London-based Devereux, who is also in charge of Virgin's television, radio and book publishing activities, will remain chief executive of VIE. Steven Berrard, Blockbuster's president, will become chairman of VIE. The advantages of the link with Blockbuster, Devereux says, are the marketing muscle it will give VIE and the size of the US company's distribution network: 4,250 shops worldwide. Another reason why Devereux says he is pleased to be linking up with Blockbuster is that the video games business is about to enter a difficult period. The first problem is that players are becoming bored with the range of games on offer, he says. The second is that the machines on which the games are played are going to change in ways that will confuse the consumer. The industry is moving from cartridge-based games to CD-Rom. Devereux believes this Christmas will be the last to see substantial sales of the current generation of 16-bit cartridge-based machines. Not all of the large games companies, however, will move on to CD-Rom machines. Sega and Sony will, but Nintendo is bringing out a 64-bit cartridge-based machine. Another growing development, Devereux believes, will be CD-Rom games for personal computers. The fragmentation will make games players reluctant to buy machines until they know which system is likely to survive, he says.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRIVER BAN IS UPHELD BY COURT;  </P> <P> HARNESS RACING: LOS ALAMITOS MAY USE PAST SUCCESS AS YARDSTICK FOR LIMITING  COMPETITION, JUDGE DECIDES.  </P> <P> Federal Judge John G. Davies has denied a request for an injunction that would  allow 13 harness drivers the opportunity to drive at Los Alamitos Race Course.  </P> <P> In an opinion filed Thursday and released Friday, Davies said that Los Alamitos  has the right to bar the drivers from the track.  </P> <P> The drivers had been excluded on the basis of experience and lack of past  success by Lloyd Arnold, Los Alamitos president and part-owner.  </P> <P> "A much more viable concern appears to be the possibility that if the Court  forces Los Alamitos to allow plaintiffs (the drivers) access to the meet as  drivers, the other 130 or so drivers who could not qualify under the new  standards will seek similar relief," the 10-page opinion said. "This would  place an unreasonable burden upon defendant (Los Alamitos), particularly in  light of the possibility the defendant will prevail in the lawsuit."  </P> <P> Richard Craigo, an attorney representing the drivers, said his clients will get  a hearing Friday before the California Horse Racing Board. The drivers will ask  the board to overturn Arnold's decision.  </P> <P> "The blacklisting of these largely minority and economically disadvantaged  drivers, without a semblance of due process of law, was recently upheld in an  action by the state stewards at Los Alamitos," Craigo said. "Incredibly, Judge  Davies' opinion does not even address this critical event. We are confident  that a ruling which so ignores constitutional guarantees cannot previal."  </P> <P> Craigo made reference to a stewards' decision on Jan. 18, whereby Ron Cassini,  who does not meet minimum driver qualifications, was allowed to drive in a  California Sires Stakes race at Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> Fred Kuebler, director of racing at Los Alamitos, said the track would allow  exceptions to drivers who had made advance payments before the driver  qualification standards were announced. In the case of California Sires Stakes  races, the payment is made two years in advance.  </P> <P> Cassini's horse, Typical Anna, finished seventh in a nine-horse field, 27  lengths behind the winner.  </P> <P> Jerry Mandel, who argued the case for Los Alamitos, called Davies' decision  "very well thought out and put together."  </P></p>

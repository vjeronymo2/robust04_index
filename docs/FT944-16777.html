			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Corporate member to sit on Lloyd's ruling body The first representative of the new corporate investors in Lloyd's of London has been elected to the insurance market's rulemaking and disciplinary council. Mr Jonathan Agnew's unopposed election marks a further rise in the influence of corporate capital at Lloyd's - as opposed to individual Names whose assets have traditionally supported the market. Mr Agnew is chairman of London Insurance Market Investment Trust, the largest of the new corporate capital groups at Lloyd's. This year 25 corporate vehicles are underwriting about Pounds 1.6bn of premiums out of the market's total capacity of Pounds 10.9bn. Both the number of corporate vehicles and amount of capital underwritten by corporate representatives are expected to rise next year. An important hurdle will be the application for stock-market listings of 'dedicated' funds, which provide capital for a narrow range of syndicates. So far listed funds have been investment trusts supporting a range of agencies and the syndicates they manage. Mr Agnew, former group chief executive at Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, stressed the importance of a 'diversity' of capital at Lloyd's - including from non-corporate members. Elections for five other places on the council are being contested.</p>

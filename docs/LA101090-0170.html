			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BEN JOHNSON TRADING SPIKES FOR SNOWSHOES?  </P> <P> Ben Johnson may trade his spikes for showshoes -- yes, snowshoes -- and compete  for Canada in the 1990 Nordic sprint championships.  </P> <P> Nick Akers, executive director of the Canadian Amateur Snowshoe Assn., said  Tuesday his group has invited Johnson to compete in the championships in  Edmonton, Alberta, on Dec. 9.  </P> <P> "I think Ben would add a lot of credibility to the sport, because I don't think  you can find any snow-shoers in the world who would come close to him," Akers  said. "We expect Johnson to finish in under 12 seconds."  </P> <P> American Scott Hannay holds the 100-meter snowshoe record: 15.06 seconds.  </P> <P> Johnson was stripped of the gold medal in the 100 meters in the Seoul Olympics  after testing positive for anabolic steroids.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Rejoinder" by V. Tikhonov, Category I economist in the </F> Glazunovskiy Rayon Administration Financial Department, Orel  Oblast, rayon Duma deputy, and member of the Russian Journalists  Union: "Stroyev Appoints Everyone"]    [Text] Orel Oblast -- ...There was an announcement on  oblast morning radio that Orel Governor Yegor Stroyev had  confirmed the authority of a number of rayon adminstration heads  and their combining of their functions with those of chairmen of  the newly elected rayon dumas. This undoubtedly should have  been expected in line with the statute on local self-government  in Orel Oblast for the transitional period. However,  "appointmentism" on such a scale as we have in our oblast grated  even on people who have seen a thing or two. A few hours later  oblast administration spokesman V. Sosunov read out the above  order at the first session of our rayon duma and announced that  there would not even be any formal elections of the head of the  rayon duma. I'll be jiggered! As far as usurping power is  concerned the oblast administration has even outdone the old  party organs, which also appointed the leaders of the soviets.    However, we must primarily blame ourselves for all that has  happened. I consider my mistake to have been voting for Ye.  Stroyev twice in the past -- in the elections for oblast  administration head and in the Federal Assembly election. A  party apparatchik with a long service record will hardly be able  so easily to abandon the old stereotypes in his behavior.    Common sense suggests that the people's deputies should meet  often in order to resolve pressing problems in people's lives  and carry out voters' instructions. But it is hard to predict  how the so-called duma chairman, who has been appointed (he is,  after all, the head of the administration), will like this. So  it only remains to envy the former rayon soviet of people's  deputies until a law on local self-government is adopted (unless  it echoes the Orel instructions).</p>

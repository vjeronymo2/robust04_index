			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Ukraine election declared valid Ukraine's first post-Soviet parliamentary elections were declared valid yesterday as fears of voter apathy proved unfounded. As Ukrainians flocked to polling booths, preliminary turnout returns showed that voting surpassed the 50 per cent threshold to make the election valid in more than 310 of the 350 constituencies which held a final-stage ballot yesterday. Ninety MPs had already been elected in previous rounds for the 450-seat legislative body which began on March 27. Although about 75 per cent of the electorate voted in the first round, voter turnout was an important issue in the campaign. President Leonid Kravchuk's aides predicted that voter apathy would elect less than a quorum of 300 MPs and enable Mr Kravchuk to establish direct presidential rule. 'A parliament will be formed,' said Mr Ivan Yemetz, chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, on television last night. Although results were not expected until today, the parliament's composition is likely to be divided between Moscow-leaning communists and allies and western-oriented nationalists, along with an equally large group of independents. Casting his ballot yesterday morning, Mr Kravchuk reiterated his intention to delay presidential elections, scheduled for June, until the new parliament defined presidential powers. Throughout the capital, Kiev, voter turnout fell short of the 50 per cent threshold despite the closing-hour extensions granted to polling stations. Only eight of its 21 constituencies elected MPs. Contrary to expectations, the independence-seeking region of Crimea and its Russian-dominated Black Sea fleet base of Sevastopol elected all but one of its 23 MPs to the Kiev parliament.</p>

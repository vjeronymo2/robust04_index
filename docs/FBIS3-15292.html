Unlike the Russian Constitution, the Republic of Komi's  Constitution was adopted not by referendum but at a session of  the Supreme Soviet. The republic is remaining Soviet because  the legislative organ will be called the State Soviet. The  Constitution introduces a new concept -- the "head of the  republic" ["glava respubliki"]. The drafters of the  Constitution rejected the term "president" in the belief that  there should be only one president in Russia. Furthermore, in  the referendum the republic's population indirectly opposed the  post of president. The new Komi Constitution envisages private  ownership of land and a state guarantee of free medical aid and  proclaims two state languages on the republic's territory --  Komi and Russian.</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / International Bonds: NatWest securitisation move marks new era for banks NATIONAL Westminster Bank's announcement that it will sell part of its corporate loan book through the US securities market could mark the start of a new phase of innovation by European banks. The technique, called securitisation, is by no means new to European financial institutions. Mortgage lenders have been securitising home loans since the early 1980s - the sterling mortgage-backed bond market amounts to around Pounds 10bn. Other financial assets such as car loans have also been repackaged and sold in the form of securities. However, NatWest will become the first UK bank to securitise loans to companies. According to experts in structured finance, other types of financial asset will be securitised soon in Europe. 'Mortgage lending has slowed dramatically so there is less pressure to securitise mortgages. Banks are turning their attention to securitising other types of asset,' commented Mr Steve Din, structured finance analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, in London. Other than commercial bank loans, trade receivables - debt owed to non-bank companies in the normal course of trading - and leases are the most likely candidates for securitisation. Earlier this year GPA, the aircraft finance company which recently cancelled its planned flotation, made a pioneering issue of bonds backed by aircraft leases. Securitisation of leases on 'small ticket' items - anything from coffee machines to photocopiers - is also possible. On April 30, the Bank of England issued new regulations for the securitisation of credit card receivables, opening the way for banks to securitise another category of risk assets. The theory behind securitisation is simple: risk is transferred from the holder of a financial asset, such as a loan or a lease, to the holders of securities backed by that asset. Since the risk is transferred, the original lender can remove the asset from its balance sheet. In addition, it raises cheap finance by issuing secured bonds which can be used to fund new loans. The drawback is that securitising assets is a complex and expensive process. The NatWest structure involves a Delaware-based special purpose vehicle buying sub-participations in corporate loans from the bank, via a Cayman Islands subsidiary. The special purpose company, Thames Funding, will then issue commercial paper backed by the loans. It is a matter for debate whether corporate borrowers should be concerned that their loans are being securitised. NatWest said last week that informal discussions with companies revealed no objections to the idea. After all, banks already sell loans in the secondary market - in Europe usually by selling sub-participations to other banks. The NatWest securitisation works on the same principle, except that the risk is transferred one stage further by the issue of asset-backed commercial paper. However, not all corporate treasurers take a favourable view of either the secondary market in loans or securitisation. Some large UK companies specify in their terms of borrowing that the lender must not sell sub-participations to other banks. One concern is that the company can end up dealing with a large number of banks which it did not even know were lenders. 'A company goes to a big bank because it wants a relationship. If sell-down isn't handled very carefully a simple bilateral loan can come to resemble a complex multi-option facility,' said the treasurer of one large UK industrial company. Although the commercial paper issued by Thames Funding will be issued in the US and is denominated in dollars, NatWest has the option of securitising loans made in sterling or other European currencies, so long as the currency risk is fully hedged. Loans to up to 10 nominated companies can be securitised through Thames Funding, although NatWest does not intend to announce which companies are involved. The commercial paper has been rated A-1 by S&amp;P and P-1 by Moody's Investors Service, on the grounds that all of the 10 companies in the securitisation pool also carry this top short-term rating. This suggests that NatWest will choose to securitise low margin loans to big corporations, liberating capital to make new loans at a higher margin. There are some complications. For example, if a company repays one of the loans early, NatWest must bridge the gap until the matching commercial paper is retired. The maximum maturity of commercial paper under the programme is 95 days, so in the worst case NatWest might have to pay interest on CP for three months while receiving no income from the underlying loan. Despite the cost of setting up the structure and some of the hidden risks, NatWest concluded that securitising corporate loans was worth the investment. Faced with similar circumstances, other European banks are likely to reach the same conclusion. Certainly every UK clearing bank has a team of corporate financiers looking at securitisation. It is easy to see why. By taking securitised assets off balance sheet, banks are able to make more loans. Since the risk has been transferred to bond holders, capital which backed the securitised loan is free to back new lending. National Westminster has a capital-to-assets ratio comfortably above the 8 per cent level demanded by international banking regulations. However, capital has become a scarce commodity. In the longer term, securitisation looks likely to become an important method of balance sheet management for banks. Regulators appear happy with the technique, so long as there is no danger of securitised assets unexpectedly returning to the balance sheet. Accountants are less sure. Last October, the UK Accounting Standards Board proposed that securitised assets should not be taken off balance sheet where the original lender retains an 'economic interest' in the loans. Such a ruling would cover nearly all securitisations, since the originator of the loan does maintain a clear economic interest - through its continued relationship with the borrower and the administration of the loan, usually for a fee. The ASB admits to receiving a great deal of adverse comment. It will put forward further proposals in the autumn. But whatever it decides, UK banks are looking hard at the economic case for securitisation and starting to conclude that the long-term benefits outweigh the immediate costs.</p>

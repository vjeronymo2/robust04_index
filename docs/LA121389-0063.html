			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL BOYARSKY: AVOIDING THE MEDFLY DISASTER  </P> <P> An important part of a politician's routine is inspecting the damage after  fires, floods, landslides or other disasters.  </P> <P> I've followed them past burned houses and mud-filled yards, taking notes on  their expressions of horror and sympathy and promises of assistance.  </P> <P> Their words are predictable and likely to produce no results, and reporters  feel stupid having to record them. But the attention of a President, a  governor, a mayor or a county supervisor may bring temporary comfort to the  victims. And the politician likes the publicity.  </P> <P> Now we have a disaster the politicians avoid. It's the Mediterranean fruit fly  -- and the resulting aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion on large areas  of Southern Los Angeles and northern Orange counties.  </P> <P> It's been with us for weeks. Unlike the 1981 infestation, when then-Gov. Edmund  G. Brown Jr. delayed spraying, this time it began quickly, over an  89-square-mile area around Dodger Stadium and in the San Fernando and San  Gabriel valleys. That didn't stop the Medfly. The spray area was expanded, and  many more aerial sprayings are scheduled.  </P> <P> The stakes are great. If those flies move over the Tehachapis, the huge  agricultural business in the Central Valley will be threatened. There are  political considerations as well. Agribusiness is a powerful force in state  politics and its business allies in the Southland -- banks, food retailers and  others -- have great clout in local affairs.  </P> <P> Environmental groups are opposed to the spraying. Although officials say the  doses of the pesticide are comparatively small, opponents protest that  malathion is especially damaging when there are frequent sprayings over a large  residential area. These environmental groups have political power.  </P> <P> With the political impact potentially so great, and emotions so intense, it is  understandable that political leaders would be more cautious in dealing with  the Medfly than when confronting a brush fire.  </P> <P> Caution is fine. But not invisibility.  </P> <P> Where's George Deukmejian? He favors the spraying. Why isn't he walking the  streets of those San Gabriel Valley communities that gave him such handsome  margins in 1986, telling them that malathion is a painful but perfectly safe  and necessary medicine?  </P> <P> What about Tom Bradley? Why hasn't he been in Echo Park or East Los Angeles,  reassuring anxious constituents? The county supervisors have not been  especially visible.  </P> <P> Political pros have an explanation: Jerry Brown. He got mixed up with the  Medfly when he was governor in 1981 and lost the Senate election the following  year. The Medfly is a loser, they say. Stay away. Let the scientists handle the  little devils.  </P> <P> That's government by public opinion polling. It's a widely criticized practice,  but elected officials seem to be following it.  </P> <P> Deukmejian's aides said he's leaving it in the hands of his agriculture  department. I called Bradley's office to ask who was watching the spraying. The  press secretary, Bill Chandler, didn't know, but said he'd get back to me. When  he did, he said the Medfly was mainly a state and county agricultural  department matter. Inquiries, he said, are sent over to the county.  </P> <P> There wasn't much satisfaction from two of the county supervisors whose  districts include substantial parts of the sprayed areas in the San Gabriel  Valley. Assistants to Pete Schabarum and Mike Antonovich said their bosses were  letting state and county agricultural officials handle it. All three offices  assured me they had had very few complaints.  </P> <P> Certainly, as the spraying has increased, more public officials are speaking  out. The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday asked the state to take another  look at the spraying and examine alternatives. Supervisor Ed Edelman, who also  represents sprayed areas, has wondered if the operation has gone too far. Other  local officials and state legislators are getting concerned.  </P> <P> The strongest opponent is the mayor of Monterey Park, Pat Reichenberg. The  helicopters spray malathion over her hilltop cul de sac of one-story homes. She  says most people in Monterey Park oppose the pesticide spraying. But  Reichenberg and the others are not powers with a broad constituency, as are the  governor, the mayor and the supervisors. They lack the authority of the  governor and the supervisors over the spraying itself. And they don't have  Bradley's ability to carry his message to many people.  </P> <P> Looking back on it, history may find that Jerry Brown's personal conduct during  the last Medfly invasion was quite admirable. He wasn't sure the pesticide was  safe. So he delayed the spraying as long as he could.  </P> <P> He may have been wrong. But he didn't hide behind agricultural officials. And  if we didn't like it, at least we knew who to blame.  </P></p>

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Arts: Slave to the cult of celebrity - The portraits of star photographer Annie Leibovitz The over-muscled torso of Sylvester Stallone, which adorns a recent cover of Vanity Fair, neatly illustrates both the best and worst aspects of Annie Leibovitz's portraiture. As a brash, eye-catching incentive to purchase, it is unsurpassed. On every other level, it is a sham. Stallone poses nude as Rodin's The Thinker, although the gushing coverline, 'Sly's Body of Art', stresses his physical, rather than any cerebral, attributes. Inside, further pictures credit a stylist, set designer, hair and make-up artists, plus there are honourable mentions for 'jeans by Gianni Versace and sheets by Ralph Lauren'. This is not so much an exposition of the actor's psyche as a highly orchestrated fashion shoot. None of which would matter unless a major retrospective at the National Portrait Gallery, 'Annie Leibovitz Photographs 1970-1990', did not invite us to view such work as having artistic value. Leibovitz herself makes the distinction between her magazine work for Vanity Fair and Rolling Stone, which makes up the bulk of the show, and her lucrative assignments for American Express and The Gap. These she excludes on the grounds that they are merely advertising, but there is little difference, either pictorially or commercially, between a photograph of John Cleese endorsing a credit card and last month's Vanity Fair cover of Roseanne Arnold, which provided timely publicity for the publication of the actress's autobiography. Leibovitz has been contributing to the magazine for more than a decade, during which time she has become court photographer to the nobility of popular culture. Her slick, colour portraits of actors, singers and sportsmen in mildly provocative, staged poses have resurrected the magazine's circulation figures and have already drawn more than 1m people to this exhibition, which is touring Europe and the US. But in helping to foster this cult of celebrity, Leibovitz has become its slave. Just as Norman Parkinson was limited by royal protocol, so Leibovitz faces similar restrictions from agents employed to perpetuate their clients' personal mythology. In a Hollywood, where publicists call the shots and journalists are blacklisted for penning unfavourable reviews, she would be unwise not to acquiesce. Faced with this restraint on creativity, Leibovitz relies on a variety of concepts to inject life into the proceedings - Clint Eastwood is bound with ropes; Goldie Hawn perches on an elephant's trunk; Jeff Koons is daubed with gold paint from head to toe. Elaborate props and posturing are not necessarily the answer. Her most percipient studies, such as a defiant Ella Fitzgerald or a world-weary Vaclav Havel, are also the least flamboyant. In these, she follows Bill Brandt's timeless advice to 'see the subject first. Do not try to force it to be a picture of this, that or the other thing. Stand apart from it. Then something will happen. The subject will reveal itself'. There is certainly revelation in Leibovitz's portraits; though not in the way Brandt intended. Like Stallone, many of her subjects strip off for her lens, as if bared chests can be a substitute for bared souls. Too often, Leibovitz seems enthralled by her subjects, willing to pander to their outsized egos. The exhibition is littered with subjects, crying out to be satirised, who instead inhabit irony-free zones. Even those emblems of excess, Liberace and Donald Trump, pictured in all their glorious ostentation, suffer only self-inflicted wounds. In her defence, Leibovitz has suggested that 'the surface can be as revealing as anything else and sometimes that's all there is. With some people it's not going to get any further'. A valid point, but by allowing her subjects so much control of the image, she only adds lustre to this surface. (Michael Jackson even gave advice on how to light him in the most flattering manner.) Leibovitz calls such methods collaboration; collusion might be more accurate. Of course, she is by no means the first photographer to contribute to the smooth running of Hollywood's publicity machine. Angus McBean confessed to removing freckles and blemishes from his 1930s portraits of Vivien Leigh, but drew the line at the practices of US film studio photographers 'who retouched all character from faces in pursuit of apparent perfection'. It was not always thus. During the 1970s, Leibovitz's reportage for Rolling Stone captured the seamier, less airbrushed side of that awkward decade, as she tagged along with debauched rock stars and disgraced presidents. Her portraits of a dissipated Mick Jagger still tingle with the demonic energy of his stage performance. Covering the Watergate scandal, Leibovitz was present on the White House lawn in 1974 as Richard Nixon made his final, ignoble departure by helicopter, guards quickly rolling away the presidential red carpet. These memorable pictures serve as a reproach to a talent gone astray. It is time Leibovitz withdrew her own red carpet treatment for Hollywood's elite; the formula is wearing thin.</p>

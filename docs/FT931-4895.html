			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Uniform CIS pipeline rules urged THE FORMER Soviet Union must agree uniform rules covering its oil pipeline network or billions of dollars of western investment in the country's oil industry will be jeopardised, according to a report by the World Bank. 'Transport issues are first and foremost in deciding western investment. It is crucial that a regime is worked out,' said Mr Richard Hildahl, pipeline expert from Ernst and Young in San Francisco and one of the report's authors. Western companies such as Chevron, British Petroleum and Amoco are considering expenditure of at least Dollars 10bn on pipeline links to export oil from joint ventures in former Soviet republics, but they need a stable framework for transport to be agreed in advance. The break-up of the Soviet Union means that the republics control each part of the national pipeline network that runs across their territory. This leads to varying tariffs for oil transport, increased bureaucracy and frequent rows between republics over payment. Russia has recently finalised a deal after a bitter dispute with the Ukraine over the gas pipeline that runs to western Europe over the Ukraine. Mr Hildahl stresses that it would be fairly easy for the republics to agree a common framework in which the pipeline system could operate. The World Bank recommendations will be presented to Russia's Ministry of Fuel and Power, Transneft, the pipeline company, and all of the republics next month. The report strongly advocates the creation of joint-stock companies for each republic's transit system. In this way, the republics could then swap shares in their local pipeline network for shares in Russia's Transneft. The cross-shareholdings would mean the transportation system starts to operate as more of an integrated network. This would have to be backed up by regulation of transit prices and investment plans in order to secure as much flexibility in the system as possible. In addition, local companies that have difficulties securing payment of transit tariffs from oil producers and refiners would be allowed to sell part of the oil in the pipeline as payment. Mr Hildahl also points out that local pipeline associations must have assets such as pumping stations and property rights transferred to them. The World Bank is expected to make its recommendations contingent on further aid for oil projects in the former Soviet Union.</p>

			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEATING'S WIFE TELLS OF JAIL 'NIGHTMARE' FOR EX-S&amp;L CHIEF  </P> <P> The wife of Charles H. Keating Jr. says his three weeks in the Los Angeles  County Jail have been a "living nightmare" as he awaits trial on securities  fraud charges stemming from his time as chairman of American Continental Corp.,  former parent of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.  </P> <P> In a letter to several newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, Mary Elaine  Keating gave a glimpse of the jailed developer's life in maximum security,  where he is being kept for his own protection from other inmates.  </P> <P> "He spends every day in a tiny concrete cell with an iron door," she wrote in  the letter, published on The Times' editorial page today. "Except for court  appearances, he does not see daylight. He is chained and shackled . . . when he  is escorted to the attorney room to meet with his lawyers."  </P></p>

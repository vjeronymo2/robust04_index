			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Maloveryan] </F>   [Text] Tallinn, 19 May (ITAR-TASS) -- The Mart Laar  government is not going to resign. That is the outcome of an  emergency session of the cabinet which went on through the  night. The main reason for the resignation issue being put on  the agenda is contradictions within the government and  differences between the prime minister and certain Cabinet  members.    The government crisis, which was smoldering like a fire  under  the ashes, flared up yesterday when it became known that the  board of the ruling Fatherland [Isamaa] party decided to  recommend the government's resignation. This decision was  opposed by the parliamentary party and other members of the  ruling coalition -- the National Independence Party and the  Liberal Democrats.    The Cabinet will be continuing with different members. So  far it is reliably known that Defense Minister Indrek Kannik has  resigned -- at the prompting of the head of government -- as  well as Justice Minister Kaido Kama, who decided to leave his  post of his own volition. According to Kama, no fewer than five  other ministers will be leaving the Cabinet. Social Affairs  Minister Marju Lauristin believes this figure to be a little  high.</p>

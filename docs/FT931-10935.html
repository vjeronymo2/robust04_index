			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Costing the welfare state - Claim-as-you-work arrangements in other countries WORKFARE was the label bestowed on the prime minister's musing about whether society should expect something back from the unemployed. For the term is generally interpreted as obliging welfare recipients to 'work off' their benefits without additional pay. But in practice the word is ambiguous and covers a myriad of work programmes which vary in their intent - from saving taxpayers money to inculcating work values into single mothers. Mr Major and his cabinet, it is understood, are not yet clear about what form of workfare they want. Various forms of workfare have been introduced into a number of countries, including the US, Sweden and Australia. In the US, where unemployment insurance runs out after 26 weeks with generally no offer of income support, workfare is is a poverty relief measure aimed mainly at providing single mothers with a route out of poverty  -'able bodied' individuals with dependent children are obliged to register for work or job training. With the exception of a couple of states in the US deep south, single mothers are not thrown onto the streets if they refuse an option. Studies of US programmes, which cost on average about Dollars 1,500 a year on top of welfare payments, produce as many conclusions about workfare as there are projects. The general conclusion is that programmes do save taxpayers' money, particularly if individuals go to work in the private sector. However, savings are cut if the approach of states such as Massachusetts is followed. It claims its good-quality voluntary training programmes get people into better jobs. However, its a controversial area. Professor Laurance Mead of the New York University, who has made a large scale study of workfare, says: 'There is very little evidence to support this. What counts, he says, is that workfare enforces the work ethic. The Swedish model is very different in that it is an integral part of a highly interventionist labour market strategy in a society that until very recently was committed to full employment. Benefits have a limited duration before it is compulsory to perform some form of work. If private sector opportunities have been scarce the state has created jobs and paid full wages while in training. But rising unemployment is putting a strain on the Swedish system and there is a new public debate on unemployment measures, while cuts are being made in payments to those in publicly funded jobs. The British government is unlikely to offer participants in any new work scheme anything like this. Instead, it is more likely to model any scheme on its own Employment Action scheme, which offered benefits plus Pounds 10. It has not attracted its full quota of participants, mainly because people do not want to work for Pounds 10 a week. Some advocates of a new large-scale work scheme offering benefit plus a small amount of cash argue it would have to be mandatory. Schemes that are being considered in the UK concentrate on the long-term unemployed, in an attempt to limit the cost and concentrate on the most needy. Alternative schemes are being canvassed at a time when the plight of the long term unemployed is highlighted by unemployment lobbying organisations and MPs concerned that a rump of individuals are emerging who may become unemployable. Ministers say there is already a degree of compulsion in the system that could be extended, with individuals having to attend Restart interviews from this April after 12 months unemployment. There may be proposals to extend this scheme in the Budget on March 16, and in the longer term. These interviews are mandatory - with the threat of benefits withdrawal - and demand the individual makes personal job plans. A proposal made by Full Employment UK, is being given serious consideration by the government. Mr Peter Ashby, a director of the consultancy, proposes a Pounds 630m a year national workfare scheme offering up to 300,000 of those unemployed for more than 18 months short contracts of public and privately funded work in return for enhanced benefits.

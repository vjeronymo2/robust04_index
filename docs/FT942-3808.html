			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Harrods claims damages Harrods, Britain's most famous department store, has put in a counter-claim for damages amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds against a former employee who is suing the Knightsbridge store for Pounds 23,000 in severance pay. Harrods said it would vigorously defend the High Court action brought by Mr Nicholas Whalley who had been taken on to modernise the store's distribution systems. 'Mr Whalley had been given an important job to do but he abdicated that responsibility and allowed the situation to continue for six months,' it said. Mr Whalley was dismissed in March for failing in his duties and for failing to safeguard the interests of Harrods, the company added. The store's claim for damages is with respect to contracts for new equipment entered into by a man Harrods claims was not qualified to do so. This situation had also cost Mr Stephen Taylor, Harrods' personnel director, his job. These departures come in the wake of the highly-publicised resignation in April of the store's former managing director, Mr Peter Bolliger. Earlier this month, Harrods said all differences had been resolved amicably. Harrods has appointed a successor to Mr Whalley but declined to reveal his identity.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["CPRF Denounces War Exercises of U.S. and S. Korean </F> Puppets" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- The secretariat of the  Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland  issued an information on Friday denouncing the U.S. imperialists  and the South Korean puppets for frequently staging reckless  military exercises and committing provocations against the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    Entering May, the South Korean puppets have staged  large-scale manoeuvres socalled "combined tactical exercises for  the first half of the year" involving the three services in an  area near the military demarcation line (MDL). They have also  reinforced Armed Forces and fired bullets and shells there,  perpetrating military provocations almost every day.    The information bitterly denounces these moves of the U.S.  imperialists and the South Korean puppets as an intolerable  crime challenging pointblank the desire and efforts of the  Korean nation to avert the danger of a nuclear war and open a  new phase of the peace and peaceful reunification of the country.    It says:    The South Korean bellicose elements made public a war plan  against the North they had worked out together with the United  States, and have massively introduced latest-type combat  equipment from the U.S. they have also massed the puppet Armed  Forces in areas near the MDL and committed military  provocations, threatening "a tough counteraction" and  "retaliation" against the North. This indicates that their  belligerent moves have reached a very dangerous stage.    We want peace. But we are not afraid of war. The U.S.  imperialists and the South Korean puppets had better act with  discretion, clearly mindful that if they dare ignite another  war, they would have to pay dearly for it.</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> J.J. CALE HUNKERS DOWN IN SAVORY, LIVING-ROOM COMFORT  </P> <P> However much J.J. Cale might protest that his image as a recluse was  manufactured by the press, his performances of old did little to dispel that  image.  </P> <P> In shows only a couple of years ago, the Oklahoman author of "After Midnight"  and "Cocaine" might have been playing to a wall instead of an audience for all  the acknowledgement he gave the crowd. Between the time he stepped on stage  until he left, there often would not be so much as a "hello" or a flicker of  eye contact with his fans.  </P> <P> But even at his most aloof in terms of showmanship, Cale always had the welcome  mat out where it mattered: The smoky, slow-cooked savor of his music invariably  drew listeners in.  </P> <P> At the Coach House on Monday, the 51-year-old singer-guitarist seemed a new  man, talking and joking between songs and generally seeming comfortable with  the idea that he was in a room full of people.  </P> <P> A fresh, open-eyed approach also seemed to infuse his music. His old shows  could give listeners the feeling they were peeking through a window at a bunch  of friends having a relaxed and insular living-room jam. While Cale and his  miraculous six-piece band retained that special feel Monday, they also have  turned it outward, playing with such a spark that they seemed intent on  carpeting the whole world with their living-room vibe.  </P> <P> Cale has always managed to find players responsive to his musical whims, but he  has outdone himself with some real groove monsters this time. Joining longtime  cohorts Jim Cruce on drums, Jimmy Karstein (who makes even a tambourine a  fluent instrument) on percussion and Christine Lakeland on guitar and vocals  were pedigreed players Steve Douglas, Tim Drummond and Spooner Oldham.  </P> <P> Saxman Douglas has been a rock studio legend since starting with Duane Eddy in  the '50s, while bassist Drummond has worked with everyone from James Brown to  Bob Dylan. Keyboardist Oldham co-penned such soul and country classics as "Do  Right Woman" and laid down keys behind Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett and  countless others (that's Oldham's organ on Percy Sledge's immortal "When a Man  Loves a Woman").  </P> <P> Seven-player rock bands can be cumbersome affairs, but Cale's group played like  a simmering stew, where personality-filled solos bubbled to the surface while  still adding their flavor to the overall mix. Cale's spare but highly rhythmic  finger-picked guitar provided the recipe for the songs, though they remained  continually open to revision and spicing.  </P> <P> Cale's current "Travel-Log" album rates as his most enlivened work, and the  summer-fireworks spirit of its songs translated well to the stage. "No Time"  and "Hold On Baby" both had an insistent locomotive drive, while the pulsing,  sensual "Humdinger" was nudged on with stings from Cale's slide guitar. The  only album tune not up to the recorded version was "New Orleans." Though it had  plenty of atmosphere from Douglas' snaking soprano sax lines and Oldham's Randy  Newman-like piano dissonances, it lacked the magic of Al Capps' orchestrated  street-funeral arrangement.  </P> <P> Eschewing both current high-tech and funky old equipment (he used to be noted  for playing a beat-to-hell Sears guitar), Cale bravely did his picking on a  budget Casio guitar, with a built-in synthesizer used lightly to broaden his  tonal palette in places. Though one suspects that he would have little trouble  executing the highly dramatic flash solos of his admirer Eric Clapton, Cale  instead worked to achieve a deceptively low-keyed, precarious balance between  invention and adherence to the songs' simple forms.  </P> <P> On "The Best I Ever Had," that meant weaving a delicate web of notes to support  the gentle lyric, while on Don Nix's blues standard "I'm Goin' Down" he  perversely overlaid some flamenco-flavored licks.  </P> <P> Douglas also peppered nearly every song with solos on soprano, alto or tenor  saxes; his workout on the Viscounts' moody version of Johnny Otis' "Harlem  Nocturne" was a standout.  </P> <P> One would think that after playing "After Midnight" countless times and seeing  it turned into a turgid suds anthem by Clapton, Cale would be pretty well fed  up with the song. Instead, he made it the highlight of the show, pumping out an  exuberant, racing version, where his chugging guitar alone could have powered  it into next week.  </P></p>

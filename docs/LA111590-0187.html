			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: WHITTIER;  </P> <P> DEVELOPER GETS RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST CITY AGENCY  </P> <P> The developer of a proposed 16-acre shopping center has temporarily staved off  an attempt by the Whittier Redevelopment Agency to nullify its agreement with  the developer after city leaders said the company failed to deliver what it  promised.  </P> <P> Urbatec, the planned developer of the Whittier Station Center, received a  temporary restraining order prohibiting the Redevelopment Agency from declaring  the company in default of its agreement.  </P> <P> Mark Novak, an attorney for Urbatec, said the restraining order is good until  Nov. 20, when a judge will determine whether the company is entitled to a  preliminary injunction against the Redevelopment Agency. Such an injunction  would prevent city leaders from breaking off the agreement and entering into an  agreement with another company to develop the property.  </P> <P> Novak, who declared the receipt of the restraining order a "major victory,"  said that Urbatec officials are confident "no court is going to say we are in  default."  </P> <P> Urbatec and city leaders have been at cross-purposes over the financing and the  type of grocery store that should anchor the 20-store center. Urbatec obtained  a $12.8-million loan that the Redevelopment Agency used to buy the land, but  city leaders complained that, among other things, the loan was put up too  slowly and the price of the land rose, making the project more expensive.  </P></p>

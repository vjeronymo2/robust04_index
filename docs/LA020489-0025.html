			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAILING OUT FAILED SAVINGS AND LOANS  </P> <P> For a few, brief moments I thought I might have voted for the wrong candidate  in November. Then, our new President, exhibiting the high moral and ethical  tone he wants his Administration to set, said that deposits in savings and loan  associations "are backed by the full faith and credit of the government, and  they are sound, they are good." Then, to prove that he meant what he said, Bush  added that he found nothing wrong with considering having depositors foot the  bill for bailing out the savings and loan industry.  </P> <P> If not immoral or unethical, the President's remarks are, I suggest, those of a  hypocrite.  </P> <P> ROBERT M. GORDON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

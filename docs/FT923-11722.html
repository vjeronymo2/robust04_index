			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc price rises prompt call for action by LME PRESSURE FOR the London Metal Exchange executive to take action to head off technical squeezes in some of its markets increased yesterday as zinc prices rose sharply again because of impending supply tightness in October. Traders suggest there are also signs that a squeeze is looming in the LME's 'flagship' copper contract for the fourth quarter of this year and early 1993. The lead contract might be the next to be subjected to a squeeze, warned Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at Merrill Lynch, the financial services group, yesterday. He said: 'We would warn hedgers about actually shorting lead (selling metal they do not own in the expectation of buying later at a lower price) in the coming weeks. This market could take off as zinc did.' Zinc for delivery in three months closed on the LME last night up Dollars 32 a tonne at Dollars 1,376.50 while zinc for immediate delivery ended Dollars 40 up at Dollars 1,362.50. Prices have risen by 9.5 per cent since July 16 when the LME removed limitations imposed to ease the impact of a squeeze in June. Six to eight zinc producers accounting for about 1m tonnes of annual output and a big trader seem to be involved. Producers would prefer to keep the LME zinc price - which is a reference point for contracts signed all over the world - above their break-even level of Dollars 1,300 a tonne. To do this they have built up a big long position (bought metal today for future delivery) for delivery in October. Those involved say they are not colluding but each came to a similar conclusion when the price languished last year at Dollars 1,000 a tonne. One of the participants explained to Reuter yesterday that they had built up long positions for delivery in June this year and, when the LME intervened, these were simply rolled over into October. Some consumers complain they are being forced to pay artificially high prices for zinc at a time when LME stocks are at record levels. However, Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, pointed out, the zinc price was being underpinned by good demand.</p>

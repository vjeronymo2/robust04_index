The two-hour meeting of the two ministers covered the issues  of European security and the situation in Russia.    Olechowski stressed at the conference that Poland was aware  that the former Warsaw Pact members could not join NATO quickly.  The U.S.-sponsored Partnership for Peace programme to be  accepted at the NATO summit should clearly define the conditions  and timetable for the entry.    Kinkel told the press conference that NATO is open for new  members in principle but immediate membership was not possible.  Instead he proposed a close cooperation with NATO, including  joint manoeuvres, participation in peace missions and  consultations in case of threat to one of the countries'  security. He ruled out, however, any formal guarantees of  security.    Kinkel stressed that Russia has no right of veto as far as  the broadening of NATO is concerned.    The Polish foreign minister said that Poland needed a  feeling  of being a part of the West. "We know we will not join NATO  tomorrow. We are satisfied with Minister Kinkel's statement that  Germany will defend our interests at the NATO summit."    The two also discussed the issue of border crossings.  Olechowski stressed that he has a strong resolution to do  something in this field as long as he is the foreign minister.  Kinkel shared the opinion that the present situation at  Polish-German border crossings should not be continued as it  complicates trade relations between the countries and contacts  between the two nations.</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Arts: Today's Television If the hairs on the back of your neck rise at the words 'I'll be leaving Cape Horn to starboard' then you will want to watch Sea Challenge (8.15 BBC2). Even today, with the Whitbread Race ensuring that people now round the Horn in something like a procession, for anyone who sails there is still something magical and threatening about the very name of the famous landmark. This programme tells the story of Mike Golding's triumphant attempt to cut 100 days off Chay Blyth's 1971 record of 292 days for a widdershins circumnavigation of the globe. Among the many Radio 5 Live programmes concerned with neither sport nor news is Arthur Smith On The Floor in which the best of the alternative comedian comperes visits different universities for student debates, today: Sunderland (9.05). Radio 3's new series Where Are They Now? begins with John Stanley, a blind organist, contemporary of Handel, whose prolific composition was once highly regarded (9.40). The first episode in a new Book At Bedtime, 'Piggy In The Middle' by Paula McKay, is read by Miriam Margolyes (10.45 Radio 4).</p>

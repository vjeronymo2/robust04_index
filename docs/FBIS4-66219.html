			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Renye (2621 0088 2814): "A Pair of </F> Outstanding Weapons Tested in the Desert. Can the T-72 Stand Up  to the M1A1?"]    [Excerpts] Tanks have been used in many limited wars since  the end of World War II; however, in terms of quantity, quality  and intensity of combat, the 23-27 February 1991 ground warfare  in the Gulf War may be rated the mother of all tank battles.    Admittedly, the combat reports published today are  explanations that the United States Department of Defense makes  to Congress and the public; thus, they are bound to be biased.  Nevertheless, it is still possible to make an evaluation of the  tanks on the basis of these reports and a technical analysis.  This article seeks to use technical analysis to find ways to  remedy shortcomings in existing tanks and to develop technology  for future combat tanks. [passage omitted]    Battlefield Performance of M1A1 and T-72 Compared    After the Gulf War was over, the Soviet-made T-72 and the  American-made M1A1 tanks became an object of much verbal  sword-crossing both in China and abroad. The main focus of  remarks was on the following four things:    Sighting and Aiming Equipment. If the decisive  factor in the M1A1 tanks destruction of the T-72 tanks were to  be listed in order of priority, the high performance thermal  imaging sighting and aiming device would have to be placed  first. This is also the reason that the American forces do a lot  of night fighting, and even pick bad weather when visibility is  very poor to fight surface warfare. The M1A1 tank's thermal  imagining sighting and aiming device is a passive sighting and  aiming device that can be used both during the day and night  that the Hughes Corporation produces. It employs a single target  periscope. Not only does the device provide images of targets,  but it also displays range and various kinds of firing data that  a laser range finder figures out. Night performance  characteristics are as follows: Ten-fold magnification when the  field of vision is 5 degrees; three-fold magnification when the  field of vision is 16 degrees; and an effective night-sighting  distance of 2,000 meters under ordinary circumstances. During  serious sand storms, the sighting distance falls to 900 meters.    The Iraqi Army's newest model T-72M1 tank uses an  Iraqi-manufactured aiming device whose performance is  substantially identical with that of the Soviet-manufactured  TPN-1-49-23 infra-red night sighting and aiming device.    The TPN night-sighting and aiming system employs an active  infra-red system in which in the infra-red rays from an  infra-red searchlight are reflected back from the target on  which they shine. The receiving device for the TPN system, which  is mounted to the left front of the gun turret, processes the  reflected infra-red image to lock the aiming device on the  target. Under ordinary weather conditions, its effective  night-sighting distance is between 600 and 800 meters (at a  5.5-fold magnification), which is one-third that of the M1A1. In  a severe sand storm, when visibility with the naked eye is less  than 200 meters, the effective sighting distance declines to  around 300 meters. Its most fatal weakness is that the infra-red  rays that its infra-red searchlight emit amount to giving the  M1A1's passive thermal imager a target to shoot at. Clearly, the  T-72 is vulnerable day or night.    Of course, the M1A1 tank's thermal imaging aiming device is  not the acme of perfection either. For example, the thermal  imagining device's image may darken at times; thus regulations  provide that it is to be used a maximum of 8 hours per day.  Furthermore, the thermal imagining system is unable to identify  friend from foe. This resulted in American army tank's regularly  damaging each other by mistake during the Gulf War.    Long Distance First Round Hit Rate. The first  round hit rate is of crucial importance in live warfare. This  was amply demonstrated in the Gulf War. According to American  Captain Jibeina [phonetic], company commander of D Company of  the 1/35 Armored Battalion, First Armored Division: "Our  company's 14 M1A1 tanks can unerringly hit T-72 tanks."    A report from A Company of the 2/4 Cavalry Battalion of the  American 24th Mechanized Infantry Division said: "Our company is  equipped with 12 M1A1 tanks and 14 M3 cavalry tanks. During an  engagement with an Iraqi Army T-72 tank, Corporal First Class  Sinide's [phonetic] M3 Bradley cavalry tank came under attack  from a T-72 tank at a distance of 600 meters. A shell from the  T-72s 125 mm gun landed 10 meters away from the M3 without  hitting it. The M3 only received a shock wave from it. Next, the  Iraqi T-72 tank was destroyed by a shell from an M1A1 tank that  was supporting the M3 tank from the rear." This is a classic  example of what can happen when the first round fails to hit.    During the Gulf War, the poor performance of the Iraqi  tanks'  fire control system, which led to inability to aim and fire  quickly, provided the American tanks with opportunities.  Reportedly, it takes an M1A1 tank 6.2 seconds to fire its first  round. Although we do not know how long a T-72 takes, British  Chieftain tanks, which are of the same generation as the T-72s,  take 13 seconds.    An American army report said that two M1A1 tanks that T-72  tanks hit could have been repaired, but the American army  destroyed them on the spot for security reasons. It should be  noted that these two tanks were hit at a range of less than  1,000 meters and that their armor was not penetrated.    An American army investigator verified that most of the  Iraqi  army tanks that M1A1s hit with the first round were at a range  of between 2,000 and 3,650 meters.    Armor Piercing Power. The American M1A1 tank's gun  fires an M829A1 armor piercing, fin-stabilized, descending sabot  (APFSDS). This shell weighs 18.7 kilograms. Its core weighs 7.16  kilograms (including the sabot). The core is made of a low-grade  uranium alloy, is 24 mm in diameter, and has a 20:1 length to  diameter ratio. Its muzzle velocity is 1,675 meters per second,  and the muzzle energy is slightly higher than 9 megajoules. At a  range of 1,000 meters, it can pierce armor to the equivalent of  600 mm thick rolled homogenous steel armor. At 2,000 meters, it  can pierce the equivalent of 550 mm thick armor of the same kind.    The Soviet-made tank's 125 mm, long APFSDS has been  developed  for at least three generations. This includes the first BM-12,  which had a total projectile weight of 29.9 kilograms, whose  core was made of tungsten alloy, and whose diameter was 44 mm.  Since the weight of the core is somewhat lighter than of the  American-made armor piercing core (4.5 kgs), muzzle velocity is  also somewhat higher (1,720 meters per second). However, because  the core is light, muzzle power is also less at only 6.6  megajoules, and projectile velocity falls off fairly rapidly.  This is particularly disadvantageous for long-range combat. In  addition, the length to diameter ratio of the BM-12 is only  10:1, and the core diameter is greater. Therefore, core mass is  less per unit of armor area, meaning that armor piercing energy  per unit of area is less. At a range of 2,000 meters, its  vertical armor piercing ability is only equal to 400 mm thick  homogeneous steel armor.    The shells that the Iraqi army used in the Gulf War may have  been either the old BM-9s (whose production was halted in 1973),  or the old style BM-11 armor piercing shells. The BM-9s core  weighs 3.6 kgs; the shell's velocity is 1,800 meters per second,  and its shell core length-to-diameter ratio is 9:1. Their  remaining velocity capacity is poor. At a range of 1,000 meters,  their velocity falls to 142 meters per second. At a range of  2,000 meters, the loss of projectile energy is even greater.  Their armor-piercing power is much less than that of the BM-12,  being only 24 mm. The BM-11 shell's armor piercing strength is  300 mm.    It should be strongly emphasized that there is still room  for  improvement of Soviet-made 125 mm gun ammunition. Nevertheless,  even the old BM-9 ammunition's muzzle energy is greater than  that of the west's 105 mm gun's armor-piercing shells. The  Middle East War showed that when an American-made second  generation tank such as the M-60 was the adversary, all it took  was the T-62's 115 mm gun to deal with it. The war in the Bakka  Valley also showed that Israel's Merkava tank, which was  designed with extremely close attention to survivability,  likewise was unable to escape destruction from the T-72's 125 mm  gun.    These circumstances show that the APFSDSs that are used  today are capable of dealing with an adversary that does not  have the most up-to-date composite armor.    Armor Defense It may be inferred that a material  such as a fine mesh nylon fiber is placed between two layers of  titanium high quality, double strength plates to make the M1A1  tanks' composite armor. The low-grade uranium material mixed  into the M1A1HA tank's armor is 2.5 times as dense as steel.    Unlike the composite armor of the traditional M1A1 tank, the  new armor of the M1A1HA uses new materials, and it also uses a  new form of construction. The new generation of composite  armor no longer consists solely of layers of different materials  with space in between, but adds a separating layer that is able  to absorb shock or reduce damage. This layer is made up of  extremely elastic honeycomb or corrugated material. It can  absorb the shock energy of kinetic energy ammunition. It has a  cushioning effect, and it can diffuse the kinetic energy  throughout the entire construction material that braces the  armor plate. No longer are the materials that form the composite  armor plane joined by a bonding agent or welded together.  Instead, layers of different materials simply overlap, each  layer being able to move. This serves both to break up the core  of the kinetic energy ammunition and to diffuse the explosive  shell's metallic jet flow.    By using this kind of construction, when a damaged piece of  armor is changed or a new kind of composite armor is used, all  that is required is to open the composite armor's external weld.  The enter process of changing a piece of armor takes less than  15 minutes. Furthermore, this replacement of the low grade  uranium armor can make the most of modern armor's best  protection capability.    By inference, the protection capability of an M1A1HA tank's  armor against an APFSDS is equal to approximately 600 mm thick  steel armor. In dealing with a high explosive squash head, it is  equivalent to 1,300 mm thick steel armor.    Therefore, a BM-11 armor piercing shell that a T-72 tank  fires, which can only penetrate 300 mm of armor plate, naturally  cannot penetrate the front armor of an M1A1 tank. Even a BM-12  cannot penetrate it. Reportedly, the front of the T-72M1 tank's  turret has not only the main armor consisting of rolled steel  armor plate, but also several layers of special armor having a  maximum thickness of 280 mm. This special armor consists of  three layers. The outer layer is armor steel; the second layer  is glass fiber/ceramic material; and the third layer is also  armor steel. According to an American army analysis, the  T-72M1's armor not only can be penetrated by an American M829A1  shell, but it has no defense against a 125 mm shell.</p>

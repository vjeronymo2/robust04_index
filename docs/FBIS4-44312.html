			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "J.G.": "Algerian Prime Minister Pleads His </F> Cause in Paris"]    [Text] Passing through Paris after a visit to Brussels,  Algerian Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi had visibly two major  concerns at a time when the Americans are very critical toward  those in power in Algeria: On the one hand, to demonstrate that  his country can count on the "total and unconditional support"  of European leaders and, on the other hand, to reassure  "everyone who might doubt the intention of the Algerian  authorities to reestablish stability and to return eventually to  elections." "I came to France and Belgium in order to express  our recognition for the various forms of support those  responsible for the European Union [EU] have given us, are  giving us, and will give us," he emphasized at the opening of a  news conference in Paris yesterday, describing the Algerian  crisis as "temporary."    The Algerian prime minister, who met with Francois  Mitterrand, Edouard Balladur, and Alain Juppe, pointed out to  his interlocutors that "it was in nobody's interest for Algeria  to remain unstable," and that "Africa's security was inseparable  from that of the Maghreb." Aware of France's refusal to attach  any conditions to its aid, Mokdad Sifi took advantage of this  situation to affirm that "no agreement with the IMF or with  Europe contained any political conditions." A position which  does not, however, appear to be that of the EU.    This prime minister reaffirmed that his government had  "opted  for dialogue without exclusivity (i.e., including the Islamic  parties) with everyone who rejects violence," but that it "would  unceasingly combat those who want to destroy Algeria through  terrorism." However, he was at pains to show that this was a  time more of antiterrorist combat than of dialogue. "If there  are moderates, let them come forward," he concluded, before  recognizing that "he had no answer" to the question of why  Abdel-kader Hachani, one of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front]  leaders, had been detained for more than two years without trial.    There remains the delicate problem of human rights  violations  and the repeated reprisals by the security forces against the  civilian population after certain operations by the armed  Islamic groups. "Human rights are our concern," Mokdad Sifi  replied calmly, adding that "instructions have been given to the  security forces not to take repressive measures, even if this  were to lead to the failure of an operation or put their lives  at risk." Affirmations which come at a time when several  Algerian political parties have denounced "excesses" to  international humanitarian organizations.</p>

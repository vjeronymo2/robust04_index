			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Russian Treasury bill to ease budget deficit THE Russian authorities yesterday hailed their first Treasury bill issue as a first step to helping finance the budget deficit by means other than printing money. Mr Dimitry Tulin, deputy governor of the central bank, said the sale of Rbs885.4m marked 'the birth of a new market in our country for credit instruments'. The first issue, which is small in contrast to Russia's budget deficit, is to be followed by monthly auctions of bigger amounts. The three-month bills were sold at around 84.7 per cent of their par value, with an average annual yield of 103 per cent. This is far below inflation, which exceeds 1,000 per cent a year, but still attractive to commercial banks which have to keep vast amounts of idle funds to make up for a slow banking payments system. The central bank payments system can also hold on for weeks to rapidly-depreciating roubles owed to exporters who may therefore also be attracted by the liquidity of the bills. Mr Tulin said commercial banks had Rbs3,000bn in idle funds and that half that amount might be invested in Treasury bills if the new instrument was proved to be reliable.</p>

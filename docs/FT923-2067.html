			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Punt protected by exchange controls THE REMNANTS of foreign exchange controls in Ireland saved the the Irish pound (punt) from further pressure yesterday, burning the fingers of speculators who had forced the punt to the floor of the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism on Thursday. The punt was yesterday trading around DM2.64, comfortably above its floor rate of DM2.619, as buyers came back into the market, many seeking to cover short positions they had taken out as sellers the day before. Mr Chris Johns, the head of research in the Bank of Ireland, said: 'The market for the punt is not a deep and liquid one, as it is for sterling. It is very difficult for a speculator who is short of Irish pounds to get ready access to them.' Exchange controls have been progressively lifted in Ireland since 1988 but there are still a few restrictions, which are due to be phased out by the end of this year. They limit the freedom of banks in Ireland in lending Irish currency abroad, especially for short-term speculative purposes. Speculators who took a short position on Thursday  - who contracted to sell punts, expecting to borrow them to cover the contract and to buy back into the currency at a lower price later  - found by Friday morning that there were very limited funds available to borrow. Overnight money market lending rates for the punt shot up to more than 300 per cent in London and other European financial centres yesterday. A trader in Jersey said: 'Overnight rates for the punt have gone crazy. We are not even quoting it.' Rumours of some quotes exceeding 10,000 per cent for overnight funds were widespread, although it is not thought deals were struck. There was no need for central bank intervention to support the punt yesterday. In confident mood, Mr Bertie Ahern, Irish finance minister, said the recovery of the punt 'demonstrates the confidence the markets have in the strong currency position of the Irish pound within the narrow band of the ERM'. He added: 'Our trade performance is an indicator of the underlying competitive strength of our economy. Our trade surplus was IPounds 1.76bn in the first six months of 1992 and is expected to be about IPounds 2.7bn for the year as a whole, over 10 per cent of GNP. This far exceeds the expected surpluses of countries such as Japan and contrasts favourably with the negative balance expected for the EC.' Figures published on Thursday show that Irish inflation has fallen to 2.8 per cent for the year to the end of August. Earlier this year, the government projected a 3.75 per cent inflation rate for 1992. Overnight interest rates are quoted on an annualised basis. A trader at Barclays said a quoted rate of 250 per cent was equivalent to 1.5 per cent payable in interest after 24 hours.</p>

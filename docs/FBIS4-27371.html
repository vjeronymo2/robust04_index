			<p>BFN     [Text] Zhang Tingyan, PRC Ambassador to the ROK, said that  China also supports the statement adopted by the UN Security  Council yesterday regarding the North Korean nuclear issue, thus  stressing that there are no changes in China's position of  supporting a denuclerization on the Korean peninsula.    At a lecture arranged by a Graduate School of the Business  Administration of Korea University this morning, Ambassador  Zhang stressed that China's position that North Korea should not  possess nuclear weapons remains unchanged, and that China is  making efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.    Ambassador Zhang said that the North Korean nuclear issue  should not be resolved by force of arms, but that he hopes that  it can be peacefully resolved through dialouge.    He added that although North Korea is in a very difficult  situation due to its economic difficulties, he expects that it  will gradually carry out an opening up policy.</p>

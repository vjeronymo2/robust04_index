			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Medical Proscription . . . . This 1940s advertisement from the archives of the Proprietary Association of Great Britain would now be illegal because of a ban on absolute statements such as 'best and safest' or suggestions that any remedy could restore 'health and vigour'. The association today launches its revised rules on how members are allowed to advertise products. A ban on the use of celebrities to endorse medicines is one of the changes. Advertisements will also have to carry the words 'always read the label' and the name of the medicine's active ingredient. The association scrutinises 4,000 advertisements a year to ensure they comply with the product licence, the Medicines Act and advertising codes of practice.</p>

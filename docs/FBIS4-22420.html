			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dainis Lemeshonoks: "Green Gold Fills the Purse"] </F>   [Text] Latvian wood products exports doubled in 1993 over  1992 levels. 1994 exports should also increase over 1993 levels.  This is viewed as quite attainable by State Minister of Forests  Kazimir Shlakota, which will retain its prior designation as  Ministry of Forests through 1994, despite the fact that the  agency is now subordinate to the Ministry of Agriculture.    The mix of exports is also improving. The log sell-off craze  has ended. But there is little to grieve over what has passed.  If at one time we had not exported unprocessed logs and  pulpwood, where would the funds have come from to acquire  equipment for cutting timber and for sawing lumber? Now we can  cut and sell boards.    - Now we are preparing for the next stage. A plywood  enterprise is already in production in Riga. That yields $600  per cubic meter. Sawn lumber is about 110-115 dollars per cubic  meter. In the ramp up period, while local workers learn how to  prepare and select wood for the plant, local wood will comprise  only 20% of the production while the balance will be  imported  from Germany and Finland. By next year Latvian wood will make up  50% of production and the following year this will jump  to 75%.    Four firms will begin production in Latvia this year that  make wood panels for furniture making from wood slats. This will  create new opportunities for furniture manufacturing. Already  Latvian furniture makers are working and exporting to the West.  We must, however, meet local demand for furniture where last  year over five million worth of furniture was imported into  Latvia from Germany and Finland, even where our own products are  superior. A German child's bed costs 320 Ls. One just like it  that is produced in Latvia costs 120 Ls (and these are exported  to Germany!). It appears that our people are ready to pay 200 Ls  for the label Made in Germany.    The most important problems -- to clarify available raw  resources and production capacity, which is now sufficiently  available that we are running out of resources. That is an  energy problem, because there is a massive effort to convert  furnaces to burn wood and wood chips. But will there be wood to  burn?    The second problem -- restart the paper industry. At this  point only the Ligatne factory is in production. Two  paper-making machines need to be started in Sloka. Paper carton  production also needs to be started in Ranka. Russian paper has  become cheap. Even the expensive Finish paper has become  advantageous due to its quality. This is why the Latvian  producer has to drop his price (reprocessing newsprint, reducing  irrational energy consumption, using production waste for fuel)  and improve his quality.    Changes in Latvia's forestry -- due to the privatization of  wood processing enterprises and to reallocation of governmental  functions -- was begun a bit too early by our Ministry, if we  take into account the overall status of the country. We hoped  that privatization would be implemented quickly -- in reality,  in three years virtually nothing has happened in the  enterprises. At the same time these enterprises have been robbed  to nothingness. We also expected that the divisions between  national, local government and private forests would have been  rapidly and clearly established.    It is finally becoming easier. Most importantly, we have let  energetic people operate in the forests. We established very low  fees to be paid to the State treasury to permit farmers and  small enterprises to start felling logs and making money with  little up-front cost. This, however, was done at the expense of  forest management -- less money to pay forester wages.    Latvians are slow by temperament. This is why for a time it  seemed that little was happening in this field. Movement began  in earnest, however, last year when over a thousand private  sawmills, carpentry shops and furniture factories began  production. Each gave work to from five to even a hundred  employees. In a year's time these enterprises got on their feet  with virtually no financial investment. But the real flowering  of the wood-processing industry lies ahead. The export of sawn  lumber has grown six-fold. This has been done by the small,  rural sawmills. The large mills have little to offer, because  they have problems with production quality. These are no longer  the times when we can produce crooked flooring where a cat can  fall through the cracks! Bit by bit local demand is also picking  up in construction.    At this time our exports are hitting the limits of our  forest  resources. There are no more logs in Latvia. We must begin to  think about importing wood for processing in Latvia. This is now  beginning. This year wood will be imported from Finland  (processing is cheaper here) as well as from Lithuania and  Russia where wood processing firms have not thrived because  there the State attempted to hold on to the wood processing  industry. The Estonian wood processing industry was immediately  converted to the free market, but we attempted to regulate the  conditions when these became critical and forest products  workers wages became unacceptable. We then lowered duties and  tariffs to assure a stable 30-40% profitability. This is  why  wood processing is the only industrial sector in Latvia that can  develop on the basis of its own resources. Farmers at this time  do not have other comparably secure sources of profits, which  can also be used for other farming needs.    -- But how does this development affect the forest  itself? Is there a basis for concerns about the rapid cutting of  our forests?    -- I believe that our explanations have helped, because now  people are less upset.    At this time we can process about 6.5 million cubic  meters of wood per annum. Last year, we processed only  4.7 million, but 1.8 million cubic meters remained in  the field. 400,000 cubic meters were not processed by state  enterprises in their prolonged prebankruptcy condition. At the  same time, 1.4 million cubic meters were not logged in the  former kolkhoz forests, which are being converted to private  ownership, because the conversion is far too slow. There are too  few specialists who can determine borders and resolve disputes  among heirs. These disputes are becoming stronger by the day as  it becomes clear that the forest represents real wealth.    The pre-war Forestry Department managed 1,270,000 hectares  of  forest. We can hope that we will regain control of 1,200,000  hectares losing 70,000 to road-building and to private farmers.  About 1,300,000 hectares should be transferred to private  ownership and about 100,000 to local governments.    What will happen with the State's share? We want to  straighten the borders, and sell small holdings in turn  purchasing forest land adjoining larger forests. In any case, I  do not desire to sell-off the nation's forests. First, until  1996 forest property in Latvia will be very cheap. This is  because many owners who have reclaimed their land don't have a  clear idea what to do with it, and are selling it off. This  drives down the price. Secondly, the government can gain greater  value from the forest through careful management instead of  selling it. Why should you take a hen to market, if you can make  good money by selling its eggs? (I hope that private owners  understand this and that by 1996 that the forest selling boom  comes to an end.)    The capabilities of the national forest management system  are  demonstrated by the stable growth of exports. (We do not do any  logging. This is done by private loggers who pay the government  a stump fee. It is however, possible, in time that we will be  able to lease a parcel including a brigade of loggers.) Third,  the national forests must remain as a place where people can  pick berries and mushrooms and rest. It will become more  difficult to do this in a private forest. Forest preserves and  reservations can be formed in the expanse of the national  forests.    -- How have new private owners of forests responded to  the strict government guidelines for forest management and use  (which came into force on January 31). It is no secret that many  of these people have the attitude, "This forest belongs to me  and I can do with it what I want!"    -- Private owners can only use their forest resources if  they  have a project that has been developed with the forest developer  and the State forester. The owner who does not have a project  must receive written permission from the forester with each use.    At this time the reaction of the owners is negative. They  feel that they will know best what to do. This is why we try to  explain that this policy serves their own interests. Why should  you log your birch now if you will barely get 100 Ls? Why not  wait a decade when you will get 4,000 Ls from each hectare?    If you must log now, then the next time when you will be  able  to earn 4,000 Ls from your birch will be 50-60 years from now.  But it is hard to explain to a beggar, who needs those 1000 Ls  today.    A person, who wants to be a real proprietor, must know what  he can extract from his property. This is why it is important to  establish a project, a 15 year plan, how to maximize the yield  from the forest resource.    Most new forest owners are people with no experience with  very poor prior knowledge. It is no accident to see forests  where the owners have mowed down the trees completely  -- as if they were in the land of their enemy and not their own.  And then their is the share that belongs to the heirs reclaiming  their land who are bent on selling it immediately at all costs,  because they do not have an idea what to do with it. This is why  we are pushing the passage of this law to explain to these new  owners what wealth a real proprietor can get from his forest.    This is why I urge those who are repossessing their forests  to read the specialty magazine Forest Life! At the  Ogre Forest Technicum, a new organization is being formed called  the Association of Forest Users which is already operational in  four regions. This organization has begun training, specialists  are going to the countryside to give lectures and to provide  explanations.    Forest owners will have to adjust to the fact that forests  will be managed only by those who have the necessary knowledge.  If they won't have this knowledge themselves, then they will  have to hire specialists who have the knowledge. Anybody can buy  a car who has the money, but only those can drive who have a  driver's license in their pocket. A forest is a far more  complicated affair, than driving a car, believe me!</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Hong Kong sale helps Time Prods to Pounds 5.33m THE DISPOSAL of its remaining property interests in Hong Kong for Pounds 1.48m helped Time Products, the watch and jewellery distribution group, lift pre-tax profits for the six months to July 31 by 52 per cent, from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 5.33m. Operating profits were ahead from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 3.34m, including a Pounds 486,000 contribution from acquisitions. This mainly reflected the purchase in March for Pounds 11.9m of the business of Judith Leiber, an American designer of luxury handbags. Mr Marcus Margulies, chairman, said that 80 per cent of profits came from the luxury end of the group's markets, with 20 per cent from volume markets. A couple of years ago the proportions would have been reversed. While the group owns Sekonda, which accounts for about 12 per cent of UK watch sales, it also sells watches worth hundreds of thousands of pounds apiece. It holds agencies for exclusive brands such as Blancpain and Vacheron Constantin, and last April acquired for Pounds 2m the agency to distribute in North America watches by Audemars Piguet, the Swiss watchmaker that specialises in highly technical and luxurious pieces. Mr Margulies' strategy is to concentrate on luxury brand names. The group has now opened a luxury watch shop at Judith Leiber's premises in New York. 'The concept of the company is changing very dramatically,' he said yesterday. 'The US offers us a very exciting opportunity, and the start has been better than we would have hoped.' Group turnover rose from Pounds 26.2m to Pounds 29.9m. The latest figure included Pounds 4.63m from acquisitions and Pounds 197,000 from discontinued operations. Turnover last time included Pounds 5.95m from discontinued operations. Mr Margulies said turnover in the luxury watch division was moving increasingly into the first half of the year, partly because of demand after the Basle Fair in April. The volume business showed some improvement, but trading conditions remained difficult. Net interest receivable fell from Pounds 1.09m to Pounds 513,000, reflecting a reduction in net cash because of acquisitions and lower rates. Earnings per share were 6.67p (4.57p), and the interim dividend is 3p (2.75p).</p>

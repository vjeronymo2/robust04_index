Thousands of people participated in the demonstrations to  protest against Islamabad's role in abetting and sponsoring  terrorism in various parts of India, especially in Jammu and  Kashmir.    A large number of Youth Congress-I workers held a massive  rally close to the Indo-Pakistan border at Wagah in Punjab to  denounce Pakistan's support to disruptive forces. Addressing  the demonstrators, the Youth Congress-I president, Mr.  Maninderjit Singh Bitta, asked Pakistan to stop encouraging  terrorism in India and work sincerely for peace between the two  countries.    In Jammu, several organizations, including the pradesh  [state] Youth Congress-I, the Democratic Youth Federation of  India, Yuva Janata Dal [youth wing of Janata Dal], Young Lawyers  Association, ABVP [Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad -- All  India Student Council], National Youth Front, and All India  Kashmiri Samaj [Society] organized the rallies. Activists of  many of these organizations marched to the headquarters of the  UN observers to submit memorandums against Pakistan's activities.    Effigies of the prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, and  former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif were burned at many places by  the demonstrators. Reports reaching Jammu say anti-Pakistan  slogans rented the air in the border villages of Kathua, Samba,  Akhnur, Rajaori, and Punch. Senior Congress-I leader Mr.  Madanlal Sharma and the Youth Congress-I leader, Mr. Raman  Bhalla, were among those who addressed the rally.    Demonstrations were held near the American Embassy and  Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi, protesting against the  recent statements of these two countries on Kashmir. The  demonstrators raised slogans and carried placards denouncing the  statements.    In Orissa, Youth Congress-I activists held a rally in  Bhubaneswar to protest against Pakistan's interference in Punjab  and Jammu and Kashmir. The Arunachal Pradesh Youth Congress-I  also organized a protest rally in Itanagar and burned effigies  of Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Nawaz Sharif. Reports of similar  demonstrations have come in from other states.    The demonstrations coincided with the nationwide hartal  [strike] in Pakistan called by the Bhutto government today to  express solidarity with Kashmir militants.</p>

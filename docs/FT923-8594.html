			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: US retailers report profits growth A CLUTCH of leading US retailers yesterday reported higher earnings for the three-months to end-July, but sales growth remained modest. Woolworth, which takes in both the general merchandise stores and a number of specialty chains, said that net profits for the 13 weeks to July 25 reached Dollars 33m, compared with Dollars 21m for the same period of 1991. This brings first-half profits to Dollars 50m, against Dollars 79m a year earlier when Woolworth incurred a one-off charge of Dollars 113m. However, in operating terms the improvement came solely from the specialty stores. Second-quarter operating profits here rose to Dollars 67m from Dollars 41m, while the general merchandise business saw a decline to Dollars 21m from Dollars 26m. The picture on the revenue front was similar: specialty store revenues rose by 1.5 per cent, while general merchandise fell by 1.3 per cent. On a comparable store basis, Woolworth said that domestic revenues were up by 1.2 per cent, while overseas revenues increased by 3.2 per cent. Woolworth is carrying out a large-scale store redeployment programme involving about 900 outlets, both general merchandise and specialty. Yesterday, Mr Harold Sells, chairman, said the plan was having positive effects, improving gross margins. 'We are confident that the upward trend established in the first half will continue for the remainder of the year,' he said. At May Department Stores, net profits in the 13 weeks to August 1 rose to Dollars 393m, after a non-recurring gain of Dollars 298m, compared with Dollars 82m a year ago. This takes first-half profits to Dollars 474m after tax, against Dollars 158m. Sales during the second quarter increased to Dollars 1.95bn from Dollars 1.85bn, and for the first half, to Dollars 3.8bn from Dollars 3.62bn. May said that on a same-store basis there were gains of 2.8 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively. Arkansas-based Dillard Department Stores saw second-quarter after-tax profits to August 1 advance to Dollars 36.5m from Dollars 35.7m, with sales rising to Dollars 974.9m from Dollars 873.9m. This takes net profits for the first half to Dollars 81.6m, against Dollars 73.8m, with sales advancing to Dollars 2bn from Dollars 1.76bn.</p>

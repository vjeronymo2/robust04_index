			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / IG-Metall to plan strike Germany's engineering workers yesterday cleared the decks for strike action, when all the remaining regions of the 3.2m-strong IG Metall trade union formally declared their wage negotiations to have failed, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. The national leadership is now expected to decide on Monday in which region to hold a strike ballot. Provided 75 per cent of the membership vote in favour, that would open the way for limited strike action in the region, from the second week of March.</p>

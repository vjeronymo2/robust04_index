			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / OECD criticises aid efforts to republics IMPORTANT gaps exist in the efforts of the industrial nations to spread economic, management and political expertise to the republics of the former Soviet Union, according to an OECD report. Reviewing 'technical assistance', or the spread of know-how to the newly independent states, the OECD said: Western donor countries were providing insufficient guidance to the republics on environmental problems. The donors' aid efforts, in both the humanitarian and know-how sectors, gave too little attention to the republics' need to improve shelter, housing and construction. The number of projects aimed at building democracy was, at only 2 per cent, too small in view of the republics' inexperience in such matters. The provision of expertise about health and social safety nets is neglected in some republics. The geographical spread of technical assistance is uneven with the needs of the central Asian republics being crowded out by larger republics.</p>

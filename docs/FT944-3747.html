			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Management: France puts her 'affaires' in order - David Buchan examines a growing debate about corporate governance and better boardroom practice French companies are beginning to punch back a bit, after the general hammering they have taken for corruption from magistrates, international investors and the press. The Patronat employers federation has called on its members to suspend contributions to political parties, and some larger ones, particularly France's big utilities suspected of winning municipal contracts by underhand means, have already stopped writing cheques to the politicians. The fact that the French national assembly is now considering legislation to ban companies giving to political parties robs the Patronat appeal of some of its import. But in a report concluding its own study on anti-corruption reforms, the Patronat is also asking for a revision of some of the penal provisions of French company law and for better protection for businessmen under investigation from press leaks, as well as calling on its member companies to adopt ethics codes and set up ethics committees. Already the corruption scandals, usually referred to in ambiguous French understatement as 'les affaires', are affecting the way some French companies are managed. The most striking example concerns the Schneider group, whose president, Didier Pineau-Valenciennes, is the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by a Belgian judge. The warrant was issued after Pineau-Valenciennes failed to return to Belgium to be investigated further on fraud charges. The Schneider president has since taken to running his multinational engineering group through tele-conferences from Paris and letting the head of his international division travel in his stead to countries that might honour the Belgian warrant. In addition, most members of the French public works contractors' association have taken a pledge not to bribe to obtain contracts. Individually, Lyonnaise des Eaux says it has reinforced its ethical practices, while Generale des Eaux has put its chief legal officer in charge of a new committee to provide ethical 'guidance' to managers. Most important of all, the publicity surrounding 'les affaires' has also given new prominence to the debate about how far France should import Anglo-Saxon models of corporate governance and change the balance of power and control between management, boards and shareholders in its companies. There is a feeling that one of the reasons why French companies have got into trouble with the law is that their over-powerful bosses are not properly controlled by their boards and shareholders. This impression is reinforced by the fact that the charge most commonly levelled against company chiefs is 'abus des biens sociaux' (literally, misuse of corporate funds). But the idea that top executives have been generally acting against their companies' interest is false, says the Patronat. The employers federation wants magistrates to stop using the 'abus des biens sociaux' charge as a catch-all, and to redefine it as including some element of personal enrichment. It is perhaps true that some directors and shareholders were ready, at least in earlier times, to turn a blind eye to executives using company money to pay bribes, provided these were a cost-efficient way of bringing in contracts, but not to feather their own nests. However, it is really foreign investors who have brought the corporate governance debate to France. Their voice is strong. At the end of last year, foreigners held 36 per cent, or FFr444bn (Pounds 52.8bn) worth, of quoted French companies' stock exchange value and 27 per cent or FFr1,063bn worth of their bonds. 'This voice has to be listened to,' recognises Jean-Francois Thedore, president of the Paris Bourse. Many of these foreign, particularly Anglo-Saxon, investors have been influenced by the 1992 Cadbury recommendations in the UK for company boards to include more independent, non-executive directors, building on similar practices in the US. Broadly, they would like to see in France more accountability of chairmen/chief executives to their boards, greater involvement of boards in the setting of strategy, auditing of accounts and nominations, a phasing out of cross-directorships held by representatives of big companies who all sit on each others' boards, and more rights for minority shareholders. This last point is particularly important for Anglo-Saxon institutional investors and pension funds, because for prudential reasons they hold only minority stakes in companies in whose management they do not want to be directly involved. Business reaction in France is mixed. Some are highly positive. Andre Levy-Lang, the head of Paribas, enthuses about 'exemplary' boards in the US such as that of Schlumberger on which he sits. For others, it is a question of swimming with the prevailing tide. 'The ever-growing presence of foreign shareholders in French companies obliges us to go forth into the open sea and to adopt Anglo-Saxon canons,' says Gerard Worms, president of the Suez financial and industrial group. The Commission de Bourses, the legal regulator of the stock market, has campaigned for the past 10 years for French company boards to create audit committees, arguing that a regular dialogue between specialised directors and outside auditors would enhance the credibility of annual accounts and boards. Others are more reserved about any wholesale import of Anglo-Saxon practices, particularly in the form of new legislation. 'We don't need a revolution, because practices are already gradually evolving,' says Jean-Louis Beffa, head of the St. Gobain glass-making and industrial group. 'Improvements in behaviour (of company boards) are more pertinent than new rules,' he stresses. The classic example of a law which changed nothing was that of 1966, allowing a two-tier structure, with a supervisory board presided over by a chairman on top of a management board headed by a chief executive. Less than 2 per cent of French companies have adopted this model. It is possible for the posts of president (chairman) and directeur-general (chief executive) to be held separately within a single board structure, as in the US. But this obviously does not appeal much to France's presidents-directeurs generaux (PDGs), as Beffa, who holds both posts at St. Gobain explains. 'When a company has separate chairmen and chief executive officers (CEOs), one always wonders who is the real boss,' he points out. 'This separation can have its uses in a crisis, when for instance in the US the chairman stays to assure continuity, while the CEO changes. But is it such a bad thing for both posts to change in a crisis, as happens in France when the top man goes?' Rather than reducing PDGs' power, there is more support for increasing boardroom control over them. But in a recent survey of directors conducted by the head-hunting consultancy Vuchot Ward Howell, 53 per cent said they did not have enough information to exercise control properly. Seventy per cent reckoned an individual director could not stop a PDG from taking 'dangerous decisions'. Only a minority (40 per cent) believed resignation was an effective form of protest, a view anecdotally confirmed by the failure of Jacques Calvet to carry out his threat to resign from the board of Generale des Eaux on the parachuting in of the young 38-year-old Jean-Francois Messier as heir to Guy Dejouany, veteran PDG of the giant utility. If the outspoken and powerful head of Peugeot is not going to carry out a resignation threat, who, in France, is? The survey reinforced the feeling that a board's power lay in it acting collectively. But this, too, was judged difficult because most directors are co-opted on to boards by the PDG acting alone or sometimes with major shareholders. Indeed, it is the big shareholders dominating the boards of leading French companies who often give foreign or minority shareholders the impression of facing a closed oligarchy. A study by a pair of academics, Michel Bauer and Benedicte Bertin-Mourot, showed that the 1,161 directorships of the top private-sector 100 companies in 1990 were occupied by 797 people. The proportion of people holding multiple cross-directorships is probably no less now, because of the 'cores' of institutional French investors which have been established in recently privatised companies. One possible remedy is to introduce more non-executive directors, independent of management and of shareholders, as the Cadbury report preached in the UK. But this idea draws sharp criticism from some quarters. Bernard Dumon, PDG of the Saint-Louis food, textile and paper group, believes it to be 'a British solution to a British problem', and not transferable to French boards which by law were never allowed as many in-house executive directors as in the UK. Directors representing large shareholders make for a strong and attentive board, Dumon argues, precisely because they have to consolidate any losses into their own accounts. By contrast, French companies seem much more open to putting board members on audit committees, rather than just remuneration committees; the latter are popular mainly because if pay is fixed in sub-committee, as distinct from the full board, it does not have to be published. But the COB recently complained that these audit bodies 'do not have the true independence of real auditing committees made up of outside directors and chaired by one of them'. However, Rene de La Serre sees change as inevitable from his role as president of the Conseil Des Bourses des Valeurs, the stock exchange's governing body. 'In the long run, it will doubtless be necessary to limit this practice (of cross-directorships),' he recognises. 'This is a goal we could fix ourselves, in parallel to the development of our financial markets and therefore of the progressive disappearance of cross-holdings.' He contests the idea that minority shareholders are victimised in France, but says that in the long run, too, he sees the need for 'every director to represent all shareholders collectively'. Until recently, 'there was no notion of the protection of minority shareholders in France', says Herve Thibaut of Deminor, a Franco-Belgian consultancy that has made a business out of championing the small shareholder. He cites the rough ride minority shareholders have had in Eurodisney, and in such operations as the takeovers of La Redoute by Pinault-Printemps and of Wagons-Lit by Accor. The only time French companies are required to commission an independent 'fairness opinion' of their bid is when they hold 95 per cent and can launch a compulsory 'squeeze-out' of the remaining 5 per cent. But the tide is turning. Last summer saw the passage of new legislation to allow shareholders to band together to force company managements to answer questions at annual meetings, to provide specific financial advice or to query auditors reports. To qualify for these rights, shareholders in these associations must hold 'nominative' shares (not very popular for tax evasion reasons) for two years and represent 1 per cent of bigger companies' equity. But it is a start.</p>

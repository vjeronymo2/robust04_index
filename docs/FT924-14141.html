			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Counting the cash For all Mr Lamont's fine words on public spending, the government's borrowing requirement will probably end up not far short of Pounds 40bn next year. The market is right to wonder exactly where the money is supposed to come from. With sterling floating outside the ERM, overseas investors can no longer be relied on to prop up the gilts market. Yet the flow of funds into UK investment institutions is hardly encouraging. Slow dividend growth from equities has reduced cash available for reinvestment. Pension funds are squeezed on two fronts by recession: a shrinking workforce and liabilities arising earlier than expected due to early retirement. Life companies, which now contribute the majority of cash flowing into the UK stock and bond markets, are finding traditional products hard to sell. The squeeze on pension funds could be particularly bad news for equities, which are the best match for pension liabilities and make up over 90 per cent of the average pension fund portfolio. The tougher conditions facing life companies, which pioneered the tentative switch from equities to bonds this year, are especially bad news for gilts. In aggregate, institutional cash flow this year and next is unlikely to be much higher than Pounds 38bn recorded in 1991. The first hint of recovery would ordinarily prompt companies to step up their demands on institutions in the form of rights issues to raise new equity. A spate of cash takeover bids might help relieve the pressure, but, given stretched corporate balance sheets and an aversion to debt, that hardly seems likely. The government may be able to tempt institutions to sell holdings of overseas bonds in favour of gilts, as they did immediately after the general election. With the odds on higher UK inflation, though, this switch now seems harder to justify.</p>

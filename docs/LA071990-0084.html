			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DRIVER ADMITS TO 2ND-DEGREE MURDER  </P> <P> An Escondido man pleaded guilty Wednesday to second-degree murder in the death  of a man struck by a car last March in Southeast San Diego.  </P> <P> Ruben Guzman Valle, 25, was charged with killing Alfredo Chavez Sandoval.  </P> <P> The 33-year-old victim, who went by the nickname Freddie, died of head injuries  when he and another man were struck by the car driven by Guzman.  </P> <P> San Diego Superior Court Judge William Mudd set sentencing for Aug. 15. Guzman  faces a maximum sentence of 15 years to life in prison.  </P> <P> According to testimony from witnesses at an April 26 preliminary hearing,  Guzman hit two people with his car outside a bar during a dispute over a woman.  "The car was the deadly weapon," Deputy Dist. Atty. Phil Walden said.  </P> <P> Guzman had also been charged with assault with a deadly weapon upon Cirenio  Samano, 34, whose leg was broken in the incident, as well as possession of  cocaine. Those charges were dropped after Guzman pleaded guilty to  second-degree murder.  </P> <P> Hilda Castillo testified she came out of the bar with Chavez and saw Guzman get  into his car and drive into a wire fence and another car before hitting the two  men.  </P> <P> Prior to the incident, Guzman was a cook at a Rancho Bernardo seafood  restaurant, according to court records.  </P></p>

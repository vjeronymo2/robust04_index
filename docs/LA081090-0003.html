			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SLIME ATOP WATER STILL A MYSTERY;  </P> <P> VENTURA KEYS: THE CITY HAS POSTED WARNINGS TO SWIMMERS ON THE BEACHES THAT DOT  THIS POSH RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY.  </P> <P> Ventura County health officials on Thursday took water samples for the third  time in three weeks from the Ventura Keys after Keys residents called to  complain about a thick, greenish-brown slimy substance atop the waterways in  front of their residences.  </P> <P> City officials also were called and took their own set of samples, but neither  they nor county inspectors were able to determine immediately either the cause  of the problem or the nature of the substance. Nor were they able to determine  to what degree, if any, the substance was contaminating the waterways.  </P> <P> Both county and city officials said they must wait three to five days for lab  test results before reaching any conclusions.  </P> <P> But Barbara Fosbrink, the city's coastal project manager, said a preliminary  study from the city lab chemist showed that the substance "could be largely  algae and protozoas," which are harmless.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the small beaches that dot this posh, upscale neighborhood of  waterfront residences near the Ventura Harbor remained posted with warnings by  the city alerting prospective swimmers to "exhibit caution/discretion in any  bodily contact with the channel waters."  </P> <P> Those signs were put up after samples taken by county health officials July 25  indicated a "higher-than-normal coliform count" in the channel waters. Coliform  concentrations usually signal contamination from decaying materials such as raw  sewage or dead animals, officials said.  </P> <P> Only a single water sample was taken on that occasion, and county officials  returned last Tuesday for more extensive tests, the results of which are  expected today.  </P> <P> The city took responsibility for that problem last week after determining that  it was caused by a storm drain discharge. In an unsigned statement, the city  said remedial steps had been taken and pronounced the problem all but solved.  </P> <P> So when Keys residents Ray Russum and his next-door neighbor, David Lawhorn,  awoke Thursday morning to discover a pool of slime in front of their homes,  they were upset.  </P> <P> "This looks like the Exxon Valdez!" said Russum, referring to the giant oil  spill off the coast of Alaska.  </P> <P> "I don't know what this is, but I . . . am not going to touch it," Lawhorn  said.  </P> <P> Russum and representatives from the county and city, however, surveyed the  mouths of several storm drain channels that empty into the Keys in separate  expeditions and could find no obvious signs of contamination.  </P> <P> And representatives from both the city and county said the substance found  Thursday did not appear to pose a threat to the residents' health.  </P> <P> "The high levels of bacteriological materials appear to be localized, and  there's no reason to believe at this point that they pose a hazardous problem,"  said Bob Williamson of the Ventura County office of environmental health.  </P> <P> Fosbrink said the "frothy mess" the residents complained about could be natural  living organisms from the channel bottom that were raised to the surface by  "respiratory gas" or carbon monoxide that accumulates at night beneath the  surface and rise in the morning with the high temperatures.  </P> <P> The news from the city brought some relief to Russum. "I'm glad to hear that,  but until I read the reports from the city and the county, I won't be sure," he  said.  </P></p>

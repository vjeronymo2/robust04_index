			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORS SEEK END TO OVERCROWDING IN HOMES  </P> <P> Residents of some Thousand Oaks neighborhoods where homes are used as  boardinghouses are drafting an ordinance aimed at banning overcrowding in  single-family neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Residents such as Shannon Young call the houses that contain six or more  tenants suburban "nightmares" that neighbors have tried to eradicate for nearly  four years.  </P> <P> Young, who lives on Calle Tulipan, complains of five homes in her neighborhood  that are occupied by up to 20 people each, some living in campers and using  back yards as bathrooms. But the overcrowded homes are spread throughout the  city, she said.  </P> <P> Citizens on the 10-member committee will begin meeting next Tuesday in an  effort to stiffen city code enforcement after the City Council last month was  unable to enact a measure that would prevent single-family houses from being  rented out to large numbers of people.  </P> <P> "We feel like we're in the middle of this nightmare," said Young, 31, a mother  of four. "We hope to come up with an ordinance that has enough teeth and bite  to be able to close down some of these houses."  </P> <P> Young was among a group of about 30 people who have asked the City Council to  crack down on landlords and homeowners who allow houses to be used as hotels  and boardinghouses.  </P> <P> Neighbors cite trash-filled yards, lack of parking and loud music as some of  the main problems.  </P> <P> "You feel like you're under siege," Young said. "My son ran into our house  hysterically last week, because there was a group of men standing near our  mailbox. He felt threatened."  </P> <P> Since neighbors began complaining a month ago, some tenants of overcrowded  homes have tried to clean up yards and hide campers that have been used as  living quarters, said Ron Keesling, 42, a neighbor on Calle Tulipan.  </P> <P> "They know people are upset at the way things have been going," Keesling said.  </P> <P> Keesling said he has seen a house two doors down deteriorate steadily in the  past four years. Other occupants have added rooms illegally, converted living  rooms into bedrooms and used garages as bedrooms, he said.  </P> <P> Councilman Lawrence Horner, who helped draft the failed ordinance, said it was  an attempt to resolve complaints by homeowners, real estate agents and  landlords about lack of enforcement.  </P> <P> Last month, neighbors took issue with the proposed ordinance, which tried to  tackle overcrowding problems by limiting occupancy in a residence to six  adults. But it did not limit the number of children.  </P> <P> "With six adults, each adult could have two or three kids," Horner said. "That  numbers game isn't going to be acceptable in the eyes of a lot of people."  </P> <P> City Atty. Mark G. Sellers has said the current ordinance is unconstitutional,  because it limits occupancy to families and groups of no more than five people.  The legal definition of families is unclear, he said.  </P> <P> Horner, explaining opposition to the ordinance, said some homeowners protested  attempts by local governments to regulate the use of their homes.  </P> <P> Some landlords rent out rooms to make mortgage payments, said Jerry Krantz,  president of the Conejo Valley Board of Realtors. Krantz, who has also been  appointed to the committee, predicted disagreement within the committee over an  alternative to the city's draft.  </P> <P> "It's going to be hard for those 10 people to agree on what constitutes a  single-family residence -- how many unrelated people are going to be permitted  to live in a home," he said.  </P> <P> Krantz acknowledged that some landlords flout the law, and neighbors have been  unable to force the city to evict them.  </P> <P> However, tenants of one allegedly overcrowded home on Calle Tulipan said it has  been difficult finding housing they can afford.  </P> <P> Carlos Gonzalez lives in a house in the 600 block of Calle Tulipan with nine  other tenants, including two children. Each adult pays about $100 a month to  live there, he said.  </P> <P> "What can I do?" said Gonzalez, 28. "I have nowhere to go."  </P> <P> Nancy Nazario, an ombudsman for the homeless with county Public Social  Services, said there are about 3,000 homeless in the county, but about five  times that many live in overcrowded conditions, because they are not able to  find affordable housing in Ventura County.  </P> <P> "Places like Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks have been built as suburban,  commuter communities, so there aren't a lot of older sections of town with  small units in them. So people will tend to crowd up in houses," Nazario said.  "Overcrowding is one of the only options poor people have."  </P></p>

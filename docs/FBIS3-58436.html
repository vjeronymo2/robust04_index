			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Anders Bjoerck by </F> correspondent Sten Soederberg, including comment by Rear  Admirral Sten Swedlund, chief of the Coastal Navy; place and  date not given; from the "Echo" program -- recorded]    [Text] Defense Minister Anders Bjoerck is very surprised  over what Rear Admiral Sten Swedlund, the chief of the coastal  navy, told the Echo [program] this morning. Swedlund is of the  opinion that defense costs can be reduced and points out that  the Russian threat is overestimated. Defense Minister Anders  Bjoerck:    [Bjoerck] I have not been engaged on anything else other  than  ensuring that the problems that the navy has with its finances  is fixed. It is a good thing if you look after your own [word  indistinct] before you start talking about savings elsewhere.    [Soederberg] What do you mean?    [Bjoerck] I mean that the Navy has been carrying a budget  deficit year after year. It has cost a lot of money to fix  this, and it is a good thing if one manages to keep to one's  budget before one starts to talk about cuts, as Swedlund does,  even though he says that they should be in the long term.    [Soederberg] Sten Swedlund recently headed a naval visit to  Russia. He was struck by the impression that the Russian Baltic  Navy was way behind Swedish standards. Swedlund judges that a  Russian invasion across the sea could not be carried out. In  THE ECHO this morning, Swedlund said that the defense costs can  be cut.    [Swedlund] I think that it is quite natural in a society  like  the Swedish one, where we now clearly experience that there are  significant economic problems, that the defense economy should  also be discussed.    [Soederberg] Sten Swedlund is chief of the coastal navy.  Don't you think that his views should be taken seriously?    [Bjoerck] Of course, but he has not voiced any such views to  me and I have had many talks with him. They have rather been  about the opposite, more resources, more money for submarine  hunts, and other things. It is only since the commander in  chief recently told Swedlund that the time had come to change  jobs and began to negotiate with him about another post that  Swedlund, now that he is apparently leaving, is voicing views  like this.    [Soederberg] But if highly placed military officials are not  averse to cuts in the defense budget, how come that you are?    [Bjoerck] Swedlund is not at all representative of what  Swedish military officials think in this respect. Now that the  time has come for him to leave, he suddenly goes out to express  his views on the operations he led in the past.</p>

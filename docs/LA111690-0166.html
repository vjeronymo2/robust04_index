			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AROUND TOWN;  </P> <P> NIGHT AND DAY DESIGNS;  </P> <P> ZANG TOI: CHARTREUSE TWEEDS, A LACQUER RED MINI-OPERA COAT, A PINK TRENCH COAT.  THE MALAYSIA-BORN DESIGNER IS NOTHING IF NOT EXOTIC.  </P> <P> Zang Toi never gave a thought to Americanizing his name, which now appears on  the label of one of the hottest new collections in the country. It may read  oddly (the last name is pronounced "toy"), but that hasn't hurt him one bit.  </P> <P> New York-based and Malaysia-born, Toi is entering his second year in business  after a five-year stint assisting New York designer Mary Jane Marcasiano.  </P> <P> You see his quirky Amerasian style in the way he dresses: Shorts made of  gold-threaded songket fabric traditionally used for wedding clothes,  apple-green custom-made blazer, black velvet Belgian slippers.  </P> <P> And you see it in his designs. In his fall collection, available at I. Magnin  Beverly Hills, colors are as exotic as rare flora, such as chartreuse green  tailored tweeds (paired with silver fox), a lacquer red moire mini-opera coat  that reverses to a jewel-colored paisley, and a shocking pink trench coat  paired with a bright red waist cincher. Prices range from $200 (shorts) to  $1,800 (evening coat).  </P> <P> Malaysia, the 29-year-old designer explains, is a multicultural country,  composed of native Malay, Indians and Chinese -- his own heritage -- and he  finds inspiration everywhere.  </P> <P> "I got my sense of color from the Indians who are known for wearing shocking  pink, orange and red together. They treat shocking pink like navy here in  America." BETTY GOODWIN  </P></p>

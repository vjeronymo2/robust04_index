			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Katin report from Brussels: "Russia's Partnership </F> With NATO Is a Misalliance. Kremlin Has Lost Its Nerve Too  Soon"]    [Text] As of today, virtually everyone for whom NATO's  "Partnership for Peace" program is meant has joined it. Except,  so far, for Russia. I was told at the NATO head office that in  principle that matter has already been resolved and that work is  currently under way to draw up a corresponding document. If  this is really so, Russia appears to be the first to have lost  its nerve.    It so happened that all Russia's former Warsaw Pact allies  and some former Soviet Union republics marched to NATO barracks  having joined the "Partnership for Peace" program. U.S.  President Bill Clinton, NATO General Secretary Woerner, and  others have been telling President Yeltsin courteously: The  door is open for you, too, all you need is to enter. An  alternative is isolation. The top Russian authorities have long  hesitated. A situation has come about where either Russia  accepts the "Partnership for Peace" program for fear of  isolation in Europe, or NATO countries will change their tone  and suggest that Russia itself define its place in the  collective defense system. The first option prevailed.    Everything could have turned out differently, however, were  it not for someone's nerves. The thing is that in the NATO head  office and in the capitals of the alliance's key members they  had been bracing themselves for a turn or, maybe, an overture  toward Moscow. For instance, Robert Hunter, U.S. ambassador to  NATO, speaking at a special colloquium organized by the European  Strategic Studies Center in Brussels on 25 February 1993 [as  published], said bluntly: Relations between Russia and NATO  should be a matter of special talks, which, to all appearances,  may end up giving Russia a special status.    Guillaume Parmantier, an authority strategic affairs,  professor at the Political Studies Institute, and deputy  director of the NATO information department, the other day made  a detailed analysis of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina,  pointing out Russia's extraordinary role in its settlement. "We  should not forget," Parmantier writes, "that Russia is a great  power. Any attempt to keep it away from the efforts to ensure  European security would be a great mistake... Giving this power  any security guarantees would make no sense, and inviting it to  join NATO would be absurd."    These and other facts and evidence suggest that sentiments  were gaining ground in NATO to offer Moscow something other than  the "Partnership for Peace." They reasoned validly in NATO that  it would not behoove Russia to join NATO on the same, albeit  gentleman's, principles as Estonia and Albania.    It is quite possible, however, that the principles will  indeed differ from those on which the East Europeans and the  Baltic states have joined it. But what is important is the end  result -- what will happen after the probationary period expires  for countries that have signed the "Partnership for Peace"  program? Everything will proceed in a clear-cut military  fashion: these countries will perfectly naturally become  full-blown members of the North Atlantic Alliance. This is  actually why the transition program was invented. It is then  that Russia will face a new dilemma. If it stays in the  capacity of a "Partnership for Peace" member, this means that  Russia will find itself in isolation once again and will be  subjected to discrimination by comparison with other East  European countries that will have become full NATO members. If  it follows their suit and agrees to full membership, then it  will have to place its armed forces, military plans, and budget  under the control and command of ...the United States. For  under a long-standing tradition, the NATO commander in chief has  always been and remains an American general.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STUDY SAYS POLICE FACE MANPOWER CRISIS  </P> <P> San Diego employs 1.6 officers for every thousand residents, but the city  police union analyzed the number of police actually working on the street and  found the ratio far lower.  </P> <P> In a station-to-station study by the Police Officers' Assn., the labor  organization concluded that many areas of San Diego are protected by an  on-the-street police manpower level of one officer per 15,000 to 19,000  residents.  </P> <P> Although the city now funds 1.6 officers per 1,000 residents, national averages  call for a minimum of 2 or more officers for every 1,000.  </P> <P> San Diego has a total of 1,821 sworn officers.  </P> <P> "Manpower has reached a state where officers' safety is critical and at an  all-time low," said Willie P. Smith, a patrol sergeant in the department's  Northern Division and the study's author.  </P> <P> "To say we presently have 1.6 officers per thousand is misleading and does not  represent the number of officers needed or available to handle police problems.  It is similar to a racehorse owner saying he has 20 jockeys but only one of  them can ride a horse."  </P> <P> Steve McMillan, a POA vice president, said Monday that many of the city's sworn  officers work desk jobs and other non-emergency assignments, while others are  on vacation or injury and sick leave.  </P> <P> "It's the beat cops who are suffering," he said. "It's the guy in the uniform."  </P> <P> The official number of sworn Police Department members, which includes  supervisors, desk assignments, injured and light-duty personnel, has been set  at 1.6 officers per thousand residents for several years. Recently, however,  city and police administrators have been trying to increase the number of  uniformed officers on the streets.  </P> <P> Cmdr. Larry Gore, a police spokesman, said police administrators are aware that  on-the-street staffing levels are lower than the 1.6 ratio. "I'm not at all  surprised," he said of the POA study.  </P> <P> The city fiscal year budget that recently ended had allocated $139.9 million to  the Police Department. In May, City Manager John Lockwood proposed a  $145-million police budget for fiscal year 1990-91, and the City Council  eventually gave tentative approval to $153 million. That number is expected to  be given final approval today. The extra $8 million was earmarked to restore  the police community safety officer program, the boat patrol program and the  horse patrol unit, all of which would have been lost with Lockwood's lower  funding recommendation. But, had the City Council scuttled the horse and boat  programs, they would have freed up more than a dozen officers to work regular  beat patrol, city officials said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, city officials also are considering a ballot initiative for November  that they hope will bring in new money for street cops.  </P></p>

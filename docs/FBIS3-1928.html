			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "special commentator" from the "News and Press </F> Review" program: "From Lei Feng to Xu Honggang"]    [Text] With the approach of spring, a resounding name is  read with admiration by people on the land of China. This name  is Xu Honggang, a squad leader of a certain unit under the Jinan  Military Region and a young hero who is ready to take up the  cudgels for a just cause.    On the eve of the Spring Festival, General Secretary Jiang  Zemin issued a call for learning from Xu Honggang. Thus, an  upsurge of learning from a hero of the times and promoting  healthy tendencies in society has been rapidly started in areas  both north and south of the Chang Jiang.    This reminds us of the radiant and enchanting spring 31  years  ago when Comrade Mao Zedong issued a call for learning from  Comrade Lei Feng. Lei Feng's noble ideas, character, morals,  and charisma have influenced millions of people and encouraged  them to pursue their lofty ideals in life over the past 31  years. Xu Honggang is an outstanding representative of those  people.    Why can the deeds of Lei Feng and Xu Honggang, two young  soldiers of different times, excite people in the depth of their  hearts? When we review these heroes' noble ideas and their  processes of growth, it is not so difficult for us to find a  common characteristic among them -- Both Lei Feng and Xu  Honggang have been models in realizing our party's purpose of  serving the people wholeheartedly. In his life and career, Lei  Feng cherished and loved the people so much. He did numerous  good turns for the masses all his life, which is a vivid  portrayal of his devoting his limited life to the unlimited  cause of serving the people.    In an emergency, Xu Honggang expressed his loyalty and  devotion to the people at lightning speed by waging a  life-and-death struggle against a ruffian with a knife to  protect people's property and lives. From Lei Feng to Xu  Honggang, heroic deeds are not quite the same, but they radiate  with the glory of the concept of serving the people and reflect  the mental attitude of communists and contemporary youths.    When many old people hear the term of serving the people, a  historical picture presents itself before their eyes: Fifty  years ago, shortly after a fighter by the name of Zhang Side  laid down his life, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered his famous  speech "Serve the People." This term of serving the people has  encouraged generation after generation of communists and youths  of noble aspirations to fight bloody battle for the interests of  the nation, with one stepping into the breach as another fell,  and to be the first to bear hardships and the last to enjoy  comforts. Emerging on battlefields were Dong Chengrui, who laid  down his life under a hail of bullets while flinging a grenade  into an enemy pillbox, and Huang Jiguang, who blocked an enemy  embrasure with his own body. Coming to the fore in the  peacetime of construction was Jiao Yulu, a good cadre who spared  no effort in the performance of his duty for the people, and  Major Shu Ning of the Artillery Corps who sacrificed himself for  the life of a soldier.    Our great motherland has numerous heroes. Although they are  engaged in different trades or professions, what they are  spiritually nurtured and the great vigor they display can find  their sources from the term of serving the people. Serving the  people is precisely the basic purpose of the CPC. Let each of  us communists realize this purpose as Lei Feng and Xu Honggang  did, and perform our duties in an outstanding manner at our  respective posts!    Xu Honggang is a contemporary hero who has come to the fore  in the new situation in which our country is developing a  socialist market economy. In our society, some people  misunderstand the market economy and set the principle of  material benefits against the concept of serving the people.  For some time, the concept of serving the people has become  diluted in or has even disappeared from the minds of some  people. This is why the following phenomena have occurred: an  old man over 80 and a pregnant woman jumped into the water to  rescue those being drowned, while strong, young people looked on  coldly; people forgot their integrity under the temptation of  personal gain or saw someone in mortal danger without lifting a  finger to save him.    The market economy we want to establish and develop is a  socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics. It is  aimed at accelerating the development of the productive forces  and achieving the four modernizations to satisfy the increasing  material and cultural needs of the people. To develop a high  degree of material civilization is a component of the socialist  market economy, and to develop a high degree of spiritual  civilization is also one of its components. This determines  that while establishing a socialist market economic structure,  we must attain a lofty realm of thought, develop the spirit of  selfless devotion, and always bear in mind the basic purpose of  serving the people wholeheartedly.    Fifty years have elapsed from Zhang Side to Lei Feng and to  Xu Honggang. During these years, earthshaking changes have  taken place in our motherland. The purpose of serving the  people set by our party has been inherited and pursued by one  generation of people after another. General Secretary Jiang  Zemin pointed out: Xu Hongang's deeds embody the tradition of  the Red Army, the People's Liberation Army, and the Communist  Party. Practice once again shows us that when the tradition of  the party and the spirit of the times are integrated, it will  nurture millions of new heroes and models. Let us hold high the  torch of serving the people and greatly push forward the four  modernization of the great motherland!</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Mikhaylov, Russian minister of atomic </F> energy, by NHK Russian Bureau Chief Kazuo Kobayashi on 17 June;  place not given; from NHK news -- Mikhaylov in Russian with  Japanese translation provided in subtitles; translated from the  subtitles]    [Text] Regarding North Korea's suspected nuclear arms  development, Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Mikhaylov  disclosed his belief on 17 June that North Korea needs more than  10 years before being able to acquire nuclear weapons. He then  criticized the movement to impose sanctions, saying that the  international community should not isolate North Korea.    Energy Minister Mikhaylov explained his understanding of the  attitude of North Korea, which rejected IAEA inspections, saying  that the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] is making  excessive demands on North Korea. On the current state of North  Korea's nuclear arms development, he said as follows:    [Begin Mikhaylov recording] I believe that North Korea does  not have nuclear weapons. It will take them from 10 to 20  years, even if they begin producing nuclear weapons right now.  [end recording]    [Begin Kobayashi recording] Russia is opposing the movement  in the United States and other countries to impose sanctions  against North Korea. Foreign Minister Kozyrev said that no  prior consultations had been made with Russia regarding concrete  proposals on the sanctions. However, the foreign minister's  opposition and Energy Minister Mikhaylov's recent remarks  reflect their twisted feelings that Russia is being treated  lightly.    Russia is saying that not isolating North Korea is a better  approach. This is the outcome of such a stance, and is Russia's  appeal and advice to the international community. [end recording]</p>

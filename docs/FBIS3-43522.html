			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Today, opposition parties issued their first  reaction to Wednesday [5 January]'s attack on the main military  base in Lome, Togo's capital. Since then, there has been a war  of words across the border between Togo and Ghana. Togo says  the attack was launched by dissidents based in Ghana. The  Ghanaian Government denies any involvement and says the Togolese  forces shelled Ghanaian territory. Now, as Ebow Godwin reports  from Lome, one of the opposition parties based in Togo is  insisting it had nothing to do with the attack:    [Begin Godwin recording] According to the Action Committee  for Renewal led by Lawyer Yaovi Agboyibor, the latest act of  violence against Togo was totally undemocratic and certainly not  in the best interest of the majority of the Togolese people.  They said and I quote, we all reservedly condemn the latest  armed attack, no matter where it comes from, because it is  undemocratic, unquote. The party, therefore, appeals to the  government to take immediate measures to restore the situation  in Togo back to normalcy in order to create the right atmosphere  for holding the forthcoming parliamentary elections.    The coordinating body of the New Political Forces, which is  an amalgamation of several opposition parties seeking to create  a balance of power between the traditional opposition groups and  President Eyadema, also described the armed attack as a  deliberate conspiration meant to reverse the move toward the  attainment of parliamentary democracy in Togo. A spokesman for  the group, Ephrem Dokenou, accused selfish people who were  unhappy about the return of peace and political stability in  Togo of trying to throw Togo once more into a state of chaos and  insecurity. The New Political Forces emphasized that Togo  already has a credible political program in place, having  already conducting presidential elections last August. The New  Forces recalled that currently an international committee,  comprising France, Germany, United States of America, and Egypt,  were engaged in helping both the opposition groups and President  Eyadema organize free and fair multiparty parliamentary  elections. He said, and I quote, those who want to create chaos  under the pretext that Togo has no credible political program  must look elsewhere, unquote.    However, the Group of [Pan-African] Social Democrats, GSP,  led by Professor Messan Gnininvi, Antoine Folly, and Zarifou  Ayeva, denied allegations currently being made in certain  quarters that their group, which was boycotting the forthcoming  parliamentary elections, was behind the recent armed attack.  Our hands are clean, the group declared. [end recording]</p>

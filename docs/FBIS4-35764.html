			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz with </F> unidentified correspondents at Foreign Ministry Headquarters in  Beirut on 2 June--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] At dawn today a massacre was  committed in the 'Ayn Zarzarah area of Ba'labakk. Would you  tell us what measures Lebanon will adopt to confront Israeli  aggression?    [Buwayz] The military operation that the Israeli army  conducted at dawn today is a blatant aggression on Lebanese  sovereignty and security. It also constitutes a major challenge  to the peace process. We believe that this operation is  tantamount to an all-out war against Lebanon. It clearly  reveals Israel's intentions concerning the peace process,  contrary to what it says to the world -- pretending to seek  peace.    In a few moments, the Higher Defense Council will convene.  It will review the details of this operation before adopting a  suitable stand.    [Correspondent] Is Lebanon going to file a complaint with  the  UN Security Council concerning this massacre?    [Buwayz] I believe that the proper decision will be adopted  after reviewing the various aspects of the matter. It should be  noted that the massacre has claimed some 45 lives so far.    [Correspondent] Was one of the objectives of that operation  to cover up the issue of Israel's diversion of Lebanese water?    [Buwayz] As far as the issue of water is concerned, I would  like to be accurate about this matter. Of course, Israel's  intentions and ambitions in Lebanese lands and water are neither  surprising nor new. Information circulated over past few years  is not new. We repeatedly wrote to the United Nations with  requests to send fact-finding committees to verify information  that we received from several sources. The UN reply clearly  emphasized that there was no evidence of water theft, either on  the surface or underground, through pipes, pumps, or tunnels.  [passage omitted]    In any case, we sent a message to UN Secretary General Dr.  Butrus Butrus-Ghali this morning, requesting him to dispatch an  experts committee to inspect al-Khardali area and tell us  whether Israel is, or is not, stealing water directly or  indirectly. Hence, we are waiting for the UN findings after its  contacts with UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia  [ESCWA].    I believe that UN official spokesman Timor Goksel made a  statement this morning, which said that press reports citing  international forces are false, that these forces took part in  no committee, and that they have no information on the issue.    Hence, we are waiting for the UN secretary general to  appointment an experts committee, instead of relying on  speculations or analysis that can never be accepted as  documents. If circulated reports are confirmed, we will file a  complaint with the UN Security Council, demanding the adoption  of the necessary measures.    [Correspondent] There is an impression that you and Chamber  of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri disagree on this matter,  particularly since your return from Amman.    [Buwayz] Speaker Birri made statements yesterday based on  press reports. We cannot rely on press reports alone. We have  assessed what we received from ESCWA and discovered ESCWA does  not adopt a specific stand on circulated information. This  information is not based on findings of a specific committee or  a field inspection; it is based on analysis and estimates. We  share ESCWA's concern over Lebanon's waters. But there is a big  difference between this concern and documented facts. [passage  omitted]</p>

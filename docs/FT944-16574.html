			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Pressure grows for tighter state aid rules: In the wake of the Bull case, Brussels faces criticism for being too soft on subsidies The European Commission's decision to allow the French government to pay Bull, the ailing French computer group, FFr11bn (Pounds 1.32bn) of state aid, will again put Brussels' record on ensuring fair competition under a critical spotlight. It comes only three months after the commission allowed a vast capital injection of FFr20bn of state funds to the bankrupt Air France and, while the Commission argues that this latest case is different, this is bound to fuel criticism of Brussels' approach to state aids. Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, has always argued - realistically - that decisions on state aid cannot be taken in a vacuum. He takes the view that political and social factors have to be considered, as well as the likelihood of returning an enterprise to viability, which he believes to be high in the case of Bull. But there is concern among some in the commission, and certainly within industry that the commission is treading too softly, and that member states have become adept at getting their own way. Following the succession of high-profile airline cases over the summer - handled by the transport directorate and not Mr Van Miert's competition directorate - pressure is growing for a change in the procedures for assessing state aids. 'At the moment we have a very heavy administrative system but with results that are not very convincing,' said a commission official. 'Industry is complaining about the lack of neutrality and transparency, the length of procedures, and the distorting effects of sectoral agreements covering areas such as textiles, synthetic fibres and cars.' A paper produced last month by the commission's industry directorate identified the need to tighten up procedures. 'Since the removal of internal frontiers (within the European Union), the risks of dominant positions and the distortions caused by state aid  - which remain too great - are growing appreciably,' it said. One of the main problems identified in the paper was the need to make existing procedures more efficient and more transparent. This theme was also taken up by the Confederation of British Industry in a pamphlet entitled Controlling State Aid. It argued that deadlines need to be set for the formal examination of state aid cases. 'The five years that passed before action was taken and decisions were reached in the Ilva Italian steel case was quite unacceptable,' it says. It also argued that recovery procedures for illegal aid needed to be tightened, citing the case of a Belgian textiles company which, eight years after a state aid payment had been found illegal by the European court of justice, had still not paid back the money. On transparency, the CBI points out that at present it is difficult for interested third parties to contribute information or views at an early stage when the commission is considering whether there is in principle a case to answer. The industry directorate says the same: 'Third parties are not as involved in procedures as they are, for example, in merger cases. There should be more consultation.' Mr Nick Forwood QC, who specialises in state aid cases says: 'Procedurally, it is still very much in the hands of the commissioners to decide what is in the interests of the community. The majority tend to perceive cases not in terms of competition, but more in terms of specific interests.' The second problem is that regional exemptions and industry agreements allow some state aid to go unchallenged. 'The instruction of state aid files is not neutral because you have a combination of sectoral and horizontal frameworks which lead to different treatments for different industries without any real justification,' said an official from the competition directorate. 'It seems to me that big investments made in regions where the levels of subsidy allowed are very high, have probably resulted in distortions of competition,' said another official. Similarly distorting are industry agreements covering sectors such as textiles, synthetic fibres and cars introduced originally for economic or serious structural reasons. 'These are the result of special situations,' said a commission official, 'but they then seem to be kept for ever.' All these points are currently the subject of discussion in the industry and competition directorates but it is unclear yet whether new proposals will be put to the commission. However, there is no denying that governments are getting better at presenting their cases on state aid in a way that allows them to 'get around' Brussels. With the rate of negative decisions on state aids last year only 1.05 per cent, there is scope for the commission to tighten procedures and close some of the loopholes.</p>

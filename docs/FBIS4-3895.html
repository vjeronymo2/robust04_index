			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with unidentified official "in charge </F> of the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court" by ZHONGGUO  TONGXUN SHE reporter in Beijing on 24 April]    [Text] Beijing, 24 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Our staff  reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Beijing  Municipal Higher People's Court on the hearing and adjudication  of the Xi Yang case. The official being interviewed responded  to questions raised by our staff reporter. His compiled answers  are as follows:    [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] The Xi Yang case has caused much  concern in Hong Kong. Could you please give us an idea of what  this case is all about?    [Unidentified official] In June and July 1993, Xi Yang  arrived in Beijing in his capacity as a journalist covering  "Project Hope," the Sino-British talks, and the Preliminary Work  Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region. Xi Yang confessed that after he came to  Beijing, he started mainly to gather classified financial and  economic information, as was specifically instructed by MING PAO  executives. After learning that his friend Tian Ye was working  for the People's Bank of China [PBC], he took the initiative to  contact Tian and had him steal, pry, and illegally provide a  large quantity of state financial and economic secrets, which  included: China's banknote designs, top- secret information  about the PBC's plan to sell gold on the international market,  exchange rate adjustments, and the PBC's plan to raise interest  rates on saving deposits again in July 1993, as well as a  document, "Notes on Provisional Control Measures for  Foreign-Funded Financial Institutions Engaged in Renminbi  Transactions," which was labeled as "classified." Xi Yang wrote  stories according to the data obtained from Tian Ye and sent  them to Hong Kong's MING PAO for publication, causing great  losses to the country's economy.    The Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court heard the  case and concluded that Xi Yang's acts constituted the crime of  stealing and prying into state secrets and that this was an  especially serious case. In accordance with the National  People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee's "Supplementary  Provisions on Punishing the Crime of Divulging State Secrets"  and Article 51, Section 1 of the "Criminal Procedural Law of the  People's Republic of China," the Beijing Municipal Intermediate  People's Court sentenced Xi Yang to 12 years in prison and three  years deprivation of political rights.    [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Was the penalty too heavy for Xi  Yang?    [Unidentified official] The NPC Standing Committee's  "Supplementary Provisions on Punishing the Crime of Divulging  State Secrets" read: "Stealing, prying, and illegally providing  state secrets to overseas institutions, organizations, and  persons," "in an especially serious case, shall be punished with  a prison sentence of 10 years or longer, life imprisonment, or  the death sentence, with deprivation of political rights." The  Beijing Intermediate People's Court heard the case and came to  the conclusion that Xi Yang's stealing and prying into a large  quantity of Chinese financial and economic secrets had caused  great losses to the country's economy, so this was an especially  serious criminal case which should be penalized with a prison  sentence of 10 years or longer, life imprisonment, or the death  sentence. Taking into consideration the fact that Xi Yang had  shown signs of repentance, the court handed down a lenient  punishment. Therefore, the 12-year prison sentence and two-year  deprivation of political rights passed on Xi Yang was  appropriate.    [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Why is Xi Yang's case considered  especially serious? Could you please specify what kind of  serious losses were incurred?    [Unidentified official] The classification of state  financial and economic information stolen and pried into by Xi  Yang was very high, the quantity was big, and the losses caused  were serious. But the specifics are still state secrets, so we  cannot publicize them.    [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Was Xi Yang's case heard in  accordance with the law?    [Unidentified official] After receiving the indictment  filed by a branch of the Beijing Municipal People's  Procuratorate in reference to Xi Yang's case on 14 December  1993, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court formed a  collegiate bench according to law and started the hearing  process for this case. During that time, because some evidence  required verification, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate  People's Court returned the case to a branch of the Beijing  Municipal People's Procuratorate on 27 January 1994 for further  verification. On 20 February, the branch of the Beijing  Municipal People's Procuratorate once again handed the case over  to the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court for  hearings. On 28 March 1994, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate  People's Court passed judgment on this case according to law.  Xi Yang refused to accept the judgment of the first hearing and  lodged an appeal. The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court  heard the case and on 15 April issued a final judgment, which  rejected the appeal and upheld the original verdict. Hearings  on this case held by the courts were in strict conformity with  legal procedures.    [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Why was the hearing on Xi Yang's case  not a public one?    [Unidentified official] Article 111 of the "Criminal  Procedural Law of the People's Republic of China" reads: "The  first hearing of a case by the people's court should be  conducted publicly. But no public hearing should be held on  cases that involve state secrets or personal privacy." Xi  Yang's case involved state secrets, so the people's court,  pursuant to the law, did not hold a public hearing on this case,  but explained to the defendant the reasons for an in camera  hearing at the court session. But during the process of the  hearings, all the defendant's rights in relation to litigation  were protected. Article 121 of the "Criminal Procedural Law of  the People's Republic of China" reads: "All judgments shall be  announced publicly." The judgment of the first hearing and the  ruling of the second hearing on Xi Yang were both announced  publicly, and written judgments and rulings were forwarded to Xi  Yang himself after the public announcements.    [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Was Xi Yang's right to a defense  protected?    [Unidentified official] The criminal procedural law  stipulates that, besides exercising his right to defend himself,  the defendant may also engage a counsel to plead for him. When  forwarding a copy of the indictment to Xi Yang, the Beijing  Municipal Intermediate People's Court informed Xi Yang that he  had the right to defend himself or to engage a counsel to plead  for him. Xi Yang declined to engage a counsel and said that he  would exercise his right to defend himself when the court  opened. During the first hearing, Xi Yang made a full defense  of himself. At the second hearing, the Beijing Municipal Higher  People's Court also informed Xi Yang of his right to a defense.  Xi Yang said that besides exercising his right to defend  himself, he would also ask his father to engage a lawyer to  plead for him. Xi's father first went to a lawyer working with  the China Legal Affairs Center to act as Xi Yang's counsel at  the second hearing. Later, because this lawyer turned down the  engagement, Xi's father approached two lawyers, namely, Peng  Xuejun [1756 1331 6511] and Xu Cheng [6079 2892], who were  affiliated to the Beijing Municipality's Jingtian Law Firm, and  asked them to defend Xi Yang. After they accepted the  engagement, the lawyers looked through the relevant dossiers and  had a consultation with the appellant, Xi Yang. Afterward, they  submitted a written defense statement to the court. At its  scrutinizing session, the collegiate bench gave full  consideration to the defense statements made by Xi Yang and his  counsels. Therefore, the courts at both levels protected Xi  Yang's right to a defense in handling this case.    [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Some people said the second hearing  on Xi Yang's case was too rushed. Is this true?    [Unidentified official] Article 141 of the "Criminal  Procedural Law of the People's Republic of China" reads: The  procedure by which the people's court handles an appeal or a  counter-appeal at a second hearing shall conform to the  procedure of the first hearing. After the Beijing Municipal  Intermediate People's Court pronounced the verdict according to  law on 28 March, Xi Yang refused to accept the judgment and  lodged an appeal. The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court  filed the case on 30 March and formed a collegiate bench in  accordance with the law. The collegiate bench listened to Xi  Yang's grounds for the appeal, examined the dossiers, verified  the relevant evidence, interrogated the appellant Xi Yang, and  the defendant in the first hearing, Tian Ye, and studied defense  statements submitted by Xi Yang and his counsels. After a full  examination of the facts established at the first hearing and  the applicable legal provisions, the Beijing Municipal Higher  People's Court made a final ruling on 15 April.    Article 142 of the "Criminal Procedural Law of the People's  Republic of China" reads: "After the people's court takes up an  appeal or a counter-appeal for a second hearing, it should wind  up the case within one month or a maximum of one and a half  months." In Xi Yang's case, the facts were clear and the  evidence was conclusive and sufficient. Neither Xi Yang nor his  counsels challenged the facts established by the initial  verdict. Therefore, it was very normal for the second hearing  court to conclude the case within 17 days. Xi Yang's counsels  submitted their written defense statement to the court on the  morning of 13 April, and the court made its final ruling on 15  April. There was enough time for studying and considering the  counsels' recommendations.    [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Why was Xi Yang's behavior considered  a crime rather than normal activity of a journalistic nature?    [Unidentified official] According to relevant stipulations,  Hong Kong and Macao reporters who wish to gather news on the  mainland must apply to the relevant authorities, stating the  object, content, and period of coverage, and they may not come  to the mainland to gather news until approval is obtained. If a  reporter needs to gather some additional news after completing  the task originally approved, he should apply to the relevant  local authorities and may not proceed until approval is  obtained. Hong Kong and Macao reporters gathering news on the  mainland are protected by the laws of the state; in the  meantime, they must abide by the laws and decrees of the state  as well as the relevant regulations. They may not engage in  activities which are incompatible with their status as  reporters. Hong Kong and Macao reporters entering the country  for the express purpose of visiting relatives or sightseeing may  not engage in news gathering activities. Xi Yang did not apply  for permission to interview the PBC, let alone obtain approval.  His act was an obvious violation of the relevant state  stipulations regarding overseas reporters' journalistic  activities in mainland China.    Xi Yang violated the relevant stipulations on gathering news  on the mainland. To make this point clear is for the sole  purpose of illustrating the fact that as far as news gathering  is concerned, he was not doing this in a normal way either. But  the penalty passed on him according to law was not because he  failed to apply for permission to gather news through normal  procedures, but because he violated the law, and, worse still,  did so knowingly. It was Xi Yang who took the initiative to  incite Tian Ye to steal, pry, and illegally provide state  secrets. Anyone with a bit of common sense understands that the  financial and economic intelligence Xi Yang stole and pried into  were important state secrets. Xi Yang, who is a reporter and  had lived and worked on the mainland for a long time, should  have known better. After the case was discovered, the Chinese  financial and economic information that Xi Yang stole, pried  into, and published in an overseas newspaper was identified by  the state institution concerned as important state secrets.  Therefore, Xi Yang's behavior was nothing to do with freedom of  the press, but was an act in violation of the law.</p>

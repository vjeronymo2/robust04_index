			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Compagnie Bancaire net tumbles 23% COMPAGNIE Bancaire yesterday highlighted the problems of the French financial services sector by announcing a 23 per cent fall in group net profit, to FFr1.15bn (Dollars 210m) in 1991 compared with 1990. The company, the largest part of the Paribas investment bank - with interests in leasing, consumer credit and direct mail insurance - attributed the fall to the difficult economic climate in France and the UK. It was also affected by a poor performance from its Sinvim business, which was hit by the sharp fall in the Paris property market. The news of Compagnie Bancaire's slide follows a warning from Paribas that it had made its first-ever loss in 1991. The two main US credit rating agencies, Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, have since put Paribas under surveillance. Compagnie Bancaire said the value of credit distributed by its businesses last year fell by 6 per cent to FFr76bn. One reason was the economic slowdown in France, which sapped confidence and drained demand for loans. Another was a strategic shift into higher margin business. The recession in the UK, its main market outside France, was chiefly responsible for the 21 per cent fall - to FFr16.4bn - in credit distributed to other countries. By contrast, the company benefited from strong growth in life insurance and savings.</p>

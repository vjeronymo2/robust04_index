			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / US ordered to compensate Iran An international tribunal has ordered the US to compensate Tehran for property frozen in the US since 1979, AP reports from The Hague. A compensation figure is still to be adjudicated by the tribunal, set up in 1981 under the Algiers Accords. Some of the property has been in limbo since Washington imposed an embargo against Iran in response to the seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran. Officials in Washington said yesterday they would consider the tribunal's ruling enforceable.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / People: Edwards heads for Antipodes The publisher Hodder Headline has appointed Malcolm Edwards, 43, as a director. Edwards replaces Michael Duffett - who resigned in January - in two operational roles; managing director of the company's Australian wing and chairman of its New Zealand subsidiary. Edwards is leaving his job as managing director of HarperCollins' subsidiary in South Africa, where he has spent most of his career. Headline was founded in 1986 by Tim Hely-Hutchinson and two collaborators but merged last year with Hodder &amp; Stoughton. Paul Coley, the company's finance director, explains that Hodder Headline alighted on Edwards largely as a result of HarperCollins' South African outpost having handled Hodder Headline's books on an agency basis. The Australian and New Zealand operations, he says, are the most important non-UK operations for the company.</p>

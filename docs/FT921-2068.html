			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Waldegrave hits at NHS claim HEALTH secretary Mr William Waldegrave has written to the editors of national newspapers to protest at the Labour party's use of tragic individual cases to bolster its attack on the government's NHS reforms. In his letter, Mr Waldegrave claims that 'very many of the individual cases alleged have, on investigation, turned out to be completely false or heavily distorted'. He says that by the time the hospitals concerned have established the truth 'the lies have been spread'. Conservative party managers were incensed by a Labour party advertisement asserting that an 18-month-old baby born with a heart defect 'died because the NHS is short of money. Meanwhile, the Tories are cutting taxes to keep their election hopes alive.' Labour insisted the advertisement was factually correct.</p>

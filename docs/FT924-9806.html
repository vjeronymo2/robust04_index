			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Chilean telecoms group considers Dollars 150m issue COMPANIA de Telefonos de Chile, the Chilean telecommunications company quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, may place between Dollars 150m and Dollars 200m of convertible bonds in US and European financial markets. Claudio Garcia, CTC's financial vice-president, said the company's board would meet this week to consider the bond issue. 'They will be 10-year bonds convertible into shares after the third year, but we have not yet fixed the coupon they will carry,' Mr Garcia said. Goldman Sachs is to manage the placement, and CTC's present shareholders are to be given first option in taking up the offer. Telefonica of Spain owns a controlling 46 per cent stake in CTC. CTC is the main local telephone company in Chile and controls a sizeable portion of the long-distance and cellular telephone market. The bond issue would help finance CTC's Dollars 500m investment outlays planned for 1993, as well as reduce borrowings. The company posted an accumulated net income of 46.27bn pesos (Dollars 123m) for the first nine months of 1992.</p>

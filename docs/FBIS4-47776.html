			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Eastern Transvaal Premier-elect </F> Matthews Phosa; place and date not given; italicized passages  recorded]    [Text] Matthews Phosa is the premier-elect for the  provincial legislature of the Eastern Transvaal Province. A  profile on a man who has had some hard times, but also today's  success.    Matthews Phosa is head of the ANC Legal Department and  chairperson of the ANC, Eastern Transvaal. Phosa was born in  (Mbombela) township, Nelspruit, in 1952.    [Phosa] I have this urban...I mean, rural background as  a child and it was not easy living in the lowest conditions in  Nelspruit. These are our stinking townships. I mean, the  health conditions are bad.    At Phosa's secondary school the students protested against  racial discrimination from their white teachers.    [Phosa] That was my turning point. They punished us  for that. They humiliated us for that and it has left an  indelible mark on me, and I never stopped since that time.    Phosa matriculated with a distinction in agricultural  science  and went on to study law at Turfloop. He was already very  politically motivated.    [Phosa] When I looked at the conditions of our people I  realized that we needed more lawyers than we had and I think  that time there were few -- and I think that we had very few to  fight for the rights of our people in (?courts) and at various  other levels of society.    After completing his articles he started a legal firm and  acquired a number of businesses. Phosa was also active in the  political leadership of the underground and was linked with  Mozambique and Swaziland. In 1984 he went into exile after a  leak to the police.    [Phosa] And I was running a number of business. I had  my legal practice, I had a construction company. I was a  director in various companies. I had a mortuary. I had to  leave everything, including leave my dear wife and little  daughter and go into exile.    After military training in East Germany his unit infiltrated  the Eastern Transvaal border.    [Phosa] ...commander, and I have a reputation in the  army as a commander. I've got enough battle experience and I've  been tested in most difficult conditions of battle.    As a lawyer he has been involved in defending cadres of the  movement and in organizing the ANC legal department. Phosa  remains committed to the Eastern Transvaal serving the region as  ANC chairman. Matthews Phosa heads the provincial list for the  Eastern Transvaal.</p>

The coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  has been pleading with the LDP to agree to convene the  two-chamber consultative body comprising 10 legislators each  from the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors.    In a meeting with reporters, Hosokawa hinted that he would  explore the possibility of arriving at a compromise on political  reform bills through the proposed joint panel.    The calls for the consultative body became loud after the  upper chamber on Friday voted down Hosokawa's package calling  for completely redesigning the mechanism for electing members of  the powerful lower house.    The directors of the lower chamber's Diet Steering Committee  from the ruling and opposition camps are slated to assemble  Monday to discuss convening the proposed two-chamber conference,  they said.    If they agree to put the proposal to set up the consultative  body to a vote, the lower chamber will vote on the proposal  Tuesday, coalition officials said.    LDP opponents of Hosokawa's package are urging the LDP  leadership not to agree to the establishment of such a  consultative body, saying it may open the way for formulation of  a compromise package, they said.    If the lower chamber votes to ask the upper chamber to set  up  the consultative body, the body would immediately start talks  for reconciling differences between the coalition's package and  the LDP's counterproposals, the officials said.    Unless Hosokawa could secure LDP consent to hammer out the  compromise package, he would be forced to observe his  oft-repeated vow to "take the responsibility" -- an euphemism  for disbanding the cabinet or dissolving the lower chamber, they  said.    Appearing on a television program, former Foreign Minister  Michio Watanabe urged the LDP leadership on Sunday not to agree  to work out a compromise package that would replace the current  multiseat constituency system for the lower house with any  system comprising single-seat districts.</p>

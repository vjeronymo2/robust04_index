Holieway, a star at Banning High in Wilmington, was a member of the Oklahoma  team from 1984 to 1988.  </P> <P> Holieway said he received a letter from Long Beach officials saying the firing  had nothing to do with Thompson's allegations.  </P> <P> Long Beach officials could not be reached Thursday night.

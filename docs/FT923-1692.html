			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Leading Article: UK policy after the debacle A DEPRESSING feature of the economic prospects before the UK is that both the people and the institutions responsible for the ERM debacle are apparently to remain in charge. Little less disturbing is the clamour for dramatically lower interest rates. The UK looks set to embark on another 'go' phase in the series of stop-go cycles that mark its decline. Yet there are alternatives. The question is whether the country is too frivolous to choose them. Judged by their pronouncements after the pound's exit from the ERM, neither the prime minister nor the chancellor fully understood what they were engaged in. To complain of 'fault lines' in the ERM as if nobody had ever noticed that the Bundesbank is the pivotal central bank and Germany the main player is peculiar. The Bundesbank's role was the justification for entering the system. Nor can the UK complain persuasively about the unforeseen consequences of German unification, since it was the only member, apart from Portugal, to enter after that event. Still less reasonable are the government's comments about the unforeseeable nature of last week's events. The tendency for semi-fixed exchange rate systems to generate overwhelming runs on weak currencies is hardly news. Has the Treasury forgotten what happened in 1931? Nor can blame for the catastrophe be cast on the Bundesbank's whispers against sterling. With little prospect of a domestic recovery, it was the credibility of a commitment to do whatever was necessary to defend sterling  - not, as officials insisted, the chance of devaluation  - that was seen to be zero. Limited confidence Strange though it may now seem, the prime minister was recently musing about when sterling might displace the D-Mark as the ERM's anchor. Now sterling is plummeting fast, to DM2.5375 by last night. But wisely, in view of the damage already done to the UK's relations with Germany, the government does not intend an early return to the ERM. As the chancellor of the exchequer has pointed out, this means that 'judgment has to be applied'. Unfortunately, there can now be limited confidence in that judgment. Mr Lamont proposes to look at a number of financial indicators, including narrow money, broad money, asset prices including housing and the sterling exchange rate. Provided emphasis is put on broad money and the exchange rate, this list is sensible enough. The problem is that such a list will allow the chancellor to justify doing whatever he may find convenient at the time. Open debate The more judgment, rather than rules, are at the heart of policy, the more important become improved institutional arrangements. The traditional British policy-making structure  - ill-suited, it now appears, to a policy as simple as ERM membership  - is completely inappropriate when judgment must be brought to bear. The combination of official secrecy, unchallenged Treasury supremacy and complete political control over economic policy has failed again and again. Who can doubt that it will fail once more? What is needed, instead, is open debate of the options, an independent council of economic advisers, a reduction in the powers of the Treasury and an attempt to depoliticise monetary policy. What is needed, in short, is the arrangements Germany has enjoyed since the second world war. Since policy can never be divorced from politics, such changes are no panacea. The UK may well prove to be irretrievably addicted to inflation. But if the country is about to choose inflation once more, let it at least make that choice openly. What Mr Lamont chooses to do in the next few weeks is much less important than such reform. But the UK does have a good opportunity for long term growth based, first and foremost, on the expansion of the supply of traded goods. Unlike in the much more closed US economy, consumer demand does not have to be revived at all costs. Since the UK suffers from more deeply entrenched inflationary expectations than does the US, the government should also avoid giving the impression that it wants yet another dash for growth. But who now believes that this government will either choose or stick to the right policy?</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / MP implicates building society in 'fraud' WEST Bromwich Building Society yesterday called for a Tory MP to give evidence to the police after he accused it of being implicated in 'forgery and fraud' over loans made to elderly investors through home income schemes. Mr William Powell, MP for Corby, said in the Commons that 'a great deal of criminal activity has been taking place' in relation to home-income plans taken out by 800 people. The schemes aimed to unlock capital in investors' homes in the late 1980s. Mr Powell said that West Bromwich, which lent about Pounds 24m through such schemes, had tried to avoid responsibility in an 'utterly scandalous, deeply shocking' way, that would 'merit much closer attention, particularly by the police'. Mr Glenn Elliot, the society's chief executive, said that he was 'horrified and appalled' that Mr Powell had used parliamentary privilege to make the accusation. He called for Mr Powell to produce any evidence to the police. Mr Elliot said: 'We have certainly not committed fraud, and if a financial adviser has been involved in fraud or forgery, we have no knowledge of it.' Mr Powell said he had seen documents signed by constituents which were changed after being signed. He said incomes had been falsified on the forms 'in order to justify the pushing out of much larger sums' than they wished to borrow. He said this had resulted in 'misery across the country' and in one case an elderly constituent had committee suicide. The society said that it was 'wrong' for Mr Powell to speculate that it had caused an investor's suicide. Many of West Bromwich's home-income loans were made after investors were sold schemes by the broker Fisher Prew-Smith, which was fined Pounds 20,000 by the insurance brokers' regulator Fimbra for its conduct and went into liquidation in 1991. Investment-linked home-income schemes were devised in the late 1980s. The idea was to take out a mortgage and invest the proceeds in the hope of earning a return large enough to meet the repayments as well as providing extra income. Many advisers backed the plans with single-premium investment bonds. When the value of these fell because of poor stock market performance and interest rates rose, investors ran into financial difficulties. The building society ombudsmen have been hampered in investigating home income plans because these fall outside their jurisdiction, and they require the prior consent of the building society. West Bromwich is one of nine building societies which have refused to co-operate with the ombudsman scheme. Mr Elliot said yesterday that it would co-operate with the complaints procedure if it received certain guarantees.</p>

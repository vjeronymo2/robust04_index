			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 3 PENINSULA HIGH SCHOOLS INFEASIBLE  </P> <P> I read with interest about the closing of two Palos Verdes Peninsula high  schools (Times, Dec. 6) and can readily sympathize with the students affected.  However, their parents are well aware it is not economically feasible to have  three PV high schools.  </P> <P> Since most if not all parents have a high income to live on that hill, I  respectfully suggest (half in jest) that if these parents desire to maintain  the status quo, they donate to a high school trust fund to keep the three high  schools operating.  </P> <P> In the interim, I assume most of these highly educated parents are explaining  the economic "facts of life" to their offspring.  </P> <P> Many South Bay school districts have encountered similar dollar problems and  somehow have managed to survive and are doing fine. Hopefully, the PV school  district will be similarly successful.  </P> <P> JIM NISHIZAKA  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman this afternoon  received Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino, who is paying  an official visit to the Republic of Croatia at the head of a  delegation of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the  president's office said in a statement.    The talks focused on numerous issues relating to bilateral  relations between the two states, particularly to the problem of  the areas of the Republic of Croatia under Serb occupation and  the resolution of the crisis in Bosnia--Herzegovina.  Convergence of views was expressed regarding the resolution of  some bilateral issues on the basis of friendly relations and  mutual interests of both countries. Minister Martino's visit  today provides guarantees for better political and economic  relations between the two countries to be achieved through the  spirit of the best possible understanding, the statement says.    Attempts should be made to resolve the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina in a peaceful way. It was stated in this  context that steps by the so-called contact group countries and  a meeting of the G-7 and Russia which is to take place in Naples  at the beginning of next week are hopefully awaited. Hope was  also expressed that the Serb occupation of areas of the Republic  of Croatia would be resolved in a peaceful way through the  reintegration of these areas into the state and legal system of  the Republic of Croatia. The Republic of Italy will try to lend  all its possible support in this respect by using its influence,  the statement says in conclusion.</p>

			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / UK Company News: MGN flotation price set at 125p per share SHARES IN Mr Robert Maxwell's Mirror Group Newspapers will cost 125p each when the company is floated later next month. The yield, howver, has yet to be finalised. The flotation price will be revealed officially tomorrow morning and the minimum outlay will be about Pounds 250, a level set to encourage the small investor. The yield is likely to be between 6.5 and 6.7 per cent, compared with a market average of 4.8 per cent, and 8.4 per cent for shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation - also controlled by Mr Maxwell. Flotation advisers say the mixed views in the investment community on Mr Maxwell's management style mean they must set a higher yield, to the tune of about half a percentage point, than might otherwise be expected. At the same time they argue that without Mr Maxwell the company would be making less money and thus command a lower total price. The prospectus will be distributed to institutions on May 2. It will argue that Mirror Group is both defensive, because two-thirds of its income comes from circulation rather than more volatile advertising revenue, and well-placed to take advantage of the recovery from recession as advertising picks up. Both Mr Maxwell and his advisers want the shares to show a significant premium when dealings start on May 21, and the yield will be set to try to ensure this. Morale in the flotation team has been helped by research conducted on Friday and Saturday among readers of Mirror Group Newspapers by AGB, a market research company owned by MCC. Details of AGB's findings were not made available yesterday. In addition, the securities house in charge of the US side of the operation, Salomon Brothers, has asked for an increase in its one-third allocation of stock. The proportion it receives is likely to rise to 35 per cent. About a third of the shares has been earmarked for the UK private investor, with UK institutions getting another third and the remainder going overseas. Before the official announcement of the flotation price Midland Montagu, the merchant banker, and broker Smith New Court intend to put in place the underwriters of the issue. The prospectus will also be available from some branches of Lloyds Bank and the Bank of Scotland and be advertised on Friday in some UK newspapers. The sale of 48 per cent of Mirror Group is intended to raise Pounds 240-Pounds 270m. Most of the money will go towards reorganising Mirror Group's debts.</p>

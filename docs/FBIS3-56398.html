			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelyov] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 15 TASS -- The Partnership for Peace  program recently approved by the NATO summit in Brussels is an  important step forward in the development of partnership between  Russia, the United States and other NATO countries, Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told correspondents on Friday.    It seems NATO membership of new states could be the most  simple and quick solution to the problem, this is naturally  their sovereign right. However, swift implementation of this  right would result in new barriers in Europe, said the minister.    "NATO has listened to us, Central and East European nations,  it listened to Russia, Boris Yeltsin who said in Poland it is  the right of each state to decide whether or not to join NATO;  but there are realities that require a more well-considered  approach," he noted.    The Brussels decision provides for a long period of  partnership which will help concentrate efforts and determine  the fate of Europe. The problem has been discussed with the  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at the Moscow summit.  The U.S. and Russian presidents exchanged their opinions on the  issue and expressed satisfaction with the program of Partnership  for Peace, said Kozyrev.    It is too early to say what the period will end with. It may  be so that many states, possibly, Russia (it is not excluded)  will join NATO. But the period will not obligatory be a  preparatory one. Other options are possible as well.    Broader security systems may be created and the Council of  North Atlantic Cooperation may be consolidated. The more so, in  the opinion of the Russian side, all areas should be developed  parallelly. It is a new quality of partnership and not new  membership in NATO that matters. Kozyrev said they should  concentrate on partnership, fill it with specific content and  see the final result. The most important is stability and  cooperation in Europe.</p>

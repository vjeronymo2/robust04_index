			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Pay row worsens in Germany: Public workers set to reject strike deal as engineering talks break down THE WIDENING German pay row worsened last night as public sector workers seemed set to reject a strike settlement and key talks to avert stoppages in the engineering industry broke down. The vote by public sector workers, to be announced today, seemed certain to upset the deal accepted by union leaders last week after an 11-day strike. It could herald a new stoppage, although this is not certain. The deadlock in the engineering talks and the public sector workers' defiance show the deep concern in Germany at the costs of unification with the former communist east Germany in 1990. In the engineering dispute, leaders of the powerful IG Metall union met employers for regional talks in Frankfurt yesterday, but the talks collapsed without a new pay offer being made. As a result, the union leadership in the state of Hesse today will declare the negotiations failed and call a ballot to clear the way for a strike from May 25. Another last-ditch effort to reach agreement will come today in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. But so far engineering employers in all regions have refused to raise their 3.3 per cent offer. The union originally claimed 9.5 per cent, but has since moderated its stand, saying it will not accept a deal below 6 per cent. Public sector union leaders last week accepted a 5.4 per cent deal, wrung out of the Bonn government and other state and local authorities by a wave of strikes that disrupted transport, rubbish collection and other public services. The deal seemed last night to have run into trouble with members of the biggest public sector union, the oTV, although two smaller public sector unions - the white-collar DAG and the railway workers' GdED - have approved it. The vote among 470,000 affected members of oTV was forecast last night to be only 40 per cent in favour - well short of the 50 per cent needed for endorsement under the union's rules. The union executive was meeting to decide its response. While it looks increasingly likely that IG Metall will call out engineering workers on strike from May 25 - probably precipitating a lock-out by employers - the chances of a simultaneous resumption of the public sector strike are much less. As for the engineering workers, the two sides seem to be dug in for a long struggle. Mr Karl Kronawitter, Frankfurt district leader of IG Metall, said the union was not prepared to settle for anything less than the public sector workers' award. Mr Walter Schlotfeldt, the employers' chief negotiator in Hesse, and a board member of Opel, the motor manufacturer, said the union attitude was simply 'not acceptable'.

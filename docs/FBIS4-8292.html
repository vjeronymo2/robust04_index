			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 9/4/1994 -- Romania's national  defense doctrine and the training of the Romanian peace-keeping  unit were among the issues approached at the Romanian Defense  Ministry's first weekly press conference, on Friday [8 April] in  Bucharest.    Romania's national defense doctrine is based on the  principle  of defense sufficiency during peace-time, said the defense  ministry spokeswoman, Major Elena Olariu, who is the first woman  to hold that office in the history of the Romanian Armed Forces.  The doctrine provides that Romania will never attack another  state. For the situations when Romania could be the target of  an aggression, the doctrine provides for reactions based on the  principle of omnidirectional defense. The defense doctrine is  going to be discussed on Monday [11 April] by Romania's Supreme  Defense Council, together with all the other documents  concerning the whole concept of national security.    The Romanian peace-keeping unit, established on 15 July  1993,  is now in an advanced stage of preparations, a fact appreciated  also by General George Joulwan, the supreme commander of the  Allied Forces in Europe. The unit comprises one staff company,  three infantry companies, one millimeters-caliber thrower  battery, one anti-tank artillery battery, one mixed  anti-aircraft artillery battery, and a logistics sub-unit.    Romania is currently contributing to the U.N. missions with  the following military: Six watchers in Iraq-Kuwait, six  watchers in Rwanda ("no bad news about them at the time being,"  Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu said on Friday after  his meeting with Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes,) and 136  people with the Romanian military hospital in Somalia (where the  tide of patients is rising and stronger security measures have  been taken after the departure of the U.S., German, and Italian  troops.)    The defense ministry spokeswoman said also that the ministry  had nine officers sent for studies in the U.S.A., six in the  United Kingdom, six in France, and five in Germany.</p>

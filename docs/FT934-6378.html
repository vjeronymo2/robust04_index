			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Observer: Writ large Michael Heseltine, Britain's secretary of state for trade and industry, proffered some advice to those gathered at the Institute of Directors' dinner on Tuesday evening. When he was in business he met his finance director every Friday afternoon to talk about some, but not all, the creditors. As he put it: 'Sometimes in life it's better not to know too much.' He placed his creditors in three categories: those who had sent solicitors' letters; those who had issued writs; and those whose writs were 14 days' old. Heseltine's advice? Always pay off the third category. An axiom which may well usefully inform the Department of Trade and Industry's current investigation into ways of dealing with the problem of late payments in business . . .</p>

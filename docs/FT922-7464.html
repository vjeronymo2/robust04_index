			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Honour for Opus Dei founder draws crowds One of the largest crowds ever to gather at the Vatican (above) witnessed yesterday's ecclesiastical spectacular in which Pope John Paul took the founder of the controversial, conservative Opus Dei movement a step closer to sainthood, reports Reuter in Rome. Police estimated that more than 200,000 people from about 60 countries filled St Peter's Square and its approaches for the beatification of the Spanish Msgr Jose Maria Escriva de Balaguer. The day was clearly a triumphant one for Opus Dei, which has for decades been fending off criticism from church liberals that it is secretive and elitist and has created a cult around its founder. These critics maintain that Escriva was a vain, hot-tempered man who did not discourage reverence for his person. But the Pope, who supports the movement, praised him for preaching that ordinary Christians could find holiness in life's daily routines. He said Escriva's life was 'marked by Christian humanism, with the unmistakable seal of goodness, meekness of heart, the hidden suffering by which God purifies and sanctifies his chosen ones'. Escriva, who died in 1975 at the age of 73, has been credited with performing one miracle: the medically inexplicable cure of an elderly Spanish nun who suffered from a terminal tumour. He must be ascribed another miracle before he can be declared a saint.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Brussels fixes new central rates in the EMS The following is the communique issued by the European monetary committee in Brussels: 'The ministers and central bank governors of the member states of the European Community have, by mutual agreement, following a common procedure involving the Commission and after consultation with the monetary committee, decided to fix new central rates in the EMS. The bilateral central rates of the Spanish peseta and of the Portuguese escudo against other currencies of the exchange rate mechanism have been reduced by 8 per cent and 6.5 per cent respectively. 'The new Ecu central rates are the following (in units of national currencies per Ecu):  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgian franc                           40.2123 Danish krone                            7.43679 German mark                             1.94964 Spanish peseta                           154.25 French franc                            6.53883 Irish pound                            0.808628 Luxembourg franc                        40.2123 Dutch guilder                           2.19672 Portuguese escudo                       192.854 Greek drachma                           264.513* Italian lira                            1793.19* Pound sterling                         0.786749*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (*The last three are notional central rates, based on market rates of May 12, 1993.)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'Ministers and central bank governors consider it essential for Spain to achieve the full implementation of the convergence programme policies. 'They also took note of the Portuguese government's commitment to their basic policy stance of budget discipline, which in the view of the Portuguese authorities, together with continued wage moderation and structural reforms, will contribute to non-inflationary growth, employment creation and a decline in interest rates. The agri-monetary consequences of the present realignment will be examined by the competent bodies. 'The new bilateral central rates and the compulsory intervention points in the exchange rate mechanism will be communicated by the central banks in time for the opening of foreign exchange markets on May 14 1993.' The monetary committee's communique was issued at the end of an eight-hour meeting in Brussels. The secretive committee had long been scheduled to meet yesterday to put the finishing touches to a report saying the exchange rate mechanism is in good shape. The report, commissioned at the height of last autumn's currency crisis, is due to be handed to EC finance ministers when they meet on May 21.</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Observer: Slave trade The BBC is keen to be seen running a tight ship in the run-up to the renewal of its charter, but this is ridiculous. It is looking for a new member of the management team at its Arabic service. 'You'll be working as secretary to head and deputy head of the service and their hundred or so staff, helping them run 10 1/2 hours a day of BBC programming,' says the advert. As well as secretarial duties, the lucky candidate will be responsible for co-ordinating the administrative procedures of the service and must be able to deal with confidential matters discreetly and enjoy solving people's problems. Oh, and the salary starts at Pounds 12,346.</p>

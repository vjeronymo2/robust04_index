			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Tackled, but still in the game: Mr Brian Quinn of the Bank of England rejects accusations that the regulator is too close to the regulated Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank of England director whose job it is to deter banks from breaking the law or getting into severe financial difficulties, does not seek his reward in the form of public acclaim. 'No one thanks the regulator when things go right,' he says in his soft Glaswegian accent. 'No one blames anyone else when things go wrong. It's like playing a football match where they only record the goals against.' The Bank of England's only Celtic supporter has spent the past few days on his goal line frantically trying to stop the ball from whizzing past him. At the end of the previous week, he had to face allegations - made during the recent Blue Arrow trial and repeated in the Economist magazine - that the Bank of England had been in cahoots with National Westminster Bank during the spring of 1988 to forestall a Department of Trade and Industry investigation into NatWest's role in Blue Arrow's 1987 rights issue of new shares. He robustly denies these allegations. Nonetheless the DTI announced on Thursday that it was reopening its investigation, although the focus is more likely to be the involvement of NatWest's senior directors in the Blue Arrow rights issue and whether the bank's chief executive, Mr Tom Frost, withheld information from the inspectors in the original DTI inquiry. However, the timing of the DTI's announcement could not have been more awkward. The previous day, a House of Commons cross-party committee issued a report into the Bank's role as supervisor of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the corrupt bank, which implied that the Bank should have taken action far earlier than it did to limit BCCI's activities or close it down. The criticism was far less severe than many in the Bank had feared. The imminence of the election campaign could have deterred MPs from stirring up controversy by making too strident an attack on the regulator. But even the soft criticism stung the Bank. Mr Quinn insists that - on the basis of the information available to the Bank - keeping BCCI open was the correct course of action, even if, with the benefit of hindsight, that now appears a mistaken decision. There is a common thread in the Blue Arrow and BCCI allegations. In both cases, the Bank is accused of suffering from 'regulatory capture' - that as regulator it has become too close to the regulated. The suspicion is that the Bank has become too conscious of the interests of banks to take effective punitive action. However, Mr Quinn insists that the reverse is true. 'I find accusations that I am being too chummy with banks quite extraordinary,' he says in the comforting surrounds of his wood-panelled office. 'That is simply not a description of the life I lead.' There is plenty of evidence to suggest that he is not always the banker's pal. In the past seven years, the Bank has been responsible for forcing the resignations of senior directors at Morgan Grenfell, after the Guinness scandal broke; for encouraging the departures of senior directors of National Westminster Bank in the wake of the Blue Arrow affair; and for hastening the departure of Sir Kit McMahon as chairman of Midland Bank, after the failure of his strategy to restore the bank's fortunes by merging it with Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Mr Quinn says an understanding of his role requires an analysis of developments in the banking market: 'There has been a substantial change in the extent of competition between banks. Life is much more difficult for them than 10 years ago.' At the same time, banks are under greater pressure to reward their shareholders by earning bigger profits and paying bigger dividends. 'This induces banks to do things which brings them more quickly up against the barrier of what is acceptable to the regulator,' he says. A second important change is that, since 1979 when the first Banking Act was passed, the Bank's supervisory role has been based on statute, rather than an informal code which seemed at times to give the Bank absolute authority in parts of the City. Thirteen years may seem long enough to adjust to a more legalistic way of policing the City. But Mr Quinn says it is not long in the context of the Bank's 300-year history. Officials say that, during the 1980s, some of the older directors of the Bank 'simply did not understand that we could no longer simply tell a bank that we wanted it to change the way it was behaving. They could not accept that we could only take action if we were sure of our position under the Banking Act'. So at the same time as banks have become more prone to using questionable devices for generating profits, the Bank's ability to prevent them from taking excessive risks has become more circumscribed. 'Increasingly, when we get into tussles with banks, they say: 'Where does it say in the Banking Act that we can't do that?' ' Mr Quinn says. 'To hear such a question 10 years ago was unthinkable.' The relationship with banks is 'not adversarial yet', he says. 'But we are far less chummy than we used to be.' However, the tradition of a bank taking informal soundings from the Bank of England before changing strategy continues: 'Bankers still come to see us to chat informally to obtain our view about whether they should do something or not. Around two-thirds of our discussions with banks are non-routine in this sense.' But the House of Commons select committee feared that, when a conflict does arise, the Bank may be too frightened of losing the battle. It implied that the Bank might have been slow to close down BCCI because of concern that BCCI would then appeal against the decision through the courts. Mr Quinn cannot comment on the details of the BCCI case; he is proscribed from doing so under the Banking Act. However, on the general issue he says: 'I don't think we worry too much about a bank launching an appeal when we take action to close it down.' He adds: 'There is a handful of cases every year where we invoke the Banking Act to take away a bank's licence or force changes to banks' activities.' There have been many cases where the Bank has closed a bank or restricted its activities and been aware that there was a risk of a successful appeal. Nonetheless he stresses that losing an appeal could be devastating: 'The damage to our reputation of having a judgment overturned would seriously impair our ability to do our job.' But when deciding whether to close a bank, the Bank does not merely assess whether it has the power to do so. It asks a second question about whether it would be right to exercise that power. Officials with a close knowledge of the Bank explain the difference between these two questions as they relate to the BCCI case. As early as April 1990  -although not before then - the Bank felt it had sufficient evidence against BCCI to close it down. However, it chose to allow the bank to keep trading, not because of fear that BCCI would appeal, but because it believed BCCI depositors' interests would be damaged by closure. The Bank had been presented with a plan to inject new capital into the business and change its structure in a way which would have made it easier to police. In the circumstances, the Bank felt depositors would have been very badly served by closure. 'Maybe we were wrong to keep BCCI open as long as we did,' says Mr Quinn. 'But we thought we were right, on the basis of all the available information. If MPs say their judgment is different from the Bank's, that is fine.' The protection of depositors is his top priority, under the 'mission statement' which his department adopted three years ago, following the example of many private-sector companies. Prudential supervision - or monitoring the health of banks - is second on the list. 'People say we are too interested in promoting the City to take a tough line on regulation,' he says. But he denies the charge that the Bank is slow to punish errant banks for fear of damaging the City's reputation. The promotion of London as a financial centre does not appear on his department's mission statement, although it is one of the core aims of the Bank as a whole. In the Blue Arrow case, however, it was clearly reluctant to see NatWest, at the time the UK's biggest bank, pilloried in public. Mr Quinn is again prevented by the Banking Act from discussing this. But an account of what happened can be constructed from court transcripts and interviews with officials. The question which NatWest had to address in the late autumn of 1987 and the winter of 1988 was whether it had broken the law by acquiring an interest in 13.5 per cent of Blue Arrow's share capital but not disclosing the exposure; under the Companies Act, companies were at the time supposed to disclose shareholdings in excess of 5 per cent. In February, NatWest asked its then deputy chairman, Sir Philip Wilkinson, to conduct an investigation into how this happened and whether the lack of disclosure was reprehensible. Sir Philip duly produced a draft, which was shown to the Bank of England in the spring. During the recent Blue Arrow trial, it emerged that Mr Quinn encouraged NatWest to redraft the report. A note of Mr Quinn's advice, made by Mr Charles Green - at the time one of NatWest's deputy chief executives - said that Mr Quinn had recommended that 'we should report a measure of ambiguity in the evidence as to whether there was a conscious or sub-conscious circumvention of the rules'. NatWest subsequently thanked the Bank for its advice. The implication appeared to be that the Bank had encouraged NatWest to soften the report's conclusions, in order to minimise any potential for scandal and forestall any attempt by the Department of Trade and Industry to launch its own inquiry. However, a Bank official insists the reverse is true. Sir Philip's original draft was apparently too lenient on NatWest because it described the purchase and non-disclosure of the stake as a perfectly normal transaction. The Bank knew enough to be sure that this was far from the case. So it encouraged NatWest to redraft the report at least to acknowledge the possibility that it may have committed an offence. But Mr Quinn's decision to give any advice at all to NatWest is by no means unimpeachable. In April, the Bank had encouraged the DTI to delay the launch of a formal inquiry into the Blue Arrow affair until the NatWest report had been completed. Having intervened to that extent, the Bank's reputation for impartiality might have been better served by allowing NatWest to submit the flawed first draft to the DTI and then informing the DTI that it disagreed with NatWest's conclusions. The Bank's misjudgment was rammed home a year later. In effect it had given its stamp of approval to the final version of NatWest's internal report, which was sent to the DTI. But when DTI inspectors were appointed at the end of 1988, they found a separate NatWest report on the Blue Arrow incident - intended for internal consumption only. This other report was far more critical of NatWest's behaviour than the report sent to the DTI. Naturally enough, the Bank felt very disappointed with NatWest. But Mr Quinn retains faith in the integrity of bankers: 'We have not had enough cases of being let down to fundamentally change our approach of trusting banks.' He may have scored an own goal in the Blue Arrow case, but he is not changing his tactics.</p>

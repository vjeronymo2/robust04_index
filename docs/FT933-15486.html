			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Taunton Cider over Pounds 17m on UK growth STRONG GROWTH in the UK cider market helped Taunton Cider to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 17.6m for the year ended May 1 1993. The group was floated on the Stock Exchange a year ago. The outcome compared with Pounds 6.58m, and reflected a strong operating performance, positive cash flow and the reduction in interest costs following the flotation. Net interest charges fell to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 11.2m). Earnings per share increased to 12.2p (8.1p) and a final dividend of 3.6p makes a total of 6p, Commenting on the results, Mr Michael Cottrell, chairman, said: 'The benefits of our commitment to marketing are particularly evident at the present time when most drink categories, other than cider, are in decline.' Turnover from continuing operations rose 19 per cent to Pounds 124.9m, from Pounds 105.3m previously when discontinued operations generated an additional Pounds 4.09m. The bulk of the increase came from volume gains in line with the overall UK cider market which grew by 12 per cent to 85m gallons last year. Taunton's share of the fast-growing packaged sector continued to increase, mainly as a result of the strong performance of its premium brands, including Diamond White and the Brody brand which was launched last year. In contrast, its share of the more mature draught cider market, which is growing by about 5 per cent a year, slipped slightly. Volume sales of Dry Blackthorn draught rose by 3 per cent last year. Operating profits from continuing activities increased by 18 per cent to Pounds 19.7m (Pounds 16.7m), buoyed by the growth of the higher margin premium brands. Despite capital investment of more than Pounds 8m the group eliminated the borrowings that remained after the flotation and ended the year with a net cash balance of Pounds 2.2m. Mr Peter Adams, chief executive, said the group was discussing the possibility of marketing and distributing foreign premium beers in the UK, and was also investigating the possibility of selling its premium cider brands overseas, particularly in the US. COMMENT Taunton is well positioned to take advantage of the growing popularity of cider in the UK, and to exploit new opportunities overseas. It already has a 33 per cent share of the overall domestic market, has captured 57 per cent of the high-margin premium cider segment and has spare capacity. As well as launching new premium brands the group is now turning its attention to arresting the decline in its share of the more mature draught cider market. Volume growth is likely to be somewhat more subdued this year - Taunton is predicting about a 5 per cent gain. However, pre-tax profits should expand to approximately Pounds 21.5m, producing earnings of about 13.4p per share and a prospective multiple of 16.4.</p>

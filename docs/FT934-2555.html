			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: How the maverick put his case Statements made by Mr Zhirinovsky. . . (unless marked otherwise, all quotes were made in election campaign) 'Russia's soldiers will once again stand guard over the 1975 border of the Soviet Union and once we have put them there they will not move back a single step.' 'We took Berlin in 1945 and then gave it back. Now the Germans live well and we live badly. What was the point of taking Berlin? We should have forced millions of Germans to work for us. Then we Russians could have taken things easy.' 'Although we're not anti-Semitic we won't tolerate an increase in the strength of Jews.' 'The world should think twice before opposing us - after all, is it really desirable to have a third world war?' 'Why should we create suffering for ourselves? We should create suffering for others.' 'The Russian people have three choices. We can either choose that which we have now by voting for Gaidar and Yavlinsky, which does not suit many people, or we can choose to go backwards by voting for the Communists, which also does not not suit many people. My party represents the third choice.' 'Less democracy] More economy] That is our slogan. Look at China. I admit it was not very democratic to use tanks against the students but the main thing is that the country itself still exists. And they do not have shortages of food and medicines as we have.' May 1992 'Never shall anyone humiliate the Russians' (on his posters.) 'You will all be fine with me' (campaign slogan) 'I am waiting in the wings. My moment has nearly arrived.' March 1993 'You are going to defend Iraq, a victim of reckless aggression by America and Israel. . . You should know you should die for a noble cause. . . We will blow up a few Kuwaiti ports and aircraft plus a few American ships in the Gulf.' Speech to armed volunteers he sent to defend his hero Saddam Hussein, January 1993 'I would bomb the Japanese. I would sail our large navy around their small island and if they so much as cheeped I would nuke them. . . and we Russians haven't forgotten English treachery during the war. You are a small island, so you watch out, too,' January 1993, when asked by an English reporter what he wanted to do about the long running battle over the Kurile islands. 'Give me a billion dollars and I will become president of Russia.' January 1993. 'Seventy or 80 per cent will vote for me in the next elections. Mr Yeltsin is not ready - he is afraid of the people. I am not afraid. I am ready for the next election.' May 1992, after last elections. 'If I don't rule, then no matter, let the military. In any case, they would be better than Yeltsin's democrats.' December 1991.</p>

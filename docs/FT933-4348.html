			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Technology: Design in a micro world Despite similarities, the technology used to make the commercial devices now on the market - bulk micromachining - is not, strictly speaking, the same as that used for integrated circuits. Small-scale masking and etching are used to produce both, but bulk micromachining typically creates much deeper holes in the silicon. Precise shapes can be made, thanks to the properties of crystalline silicon. Specially formulated etchants will move straight down, but not sideways, through a layer in the crystal lattice. This also makes it possible to etch under a layer of silicon, freeing the tiny weights and levers used in devices such as accelerometers. If bulk micromachining is like sculpting, the more advanced technique of surface micromachining is like painting - layers of material are built up and etched away on top of a layer of silicon, until the desired three-dimensional objects are formed. Randy Frank, technical marketing manager at Motorola's semiconductor products division, says that compared with bulk micromachining, surface micromachining is more similar to the standard technology used to make most microchips. It should allow the same bit of silicon to hold the sensor or actuator and the control circuitry, enhancing reliability and cutting the cost of devices. Much of this is still at the laboratory stage. Commercial devices using surface micromachining are starting to appear, but Frank says sensors and controls on the same chip will not be made in large numbers until the end of the decade. Problems include the heat or etchants used for processing the sensor ruining the integrated circuit, or vice versa. Also, the layers of material used in micromachining are much thicker than those used for microcircuitry. Thickness is important for microgears and motors - the thicker they are, the more torque is possible. A technique developed in Germany called Liga (lithography, electroforming and moulding) allows shapes like gears to be made thicker than is possible with surface micromachining. Liga uses high energy X-rays which penetrate hundreds of microns into a layer of polymer. The polymer is then etched away and used as a mould for a metal such as nickel. The use of metals rather than silicon to achieve greater strength or durability is also being applied to surface micromachining. A set of techniques, developed in Japan, uses micro drills, spark erosion devices and tiny diamond lathes, which require each device to be made individually. But Linton Salmon, director of the solid state and microstructure programme at the US National Science Foundation, says that by making single devices the Japanese will lose the economies of scale which come with making hundreds of devices on a silicon wafer.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Berenice Gomez Velasquez] </F>   [Text] Hours before traveling to Cartagena de Indias,  Colombia, President Rafael Caldera, commander in chief of the  FAN [National Armed Forces], decided who will be the first  division generals and vice admirals, as had been unofficially  announced. The president officially informed Defense Minister  Division General Rafael Angel Montero Revette to advise the  promoted officers.    The president decided to promote three officers regarded as  born commanders to the rank of division general, as they were  described as military men who will be remembered as commanders.    Nicolas Valencia Vivas, an AMV [Military Academy of  Venezuela] artillery branch graduate of the 1967 Lino de  Clemente Class, is currently the chief of the Army's General  Staff. He previously served as Army Intelligence director and  commander of the 61st Infantry Brigade stationed in Apure State.  He is a Iaeden [Institute of Higher Studies for National  Defense] graduate. He also held the post of commander of the  Jungle Battalion stationed in Luepa, Bolivar State, and is a  lawyer.    Pedro Hernandez Guevara, an AMV artillery branch graduate of  the 1965 Lino de Clemente Class, served as commander of the 52d  Jungle Brigade stationed in Puerto Ayacucho; commander of the  Jancito Lara Self-Propelled Group [Grupo Autopropulsado Jacinto  Lara] stationed in Valencia, Carabobo State; commander of the  155mm Armored Brigade; director of the Army Higher School;  commander of the Ayacucho Artillery group; deputy director of  DIM [Directorate of Military Intelligence]; and is currently the  Army's logistics commander.    James Patro Navas, an AMV infantry branch graduate of the  1968 Pedro Maria Freites Class, was born in San Cristobal,  Tachira State. He served as commander of the 1.1 [as published]  Task Forces at the service of Cufan [expansion not known]. The  president appointed him commander of the Paratroopers Brigade  and of 4-F [not further identified] later on. He is currently  the commander of the 4th Army Infantry Division stationed in  Maracay, Aragua State. The following rear admirals were promoted  to vice admiral: Jesus Briceno Garcia, current regional  personnel director of the Defense Ministry, and Oscar Morales  Martinez, Venezuelan Navy School director and Navy personnel  commander. F-16 and Mirage pilots with well-known military  records will be the new Venezuelan Air Force [FAV] division  generals. Jose Agustin Borges Blasco is an outstanding and  highly respected pilot. He is a jet bomber, transportation, and  fighter pilot. He graduated from the AMV Aviation School in 1967  with the rank of lieutenant major of the Teofilo Zambrano Class.  He was born in San Juan, Caracas, and was raised in Catia. Since  his days as a cadet he distinguished himself as a test and  training pilot in all the FAV weapons systems. The only aircraft  he has not flown is a helicopter. He is a graduate of  Washington's Inter-American Defense College. After Division  General Maglio Montiel Arguello, he is the Mirage fighter pilot  with the most flight time in the country. Montiel and Borges  escorted the Mirage squadron upon its arrival in the country  from Nellis Air Force Base in the United States after  participating in the Red Flag maneuvers with F-16 airplanes.    The two pilots flew for the president during the FAV's  anniversary on 9 December, a few days after the 27 November  uprising, when it was reported that U.S. pilots flew those  airplanes. Borges is currently commander of FAV Air Operations.    Juan Antonio Paredes Nino is one of the country's most  distinguished fighter pilots. He helped pioneer the F-16 weapons  system. Since his time at the Military Aviation School, he stood  out as an excellent pilot. It was always said that "Paredes Nino  was giving orders from school." He is the son of former Defense  Minister Fernandez Paredes Bello, an FAV division general.  Expectations were that at least one general of the 1968 class  would rise to the rank of division general. Those expectations  were based not only on merits but on knowledge about what has  happened in the other branches. The president, however,  dispelled those notions. It did not happen. The president did  not expand the number of slots. He promoted two generals who  were sure bets to the rank of division general. There was no  surprise.    The promoted officers are: Julio Cesar Pena Sanchez, current  FAC [Armed Forces of National Cooperation] inspector general,  and Euro Luis Rincon Viloria. Rincon Viloria comes from Zulia  State and graduated from the Efofac [Armed Forces of Cooperation  Officers Training School] as a member of the 1967 Taguanes  Battle Class. He served as deputy director of the FAC Higher  School, Core [National Guard Regional Command] 5 chief of  general staff, Training and Environmental and Natural Renewal  Resources Protection School director, and commander of the 51st  Mobile Destacafac [expansion unknown]. He served as Core 6  commander as well as commander of the Apure Garrison stationed  in San Fernando. He is currently the FAC chief of General Staff.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 21 Jun (AFP) -- Honduran Foreign  Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar today described as "unfair,  lamentable, and deplorable" the $20 fee for each visa  application charged by the U.S. Consulate in Tegucigalpa.    "It is unfair so much money is charged for a simple,  administrative form," the Honduran minister said, reacting to a  decision the U.S. Government announced on 20 June. This  decision will be applied in all Central American countries.    Fernando Sanchez, the U.S. consul in Tegucigalpa, has said  the charge is to prevent people who do not even have $20 from  approaching the U.S. Consulate to request a visa, because their  intention is none other than to migrate to the United States.    "I believe this is an unfair decision. I have said the only  way to prevent large flows of Caribbean and Central American  immigrants to the United States and the developed countries is  by consolidating freer, stronger, and more competitive economies  in our countries," Paz Aguilar said.    According to Sanchez' estimates, approximately 50,000  Hondurans go to the consulate every year to request visas, of  which approximately 30,000 are granted, meaning the consulate  would be receiving $1 million if the current flow of  applications continues.</p>

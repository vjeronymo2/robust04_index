			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Recession brings spending shift A SHIFT of spending from weapons purchases to payments for the poor is among the changes forced on the government by the longer-than-expected recession. There is also a big switch in the pattern of spending by local authorities, with the Treasury being willing to sanction a large increase in spending which councils finance themselves while cracking down on payments to them by central government. At the same time, funds channelled to councils by central government have been shaved back. Councils' self-financed spending is due to increase to Pounds 11.1bn from the Pounds 9bn planned a year ago, but at the same time the Treasury will crack down on payments to them by central government. The new plans also indicate a cut in transport spending in relation to existing plans, while health spending has emerged virtually unscathed. Spending on defence will total Pounds 23.5bn in 1993-94, 4 per cent down on the Pounds 24.5bn sketched in for the year in the 1991 Autumn Statement, including the effects of a technical adjustment for pension costs. Some of the Pounds 1bn taken from defence funds will be injected into a 6 per cent overall rise in social security spending, up sharply from the Pounds 76.1bn envisaged a year ago to a new estimate of fully Pounds 80.5bn. Under new Treasury rules outlined yesterday, only that element of social security spending which is reckoned to be unrelated to the economic cycle will be counted as part of the new control total introduced by the government to curb rises in overall spending. After taking into account various changes in classification, the new control total - set at Pounds 243.8bn for 1993-94 - is equivalent to the Pounds 244.5bn planning total for this year announced by the Treasury 12 months ago. Overall social security spending is divided into two parts: Pounds 65bn which is unrelated to the economic cycle and Pounds 15.5bn linked to the economic downturn. That takes the form of unemployment pay and some elements of income support to people under 65. The Treasury is assuming that unemployment will average 2.8m this year and total 2.9m in 1993-94, staying at this figure until 1995-96. Even as recently as the March Budget, the Treasury was assuming that growth would be much higher during this period, with unemployment as a result being limited to 2.5m. As a consequence of the shift in thinking about unemployment, overall social security spending is likely to continue to rise steeply. For next year, the Treasury has found it possible to increase social security spending by making small cuts in other departments' spending - among them transport - and by pencilling in a Pounds 1.2bn reduction in finance to European Community funds compared to last year's plans. Other extra funds have come from reducing the unallocated reserve - which is part of the 1993-94 spending plans - from Pounds 8bn a year ago to Pounds 4bn. Some of the comparisons between the different plans for 1993-94, shown in the table, have been affected by changes in responsi-bilities of specific departments; for instance the taking over of the responsibilities of the Department of Energy by the Department of Trade and Industry.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WINNERS AND LOSERS AMONG GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS: HOW THE NEW CONTROL TOTAL FOR 1993-94 IS SHARED OUT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds bn                             Old plans**       New plans++  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Defence                                   24.5               23.5 Foreign Office                             1.2                1.2 Overseas Development                       2.3                2.3 Ag, Fish and Food                          2.2                2.8 Trade and Industry                         0.9                2.6* ECGD                                       0.1                0.0 Energy                                     0.5                n/a Employment                                 3.9                3.7 Transport                                  6.6                6.4 Dept of Environment Housing                8.0                7.9 Environment                                1.3                1.4 Local g'ment                              32.5               29.4 Home Office                                6.4                6.1 Legal departments                          1.8                2.6 Education/Science                          8.4                9.5 Arts/libraries                             0.6                  - National heritage                          n/a                1.0 Health                                    30.0               30.0 Social security                           76.1               65.0 Cyclically-related social security         n/a               15.5++++ Scotland                                  13.1               13.4 Wales                                      6.1                6.3 N.

			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FISHER LOST FOR SEASON AFTER GPA FALLS SHORT;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE CENTER MISSES ACADEMIC ELIGIBILITY  STANDARD BY ONE-HUNDREDTH OF A POINT.  </P> <P> Hours before embarking on a lengthy trip into subzero temperatures, the Cal  State Northridge basketball team was dealt an icy blow when it lost center  Percy Fisher for the season because of academic ineligibility.  </P> <P> Fisher missed the fall semester because his cumulative grade-point average fell  below 2.0, the university standard for student-athletes.  </P> <P> He expected to join the team this morning on its trip for games against Idaho  State in Pocatello, Ida., on Friday, and against Weber State in Ogden, Utah, on  Saturday.  </P> <P> But Fisher learned late Wednesday night that he had come up one-hundredth of a  point short. He has a 1.99 GPA.  </P> <P> "It is frustrating," said Pete Cassidy, coach of the 2-6 Matadors. "I wouldn't  say all is lost without him but he is definitely a talent that would have  enhanced our chances of success."  </P> <P> The 6-foot-7, 212-pound sophomore from San Francisco's Riordan High runs the  floor with speed, is powerful inside and can shoot from three-point range.  </P> <P> "Percy, without a doubt is more made for Division I basketball than any big man  on our team, especially me," said CSUN's 6-7, 300-pound starting center, Todd  Bowser.  </P> <P> Last season, Fisher averaged 4.4 points and 3.3 rebounds a game in a reserve  role.  </P> <P> "Based on his stats, you wouldn't say he was much but you have to see him  play," Cassidy said.  </P> <P> "He was our most improved player last year. His best basketball is still ahead  of him. He was only 17 when he came to us, a young Bambi. He has marvelous  physical talents."  </P> <P> Like Fisher, teammate Erik Cooper sat out the Matadors' first eight games and  had hoped to rejoin the team, but he will not be able to make the trip either.  His grades for the fall semester were not received in time by Dean Edward  Peckham.  </P> <P> If Cooper's grades arrive by Wednesday and he receives all the credits he  needs, he will be eligible to play that night when Northridge plays host to  Canisius College.  </P> <P> Cooper's cumulative GPA was above 2.0, but he unwittingly repeated a class and  subsequently came up short on credits.  </P> <P> Last season, the 6-3 guard from Pasadena City College averaged 2.1 points a  game in a limited role.  </P></p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (14): The business of history MYTH, HISTORY AND THE INDUSTRIALREVOLUTION by D C Coleman Hambledon Press Pounds 32, 225 pages FIRST, A Cambridge High Table joke about Oxford: ask an Oxford economist who invented the term 'Industrial Revolution' and the smart reply will be 'Arnold Toynbee, who got it from Marx.' Hardly hysterical, particularly since it was Friedrich Engels in Die Lage Englands (1844) who used the term repeatedly; but the wit uncovers arcane disagreement in recondite quarters, the beginnings of a battle over business history. The question which taxes DC Coleman throughout his ten selected essays (1953-1989) is this: 'What is business history?' Myth, History and the Industrial Revolution strikes at industrial, economic and business history from several angles. These densely compiled essays are explorations in the area, conceptual accounts and statistical feats, everywhere bowed with the fruits of learning. There are pieces on Adam Smith, Naval Dockyards Under the Stuarts and a fine examination of 'Proto-industrialisation.' Coleman writes indirectly and capaciously, spreading his knowledge. An essay on Marx refers to the English Romantics, one on 'Gentleman and Players' dealing with business competence in Victorian England touches on Castiglione and JH Newman. His abiding concern with business history begins with the concept of the Industrial Revolution, born of Romanticism and Revolution, widespread in continental Europe but slow to reach England. Without it and its heroes, whether theoreticians like Adam Smith or practitioners such as Josiah Wedgewood, business history would not exist. So, what is business history, and why write it? In two essays, 'Historians and Businessmen' and 'The Use and Abuse of Business History', Coleman makes his pitch. He has, after all, written a three-volume history of Courtaulds and keeps a professional interest in supporting the stock. Business history, as Coleman sees it, is the kind of book written by Charles Wilson on Unilever (1954, 1968) and WJ Reader on Imperial Chemical Industries (1975), both substantial works which deliver as much about the business environment as about the respective companies. Coleman maintains that we can use business history to learn from the past, just as we learn from political or social history. He sees the company, including the nationalised industry, as the fundamental unit of economic and social history over the last hundred years. But company history is not business history. Access to the records of a company, bank or firm (lawyers, accountants, architects) invariably comes only with the company's commission to write the house history; and that can mean censorship and limitation. Forty years ago, most business history was of this type. The gain to the commissioning company was, and continues to be straightforward: where a commercial publisher wants a straight return on investment by sales, a business commissioning its own history hopes for a return in image. So what can and do business historians write, if not company history? Since Wilson's 1954 book on Unilever, academic business history has turned to industries: steel, brewing, glass, shipping, insurance, banking. Business history has none the less divided into anecdotal inside-house history, and turgid academic texts, all narrative and no analysis. What business history needs now is research and writing which understand the most important organisational unit of the economy and which recognise lines of business influence and tradition. As George Eliot said: 'The past still travels with us from afar, and what we have been makes us what we are.' Coleman advocates greater, freer access to company records together with company sponsorship of research into specific issues (just as pharmaceutical or engineering companies support academic research) in the hope that business history will become part of the MBA curriculum: 'Those responsible for education in business management will be failing the needs of their subject if they continue to ignore the lessons of the business past.' The discipline of business history still lacks a general introduction. There is a worthwhile book waiting to be written.</p>

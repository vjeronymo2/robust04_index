			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BIG EAST CONFERENCE SET TO TRY OUT SIX-FOUL RULE  </P> <P> The Big East Conference will experiment next season with allowing players to  commit six fouls instead of five before having to leave a game.  </P> <P> Critics of the rule said it will hurt underdogs by making it harder to get the  other teams' star players out of the game.  </P> <P> The six-foul rule, long used in the NBA, and a proposal that the 45-second  clock, rather than a hand count, be used to measure 10-second violations were  approved by a vote of Big East coaches, league spokeswoman Chris Plonsky said  today.  </P> <P> A third rule change, giving players three free throws instead of two if they  are fouled while shooting a 3-point basket, was rejected, Plonsky said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Experimental Rules  </P> <P> The league must get NCAA permission to adopt the experimental rules, which were  approved by the NCAA in May, but that is "usually a formality," Plonsky said.  </P> <P> Tom Niland, LeMoyne College athletic director and head of the NCAA Rules  Committee's research subcommittee, said that approval would be automatic for  regular-season conference games but that the committee would have to grant a  special exception for the Big East tournament. He said the new rules could be  used in non-conference games with the opposing coach's permission.  </P> <P> The vote tally was not released, but published accounts had predicted that the  vote on the six-foul rule would be 6-3, with Pittsburgh, Boston College and  Connecticut the reported opponents.  </P> <P> "It's just another case of the rich getting richer," said Boston College coach  Jim O'Brien, who voted against all three rules.  </P></p>

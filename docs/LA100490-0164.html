			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWYERS GIVE TO CLIENTS WHO WERE TAKEN;  </P> <P> LAW: THE STATE BAR'S FUND TO COMPENSATE VICTIMS OF UNETHICAL ATTORNEYS IS  BUSIER THAN EVER. THE PROFESSION MAINTAINS IT TO IMPROVE AN UNDESIRABLE IMAGE.  </P> <P> The president of the State Bar of California wants to set the record straight.  Shakespeare was not insulting the legal profession with the line, "The first  thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers." The character who uttered those words  in "Henry VI" was himself a criminal, see, so the Bard was really offering  praise, Charles Vogel said. You could look it up.  </P> <P> Whatever, the leader of the California bar is somewhat defensive about the fact  that shys. . . , er, attorneys don't have the greatest image. Some people might  describe 500 lawyers on the bottom of the ocean as "a good start," as the joke  goes, but not Vogel.  </P> <P> That is one reason he presided over a press conference in Los Angeles on  Wednesday at which the legal profession actually gave money to clients who were  victimized by crooked lawyers.  </P> <P> Lesley-Anne Melloy, a Los Angeles resident who suffered whiplash in an auto  accident, was handed a check for $3,333 to compensate for money she was denied  when her lawyer forged her signature on a settlement check and deposited it in  his own account.  </P> <P> Mary Dean, an Altadena resident, picked up checks for $5,500 for herself and  $2,738 for her 17-year-old daughter, Tara. They had been denied settlements  from an auto accident. "Just a dishonest lawyer," Dean said of her troubles.  </P> <P> Television cameras and newspaper photographers recorded the event for  posterity. The poet John Keats ("I think we may class the lawyer in the natural  history of monsters") would have been impressed.  </P> <P> The checks are, in a sense, the profession's way of saying "we're sorry" for  the unsavory among them. Annual bar association dues include $40 set aside for  a so-called "Client Security Fund" to compensate for the lawyers' dishonest  brethren.  </P> <P> The obscure program covers instances of theft and embezzlement rather than  malpractice. It started in 1972 with an annual $5 contribution per lawyer, and  since then it has paid out more than $12 million to 2,288 clients. But it is  busier now than ever. In 1989, it paid $2.3 million on 584 claims. So far this  year, 443 checks totaling about $2 million have been distributed.  </P> <P> Not that the legal profession has become any sleazier, Vogel asserted.  </P> <P> "I don't know that lawyers are any more dishonest than other people," he said.  "There's a level of dishonesty that runs through the entire population."  </P> <P> Rather, he suggested, there are more crooked lawyers these days simply because  there are more lawyers, especially in California. The state that is home to  about one-ninth of the nation's residents has about one-sixth of its lawyers.  It has more than 124,000 in all, of whom about 103,000 are in practice.  </P> <P> More significant, Vogel said, has been the State Bar's effort to clean its own  house. A series of reforms triggered by an award-winning San Francisco  Chronicle expose in 1985 transformed the Client Security Fund from a low  priority to a high priority, he said.  </P> <P> William O. Fleischman, a Los Angeles real estate attorney who serves on the  commission that oversees the fund, emphasized that the program often has to  reject "borderline" claims. The program distinguishes between attorneys who  commit malpractice and those who simply take the money and run.  </P> <P> "The guy who ran off with the client's money -- well, he's a crook, and we're  going to take care of that," Fleischman said.  </P> <P> The attorneys in these cases are disbarred through disciplinary action or by  resignation. If they wish to regain their license to practice, they must  reimburse the fund, Fleischman said.  </P> <P> Alcohol and drug abuse is a common problem among attorneys who defraud clients,  Fleischman said. Melloy suggested that sympathy for her lawyer's drug abuse was  one reason she did not press criminal charges against him.  </P> <P> Vogel said clients who believe they have lost money to dishonest lawyers could  call 800-843-9053 to learn more about the fund.  </P> <P> Although the program does not offer much relief to victims of malpractice,  individuals are advised of their legal options, Fleischman said.  </P> <P> "We tell them, 'Look, sue this guy,' " he said.  </P></p>

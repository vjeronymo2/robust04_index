			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Csaba Tabajdi, Hungarian Socialist Party </F> expert on national and ethnic minority affairs, by Istvan Joo;  place and date not given: "Csaba Tabajdi on Hungarians Abroad"]    [Text] It is a known fact that a significant number of the  Hungarians living beyond the border are concerned about the  election results and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] that  is preparing for power. Mostly, Hungarian minority leaders  living abroad are worried that the cabinet led by the Socialists  will make basic treaties with the neighboring countries before  the interests of the Hungarians living there receive adequate  guarantees. Recently, Miklos Duray [chairman of the Coexistence  Movement in Slovakia] expressed his worries. We interviewed  Csaba Tabajdi on the obviously not unfounded fears.    [Tabajdi] If Miklos Duray had read the MSZP's program that I  personally handed over to him in Bratislava in January, then I  do not really understand what he is afraid of. According to the  program, basic treaties can be written in such a way that they  lay down the inviolability of borders, and guarantee the rights  of the national minorities. The material also contains [a  provision] that before a basic treaty is signed, it must be  coordinated with the opposition parties and the democratic  organizations of Hungarians abroad.    [Joo] Would the latter [organizations] be present during  intergovernmental negotiations?    [Tabajdi] This would also be possible if the negotiating  partners do not have objections to it.    [Joo] Would the passage on the inviolability of borders lead  to documents similar to the Ukrainian-Hungarian basic treaty?    [Tabajdi] The two countries that sign the treaty would state  that they will not make territorial demands against each other.  In my view, this or similar wording of the clause on borders  should be in the treaties, as I have already said in the  parliamentary debate on ratifying the basic treaty with Ukraine.  This can clearly express the political intention and will of  the treaty countries, the importance of which has been expressed  by a number of our neighbors. Although, there are no tangible  signs whatsoever that political forces that are significant in  Hungarian politics would question the reality of borders.  However, many decades ago, an atmosphere of mistrust emerged in  this region; a properly worded, modern, basic treaty would be an  answer to this.    [Joo] Anyway, during the campaign, there was a difference  between the statements made by you, who had drawn up the  program, and the statements of MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn. Horn  would abolish the Office for Hungarians Living Abroad [HTMH].    [Tabajdi] The work of the HTMH was also sharply criticized  in the program. We stated that the Office has to be  fundamentally reorganized. The future of the HTMH is uncertain  at the moment, because it depends on the future governmental  structure as a whole. However, this does not mean that the MSZP  does not consider care for the Hungarians living abroad to be  important, but it wishes to implement this in a different  institutional and organizational structure.    [Joo] Is it true that the Socialists are planning to set up  a ministry on national minorities under your leadership? And  the HTMH would be incorporated in this just as the government  office dealing with church affairs?    [Tabajdi] It would be too early to talk about the  organization at the moment. As for my future office, this is  only speculation.</p>

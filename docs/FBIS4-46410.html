			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Beirut AL-'AHD in Arabic devotes most of  its 27 May 1994 edition to reactions to the abduction of Mustafa  al- Dirani, a leader of the Faithful Resistance, by a "Zionist"  commando unit.    On page 5 the paper publishes an approximately 550-word  report on a statement issued by the Bloc of Loyalty to the  Resistance [Hizballah's parliamentary group] condemning the  kidnapping of al- Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani, "a symbol of the  Faithful Resistance." The statement says: "This cowardly  operation was a blatant defiance and an impudent provocation  against the resisting Lebanon. It also clearly reveals the  policy of indifference being pursued by the authority regarding  the country's primary issues, foremost being the political and  military confrontation of the Zionist designs of hegemony."    On the same page, the paper publishes an approximately  250-word report on an address delivered by scholar Ibrahim Amin  al-Sayyid, chairman of the Bloc of Loyalty to the Resistance,  during a memorial service. Having accused the state of inaction  on the abduction of al-Dirani, al-Sayyid says: "The Lebanese  people are no longer living under the protection of a state  because it is incapable of achieving security and safeguarding  the people's dignity."    On page 6, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately 3,000-word  text  of a statement issued by representatives of the Lebanese and  Palestinian nationalist and Islamic parties and forces at the  end of their meeting held at the invitation of the Faithful  Resistance to discuss the Israeli "act of piracy" in kidnapping  al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani, a leader of the Faithful Resistance;  the date of the meeting was not given. Among those attending  the meeting was Hizballah Political Bureau Chairman al-Hajj  Husayn al-Khalil and representatives of "the Socialist Arab  Ba'th Party, the Progressive Socialist Party, the Syrian Social  Nationalist Party, the Socialist Labor Party, the Nasirite  Popular Organization, the Union Party, the Islamic Amal  Movement, the Congress Party, Fatah Movement--the Revolutionary  Council, the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, the Popular  Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, the  Islamic al-Da'wah Party in Iraq, the Islamic Group, the Islamic  Resistance Movement--Hamas, the detainees follow-up committee,  the Muslim Ulema Council, the Jabal 'Amil Ulema Committee, the  secular conference, and the Democratic Front for the Liberation  of Palestine." The conferees issued a statement, which says in  part: "The participants demand that the Lebanese Government  adopt a stance commensurate with the popular position expressed  by the conferees to withdraw from the settlement negotiations,  which continue to represent a cover for ceaseless Zionist crimes  and attacks." The statement adds that "the conferees stress the  need for the authority to adopt the option of resistance in the  face of the enemy's plans and to support our resisting people in  all fields and domains for the sake of liberating the land and  safeguarding the holy places."    On page 7 AL-'AHD publishes approximately 1,000 words of  statements by various Lebanese officials and deputies in  reaction to the kidnapping operation. His Eminence Shaykh  Zuhayr Kanj, member of the Muslim Ulema Council, "notes that the  timing of the operation, just five days after Warren  Christopher's visit to the region, indicates the State  Department's involvement in the operation." He blames the local  authority and the Lebanese Government for negligence toward "the  act of piracy." Kanj calls on the prime minister to "resign  immediately because he is no longer capable to run the country  and because his policies have proved futile."    On page 9 the paper publishes an approximately 700-word  interview with Deputy al-Hajj Muhammad Yaghi, member of the Bloc  of Loyalty to the Resistance, place and date not given. He  condemns the kidnapping of al-Hajj al-Dirani and says: "We must  tell the Lebanese authorities that after the Zionist act of  piracy that dereliction and negligence on the part of the  government toward the basic issues, including the confrontation  of the Zionist enemy's schemes and plots, are unacceptable  policies for which the government must be held accountable."  Yaghi adds: "It is useless to lodge a complaint with the  Security Council as long as the U.S. Administration is the  international power broker and also the unrepentent supporter of  Zionist terrorism." He adds: "The only useful recourse is to  support the resistance with every available means because  resistance is the only appropriate reply to the continuing  aggression and arrogance."    On the same page, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately  2,000-word political and security analysis by Ibrahim  Shams-al-Din of the kidnapping operation. The writer refutes  the Israeli objectives and excuses behind the kidnapping  operation, noting that the kidnapping will not give Israel any  information about the whereabouts of Israeli navigator Ron Arad,  simply because al-Dirani knows nothing about the Israeli pilot.  The writer then discusses the "principles that should be upheld  by the government to eliminate the loopholes that contributed  toward the success of the terrorist operation." Shams-al-Din  adds: "It is necessary that the government change the list of  its priorities and give precedence to the issue of liberation.  The government should close the gaps through which the Zionists  penetrate the homeland's security and sovereignty." Shams-  al-Din goes adds that "the Lebanese authority should take  sufficient interest in the cause of the Lebanese detainees held  in Israeli prisons. The government should investigate the  recent kidnapping operation and unveil the identity of the  collaborators, who, according to various stories, guided the  enemy forces to the landing spot and to roads leading to the  house of al-Dirani."</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Arts: Faustus meets Arctic Willy - Youth Theatre A ROWDY mob has just staged its annual three day riot at the National Theatre to enthusiastic applause from relatives and assorted thespian worthies. Twelve youth theatre productions were chosen from more than 200 which took up the Lloyd's Bank Theatre Challenge for the prize of playing on a national stage and working with professional actors, directors and producers. It is a challenge the actors, aged between 11 and 19, handled with aplomb, as they threw themselves and their props around the Olivier and Cottesloe theatres. They would never forget the nights and nor would their professional mentors. Three productions left images in my mind. An adaptation of Christopher Marlowe's Dr Faustus by Unit 108 of the Orchard Theatre Company from Devon, uses the original text merely as a starting point to explore the fate of those who dare to test the truth as laid down by the powers that be. A nightmarish chorus opens the play, snaking across the stage to the strains of sinister Egyptian-esque music. They chant the opening speech with the air of those party to a vicious joke never shared with the audience and probably at its expense. In bizarre and sleazy costumes, with whitened faces made ghastly by garish make-up, they establish that this is Allegory and we are about to be judged. The action centres around a pub in 16th century Deptford. In a series of flashbacks, the audience learns how Faustus found that the study of philosophy, law, medicine and divinity could not answer his questions, so he agrees to exchange his soul for 24 years of magical power. Now, having spent his power on base whims like summoning the ghost of Marilyn Monroe, time is running out and he is afraid. He pleads with Marlowe to change the ending of the play and release him from the contract. The 16th century setting is shot with contemporary references. In the pub, a writhing stripper competes vainly with a conversation about Startrek. Marlowe appears in the guise of Raymond Chandler's private detective, complete with mackintosh and Hollywood theme tune. The only prop is a versatile wardrobe. As the play opens, it is a gents' loo, and then variously, a telephone box, a letter box and a coffin. The wardrobe is the vehicle for symbolism. A stylised silhouette of a man stuck to the wardrobe door signifies not only the gents' loo but also, when torn off, the play's main theme - the fall of man. The Dulwich College Dramatic Society's Arctic Willy, also uses theatre to examine the human condition. Set on a glacier inside the arctic circle, the play begins and ends with glaring hard light which subsides to reveal an icy landscape made out of white sheets. As the action unfolds, four young men stuck together on a scientific expedition miles from anyone else discover that even when everything is different, everything is the same. For example, authority, in the shape of the Expedition Manual, is hopelessly out of touch with reality. Addressing the audience, the team explains that Dan has fallen into every available crevasse. (He worries about frostbite of the penis - hence the play's title). They gravely recite the manual's absurd and complicated instructions for dealing with the situation. What actually happens is the other three have a good laugh at poor Dan's expense and then haul him out of the latest hole. It is the characters and the tensions between them which are the production's real strength. Dan and Nick do not get on because of their different ways of expressing their shared vulnerability. Dan is the bumbling anti-hero who confronts his many anxieties and Nick is a bullying oaf who pretends he is not as scared of polar bears as the others, all the while fearing his weakness will be exposed. Martin and Chris are both practical, hearty types engaged in a low-level struggle for control. And they all jostle for food. Much of the time, the actors address the audience directly, using cleverly choreographed movement to engage the eye as well as the brain. The play ends with Dan railing against the stupid insensitivity of the others. He alone recognises the beauty of their surroundings. The play suggests only those who are aware of themselves can hope to understand and appreciate the beauty of life. If Only I Had Friends, performed in the Cottesloe theatre, concentrates on a specific kind of human relationship - friendship. It is a courageous and compelling production devised by the Jeugdtheaterschool Zuid Holland. Set on a chess board-like floor to emphasise the epic forces and formalised rituals latent in the game of friendship, the two-man cast begins by looking at making friends. Through the device of recalling their first meeting at school, it becomes obvious that their perceptions - both of each other and themselves - were sharply different. It is a gripping performance which only hints at resolution for the questions it raises, but keeps the audience involved through the delicate observation of the improvisation. Rik was impressed by Hielke, who sported Doctor Marten boots when everyone else wore Nike trainers. Hielke was flattered by Rik's admiration, but found it unsettling because of his own self-loathing. The production makes clear that the sub-text of friendship is the imbalance of power. One party will always want what the other will not give. The action is interrupted by scenes of friendship from Kenneth Grahame's Wind in the Willows (Ratty meets Mole), Dickens' Oliver Twist (Oliver meets the Artful Dodger), and a charming puppet show in which a butterfly teaches a swan how to flutter. These straightforwardly fictional scenes provide a foil for the real-life relationship between the two boys and also make points about the dangers of friendship. Friendship is about sharing experiences. This can be something of a poisoned chalice if your friends are a bit odd.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Observer: Wrong plate Can Britain's best known financier do no wrong? A reader reported with ill-concealed joy that he had just seen a posh Rolls Royce - licence plate HAN 50N - clamped in London's Notting Hill Gate. Had the good Lord Hanson proved humanly fallible at last? Alas no. Although his carriages do have personalised number plates, his vice-chairman's office tells me the offending one is not among them. Perhaps it should be. Still on the subject of personalised number plates, I see that Ken Warren, Conservative MP for Hastings, owns MP 1066. Presumably, if he loses his seat it will be amended to XMP 1066.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar to a </F> Slovak Parliament session in Bratislava--live]    [Excerpts] There have been some calls asking me to take the  floor and show courage in this way. Let me tell you that  courage should be shown in the fight against the enemy and the  Slovak parliament has not been, is not, and will never be an  enemy for me. [long applause]    There has been an agreement on technical matters according  to  which a break is to follow the prime minister's speech. Then  the discussion will be about something else. I was therefore,  deliberately trying to give time to the members of the  government and others to enable them to voice their opinions.  [passage omitted]    The debate about confidence or no-confidence in the prime  minister is a debate about confidence or no-confidence in the  government as a whole. It is a problem that is worth discussing  at length because it is not about Meciar. This is about the  issue of the further strategy of Slovak politics, the further  path that Slovakia is to follow--because this strategy is  different. And this is a substantial change that will take  place. To think disparagingly that this is all about one person  is not good enough.    The president gave an impulse and started this discussion.  This was a purposeful action, not an accidental one. The  Slovaks understand the office of president as a symbol of the  state--which it really is--as an office for which they have a  sacred respect. It must, however, be also understood that the  president is an ordinary man, that the Presidential Office is  only one among institutions within the system, of the other  constitutional institutions of the state, and it is not the most  important one. The most important institution is you, the  deputies. You elect the president, you have the right to check  on him, you have the right to decide whether he will or will not  be president. It is your right. You cannot give up this right,  whatever the sanctity or deification of the president, at a time  when he is against the government and when he acts against the  movement in which he used to be its deputy chairman.    If you allow me I will not talk about this, but I would like  to reminisce. [passage omitted]    There are no personal disputes between me and Slovak  Republic  President Michal Kovac. He is not having an affair with my wife  and I do not wish to become a president. What personal disputes  can there be between us? [applause and whistling] At the same  time, allow me to express my view on his speech [in Slovak  Parliament on 9 March, criticizing Meciar].    First of all, assessing the structure of the speech, I would  like to say that no one from the Slovak Republic Government took  part in its drafting. The president did not ask any one of us  to give him information to base his speech on or to help him  with it. He did not consult any one of us--it surprised us just  as it surprised you--despite our offer, which was repeated  several times, to give the president anything that he might need  for writing such a speech.    The speech was written from the point of view of a  presidential system. The letters that the office of the  republic [as heard] receives and the statement that 99 percent  of the population is dissatisfied with the overall situation [in  the country] is not, forgive me for saying so, an objective  analysis. The president told you off, told us off, reproached  us for passing too many laws, the quality of which is not very  good as a result. He positively assessed the work of the  prosecutor's offices, he did not have any objections against the  government, with the exception of the prime minister, whom he  criticized for his working methods, and for his attitude to  himself, the person of Michal Kovac.    He also criticized the political parties and very mildly  also  the opposition. [passage omitted]    As far as the part of the speech concerning the personal  relations between the president and the prime minister is  concerned, and not the state of affairs of the Slovak Republic,  he [Kovac] bases it on statements allegedly made in one-on-one  conversations. What can one do when someone uses such arguments?  The only thing to do is not to have any more one-on-one  conversations.    I refute the statement by the president, according to which  I  said that we needed State Secretary Ivan Lexa to be appointed  minister of privatization so that we could engage in corrupt  practices. I refute this. We have never talked about this.  Roman Zelenay was present throughout our conversation. But it  is not ethical to base one's claim on the testimony of those who  are dead. But before Zelenay left the castle, he met several  members of the government and told them about the meeting. They  are sitting here, you can ask them. The president must be wrong  about this.    As far as the content of the president's speech is  concerned, allow me to say that the president does not have the  right to check up on the actions of the Slovak Republic  Government, does not have the right to initiate, in any way, a  motion of no-confidence in the government or its members, does  not have the constitutional initiative, cannot demand the  resignation of the prime minister.    The president does not have the right to assess the actions  of the National Council of the Slovak Republic. He was elected  by it and answers to it. The National Council should assess his  actions. It is the other way round. You failed to notice this,  just because it [the criticism] was aimed against us. [passage  omitted]    The president calls for political calm and consensus, but,  forgive me, if he indirectly appeals to the parliament to pass a  vote of no-confidence in the government, then, it seems to me,  he does not honestly want the political situation to be calm.  Most of you in the opposition understood that he called on you  to do that.    The president has significantly contributed to the immediate  polarization of our society. He does not accept the democratic  process and the phenomenon of pluralistic elections, according  to which it is not important whether the government has a  majority, but what matters is whether the majority allows the  government to rule.    Norway has a minority government for the third term now and  the country is among the most prosperous in Europe.    Today, the mechanism of 86 votes is here, according to which  you can formally express a vote of no-confidence in the  government. This is the reality.    As for the issues raised by his speech, it is not only the  president who is a constitutional body. You yourselves are a  constitutional body and we, the government, are a constitutional  body, too. Tell me, where else in the world, in which state are  relations between constitutional bodies being solved in this  way? Show me another silly place, apart from Slovakia, where  things are done like this! Things must not be done like this,  for nowhere else are they approached in this way! From time to  time there can be clashes between parliaments and government.  That is quite normal. There were clashes in Hungary, for  example, between the government and the president. But  altogether, different ways and means were used to resolve this  situation. Things must not be done in this way!    As far as another issue is concerned, it was not us who  attacked the president in parliament. It was he who has  attacked both the prime minister and the chairman of the  parliament [Ivan Gasparovic]. My view is that the Constitution  does not give the president the political right to express his  views on the activities of the cabinet, let alone express his  views on the methods of constitutional officials' activities.  This assessment is for the electorate to make and early  elections would provide an opportunity to make such an  assessment. Despite the fact that he declares he is above the  parties, in reality he took sides by delivering his speech.    I have stated that I have no personal conflicts or  misunderstandings with Michal Kovac, I have no personal  conflicts with anybody. I have working ones, yes. This happens  often in the course of work.    As for issues discussed and not discussed, my views on a  number of issues differed from those of the president. In the  foreign policy sphere there was a lack of coordination between  the work of the National Council and the government. In effect,  we have spent the whole year asking for this coordination. To  this day it has not materialized. We proposed to exchange  reports on our [foreign] trips. I suggested that the president  provide the government with a report on his trips, so that we  could use it as a basis for working toward [concluding]  agreements. We did not intend to check things. [passage  omitted]    We did not receive any reports from his trips at all. I  cannot say to what extent these trips were successful, because I  was not there, but I do know what happened during my trips.  Anyway, this cooperation in our work has been lacking.    As to Slovakia's foreign political activity, our views  differed on a number of subjects. Former Foreign Affairs  Minister Milan Knazko remarked here in the National Council on  Lexa's doings in Yugoslavia. Lexa did not go to Yugoslavia, he  went to Croatia. I asked him to go there and to cancel the  promise of the president, who was then Federal Assembly speaker,  that we and Croatia would pursue and coordinate the  manufacturing and sale of arms. After taking his up post [as  president], the president once again returned to this matter,  saying that Austria was to be involved, too. The Austrian press  wrote about some of these matters, which were then suspended.  Should any doubts arise, then there is a witness whom I  instructed to be there. The foreign affairs minister who was  then also deputy prime minister [Knazko] knew what [Lexa] would  do there. (?He will remember it later). I handed written reports  on the subject to the then state secretary [in the Privatization  Ministry].    We had different views on the recognition of Taiwan when  the president requested in writing that the matter be resolved  either by a political or commercial recognition, the upshot  being that we would receive $5 million. It happened that a  Baltic country took such a step and received in return nothing,  but such a thing means immediately a political and international  conflict with the Chinese People's Republic. I was  fundamentally against taking such a step, although I was not  against the president. I wanted the state to acquire dollars,  but I did not want the state to be involved in an international  conflict and find itself in international isolation. Is this a  personal dispute?    We equally parted ways in the assessment of our visits to  the  Czech Republic. After his talks with President Havel, the  president returned and asked that we make a settlement amounting  to 18.2 billion korunas [Sk] regarding the National Property  Fund and Sk24 billion in settling the deficit in the Czech  budget. I did not agree. I was not alone when we explained the  matter to him at the airport. There were a number of us there.  In the end Sk18.2 billion worth of shares came into Slovakia  free of charge. The government was right.    Regarding the visit to Poland, which you assessed here, only  after the president's visit did ministers meet and prepare the  draft of an agenda which both sides would then discuss and  prepare by the end of March. When you proceed from the premise  that such treaties were prepared before that visit, then the  answer is that they were not. We did not infringe on anything  and behaved correctly towards the president.    On the question of the assessment of the visit by President  Clinton, I personally assess it as a wasted opportunity. We had  40 minutes for talks. Extensive preparations were made. Before  the team President Clinton delegated for the visit to the Slovak  Republic arrived, the president issued a statement to the press  that Slovakia wanted to be in NATO's political structures. The  commission which visited our country understood this to be a  counteralternative, a different proposal, and this is why I  dissociated myself from it on behalf of the Slovak Republic,  because that matter had not been consulted with us. It was a  unilateral statement, and after all, we are jointly responsible  for foreign policy.    An agreement was approved on a joint course of action of the  delegation in talks with President Clinton. This was an historic  opportunity which would not be repeated; an opportunity to  tackle security and economic interests of the Slovak Republic,  to tackle issues of cooperation and bilateral relations between  the United States and Slovakia. We worked out very many  matters, but out of only 40 minutes, 34 were reserved for a  one-sided speech which the president, acting as the chairman of  the delegation, delivered. How much time then did I get? I  asked the foreign minister how much time do I have? He told me  five minutes and no more. There were reactions from the  American side which were negative in this regard. Twice there  was an interruption by a sound signal [as heard]. There was the  stance of the foreign minister, the stance of Mrs. Albright, the  stance of President Clinton. I was ashamed and I was not alone;  we all felt the same in the delegation. This was a wasted  opportunity. But why not discuss this matter frankly? I do not  wish to cast a doubt.... [pauses]    Why were agreements not implemented? We drew up important  documents that were key for the Slovak Republic. When will a  delegation of the Slovak Republic be received again in such a  favorable atmosphere and in such a composition?    Regarding matters of protocol, in reality these discussions  did not take place on several occasions with the president, but  he always was represented by a deputy prime minister. It was  either a prime minister or a deputy prime minister. This is not  against protocol. The same applies to the chairman of the  National Council. It was either he personally, or a deputy  chairman of the National Council, who represented the president.  We have never permitted ourselves to not show respect to the  president and not meet him. But when a visit takes place, for  instance, in the course of government's meeting, then a deputy  prime minister leaves and the prime minister continues in the  government meeting. If by a chance an announcement about the  president's departure comes several hours before fundamental  questions are to be discussed, during which the prime minister's  personal attendance is essential, then a deputy prime minister  goes. Is this the reason for parliament to discuss the matter?  [passage omitted]    Concerning ethnic minorities, the president asked the  government for any material relating to ethnic minorities. We  were never invited to take part as partners in the roundtable.  Only political parties were invited, although the government had  a plan ready. We could not accept the situation which had  arisen, for example, in connection with the law on place names  and surnames which we jointly referred back to the National  Council. After a long debate in parliament, I successfully  defended the law at the Vienna meeting of Council of Europe  representatives, who accepted it. It was very frustrating to  learn that the president referred the law back to the National  Council for a second time, which he was not constitutionally  authorized to do. [passage omitted]    The Government of the Slovak Republic is not to be blamed.  The same applies to the law on place names and surnames. One  concept came up.... [pauses] The Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia cannot create alternatives to government policy. It  must support it as long as it is in the government and you will  do the same when you are in the government. It was not  necessary to promise at the round table that an executive body  would be set up on a governmental level, because it already  exists. The Council for Minorities exists. It is not necessary  to talk about the existence or nonexistence of government  policy; it is necessary to get to know it.    Concerning questions of the relationship with the  government,  we shall part the veil slightly although we never intended to do  so. There were (?talks) with all government members, their  loyalty to the prime minister was investigated. For example, at  the Ministry of Culture, a discussion took place in March 1993  about the possibility of changing the prime minister in autumn  1993. These talks were also held with other government members.  They sit here, they can confirm it if you want to know. It is  not the usual way in which the president of the state should go  about his business. Only you can decide if I am going to be the  prime minister or not and you must not permit anybody to take  this right away from you.    Concerning personnel issues, I also think that president  cannot take over the role of the prime minister by negotiating  with ministers about who will leave what ministry for which  different ministry. Only I am entitled to make similar  proposals. Somebody did not want to respect this right of mine.  [passage omitted]    Regarding the discussions concerning Lexa, Prokes, and the  like. I do not wish to comment on the matter. It is a very poor  show. The president has made use of Ivan Lexa's remark that was  made in private--and I do not know where and in front of whom it  was made. He said that when the president was elected, Slovakia  was in shit. Nonetheless, to bring this into the relation with  the prime minister and start politicking in parliament because  of that private remark, this does not seem to me either tactful  or appropriate.    As regard the matters concerning relations between Lexa and  the president, there were certain problems within the Movement  for a Democratic Slovakia. Lexa was right. [laughter] You do  not know the details of it and yet you are laughing. This is  good.    As regards the proposal about Mr Prokes, excuse me but we do  have to accept the basic existing institution, which is  pluralistic democracy. If there is a government coalition in  power, the prime minister can submit only a candidate endorsed  by the coalition. And if you form that super-coalition  government, then you will not be able to submit any proposal to  the president unless a mutual agreement has been reached on it.    It is difficult to accept when somebody is approved to the  office of deputy prime minister for European integration and at  the same time is not approved as a minister of foreign affairs.  Why not? After all, he is already member of the government. He  is not a new person. Naturally, we did expect some support,  rather than conflict regarding this matter.    The same applies to Ivan Lexa. If the president did not give  me his word and if he did not tell me in front Mr. Gasparovic  that he would accept Lexa in the coalition bloc, I would not be  have put him forward. He, naturally, said in public that he did  not want Prokes. But if, after this public statement, he did  not say at the close of our private conversation, that he would  take some time to consider the matter and that he would consider  his attitude then we (?would have not proposed him). Half an  hour after the conversation, his attitude was different. Now he  is using that incident for politicking. Excuse me but this was  not aimed against the president.    If the government is to be formed by the president as he  thinks it fit, instead of the coalition in accordance with an  agreement mutually arrived at, a functional government cannot be  formed.    As regards the issues connected with the government, one can  have a respect for the office or the person, but the president  cannot say in any state that he needs a new government that  would be trusted abroad, since this government enjoys confidence  abroad.    Equally, the president cannot say about the government that  it does not strive to be the government of all citizens. The  government does not have to be accepted by all citizens, but its  conclusions and proposals are binding for all citizens. It is  the government of the state.    Equally, the president cannot ever say without any evidence  that corruption affects the highest quarters. If it is true,  why did he not report to the prosecutor general anyone suspected  of corruption? If it is not true, then he should apologize to  us. We are not thieves. You may have doubts whether we  discharge our office in line with your ideas, but we do not  steal. When there was any doubt and evidence or suspicion about  any member of the government, I always had it investigated.  [words indistinct]    Equally, the president cannot say the government has lost  moral credibility. What immoral things have we done? I want  nothing else but evidence. You can judge us if you wish but  only in accordance with evidence. Look for evidence. If you do  not have it, judge us in accordance with an impression we have  made.    As regard the accusations that everyone who works for me is  somewhat obliged to me regardless of his or her talent, excuse  me, this is a gross insult to all those who work with me. I  have never obliged anyone but by the promise of hard work. I  have never in my life given any advantages above those that are  due. I demand from everyone only service to the state, service  to the public, not to spare oneself, and to give all. Not  everyone has been able to cope with these demands either  psychologically, physically, or politically. I got goose  pimples when I received, with a great deal of dilemma, the  message the president conveyed to me several weeks ago by the  speaker of the parliament saying that the president enjoyed the  support of the Armed Forces and the police. What for?    As regard to the HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia],  you do not like the way deputies have been speaking, that many  of them have been reacting with emotions, that they have been  reacting to the president's speech differently to how you in the  opposition understand it, into whose hands it has inevitably  played. This is a political motive. But our attitude is  different. After all, he is the man who came from our ranks.  He is the man to whom we gave 74 of our votes. He is the man  who enjoyed our confidence. He is the man who always declared  himself as being my friend and who declared this publicly  everywhere he went.    As regard the questions of the HZDS attitudes, I ask you  chairmen of parliamentary parties, who of you would tolerate a  situation in which the president would invite your deputies and  say to them that he had his own people in your clubs who report  to him, and therefore; he did not need information from you.  Who of you would tolerate a situation in which, within your  movement, he would hold discussions with your deputies or your  party officials asking them to seek another chairman or another  prime minister? Among the people who were most frequently in  cahoots with him for more than three quarters of the year were  Roman Kovac, Jozef Moravcik, and Ivan Laluha too, who was among  them for a certain period of time, about three weeks. The  president simply cooperated with them within our movement for  three quarters of the year. This is simply not a normal state  of affairs. Yet this happened.    Regarding, attitude to parties, the Constitution says that  parties are independent from the state. The president is a  representative of the state. The president of the republic  cannot interfere in the internal life of a party. Likewise, the  state does not have the right to interfere in the internal life  parties. Parties are autonomous in this regard. We did not want  anything and at the meetings of our leadership, we discussed  nothing else but how to curb or prevent such an influence within  the movement.    As regard the criticism made at the rally in the Park of  Culture and Rest, we drew the president's attention to the fact  that he was not getting good information about what was going  on. We drew his attention to the fact that those who were  giving him such information were misleading him. But rallies in  the Park of Culture and Rest and other meetings held by the HZDS  took place under Havel's and Carnogursky's rule and will take  place also under Kovac's.    Regarding the crisis we have, it is a crisis of  personalities  in the parliament. It is not a crisis of the movement. The  movement is healthy, ready, and capable of fighting any other  party in an honest and democratic fight, in the interest of  future cooperation.    On questions concerning the concept of the government's  activities, there cannot arise a situation, and such a thing  does not arise from the Constitution, in which the president  would propose his concept of privatization to be incorporated  within the government's concept of privatization. This cannot  happen. There cannot be a situation under which the government  acts in one way in the Fund of National Property while the  president acts differently. These are situations which do not  stem from him his constitutional duties. The constitution sets  boundaries for competences and cooperation among all  institutions. If these boundaries are violated, conflicts  follow and both violation and conflicts have occurred before you  in the parliament.    Regarding the state of our society, I permit myself to  claim that there does not exist a crisis within the state.  There is neither a social nor economic crisis in our society  and there has not been a governmental crisis to date either.  You have been accusing us of not cooperating enough. But how  did we pass laws, if not in cooperation with you? You say that  we have been concentrating power in our hands. How can a  government, that has had since the very days of assuming office  a minority in the parliament, concentrate power in its hands.  We have been able to make progress only in cooperation with  other parties.    The government has never intented to control the judiciary  and has not interfered in the powers of the judiciary. We form  the government, but only because people elected us in democratic  elections. We have not formed the government by cheating. We  have not recruited deputies from other parties asking them to  vote for us to enable us to form a government. We went honestly  into the elections and won the fight and we know that we shall  also win every future one. [applause]    You say that broad-based cooperation should have been  established. This was not possible, not because we did not want  it. It is the interests of individual parties that decide such  cooperation. What choice did we have? In the run up to the  establishment of our new state, the Party of the Democratic Left  [SDL] did not want to go with us if the Slovak National Party  [SNS] was to be our partner, too, and after the establishment of  the state, the SDL defined clearly its interest. It aimed at  what I regard to be the correct thing and that is it followed  its own of political interest, which it is also doing at  present. [passage omitted]    The Christian Democratic Movement [KDH], too, formed its  attitude to the HZDS autonomously and independently. These were  not questions relating to the period ending 1 January 93 which  have prevented cooperation between our two parties. They were  also questions concerning your attitude after 1 January 1993:  confrontation with the government, confrontation in localities,  inability to cooperate with anyone at the district level,  threats to members of the HZDS. You can claim what you want, but  that is the picture. If such willingness to cooperate is absent  in the party structure as a whole and when your party structure  acts in conflict with the government, how can you come to an  agreement with it? [passage omitted]    I was not imposing confrontation on you. I was asking for  cooperation. That is why we are saying as late as today that  the limits of cooperation are hard to come by. The situation is  similar with regard to the Hungarian parties. The part of their  policy which is turning into nationalism, intolerance and which  contains hints of irredentism, is unacceptable to us. Regarding  the main parts of the policy, it is possible to cooperate with  you, but you are clearly not going to give up this part of your  policy just because of us. [passage omitted]    As regards the relationship which has developed between the  president and the government, I am willing to respect the  Constitution of the Slovak Republic and I am capable of  respecting it. Providing the president acts within the  framework of the Constitution, it is possible to forget what has  taken place here.    If he is not prepared to do so, I propose the following.  Taking into account the fact that a conflict has emerged between  the leading personalities and that this conflict is damaging to  our state, it is to detrimental to our state, [I propose] that  the president of the Republic resign and one minute after that I  will resign, too. I give you my word on this. I propose that  both of us face our citizens openly in elections, and attempt to  gain trust and influence.    As for the solution to the situation which has emerged  today,  this situation can never be so clear-cut that it prevents it  from being dealt with in various ways. The first fact that  exist is that the referendum is underway. The mechanism of the  referendum has been set in motion. It has been initiated by  citizens and none of us should be indifferent to the fact that  15 percent of the voters were in favor of it. If citizens  matter to us and if we hold them in esteem, we should respect  their will. Their will says: Let's hold immediate elections.  Their will says: Put an end to deputies leaving the parties for  which we voted for other parties, because those of you who left  will not stay neutral for long. You will end up in  Carnogursky's camp. [laughter, applause] You have no other  chance! And if your reason for leaving us was to get Duray  [chairman of the Hungarian Coexistence movement] and Carnogursky  into the government, it is up to you to settle the score with  your leadership and with those who put their trust in you.    As regards the matter of a referendum, the possible outcome  is as follows: Unless elections are held by the end of June a  referendum will take place. In the case that the referendum's  outcome is positive in favor of changes, its validity excludes  the validity of the Constitution, a situation can arise when the  current government coalition may have 90 votes at its disposal  by the end of June. [sentence as heard] You do not want this  but it could happen. You argue that Western Europe is against  it. Allow me to inform you that certain circles in Western  Europe permit this as a temporary solution. A temporary  situation can last for a period of three years, and after three  years have elapsed the parliament may change the outcome of the  referendum by passing a constitutional law.    As regard to further questions put in the  referendum--elections and the proof of property--this all is  capable of being resolved. To seek a mechanism of how to prevent  direct democracy means to choose a new conflict between a  representative body and direct democracy, between a  representative democracy and direct democracy. This, for God's  sake, we cannot permit. The HZDS will therefore not do anything  that would question a referendum and the right of citizens to  hold such a referendum. Please do not ask this from us. We have  come of the people and will return to them even if we are no  longer in the government. We will never go against the people.    The second possibility that exists is early elections. There  were three alternatives of elections. An alternative that  elections take place a year hence, although I said that they  would not then take place. Then there is the alternative for  them to take place in November. This is not acceptable. This  would mean that the political crisis would affect all those  structures about which I was talking, and that serious damage  would be done to the economic, social, international, and  political interests of the state. This is why I ask all of you  to be in favor of early elections, but in June.    It is the state that needs such elections. The Meciar  government does not need them. Our readiness to hold elections  is the same as yours. [passage omitted]    As regards early elections, we regard them as a key  democratic process of how to resolve the crisis. In the case  that early elections are held by the end of June, then the  mechanism of the referendum could not be set in motion. It  could not be.    As regards the questions connected with what to do next is  the question of what to do in the period between today's  parliament session and elections. There are several possible  alternatives. There is the alternative to which 50 of you  subscribed--to pass a motion of no confidence in the government.  In that case there will be a new government, and the HZDS as a  whole will go into the opposition. Do not expect that any of us  will become members of the new government, or that you will  manage to persuade any of us to join the new government. Our  political bodies have laid down that anyone who would want to  attempt this [join the new government] that vote of no  confidence be passed against such person and no member of the  HZDS can be a member of such a government. There exists an  agreement of honor among members of the government that in the  event of a motion of no confidence in the government being  passed, no one would join the new government.    Thus, the vote of no confidence presents a danger that the  continuity of the current government's work will be completely  lost. There is also a danger that if the referendum at the end  of June reinstates our previous numbers in the parliament, we  will bring this government back. Do not even think, do not even  consider that we would not do this.    As regards the options of staying in government, there are  three options we consider to be realistic. The first option is  to preserve the cabinet in its current form until democratic  elections take place. We give our word to the National Council  of the Slovak Republic and citizens of the Slovak Republic that  we will do everything possible in order to have democratic, free  elections and that the cabinet will cope with organizational and  technical elements of the campaign in a way that will not be  detrimental to anyone's interests. We also assume the  obligation to accept a cross-party agreement on what the cabinet  will do or not do in the period before the elections, in order  not to damage your interests.    We are also prepared to accept the third [as heard] option.  According to the third option, it is possible to form a  three-member coalition--consisting of the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], the Slovak National Party [SNS], and  the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL]--providing the offer I am  now publicly making to the SDL to participate in the cabinet is  accepted. [applause]    The following option is not easy because of our relationship  with our coalition partner, the SNS, but it is the result of  their free decision and their own, free considerations that they  do not want to become an obstacle to a wider political  agreement. I am unhappy doing this, but I am doing it because I  am aware of the political realities: I am also offering the  option according to which it would be possible to form a  coalition between the HZDS and the SDL, which could be formed  immediately on the basis of a reorganization of the cabinet, and  does not need to lead to the dismissal of the current cabinet.  Such a cabinet would also be considered a temporary cabinet and  its main task would be to prepare free and democratic elections  for all as soon as possible.    I have stated the reasons for our not offering a coalition  to  other political entities. In Slovakia there is a crisis of  democracy, excuse me, a climate of democracy, I should say.  [laughter and applause] The government has not acted against  anyone for views that were voiced. The only one against whom  criminal proceedings were launched in the republic is Ivan Lexa,  the state secretary in the Privatization Ministry, for his  opinion, which he stated before the election of the president  and which he reiterated after the presidential elections.  Nobody else is being, or will be prosecuted on the territory of  our state by the government. As far as administrative  interference is concerned, there was not a single case of  interference. While the polemics we pursue are unpleasant, we  do not carry out any administrative interference, we do not  issue orders or go in for red tape.    The arts have been developing freely. Those harboring  another approach to the government and those who sometimes  overdo things (are still finding the courage) to criticize the  government. But that is a matter of taste and for us it is  absolutely natural to respect this. Freedom of the press and  the freedom of action by political entities is respected. There  were no actions against other political entities.    In this connection, I would like to point out to the  Hungarian political parties that they have signed the draft  motion seeking a vote of no confidence in the government along  with the very same people who only a few weeks ago called for a  strong action in Komarno [where Hungarians called for autonomy]  saying that there was a need to use force. If this does not  serve as a reminder it does not matter. But do not regret it  afterwards.    As regard to matters connected with the further development  of our political system, at issue is not merely the purity of  our society but a climate must inevitably be created, or rather  the current climate must be changed in regard to the attitude  parties take toward the state and the citizen. The fact that so  many people have at present turned indifferently to politics,  this my esteemed fellow deputies, represents a common failure of  ours, both yours and mine, even if we come out of this best in  this respect. Nonetheless, this is a failure. A citizen who is  indifferent to public affairs poses the biggest threat to the  state. You also have such people among your own voters. This  is not merely our own disease. This poses a risk to the state  and it cannot go on. To build on the collapse of our society's  subconsciousness, the collapse of the interest in politics is  not a policy for the future. This is a defeat for the state.  Whoever builds on such a premise is himself a loser. Such a  person will no longer be able to govern in any other way but  with the help of the police. Up to now we did not need to do  anything of this kind for we have been enjoying enough of the  people's trust.    When making up your minds today, think well of what will  happen after the elections. Do not create a state of affairs  that would make cooperation difficult or even impossible after  the elections have taken place. Those of you who are even a bit  realistic know that we will win the elections. It does not  matter when they take place. Do not draw a conclusion that  would create a situation in which today's success paves way to a  subsequent failure. I warn you and beg you to heed this advice.    Allow me now to express my own personal attitude. Along  with my friends and colleagues--whether they are in the  government or in our movement--I have achieved what no Slovak  has succeeded in achieving in several decades or even centuries.  I know none of the Slovak representatives who wanted to achieve  a great deal who did not have an easy fate and did not end well.  Nonetheless, to think that an office or who is in charge are  not important, then when the interest of the nation and the  state is at stake, one has to guarantee it also by one's own  life and not merely by one's word and one's own position. This  is the duty of the person who wants to be at the head of such a  great movement. A person who is not prepared for this should  not get involved. One cannot distribute rewards in this  instance in the form of privatized projects. In such an  instance foundations must be laid to prepare the whole of  society for the 21st century. A person who does not have such  great goals will achieve nothing great. A person who only sees  personal interests will be rejected as a person. A person who  does not have a program for the development as a whole will  perish. Since many of you aspire to get involved and then look  at what is ahead, I tell you that apart from the trapdoor of  history, there is nothing beyond. One can either sink or swim.  All of you who think that there is something beyond--there is  nonetheless one great holy thing: To serve all and to give  everything that is good as well as bad in us. [sentence as  heard]    I am a normal person and I have made my own mistakes and  have  imperfections. I possess some advantages and some shortcomings.  Everyone is better as well as worse at something. I have never  resisted a factual criticism of what was not good and I have  always endeavored to accept proposals that I have heard from  you. If there were not many of them that could have been  applied, do not blame me.    For the past four years I have been the subject of a  continual political struggle. It was at one time [then  Czechoslovak President] Havel who caused me a headache and now  our own president is the instigator. During the past few weeks  in this parliament you have been engaged in seeking our  dismissal and now you will perhaps once again debate this matter  and dismiss us. It is not pleasant to be a continual target of  the most dirtiest and the most primitive attacks. It is not  pleasant to be the subject of invectives and attacks as well as  malicious remarks, some of which lack substance. You are against  something that you feel instinctively but which you do not seem  to be able to develop. It is not easy to live such a life and  to bear such a burden. When I am doing it I am not doing it  because I feel the need to be in power; I am not doing because I  aspire to power; I am doing it because people have asked me to  discharge such a service. I will go to them once more to ask  them if they still want me. If they say "yes" to me I will  continue to serve.    If you believe and stand on the idea of some kind of all  embracing human understanding that all parties will be in the  government and that calm will prevail everywhere, you will only  succeed in bringing the discord that is among you in parliament  into the government and into the state structures. You will  thus destroy them. This is not such a simple mechanism that  could be implemented in such a way.    If I fear a coalition that would be confrontational within  itself then this is not because I want to hold onto the prime  minister's chair. I am merely doing so because we do not want  government departments and the state administration to start  fighting among themselves. I do not want our society to become  Balkanized. I do not want a misunderstanding among people,  which has already been sown and which would lead to ethnic,  social, or any other conflicts. When I was the prime minister  nothing of this kind has happened.    Regarding matters concerning the understanding of what  constitutes either a democratic or undemocratic management and  discharge of state functions, you can have thousands of views on  the matter, you can have thousands of standpoints, but results  have nonetheless been achieved. Judge me for what I have done.  Do not judge me for what you have, what I could have possibly  done and what was not possible in a given situation. The  situation as it existed in the government lead to us having one  single common goal--the burning question of the aspiration of  the state. [sentence as heard] With me in the government were  people who joined at my invitation and each of whom had to win  the trust of our people, and I beg you to treat these people  with respect. They have done you no harm and they have given to  you and to the state everything they were capable of giving.  They have given their health, their own personal interests,  their own families. They now have only their own life. They  have given all. There are not many such politicians who have  willingly given all. Whatever decision you make I am proud that  I have been able to work with them. They are honorable people.  If I were to form a future government the overwhelming majority  of them would be included.    Regarding matters connected with present developments and  attitudes, one can lose many battles. There is however, in  history a time that I call the time of justice, a time that  measures each of us. It contains within itself a great truth.  In our life we all have been given an equal measure and time  itself will judge us. Do not therefore do today anything that  would damage the state. Do not be hasty in taking steps in  which you would write the government off, only because its  members do not come from your ranks.    I am so pleased and so proud that you are the parliament of  the Slovak Republic as a state. You are its first parliament.  I am just as pleased and proud of the fact that this was the  first government of this state. If it is at all possible, let  us make sure that (departments) of constitutional bodies are  coordinated rather than clashing with one another. If it is at  all possible, let us impart to people the art of carrying out a  civilized dialogue, let us give peace to the country and let us  respect its citizens. If possible, let us get united in  political diversity where each of us will be able to help revive  the socioeconomic system. [passage omitted]    If possible, let us look for a path leading to an agreement  on the use of the huge potential that the Slovak Republic has.  Wasting this opportunity we have would be irresponsible,  because it might be thousands of years before another chance  come's about. It might never come about. My interest has never  been other than the interest of this state. You do not have to  agree with me. In fact, it would not be a good idea if you did.  I was tough in discussions. You know that I was a winner in the  majority of discussion duels. But this should not give you  grounds to say I was (nasty) to you.    As far as the issues of Slovakia's future are concerned, I  will consider myself an optimist if the basic democratic  substance of its existence--the free will of citizens--is  manifested and maintained. Should this element be suppressed I  would consider myself a really big pessimist.    I know this state inside out. I know each element in its  mechanism, everything we fixed, failed to fix, or resolve. I  know where it is heading, I know its potential. I believe in  people. It is for them and in the face of them that you should  demonstrate your belief. There is never just one solution, but  a second, and subsequent solutions, especially on radical  matters. Thank you.

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / World Trade News: Indonesian water for Singapore The government of Singapore is to invest SDollars 1.4bn (Pounds 485m) in a water development project on Indonesia's Bintan Island, Indonesia's official Antara news agency said yesterday, writes William Keeling in Jakarta. Antara quoted Mr Rivale Rachman, administration secretary of Riau province and responsible for Bintan and Batam islands - which with Singapore and Malaysia's Johor state make up the 'growth triangle' - that the agreement had been signed between the two countries last month. The agreement supplements a 30-year accord signed on June 20 last year, Antara said, in which Indonesia agreed to supply Singapore 1bn gallons of water a day at a price of one Singapore cent per cubic metre. The water is to be piped from Bintan Island through Batam Island and across the sea to Singapore. The project will be completed in three stages over 15 years. Mr Rachman said 'the project will be fully financed by the Singapore government and not by its private sector.' Batam has been attracting most investment, USDollars 2.2bn in commitments by 1991, but adequate water supply has been a major restriction to further development. A limit of 40 cubic metres per hectare a day has been imposed. However Bintam which has 14 rivers is the more abundant in water resources and the project will include the construction of a reservoir.</p>

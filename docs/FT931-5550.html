			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Business structure takes a new shape The decentralisation of companies and flatter management structures - buzzwords of the 1980s and 1990s - have coincided with the downsizing of computer systems to produce the latest computer term - groupware. But while most companies will eventually opt to use information technology which will support team working, the inhibiting factor today is cultural rather than technical, according to the Groupware Report'93. The report, published by Policy Publications, of Brighton, cites numerous companies that have re-engineered their business structures using groupware and have cut costs in the process. The report costs Pounds 195. Policy Publications: UK, 0273 565505.</p>

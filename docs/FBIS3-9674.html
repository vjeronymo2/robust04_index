After an introductory speech by Mirsad Delagic,  Bosnian government minister for regional coordination for the  Bihac-Banja Luka district, and statements by the republic's  deputies Adem Ibrahimpasic and Ejub Topic, deputies of the Bihac  assembly praised this historic document and fully approved the  proposed constitution. They also concluded that -- due to  administrative mistakes -- a protest must be lodged with the  chairman and the secretary general of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  parliament to request that invitations and documents for future  sessions be sent to the Bihac deputies.

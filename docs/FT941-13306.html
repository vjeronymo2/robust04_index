			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Cantors advances to Pounds 563,000 Improved trading and tight control of overheads and margins enabled Cantors, the furniture retailer, to report profits ahead from Pounds 175,000 to Pounds 563,000 in the 26 weeks to October 23. However, Mr Harold Cantor, chairman, said that trading in the second half had been difficult, affected by the uncertainty created by the November Budget. He added that new year sales had started well and if the trend continued there would be an acceptable improvement in full year profits. Mr Cantor said that the experimental format of trading in retail parks was continuing satisfactorily. One was opened in the period under review with two more in December. Three more are planned before the end of the financial year. The shares rose 10p to 340p. Turnover rose by 4 per cent from Pounds 28.7m to Pounds 29.8m. Trading profit was almost doubled at Pounds 656,000 (Pounds 336,000). The pre-tax result was helped by lower net interest charges of Pounds 93,000 (Pounds 161,000). Earnings per share came out at 2.42p (0.76p). The interim dividend is maintained at 1p.</p>

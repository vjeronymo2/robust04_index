			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: US capacity utilisation figures could fuel speculation about higher rates if, as economists expect, there is only a marginal drop between June and July. Wednesday: June average earnings and unit labour cost data form key points of interest in the UK's mid-month 'super Wednesday' for economic releases. Consensus forecasts from MMS International point to unchanged wage inflation and a slight easing in the annual rate of unit wage cost inflation. July's unemployment figures are expected to show a further fall of about 18,000 last month. Thursday: The Bundesbank council meets for the first time after its summer break. Few analysts expect a change in official interest rates. Although UK markets are prepared for a rate rise later this year, the expected rise in retail sales in July should not trigger action, provided the picture is one of subdued inflation encouraging spending. Analysts are not expecting any shocks from UK broad money and bank and building society lending figures, which are forecast to show a modest slowdown in growth in July compared with June.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES CITY HALL'S PILOT PROJECT TO RECYCLE WASTEPAPER  </P> <P> As the sponsor of the City Hall pilot recycled paper program, we feel compelled  to correct the many misstatements of fact in your article ("China Recycling  Program a Paper Tiger," Metro, Dec. 3) and to affirm the excellent efforts of  both the City of Los Angeles General Services Department and the city employees  in making this project successful.  </P> <P> This 6-month pilot was funded at considerable expense entirely by China Paper  Partners. It tested a unique concept of separating, collecting and recycling  mixed paper and represented the first phase of a project to build a de-inking  pulp mill in Tianjin, China.  </P> <P> The intent was to finish the feasibility study in June, break ground in August,  and be able to ship Los Angeles wastepaper to the mill when it was finished.  Unfortunately, the difficulty in relying on foreign markets for recycling that  the United States should be undertaking itself was dramatically underscored by  last summer's political events in China.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Los Angeles made a good faith commitment to explore an innovative  and needed means of recycling mixed paper. Neither party walked away from the  program. I would like to correct several points:  </P> <P> 1. Conservatree Paper Co. and China Paper partners did not "lose interest in"  or "abandon" the program in the spring of 1989. Mayor Tom Bradley notified  employees about the program by letter in late February.  </P> <P> Several meetings were conducted with the entire custodial services staff in  April and May. China Paper Partners launched a follow-up employee education  campaign throughout City Hall in early May, 1989, with a second letter of  instruction from the mayor.  </P> <P> With the assistance of the Los Angeles Conservation Corps, practically every  employee work station in City Hall was visited, with program materials  distributed and program operations explained on a one-to-one basis. This was  supplemented by decals on all recycling and refuse bins, as well as posters in  every elevator lobby.  </P> <P> 2. City's Hall's existing white paper and newspaper recycling programs were  never discontinued. Rather, our mixed paper recycling program was added to the  system.  </P> <P> 3. China Paper Partners was not in the business of buying and selling  wastepaper. This would occur only if the pilot project succeeded and a mill  were established in China.  </P> <P> 4. The collection program resulted in more than two-thirds of the waste stream  being collected for recycling from both Transamerica and City Hall, more than  twice the collection rate of programs previously judged successful.  </P> <P> China Paper partners briefed the mayor's office, the General Services  Department, and Councilwoman Ruth Galanter's office, as well as your newspaper,  in October and November regarding the status of the program and the uncertainty  of the situation in China.  </P> <P> Innovative ventures such as this are complex, particularly when international  political and business interests are mixed. The Chinese government remains  deeply interested in this project.  </P> <P> It is only after our November visit to China and time to review the complicated  situation with planned investing institutions that we have had the information  necessary to determine the next steps. Unfortunately, this includes the  realization that our ability to proceed in China will be delayed. Therefore, we  have laid the groundwork to extend the program to other countries, if  necessary.  </P> <P> Despite the current political problems hampering the program in China, we  remain deeply committed to designing and implementing environmentally sound and  effective business solutions to a serious environmental problem.  </P> <P> ALAN DAVIS  </P> <P> Chairman  </P> <P> China Paper Partners Inc.  </P> <P> San Francisco  </P></p>

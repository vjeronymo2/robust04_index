			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Grim scenario for Credit Lyonnais - Heavy provisions could push bank into the red ANALYSTS are bracing themselves for gloomy figures next Monday when Credit Lyonnais, one of Europe's biggest banks and France's most prominent state-controlled companies, publishes its 1992 results. Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, Credit Lyonnais' controversial chairman, has warned that 1992 was the group's worst year for two decades. Given that it suffered a loss of FFr177m in 1974, the bank may have fallen back into the red last year. Credit Lyonnais barely broke even in the first half of last year after provisions of FFr6.3bn (Dollars 1.1bn), and Mr Haberer has warned that provisions will be even higher in the second half. This grim scenario could not have come at a worse time. First, it could jeopardise Credit Lyonnais' hopes of being privatised. It also poses a threat to Mr Haberer, who was appointed by the socialists in 1988 and risks losing his job if, as expected, the right wins power. Mr Haberer has pursued an aggressive policy in terms of loans and international expansion in his five years at Credit Lyonnais. As a result, it has been much more vulnerable than its fellow French banks to the economic slowdown. Credit Lyonnais is not only heavily exposed to the weakest areas of the French economy - small companies and commercial property - but also to a string of corporate catastrophes, including Dollars 215m to Robert Maxwell's media empire and Dollars 350m to the Olympia &amp; York property group. The most tortuous saga has been its involvement with the bid by Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the controversial Italian financier, for MGM, the Hollywood movie studio. Credit Lyonnais has been left with a stricken film business, a string of lawsuits and persistent speculation that its final exposure will be higher than its official estimate of Dollars 900m. These 'big hits' have been largely responsible for the steep increase in Credit Lyonnais' provisions. The average level of provisions as a percentage of average loans has trebled in the past three years, to 1.6 per cent on an annualised basis for the first half of 1992, against an average of 1 per cent for the other big three French commercial banks. Some aspects of Mr Haberer's strategy have worked, however. Credit Lyonnais' French banking network is still robust, mainly because of prudent cost-cutting. Its international expansion has also been successful, particularly in Spain and Italy. The group continued its growth last year by taking control of BfG Bank in Germany. 'There is no cause for concern on the domestic front,' says Mr Chris Davis, European banking analyst at BZW Securities. 'Credit Lyonnais has held its own in a difficult market. It has also done well with its European network.' The critical question is how much longer will Credit Lyonnais' results be clouded by write-offs on its loan portfolio? The answer is complicated by its refusal to release details about provisions, or even to specify whether it has finished writing down its exposure to 'big hits'. 'It is very difficult to tell what is going on,' says Ms Sheila Garrard, banking analyst at Shearson Lehmann in London. 'But the French economy is still weak and it will take time for small businesses and commercial property to recover. We're likely to have more high provisions in 1993.' In theory, Credit Lyonnais, alongside Banque Nationale de Paris, the other big state-controlled bank, should be one of the first candidates for privatisation by the new government. But the conservatives, were forced to postpone plans to float the bank in their last administration after the 1987 stock market crash, and will undoubtedly have to delay the sale. 'Credit Lyonnais is not sellable in the near-term,' says Ms Susan Sternglass, European banking analyst at Goldman Sachs. 'It will have to wait until it can show that its loan book is in good shape and that it has real prospects for profits recovery. That could happen in 1994 if there are no more major corporate losses.' The other big issue is whether the conservatives will allow Mr Haberer to lead Credit Lyonnais into the private sector. The arrival of a new administration is traditionally followed by the weeding out of old appointees. Mr Haberer is undoubtedly vulnerable. He is seen as a socialist sympathiser, although he worked for conservative ministers in the 1960s and 1970s. Moreover, if the new government ousts him, Credit Lyonnais' 1992 results will probably provide a suitable excuse.</p>

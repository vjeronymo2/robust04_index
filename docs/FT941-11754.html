			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Further economic measures taken by South Korean government The South Korean government yesterday introduced its third set of measures within three weeks to cool the Seoul bourse, writes John Burton. The general share index closed at 974, continuing a rapid climb towards its peak of 1,007, set on April 1 1989. The latest measures will require institutional investors to buy Won1,000bn (Pounds 823m) worth of monetary stabilisation bonds in an attempt to divert funds from the liquidity-driven stock market. They have also reduced the ceiling on the amount of money individual investors can borrow from securities houses for stock investment.</p>

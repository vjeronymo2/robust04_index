			<p>BFN     [Text] At their Saturday, 23 April, session, the  parliamentarians examined a draft of the temporary regulations  of the Supreme Council presented by Nikolay Akuyev. From the  outset of the discussion of the document, it became clear that  the deputies are very strict and particular about its  endorsement. Serious debates were held with regard to  nominations of candidatures for the posts of chairpersons of the  parliamentary committees. A provision was adopted that these  candidates would be nominated not only by the speaker, but also  by the deputies.    A statement on behalf of a group of the members of the  Supreme Council representing Karaganda and Kostanay Oblasts was  made by Boris Marinushkin. The serious economic situation of  the Republic is at issue in this statement. The deputies  believe that the government and the leadership of the National  Bank are to blame for this situation. The deputies put forward  a proposal to the Constitutional Court of the Republic to  examine the competence and legality of measures taken by the  Cabinet of Ministers and the National Bank.    At today's morning session examination of the draft of the  temporary regulation was resumed. Provisions for setting up  deputies' factions and groups and organizing hearings in the  Council were discussed in full detail. The deputies disputed  those articles of the temporary regulations that envisage the  setting up and functioning of the coordination council of the  Supreme Council. The Supreme Council should have a special  collegiate organ that will resolve unresolvable problems. The  position of those who put the proposal forward got the upper  hand as result of the vote. At last, the temporary regulation  was endorsed; it has been suggested to produce by 1 July the  standing regulation of the Supreme Council for examination by  the deputies. The session then began to examine behind closed  doors the issue concerning the maintenance and provision of work  of the Supreme Council deputies.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Still digging for missing bodies A woman, whose husband is still missing, screams Distraught relatives gathered yesterday outside the Incirharmani mine near Kozlu, north-western Turkey, where around 300 are feared dead in the country's worst pit disaster. So far 95 bodies have been recovered with a further 200 missing. Another 400 escaped after the methane gas explosion on Tuesday. Parts of the mine have been blocked off to stop an underground fire spreading and to allow the rescue operation to continue. But last night there was little hope of finding more survivors. Nine years ago 103 miners died in a pit disaster 10km away at Zonguldak.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Letter: Business in the Community should get back to its roots Sir, Charles Batchelor reported ('Shake-up in business support', June 3) that Business in the Community, the umbrella organisation for Britain's 300-plus Local Enterprise Agencies, plans to reduce its direct involvement in the affairs of the agencies. He goes on to quote David Grayson, BITC managing director, as saying 'We are not walking away from the enterprise agencies'. As a recently retired general manager of one of these local enterprise agencies (after nearly 10 years work in the field), I beg to differ. BITC was set up as an initiative to assist local economic regeneration in the aftermath of the Toxteth riots to enable local and national private sector firms to work with central government in taking local initiatives in areas of high unemployment. These initiatives could embrace support for small firms creation, support for education/industry links and a variety of other community based support activities. Where BITC scored was in representing the agencies to government, in lobbying to initiate local mobilisation of private sector involvement and persuading British industry to give priority to community involvement as a means of addressing some of the social, economic and structural problems of the inner city and development areas. BITC did its job well - until it started trying to be all things to all people. It seemed, in the mid-1980s, to consider that it had a mission of its own - to support ill-conceived environmental and urban renewal schemes, to re-invent a variety of educational link schemes, and to present itself as the voice of industry in discussions with government on training for the unemployed and the establishment of business support networks. As a result it has not only totally lost its credibility in the eyes of LEA managers like myself - but also, it seems, in the eyes of government, since BITC influence has been marginalised over the past four years. Instead of groping for a role which, one suspects, its industrial sponsors do not envisage, BITC should revert to its original role. Perhaps the failure of BITC has something to do with its staffing and management at the centre. So many of the senior people seem to be involved in other 'causes': in political lobbying and in supporting BITC's president, instead of trying to provide a relevant service to its grass roots base. It would not surprise me if the recent antics of BITC have so alienated local and central government that there is no hope of any concerted action in the areas described above.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 2 February, the newspaper GRANMA reports that the  ranks of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] and the Union of  Young Communists [UJC] experienced a significant increase in  1993 while maintaining their selective and vanguard nature. The  newspaper adds that approximately 50,000 people joined the PCC  and approximately 80,000 youths joined the UJC while the  attrition rates remained at the level of the past 15 years. The  growth in the PCC ranks represents a important political  process, particularly in light of the broad participation of the  people on the outstanding workers' assemblies. [as heard] The  PCC needs to increase its under-30 membership in order to  include the views of the young.</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Shevardnadze set to win mandate MR Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister, was expected to win a legitimate mandate in yesterday's elections as Georgia's leader, together with backing for his attempt to retrieve territory lost to Abkhazian separatists in the north-west of the state. Voting in the parliamentary elections in Georgia and for the post of parliamentary leader, for which Mr Shevardnadze, who led the Georgian Communist party until 1985, is the only candidate, went off generally peacefully in the republic yesterday. However towns in the autonomous republic of Abkhazia controlled by separatist forces and their north Caucasian allies boycotted the vote. A heavy turnout was reported by the Central Election Commission in the capital of Tblisi, with nearly half of the registered voters casting their votes by midday. In the Abkhazian capital of Sukhumi, controlled by Georgian forces but surrounded by Abkhazian forces, half of the vote was reported to have turned out by one o'clock. No single party or bloc of parties is expected to control the post-election parliament, since polls report that the main blocs among more than 30 vying for seats all have support of about 12 to 15 per cent. Because of fears of electing a president who usurps effective power - as Mr Zviad Gamsakurdia, the previous elected president ousted last December, is held to have done - Mr Shevardnadze will be elected by the entire electorate and must find support within parliament, almost certainly by putting together a coalition of parties. Mr Shevardnadze on Saturday pledged that he would recapture the areas of Abkhazia taken from Georgian troops earlier this month. Mr Tenghiz Khitovani, the Georgian defence minister yesterday blamed 'treason' by commanders and servicemen in deserting their posts in Gagra, the northern town captured by Abkhazians. Talks between Mr Shevardnadze and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president and Mr Vladislav Ardzimba, the Abkhazian leader were set for Tuesday - but there are now doubts that they can take place.</p>

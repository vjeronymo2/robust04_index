			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Soffex halts expansion plans SOFFEX, Switzerland's futures and options exchange, has halted plans to internationalise trading, dealing a blow to co-operation plans between Europe's small but rapidly-growing electronic derivatives exchanges. 'We were about to take a major step toward cross-border trading, and our board decided to say no for at least 12 months,' said Mr Daniel Grossrieder, Soffex vice-president. The Soffex board, led by Switzerland's three big banks, is sensitive to a new stock market regulatory proposal now before the Swiss Parliament. The legislation would create national stock market regulation, and would apply to Soffex and to a planned Swiss national electronic bourse, the EBS. 'We did not want to create the impression that there was no co-ordination between Soffex and the EBS, by allowing Soffex to go forward on its own,' said board member Mr Patrick Odier, managing partner of Lombard Odier. 'We must wait until strategic decisions on the stock side are made.' Links between the electronic stock market and Soffex have not been formally declared, but are widely expected, with Soffex likely to adopt some of the new EBS technology. The decision will prevent non-resident foreign firms and traders from joining Soffex. It will also delay or derail plans for Soffex to link with the Swedish OM exchange group, with facilities in London and Stockholm; Amsterdam's EOE and Austria's Otob. Mr Grossrieder said Soffex would go ahead with its application in the UK for recognition as an overseas exchange. Last year those exchanges agreed to give each other's members access to products without creating additional clearing costs, and to share marketing efforts.</p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VERSATILE TRACK STAR EXPECTS AN EVENTFUL SEASON AT WOODBRIDGE  </P> <P> Every weekday at 2 p.m., members of Woodbridge High School's track and field  team begin warming up for their afternoon workout. After a slow jog, light  stretching, drills and wind sprints, the athletes gather for a quick team  meeting before dispersing into their particular groups:  </P> <P> Sprinters with sprinters, hurdlers with hurdlers, pole vaulters with pole  vaulters  </P> <P> And Louie Muniz with Louie Muniz.  </P> <P> Muniz, a sprinter, long jumper, high hurdler, low hurdler and anchor of both  the Warriors' 400- and 1,600-meter relays, has something of a daily identity  crisis.  </P> <P> He knows who he is; he's just not always sure, at track practice anyway, who he  should be at the particular moment. When his teammates run off to work on their  particular events, Muniz stands alone, wondering which way to go first.  </P> <P> "If I was cloned, that would be great," Muniz said. "I mean, that would be  perfect."  </P> <P> It wouldn't be too bad for Woodbridge either. Not that the Warriors are in  desperate need of help. Led by the multitalented Muniz, the team is one of the  top contenders to win the boys' Southern Section 2-A title this season.  </P> <P> Saturday at the Katella Relays, the Warriors won the Division I championship,  defeating, among others, Orange County powers Santa Ana Valley and Villa Park.  </P> <P> Muniz's contributions were pivotal.  </P> <P> With a 21-foot long jump, he helped Woodbridge's three-man team win the long  jump relay. He ran a 50.6 leg to lead the Warriors to a victory in the mile  relay. He helped Woodbridge tie a school record (43.7) in the 400-meter relay  and place second. And in the 800 relay, Muniz ran a personal-best anchor split  of 21.5 to hold off Santa Ana Valley, which finished just a stride behind.  </P> <P> "After my freshman year, people would always say, 'You're going to carry the  team when you're a senior,' " said Muniz, a four-year varsity member. "I'd just  say, 'Yeah, sure.' I knew it wouldn't be as easy as that."  </P> <P> Muniz would be the first to admit it hasn't been easy. Doing well in so many  events has meant much longer practices than the average track and field  athlete. His usual practice day runs from 2 to 6 p.m., while most of his  teammates have finished their workouts by 5.  </P> <P> "In practice, I'm always the last one out there at the end of the day," Muniz  said. "It gets depressing sometimes.  </P> <P> "When it's 5 or 6 o'clock and the sun's going down and you're the only one  around. . . . You see everyone else going home, people are coming home from  work and you're just sitting there going, 'Hmmm.' "  </P> <P> Does he ever think of giving up the sport?  </P> <P> "Probably every day," he said.  </P> <P> But Muniz hangs in there because he hopes it will get him reach a goal -- the  state meet June 2-3 at Cerritos College.  </P> <P> "I want to get to state this year, just to say I made it," he said. "I also  want to place in all my four events at the (Southern Section) championships."  </P> <P> Last year, Muniz qualified for the Southern Section championships in the long  jump, 110 and 300 hurdles and 1,600 relay, but he failed to advance to the  state meet when he placed no better than fifth in any of the events.  </P> <P> "I think I kind of psyched myself out last year," he said. "I started thinking  that maybe I was doing too much. I think I told myself it was too hard to do  everything. This year I know that's not true."  </P> <P> Woodbridge Coach George Varvas agrees.  </P> <P> "He's a very durable and well-conditioned athlete," Varvas said. "I never worry  about him. Frankly, he could do a lot more if it were allowed."  </P> <P> Muniz often has been asked whether he would like to pursue the decathlon. But  at 6-foot-1, 145 pounds, Muniz admits he would have trouble with the strength  events such as the shotput and discus.  </P> <P> Muniz said he owes much of his success to his family, which supports him in all  his efforts. It's not surprising, considering the family's connection to track  and field.  </P> <P> Michelle Muniz, a junior, runs the 100 and 200 meters and anchors the 400 and  1,600 relays for the Woodbridge girls' team.  </P> <P> Greg Muniz, a freshman, is a standout on the Warriors' frosh-soph team. He runs  both the 110- and 300-meter hurdles, as well as the 400 and 1,600 relays.  </P> <P> And Louie Muniz Sr., is a Woodbridge assistant in his third year of coaching  hurdlers. He also was an All-Southern Section hurdler for Santa Ana High in  1963. He went on to help Santa Ana College (now Rancho Santiago) to two  consecutive state championships in 1964 and 1965.  </P> <P> "Oh, I still get butterflies when Louie competes," he said. "It brings back a  lot of memories."  </P> <P> It also gives the younger Louie a goal, to break his father's best time in the  high hurdles. Louie Sr. ran 14.3 in high school. His son has run 14.7.  </P> <P> Most agree that if Muniz concentrated on only the hurdles, he would excel even  further. But, right now anyway, Muniz is content to spread himself thin.  </P> <P> "I feel if I do both hurdles, then everyone can know I have not only speed and  technique but endurance, too," he said. "And when I do a field event, it shows  I can do more than just run. And the mile relay, well that's where my team  comes in.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I say to myself, 'Be serious Louie, you're not a machine! You don't  have to do all this.' But it's such a challenge, and I like challenges."  </P></p>

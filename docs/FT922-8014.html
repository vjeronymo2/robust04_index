			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Letter: 'Inappropriate' for civil servant to join Anglian Water Sir, You report (People, May 13) that a deputy secretary in the Environment Department has just been made a non-executive director of Anglian Water. 'There will be no conflict of interest,' you say, 'because the department has been restructured' following the privatisation of the water companies. You say that the appointee has also been a director of a subsidiary of John Laing. Such appointments are and always will be particularly insensitive and inappropriate. The fact that a public servant has the time to devote to one or more non-executive board appointments and the fact that remuneration is paid for such services are matters of considerable public interest. I hope that the powers that be in the Environment Department (or indeed any other department) will look again at this and any similar appointments and realise that the granting of such permission is an error of judgment which should not be allowed. David Elyan, Communication Investments, 8th floor, Queen's House, Holly Road, Twickenham, Middx, TW1 4EG</p>

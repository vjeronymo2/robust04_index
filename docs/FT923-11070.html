			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Paris trims campaign for Yes to Maastricht THE French government has cancelled a radio and television campaign for a Yes vote in the September 20 referendum on European union, after the CSA broadcasting authority demanded changes. The move, triggered by opposition claims that the FFr25m (Pounds 2.56m) campaign was a waste of taxpayers' money, is an embarrassment at a time when the popularity of President Francois Mitterrand and Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, is sinking to new lows. However, the government claims it has not climbed down and will continue with a poster campaign, to start in 75 newspapers and on 6,814 billboards today, representing well over half the campaign's cost. Mr Mitterrand's popularity has fallen by two percentage points over the past month, to 26 per cent. This is the lowest level since before last March's disastrous regional elections, according to an Ifop poll in Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper yesterday. Only 32 per cent of French voters are satisfied with Mr Beregovoy, while 39 per cent are dissatisfied, according to the survey. This is the first time Mr Beregovoy's unpopularity rating has exceeded his popularity score since he came to office in April, an indication that his prime ministerial honeymoon is over. The Maastricht campaign row further dents the government's image, already battered by the truckers' strike - which shortly predated the Ifop poll - farmers' demonstrations, and scandals over political corruption and the distribution of Aids-infected blood by the national transfusion service. Mr Philippe de Villiers, an anti-Maastricht member of parliament in the pro-European UDF party, complained to the CSA that the television and radio advertising campaign, which was due to start today, breached a 1990 law against broadcasting political publicity. It was not a straight public information campaign as it was biased in favour of the Maastricht treaty, he maintained. Political posters and newspaper advertising are not covered by this law. Mr Philippe Seguin, a leading anti-Maastricht campaigner in the Gaullist RPR party, dubbed it 'a scandalous misappropriation of public funds' and called on the government to scrap the poster campaign as well.</p>

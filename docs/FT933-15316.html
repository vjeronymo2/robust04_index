			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Survey of Lebanon (3): Up goes the Lebanese pound - There are some good economic indicators NO SINGLE event since the end of the fighting has had a greater positive impact on the Lebanese economy than the appointment of Mr Rafik Hariri as prime minister. Lebanese of all confessions and political persuasions unite only in their respect for an individual who has amassed a substantial financial fortune. On this occasion they were scarcely less united in their astonishment that Mr Hariri, having achieved so much, should put himself at risk for the sake of his country. It proved to be one of those rare moments in Lebanese history when an inexplicable event was taken as a positive harbinger. The exchange rate of the Lebanese pound against the dollar jumped from 2,205 on the day before his appointment to 1,820 at the turn of the year and now appears fairly stable in the 1,700-1,750 range. For Lebanese there is no more important gauge of confidence in the future of the country than the exchange rate, particularly as many remember with nostalgia the pound trading at less than five to the dollar during the darkest days of the civil war. It is also one of the very few economic statistics which is accurate and immediately available. The maintenance of the pound's stability despite lack of improvement in other economic indicators was also significant. Earlier this year several hundred million dollars of precious non-gold reserves were used to support the currency, but officials say that the expenditure has since been recouped and reserves stand again at just below Dollars 1.4bn. Lebanon also holds more than 9m ounces of gold, which are effectively frozen by parliamentary legislation and therefore cannot be effectively deployed. In the absence of dramatic external events, maintaining the currency's stability will rest on the government's success in tackling a formidable array of problems. The war left Lebanon with only the remnants of a civil administration, up to 900,000 displaced people, more than 150,000 disabled, nearly 30 per cent of the workforce unemployed, pervasive underemployment for those in work, inflation last year at close to 120 per cent, an alarming budget deficit, a severely damaged infrastructure, and only sketchy public services. Deciding on priorities and linking them to the Dollars 13bn reconstruction programme outlined in the Horizon 2000 document is currently taking much of the government's time. Mr Fouad Siniora, the finance minister, has no doubt that the budget deficit must be tackled first. Considerable progress, he says, is already being made. During the first five months of this year, the deficit fell by 30 per cent to about Dollars 360m. If debt servicing is excluded, the improvement would be closer to 70 per cent, he says. The main reason for the change has been an increase in revenues, achieved in large part by improved collection. An important element has been customs dues which have soared since the government resumed control of most ports. Improved collection methods should see further large revenue increases, although widespread evasion will be difficult to overcome. In order to encourage the payment of income tax, the government is introducing a new law which will set three levels of 2 per cent, 4 per cent and a top marginal rate of 10 per cent. The government's hope is that by setting such modest levels the public will not risk incurring the increased penalties for evasion. It should also contribute to attracting back to Lebanon many well-qualified nationals who inevitably would have to accept lower salary levels than they currently receive overseas. The return of more of these people will contribute not only to the level of skills available in the country, but their repatriated capital will also increase the amounts available to the banking sector during reconstruction. Getting a larger number of people to pay realistic prices for essential services, such as electricity, may be more problematical. At the moment some hundreds of thousands are believed to tap into the erratic power system without authorisation. And with many others earning less than the equivalent of Dollars 150 a month the government has to be very sensitive to the pace at which it demands payments for its services. Mr Siniora claims success in sharply reducing inflation this year, an achievement greeted with scepticism by many Lebanese. Given that Lebanon imports 70 to 80 per cent of its requirements, the improvement in the exchange rate over the past seven months should have fed through into lower consumer prices. However the dominance of a few importers means that the laws of supply and demand do not fully apply. While some prices have fallen, it is suspected that other profit margins have increased. Officials hope that this distortion should eventually disappear as the market in Lebanon develops. It is unlikely, however, to ease the increasing demands from all employees, particularly those in the public sector, for an improvement in pay levels. The government recognises the need to answer the need, but is wary of its effect on budget finances and on inflation. With Horizon 2000 demanding an increased government contribution by the middle of the decade, the political pressure on the budget will remain intense. Preliminary work is already underway in reviewing, reorganising and re-equiping the bureaucracy. Incentives have been offered for government employees to leave their jobs before an element of compulsion is introduced. Capital expenditure will grow as ministries introduce computer systems and try to streamline their operations. A new Central Bank team, already recognised as one of the best qualified in the region, is also due to be in place by August. This will signal an extensive reorganisation and modernising of the bank's activities, an improvement in economic statistics and a start on planning a proper capital market, including a stock exchange. These facilities are urgently needed if Lebanon is to absorb and channel effectively the heavy capital expenditure forecast in Horizon 2000. Mr Siniora goes to great lengths to emphasise that in his view the most effective answer to the dangers of Islamic fundamentalism has to be a steady improvement in economic and social conditions. Once Arab and western friends fully understand this, the minister expects them to respond with more generous contributions to the reconstruction effort. But ensuring a balanced and equitable distribution of income during the most intensive part of the rebuilding operation will not be achieved without closer studies of the population, workforce, education and skill levels that are available. Without that information, and a sensitive response to it, some economists worry that rapid economic development could create additional political tensions rather than easing those that already exist.</p>

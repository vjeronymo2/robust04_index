			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Salvadoran economic developments monitored through 7  Jun.    Addressing a meeting of presidents from the Central American  Chambers of Commerce, Economy Minister Luis Enrique Cordova on 2  June warned that if equitable treatment is not guaranteed in  free trade negotiations, there is a risk that investments will  be diverted away from Central America. The meeting is being  held before negotiations for a free trade treaty with Mexico to  review the private sector's role in the negotiations. (San  Salvador Canal Doce Television in Spanish 0300 GMT 3 Jun 94)    The Central Bank reported on 3 June that economic activity  in  El Salvador increased 7.1 percent during the first three months  of 1994. The increase was primarily attributed to the "dynamic"  output of the industrial and construction sectors. The 1994  monetary program is designed to achieve overall economic growth  of 5-6 percent.

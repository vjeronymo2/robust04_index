			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FCC CHIEF SAYS CABLE TV MAY BECOME RE-REGULATED  </P> <P> Alfred Sikes, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said at a Los  Angeles hearing on the cable television industry that some re-regulation of  cable is likely unless the monopoly position of system operators in most  markets is ended.  </P> <P> His remarks, during a break in the daylong proceedings at City Hall, came amid  speculation that the commission will ask Congress to curtail cable operators'  freedom to set prices or will otherwise seek to limit industry practices when  it files a long-expected report on deregulation in July.  </P> <P> "If the monopoly (in local service areas) persists, there'll be more regulation  than there is today, yes," Sikes told reporters.  </P> <P> At Monday's session, more than two dozen witnesses from cable companies, film  studios, broadcast stations and local governments gave sharply conflicting  views of the cable industry's practices since it was largely deregulated under  a 1984 federal law.  </P> <P> City officials from Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, Thousand Oaks and Oakland said  they faced a rising chorus of consumer complaints about higher prices and poor  service.  </P> <P> "Lincoln freed the slaves. We would like you to free us from the gouging cable  TV companies," Beverly Hills Mayor Maxwell Salter said in recounting his city's  long-running disputes with Century Communications, which operates the only  cable system in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Several cable officials, however, said deregulation had led to an explosion in  program services such as Cable News Network, the ESPN sports network and the  Discovery Channel and that such programming could be destroyed by  re-regulation.  </P> <P> "Cable has done more (for black audiences) than broadcast has been able to do  in over 20 years," said Robert Johnson, president of Black Entertainment  Television, a network formed with financial support from Denver-based  Tele-Communications Inc.  </P> <P> Separately, the commission is considering proposals to subject more systems to  rate regulation by widening the legal definition of competition in cable.  Currently, cities are permitted to regulate local cable rates only when their  areas receive fewer than three broadcast TV signals.  </P> <P> On Monday, FCC Chairman Sikes repeatedly queried witnesses about the likely  viability of a second cable system, or of so-called wireless alternatives to  cable in various areas.  </P> <P> Wireless cable uses microwave bands to distribute programming to homes and is  operating in some cities, including Cleveland. But wireless operators complain  that they are denied access to programs that are routinely available to cable  franchisees.  </P> <P> George Ring, chairman of Cross Country Telecommunications, said his company is  launching such a system to serve a 2,800-square-mile area largely in San  Bernardino County. But "we are being denied equal access to programming," Ring  complained.  </P> <P> While the Los Angeles hearing was supposed to focus on program supply to cable  companies, no clear consensus emerged among witnesses from big studios and  independent production companies as to what measures, if any, authorities  should take to contend with the increased "vertical integration" of companies  such as TCI and Time Warner Inc. Those companies own both cable systems and  interests in production units.  </P> <P> Several independent Hollywood producers -- those whose companies are not owned  by major studios -- argued that cable operators should be barred by law from  owning an interest in programs, much as big broadcasters such as CBS, ABC and  NBC are barred from owning an interest in the shows they produce.  </P> <P> Marcy Carsey, whose Carsey-Werner Co. produces "The Cosby Show" and "Roseanne"  for NBC, said her company has been unwilling to produce shows for cable TV  because cable networks insist on owning the syndication and other rights to the  programs, rather than leaving the producer free to profit from them after a  first showing on cable.  </P> <P> "Cable is a closed business. You do it their way creatively or financially, or  don't come at all," Carsey said of her attempts to produce for cable.  </P> <P> At least some of the commission's four members, however, appeared skeptical of  the claims that program diversity would be served by making it easier for  Hollywood to produce for the medium.  </P> <P> Edward Bleier, a Warner Bros. TV official, strongly argued that cable  re-regulation would damage what he called an "adolescent" industry. Since Time  Inc. bought Warner Communications Inc. last summer, the resulting company has  owned not only the nation's second-largest cable operation but also the Warner  Bros. studio and the HBO pay TV service.  </P> <P> Under questioning by the commission, however, MCA Inc. general counsel Robert  Hadl complained that his company's recent films, including "Born on the Fourth  of July" and "Back to the Future, Part II," may not be seen on pay TV at all  because Time Warner's HBO unit was "not interested in buying" from MCA since  the merger.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for HBO and for Warner Bros. declined to comment.  </P></p>

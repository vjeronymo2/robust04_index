			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: EL MONTE;  </P> <P> PLANNING APPEAL DELAYED  </P> <P> An appeal of a Planning Commission decision rejecting an eight-home subdivision  on Edwards Avenue was again delayed by the City Council last week.  </P> <P> The council allowed owner Fun S. Tsang until its Nov. 27 meeting to prepare his  case.  </P> <P> Tsang is proposing to build the eight homes on two parcels in the 2700 block of  Edwards Avenue just south of Garvey Avenue. One house currently occupies the  land.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Tsang said the additional time is needed to allow the owner to  come to agreement with neighbors who objected to the development.  </P> <P> The commission denied approval of the plan in May, terming the site unsuitable  for an eight-house development because of insufficient street access and the  project's density. Edwards is a private street that would have to be widened if  the project is approved.  </P></p>

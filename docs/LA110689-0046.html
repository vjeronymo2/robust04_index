			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> THE SCIENCE OF FIGHTING A DRUG WAR;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT RESEARCHERS VIEW TECHNOLOGY AS THE KEY WEAPON. THEIR PROPOSALS MAY  BE BEGUILING, BUT THEY COME WITH A PRICE -- AND PROBLEMS.  </P> <P> Here in the birthplace of the atomic bomb, the disappointments of the war on  drugs have set scientific minds to turning.  </P> <P> Enough of this stalemate, researchers say. Enough of slogging through jungles  and sifting through cargo. They see a better way: a technological fix.  </P> <P> The echoes are faint but inescapable. Fifty years after Albert Einstein urged  President Franklin D. Roosevelt to begin the Manhattan Project, two scientists  at the Los Alamos National Laboratory dispatched a letter this summer calling  for a comparably intense drive against drugs.  </P> <P> Already one Los Alamos team has shifted its sights from Cold War to drug wars.  Others may follow. And the ambitious proposals they are bouncing off  well-guarded walls during months of brainstorming at this cloistered facility  hint of major breakthroughs.  </P> <P> Munitions experts here talk of wreaking irreparable damage on the airstrips  that are stepping stones in the cocaine chain. Physicists offer up lasers as  eyes that could uncover fumes from drug laboratories hidden in jungles or  anywhere else. Biologists recommend sophisticated bacteria that would remove  the psychoactive powers from the global coca crop.  </P> <P> Other possibilities under discussion include isotope fertilizers that would  impregnate illicit crops with easily detectable radioactivity, stun guns that  would disable car and plane engines, and supercomputers that would track the  flow of drug profits.  </P> <P> "Technology," the Los Alamos team declared, "can have major leverage."  </P> <P> The Los Alamos proposal is the most ambitious under consideration, although by  no means the only one. Government scientists across the country have set their  sights on new weapons for counter-drug missions.  </P> <P> But, with new ideas flooding into the agencies that combat drugs, skeptics are  beginning to voice misgivings. They warn that some proposals represent  "solutions waiting for problems" and that others reflect a bid for abundant  drug-fighting dollars in an era of Pentagon constraint.  </P> <P> That charged atmosphere presents a dilemma for an Administration eager to score  points in the drug war. From a dizzying array of innovative ideas, officials  are seeking to settle on anti-drug solutions that work. And the drawing-board  sketches available so far might depict either miracle weapon or costly dead  end.  </P> <P> "All this is well and good," one official said. "But at some point we'll have  to decide. Is the answer going to be Buck Rogers? Or do we really need more  Dick Tracy?"  </P> <P> The technological starting point, experts say, is unimpressive. Past research  has produced drug-sniffing dogs, mirrors on poles and high-resolution  photography.  </P> <P> But the government still has very little success in ferreting out the smuggled  cocaine that crosses U.S. borders by land and sea. South American processing  laboratories lie mostly undetectable beneath triple-canopy jungles. And  trafficking operations themselves remain difficult to track, leaving scarcely a  fingerprint on the products they peddle.  </P> <P> "Frankly," said one expert in anti-drug technology, "just about everything has  failed."  </P> <P> The congressional Office of Technology Assessment two years ago blamed a  "serious lack of support" for potential inventions. But most anti-drug  initiatives have revolved around such stopgaps as deploying National Guardsmen  to search cargo at U.S. borders.  </P> <P> "That's not an American solution," entrepreneur Martin Anis, president of the  Boston-based American Science and Engineering, groused.  </P> <P> As the drug issue leaped to the top of the national agenda, Congress last year  voted to establish eight federal laboratories to aid in the drug fight. William  J. Bennett, who heads the war on drugs as director of the White House Office of  National Drug Control Policy, advocated the "development of new technologies"  for use against illegal drugs. He is expected to deliver to Congress by the end  of the year a plan based on ideas developed at the eight national laboratories.  </P> <P> After meeting with the Los Alamos delegation, Sen. William S. Cohen of Maine,  the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, described the  discussions last month in glowing terms. "Technology," he declared, "can make a  contribution to stopping the flow of drugs into the United States."  </P> <P> "This field," an enthusiastic Democratic congressional official said, "is  probably the clearest example you can find of progress requiring money."  </P> <P> That technology-friendly spirit has left the government's  research-and-development experts besieged -- and not only by the Los Alamos  team. "Everyone thinks they've got a weapon that will shoot around corners,"  Washington consultant Neil Livingstone said.  </P> <P> "Congress starts saying: 'Money for drugs,' and you immediately start hearing  vendors talk about high technology," said John J. O'Neill, deputy assistant  administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration for investigative support.  </P> <P> "Thank God," he added wearily, "for the American entrepreneurial spirit."  </P> <P> The ideas, officials say, range from the beguiling to the absurd. Among the  latter was a proposal to use trained gerbils to sniff out contraband drugs -- a  "complete fiasco," Customs Service scientist William Johnson said.  </P> <P> Another came from an "accredited etymologist" who suggested that insects could  do the job. Customs officials thought the idea promising but reconsidered when  they thought of a potential obstacle: Nocturnal bugs might not work around the  clock.  </P> <P> "We appreciated the suggestion," Johnson said, "but we declined to be  involved."  </P> <P> On the rugged New Mexican mesas of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, two  senior researchers last summer produced the 16-page draft white paper that  quickly became fuel for fancy in some anti-drug circles.  </P> <P> "New weapons," the scientists wrote in the "Role of Technology," which was  distributed to the Senate Intelligence Committee and at least four federal  agencies, are "badly needed in the war on drugs."  </P> <P> Although spare in language and detail, the July 24 paper conjured up images of  stunning advances, such as isotope fertilizers to tag drug crops, laser  spectroscopy to sniff out drug fumes and stun guns to attack cars and planes.  </P> <P> A cover letter was dispatched to officials in Washington on Aug. 3, exactly 50  years and one day after Einstein wrote to Roosevelt to urge "quick action" on  experimental atomic research that was soon sited at Los Alamos.  </P> <P> With the expertise garnered since then from its role as the nation's atomic  city, researchers Terry D. Bearce and John D. Immele wrote, Los Alamos was now  well-placed to play a "major role in the counter-drug research and  development."  </P> <P> From their laboratory complex in the Jemez Mountains, the researchers refused  to discuss their proposal with a reporter. A special assistant to the director  of Los Alamos, William (Buck) Thompson, explained that the scientists believed  it important to maintain "sensitivity" about the yet-unfunded proposal.  </P> <P> "Security is why a lot of federal agencies come to Los Alamos in the first  place," Thompson said.  </P> <P> Scientists at other defense laboratories were similarly guarded. Even some who  agreed to discuss their work asked that their names not be used. Now that their  research is being focused on the drug wars, they feared retribution from its  soldiers.  </P> <P> But together, the researchers, government officials and experts in the field  offered accounts of the technology drive now under way.  </P> <P> One hope lies in proposals to penetrate the dense Andean jungles that shield  cocaine processing pits from probing eyes. Even the best of U.S. satellite  photography is often thwarted by forest canopies, experts say. But some  researchers believe that high-tech sensors and lasers might zero in on telltale  signs of drug activity.  </P> <P> "If we can sniff out acetone and ether in the middle of the jungle, we will in  effect have found one of the laboratories," said a senior  </P> <P> chemist at the Aberdeen Weapons Center in Maryland.  </P> <P> The research at Aberdeen, supported by the Drug Enforcement Administration,  illustrates a switch in focus. The vast Army facility was founded in 1917 to  combat the threat posed by German use of gas in World War I, and it has  concentrated on chemical warfare ever since. With the new anti-drug project,  researchers hope to apply the lessons learned.  </P> <P> The approach is modeled on new battlefield devices that use ion mobility  spectrometry to sniff the air for chemical weapons. Already the researchers  have found a way to reprogram a hand-held sensor to be alert instead to ether,  acetone and other chemicals used in cocaine production.  </P> <P> In time, the researchers hope to mount such sensors on drones or helicopters  that might conduct airborne jungle sweeps. If current projections hold, the  sensors would be 1,000 times more sensitive than the human nose in identifying  traces of chemicals.  </P> <P> Los Alamos researchers see physics, not chemistry, as the means to the same  end. The fumes that rise from jungle factories, they contend, can be detected  by tunable lasers mounted aboard helicopters or aircraft. The plume would be  detected by its "unique return after laser illumination."  </P> <P> Other technologies under consideration aim at tracking any cocaine that escapes  such airborne scrutiny. If the fertilizer fed to coca plants could be  chemically doctored, the cocaine would forever bear an isotopic tag detectable  at U.S. borders, the Los Alamos team suggested.  </P> <P> The researchers' hunt for chemical indicators derives from an abounding  frustration with efforts to detect the drugs themselves. Because drugs are  neither dense nor chemically volatile, they have proved invulnerable to most  X-rays and sniffer devices. The Customs Service has made the search for a  solution its top research priority.  </P> <P> The tools under consideration range from biology to nuclear physics. The Naval  Research Laboratory near Washington is injecting small animals with drugs in  hopes of developing antibodies that would later serve as sensitive indicators  of the presence of drugs. A three-man team at Tennessee's Oak Ridge National  Laboratory is using locally seized cocaine to experiment with new applications  for vapor detectors built to sniff out bombs.  </P> <P> But so far, Oak Ridge researcher Scott McLuckey acknowledged, "you've got to  get the thing right up to it to smell anything."  </P> <P> Those and other failures in drug detection have convinced many technologists  that the prospects for breakthroughs lie in more aggressive approaches. One is  called "soft kill."  </P> <P> That idea, included in the Los Alamos white paper, proposes to disable  traffickers or terrorists by bombarding their vehicles with microwaves or  gases. Even in low concentrations, the paper says, such weapons directed at  internal combustion engines could leave cars and planes powerless.  </P> <P> Another would target coca or poppy plants themselves with pathogens far more  effective than the defoliants now employed for crop eradication. The compounds,  Los Alamos researchers believe, could prevent the plants from developing  mind-altering power or stop them from growing altogether.  </P> <P> The team also offered expertise in developing air-drop devices that could halt  traffic on dirt runways used by cocaine traffickers. Sketches included in the  Los Alamos white paper showed odd-shaped metal-pronged tools that the  researchers said would be "positive in their action against vehicles' tires."  </P> <P> Unfortunately for the anti-drug agents, technology is two-sided. Cash-flush  cocaine cartels have already developed communication systems that are in many  ways superior to those of law enforcement officials.  </P> <P> What is more, a senior drug enforcement official said: "All this high  technology sometimes doesn't do much good in labor-intensive countries."  Low-wage peasants have thus far been an effective antidote to assaults on  airstrips, for example.  </P> <P> "We could blow one up on Tuesday," said the DEA's O'Neill, "and on Wednesday  they'd be back with 1,000 campesinos to repair it in a day."  </P> <P> And sometimes salvation for the bad guys doesn't require even that much effort.  A DEA attempt to track chemical shipments by attaching beepers to barrels ran  aground once traffickers began to pour the acetone into five-gallon jugs.  </P> <P> Another plan fell victim to a similar fate. After agents attached one too many  transmitters to suspicious automobiles, traffickers found a foolproof way to  search the undercarriage. "They'd take it to Jiffy Lube," O'Neill said.  </P> <P> That record aside, other wariness remains. Some wonder whether technologists'  enthusiasm for the anti-drug effort has been motivated by dwindling federal  support for more traditional defense projects.  </P> <P> Los Alamos, for example, has seen its budget for Pentagon and intelligence  projects plunge 13% in the last two years. In part to fill the void, noted Rep.  Bill Richardson (D-N.M.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, the  laboratory is "aggressively trying to get into (the anti-drug) business."  </P> <P> A laboratory official once complained to Richardson that Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev's peace offensive "was the worst thing that ever happened  to Los Alamos."  </P> <P> At the same time, officials worry that good ideas may be lost in the shuffle.  The budget for research and development, some of which is classified, is known  to be limited. And there is concern that misguided decisions might choke off  promising proposals.  </P> <P> To coordinate the effort, Congress and the Administration are nearing agreement  on plans that would establish under a Drug Control Research and Development  Committee a system for identifying worthy plans and determining appropriate  funding.  </P> <P> "The more people stand up and point to particular technologies, the more  important we think it is to lay out a lot of plans first rather than get all  carried away about particular gizmos," a senior congressional official said.  </P> <P> The Los Alamos anti-drug proposal endorsed similar action, but with markedly  more urgency.  </P> <P> "You've got to treat this with the same ingenuity as the problems of coming up  with a major weapons system," Robert Kupperman, who was involved in the Los  Alamos overture, said in an interview. "There are technologies to behold, and  we don't really have the (research and development) to go for it."  </P> <P> And from the white-coated researchers in the laboratories, a similar impatience  exudes.  </P> <P> What would set anti-drug ingenuity in gear, an Army chemist on the East Coast  said, is "potentially something like the Manhattan Project."  </P> <P> "We know what is out there," he said. "What we need is the license to do it  quicker and faster and do it right now."  </P></p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Letter: Banking practice is not a 'sham' Sir, Your rather gratuitous quotation ('Islamic bank opens in Jakarta', May 15) of a 'local banker' that profit payments by Indonesia's new Islamic bank are 'a sham' is very much unappreciated. A newspaper of your quality surely has many qualified staff who are aware that the issue for Moslems is not what conventional bankers consider to be interest, but what Allah considers to be 'riba'. Interest as paid in the normal course of most bank loans and deposits is, indeed, riba. But, here in America, Moslems find that a number of transactions are riba free, and yet still defined as interest by authorities. For instance, were I to sell goods on consignment at a profit, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would define the profit as interest. Or were I to lease equipment to a manufacturer under an Islamically acceptable lease, my accountant would define my income to the IRS as 'interest'. In neither case would there be an iota of riba, a stain of sham. I could cite many more examples. Let's see what services Bank Muamalat Indonesia offers, and then we will have a basis for judging whether or not they are a sham. I suspect that they will not be a sham. Please don't cast aspersions unnecessarily. Abdulkader, president and publisher, FP Publications, 27957 Ridgebluff Court, Rancho Palos Verdes, California 90274, US</p>

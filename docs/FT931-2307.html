			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow's witching hour spell disappoints Wall Street US equity prices barely moved yesterday afternoon, as the triple witching expiration of options and futures failed to move the market dramatically, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 5.94 higher at 3471.58. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500, however, was off 1.46 at 450.43, while the Amex composite was up 1.25 at 422.37. The Nasdaq composite, which failed to keep pace with the big board's gains on Thursday, fell 4.69 at 682.72. Trading volume on the NYSE was about 294m shares and declines outnumbered rises by 1,038 to 830. The simultaneous expiration of stock index futures, index options and options on individual stocks had little impact on morning trading, although it generally creates volatility later in the day. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 58 3/4 in active trading after announcing the surprise resignation of Mr Gilbert Williamson, the chairman of its NCR computer unit. Whirlpool slipped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 52 1/4 after the company said that charges related to its wholly-owned financial services subsidiary would reduce first quarter after-tax earnings by Dollars 40m. The charges relate to a write-down of specific accounts, largely in its aerospace portfolio. In the first quarter of 1992, Whirlpool earned Dollars 35m, or 50 cents a share. Drug company stocks remained active in NYSE trading. Merck eased Dollars  3/8 to a 52-week low of Dollars 35 7/8 and Glaxo Holdings laost Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 18. Shares in Lewis Galoob Toys firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 3 7/8 on its plans to buy Diversified Specialist with financing from a two-year credit facility. Ford added Dollars  1/2 to a 52-week high of Dollars 52 1/8 , Chrysler rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 40 and General Motors moved Dollars  3/8 higher to Dollars 40 1/8 . In Nasdaq trading, shares in JB Hunt Transport plummeted Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 18 1/8 in heavy turnover after predicting lower-than-expected first quarter earnings because of bad weather and high fuel prices. Digital Microwave jumped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 11 1/4 , a 52-week high, after Alex Brown increased its investment rating on the stock to 'buy' from 'hold'. Alex Brown reduced its predicted 1993 loss for the company. Canada TORONTO stock prices finished the week on a positive note, closing the day higher in heavy trading. The composite index rose 17.70 points, or 0.5 per cent to close at 3576.99. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 367 to 269. Volume was 62.933 shares, up from Thursday's 44.338 shares, and trading value meanwhile rose to CDollars 589.4m from CDollars 448.7m. For the week, the stock exchange rose about 29 points. Eleven of 14 stock groups closed higher.</p>

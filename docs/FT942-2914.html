			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Clinton has few trump cards up his sleeve North Korea's apparent willingness to allow international inspectors to continue their monitoring provided some welcome news yesterday for a US administration faced with few attractive options in its dealings with the unpredictable Pyongyang regime. President Bill Clinton and his advisers would like nothing better than to be able to resolve the crisis over North Korea's nuclear programme through diplomacy, but the US has little leverage to bring to the bargaining table against a government which is already in most respects an international outcast. The administration has been grappling, ever since it took office a year and a half ago, with the problem of what Mr Anthony Lake, White House national security adviser, calls 'backlash states'. Besides North Korea, Mr Lake numbers Cuba, Iran, Iraq and Libya in his list of such 'recalcitrant and outlaw states that not only choose to remain outside the family but also assault its basic values'. Of the five, North Korea is apparently most advanced in its development of weapons of mass destruction. The US response has been a strategy of containment, backed by a willingness, as yet untested, to respond with military force to any aggressive act. While not ruling out any option, Washington officials have expressed no readiness for pre-emptive military action. That leaves only diplomacy, a path hindered by the difficulty of penetrating the mind of President Kim Il-sung and the North Korean regime, as well as by the paucity of levers available to the US. The administration has tried to keep some carrots in the deal presented to North Korea. These come in the shape of a promised improvement in diplomatic relations and economic ties. The danger is that it will be trapped into conferring these privileges over and over, in exchange for minimal North Korean concessions. Few sticks, however, come to hand. The problem is not just persuading China not to veto a United Nations sanctions resolution. It is that only China and a handful of other countries have any significant economic relationships with North Korea through which economic pressure can be applied. The arms embargo proposed in the first phase of the US's draft resolution seems unlikely to have much effect, since the main countries that trade arms with North Korea are the same 'backlash states' least likely to comply with UN sanctions. The advantage of the phased approach contained in the US draft, however, is that the next step along the road is not a renewed Korean War. Some in Washington argue that the US does not have the luxury of waiting to see if Pyongyang will have a change of heart. Mr Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser under President George Bush, and Mr Arnold Kanter, under-secretary for political affairs in the Bush State Department, argued in the Washington Post that more immediate action was needed to deal with the possibility that North Korea might, by 1995, have reprocessed enough plutonium to make another four to six nuclear warheads: 'We should tell North Korea that either it must permit continuous, unfettered International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring to confirm that no further reprocessing is taking place, or we will remove its capacity to reprocess.' Mr Scowcroft does not believe a limited attack to destroy North Korea's nuclear reprocessing facility would in fact lead the North to military retaliation. The State Department says this argument 'had not been overlooked,' but Mr Scowcroft and Mr Kanter understate the risk of all-out war between North and South Korea. That warning was reinforced yesterday when a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman confirmed Beijing stood by its mutual defence agreement with North Korea. Nor is there great support for such a military gamble in the US Congress, even among Mr Scowcroft's friends in the Republican party. 'I think on our side there is a 'Be cautious, be firm, but don't rush into anything right this minute' kind of mood,' said Congressman Newt Gingrich, number two in the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives.</p>

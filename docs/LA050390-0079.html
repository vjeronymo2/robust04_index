			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO HOMES AT MARINELAND SITE  </P> <P> The Monaghan Co. has dropped its plan to build homes at the former Marineland  site in Rancho Palos Verdes but still plans to construct a 495-room hotel and  nine-hole golf course on the land, company spokeswoman Joan Hanley said.  </P> <P> The decision came less than two weeks after City Council members agreed to  allow the company to seek a zoning change to build 45 homes on the land.  </P> <P> The 102-acre site is currently designated for commercial and recreational use.  The council also required that the company replace any open space lost to the  project with a comparable amount of open space elsewhere.  </P> <P> Company officials, who wanted to build 65 homes on the site, argued that such a  project would be economically unattractive.  </P> <P> The company had said it would give the city 100 acres of unspecified land it  owns in an area of the city known as the Filiorum. However, Hanley said Monday  that the company hopes to build an 18-hole golf course in the Filiorum area, in  addition to the nine-hole course planned at the Marineland site.  </P> <P> The majority of the company's Filiorum-area land is in a building moratorium  zone because of past landslides in the area.  </P></p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Manweb cuts workforce by 11% to save Pounds 20m Manweb is cutting 500 jobs, 11 per cent of its workforce, in a move expected to save the Cheshire-based electricity distributor and supplier up to Pounds 20m a year by 1997. The group is the second in the sector to respond to the regulator's recent price review with job cuts and a wide-ranging restructuring. Norweb announced just two weeks ago that it would shed 1,200 jobs over five years. Most of the regional electricity companies are expected to announce similar action to cut costs over the coming weeks. Manweb said it would shed the jobs over three years with 400 coming from a fundamental restructuring of the electricity distribution business into three centralised divisions. The remaining losses would result from efficiency savings. Mr John Roberts, chief executive, said the restructuring was not simply a knee-jerk reaction to the price review, which was widely perceived to have hit Manweb harder than some of the other regional electricity companies. 'It is the next logical stage in the development of our strategy,' he said. The first stage had been to cut costs afterprivatisation and the second was to improve the quality. This, the third stage, was about holding the improved quality and cutting costs yet further. Analysts welcomed the cost cuts, which were largely as expected, with some reservations. 'The regulator said they were a high-cost producer, so they have got to take costs out,' said one. 'But even after this they will still be among the highest cost producers.' Mr Roberts said Manweb would continue to seek savings through innovation and restructuring. Although cost cutting would get more difficult over time, Manweb had no intention of developing an alternate earnings stream by diversifying into non-regulated businesses. He was confident Manweb would be able to continue delivering dividend growth above the sector average for some time. Analysts speculated that Manweb could deliver growth of up to 9 per cent above inflation, and still retain cover of about two times by 2000. The shares moved ahead by 2.4 per cent to 851p in a relatively flat sector. Northern Ireland Electricity has called on staff in its Shop Electric showrooms to accept new terms, including pay cuts averaging 6.1 per cent - up to 14 per cent for some - or face the loss of 400 jobs.</p>

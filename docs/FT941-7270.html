			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: ICI The profits recovery at ICI owes much to self-help and good fortune. The snag is that favourable foreign exchange rates can no longer be taken for granted. Sterling was already working against the company in the fourth quarter. Unless ICI has the stomach for another big round of rationalisation, the best of the cost savings have also been had. While slightly higher prices for titanium dioxide and PVC are encouraging, a broader recovery in chemicals prices looks some way off. Still, ICI is generating cash after capital expenditure even at this depressed point in the cycle - thanks to a squeeze on working capital. With gearing of only 12 per cent, now that Zeneca has repaid its debts, ICI can consider some sizeable investments. The company argues that gearing of 30 per cent would be comfortable. That implies at least Pounds 800m to spend - over and above normal capital investment - should opportunities arise. Since the thrust of strategy is now towards tighter focus, smaller acquisitions in ICI's chosen areas of competence look more likely than one big deal. Financial strength is an especially strong card where potential sellers have problems. So it is only natural that ICI should show a passing interest in the tribulations of Metallgesellschaft. With the European chemicals industry still mired in recession, similar opportunities will doubtless arise elsewhere. Having taken the knife to costs, though, the question is whether ICI can spend wisely.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / UK Company News: US side takes toll on Attwoods DEPRESSED world metal prices that hit its US recycling plant left first half profits at Attwoods, the international waste management company, virtually static at Pounds 16.51m pre-tax. The figure for the six months to January 31 compared with Pounds 16.47m previously and was scored on the back of a 30 per cent rise in sales to Pounds 168.3m. Earnings per share fell from 5.07p to 4.27p. A same-again interim dividend of 1.75p is being paid. Mindis, the US recycling and reprocessing plant, was hit by falling metal prices, particularly aluminium. A Dollars 6m pre-tax profit turned into a Dollars 900,000 (Pounds 520,000) loss in the first half. That reduced margins in the US, which accounts for over 70 per cent of sales, from 14 per cent to 9.8 per cent. The company had anticipated too much growth but had now cut overheads and was showing signs of recovery, said Mr Ken Foreman, Attwoods's chairman. Sales and operating profits in continental Europe doubled over the period with Germany a particularly good performer. Demand for portable accommodation units on long term rental outstripped expectations. Mr Foreman said there was a large potential market in former East Germany for temporary accommodation. Margins in Germany remained at 19 per cent even though sales doubled. In the UK, sales and profits rose and margins were maintained at about 7 per cent. The eight council waste disposal contracts were not making good profits although there was potential to improve margins, Mr Foreman said. Gearing fell to 28 per cent after the deeply discounted rights issue in December. However, the interest charge more than doubled to Pounds 1.96m as a result of considerably higher debt that triggered the need for the rights issue.</p>

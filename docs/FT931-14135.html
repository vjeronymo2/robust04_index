			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Observer: Smoke behind the screen South Australian premier Lynn Arnold arrives in London this week on a top-secret mission. His cover story is that he is here to rail against the Defence Ministry's stone-walling over the cost of cleaning up the 1960s nuclear test sites in the Nullarbor desert. That, however, is partly a screen for an even more important job he plans to do. His contact man for it is Bernie Ecclestone, executive director of the Formula One Constructors Association, the most powerful man in Grand Prix motor racing. Since the mid-1980s, Arnold's home town of Adelaide has staged the November finale to the Formula One championship, an event raising around ADollars 100m in tourism revenues. However, a formidable cloud has been spotted recently on Adelaide's horizon  -a new federal law banning tobacco advertising in Australia after 1995. The same cloud has already caused the demise of the French Grand Prix. And the Adelaide race is dead if sponsors like Marlboro get the jitters. Arnold's pitch to Ecclestone is likely to consist of an assurance that the state government will apply to Canberra for an exemption from the new legislation for the Grand Prix. Somehow that doesn't sound like a promise that will impress an argumentative opponent like prime minister Paul Keating. No doubt Arnold has a more powerful secret weapon in reserve. Declare independence, perhaps?</p>

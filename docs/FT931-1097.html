			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Arts: Pelleas et Melisande - Opera Pierre Boulez, reflecting on Pelleas et Melisande before conducting the opera for the first time (at Covent Garden in 1969), compared Debussy's nature, as composer, to a cat's, and discerned in the opera a 'swift and deadly sheathing and unsheathing of claws'. A picture-book new production of the opera has arrived at the same theatre from Milan (where it was first shown in 1986) via a 1988 stopover in Vienna; a sense of claws (in Boulezian terms) in swift, deadly action is exactly what it seems to lack. No blood is drawn, no real threat of menace or pain offered; the spectator is not carried upon an ineluctable welling of dramatic movement toward tragedy. By its lack of fibre, and challenge, the new production is immediately cordoned off from those recent Pelleas feats of re-discovery - in Britain alone, by Elder and Pountney at the Coliseum, Boulez and Stein in Cardiff, and Peter Brook in Glasgow - which now form an essential part of serious opera performance and experience everywhere. High-quality ingredients are on offer here. The Milan and Vienna conductor, Claudio Abbado, returns to Covent Garden after a 10-year absence, along with three members of his original cast - Francois Le Roux and Frederica von Stade in the title roles, Patrizia Pace as Yniold. Antoine Vitez, the producer, died in 1990; his staging, in its Yannis Kokkos designs, has been placed in the care of Lorenzo Mariani. In spite of first-night vagaries - chinks of light peeping through castle walls, rumpled back-cloths, come-and-go lighting, plentiful set-change noise  -the show looks good, in an airy pre-Raphaelite way. Its Burne-Jones shapes and proportions have been devised to reflect important thematic concerns in the opera. Above all, the extinction of light in the lives of its youthful title-characters: light plays behind a semi-diaphonous black swing-curtain during the interludes, and its diminution by various forms of filtering is an integral part of the unfolding of every scene. It is a setting pregnant with dramatic possibilities for the conductor to realise. Abbado concentrates on making the score sound limpid and lustrous, the scoring substantial and picturesque: buoyant rhythms pick up swirling sea-breezes, delicately fashioned phrasing catches fountain ripples, the scent of evening air. He is a conductor of extraordinary skill and sophistication, who achieves his fairy-tale account of Pelleas in a way that leaves no musical element undisciplined or out of focus. What he avoids is any acknowledgement of the hard muscle and bare bone of the music, its nervous system, its dramatic articulation by means of infinitely subtle combinations of timbre. Mr Le Roux and Miss von Stade have become rather mature occupants of the innocent-white costumes they are asked to wear. Both are artists of wonderful sensitivity, alert to the finest gradations of tonal and verbal nuance; neither, on this occasion, produced the wholly absorbed, completely transported account of their roles of which one knows them capable. (Miss von Stade, it should be said, was not wholly recovered from the illness that affected her participation in the final dress rehearsal; it would have been fairer both to her and to the audience to make this information public before curtain rise.) This lack of sharp-profiled characterisation, reflected alike in the conducting and the title parts, is continued in Victor Braun's Golaud, intelligently conceived and executed but projected with insufficient vocal thrust. Robert Lloyd, celebrating two decades of leading roles at Covent Garden, returns as Arkel. It is an even greater pleasure to welcome back the long-absent Yvonne Minton, whose Genevieve cut across the spaces with a trenchancy of attack one would wish more widely imitated - Miss Pace's Yniold likewise, though in demeanour she seems more a fetching gamine than a carefully observed and enacted boy. The sum of all this, on Wednesday, was Pelleas as International Opera - of, admittedly, a high-calibre kind. Since recent seasons at Covent Garden have taught one to expect more searching presentations of serious opera, a more inventive blending of international ingredients, it comes as a disappointment. In repertory until April 8</p>

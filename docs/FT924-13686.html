			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: NAB chief warns of withdrawing BNZ bid NATIONAL Australia Bank (NAB) may withdraw its NZDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 813m) bid for Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) if there is a public inquiry into the target bank, Mr Don Argus, NAB chief executive, said yesterday. He was responding to demands for an inquiry into BNZ's operations and alleged secret deals between 1986 and 1991, for which the bank disclosed losses of at least NZDollars 2.5bn requiring taxpayer support. Mr Argus said similar inquiries into Australian banks had been costly, debilitating, and had seen these banks lose their way. He said an inquiry into BNZ had the potential of severely damaging its franchise in the New Zealand market and its value to NAB. It might force NAB to decide to 'go home. But I hope commonsense prevails, and no enquiry is held'. Mr Argus' comments are similar to those made by Mr Lindsay Pyne, BNZ chief executive, who on Monday warned that the campaign was putting the bank at 'risk'. The New Zealand Securities Commission will today review its previous decision that there was no need for an inquiry. The campaign for an inquiry began late last year following the sacking of the former minister of Maori affairs, Mr Winston Peters, who has since become a critic of the government. Mr Peters has led a high profile public campaign to force the government to hold an inquiry into BNZ. He has released a steady stream of leaked documents in parliament, alleging misdemeanours by directors and others. A key target for Mr Peters' campaign is the prime minister, Mr Jim Bolger, who since the 1991 election has refused to hold an inquiry. On Monday, Mr Pyne, in a bitter attack on Mr Peters, said an inquiry would undo the three-and-a-half years spent rebuilding the bank, would cost up to NZDollars 30m and last up to 18 months.</p>

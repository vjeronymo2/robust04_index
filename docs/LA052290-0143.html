			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIRING HALL PROPOSED FOR HUNTINGTON BEACH  </P> <P> To combat a rising crime problem in the city's Oakview section, Police Chief  Ronald E. Lowenberg on Monday urged the City Council to establish a day-laborer  hiring hall and a police substation in the area.  </P> <P> The council members, while taking no formal vote, indicated majority support  for Lowenberg's proposal. The day-laborer hiring hall, if built, would become  the fourth such facility in Orange County.  </P> <P> Lowenberg's proposals, which would cost about $500,000, are not included in the  $176-million budget proposed by City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga.  </P> <P> During a preliminary budget briefing, Mayor Thomas J. Mays told Uberuaga that  the 1990-91 budget needs to be revised to cover Lowenberg's proposals for the  Oakview area.  </P> <P> "We need to support these items in our budget to maintain a safe community,"  Mays said.  </P> <P> Councilman Jim Silva added: "I think the people of Huntington Beach deserve  this."  </P> <P> The city's Oakview area is roughly bounded by Beach Boulevard, Slater Avenue,  Gothard Street and Warner Avenue. City officials have said the area is marked  by overcrowded housing and has a large proportion of new immigrants, primarily  Latino and Asian.  </P> <P> Lowenberg said a hiring hall would greatly aid many adult residents of the  area. He proposed using a trailer, manned by city staffers, which would be  located on Nichols Street about a half block from Warner Avenue.  </P> <P> Lowenberg proposed that the hiring hall be modeled on one in Brea and operated  in a similar manner.  </P> <P> According to a written report that Lowenberg gave the council: "The Brea Center  does not require the day laborer to carry proof of United States residency. The  center will provide a designated location within the city where employer and  employees can make contact with each other."  </P> <P> The city's proposed budget includes no new city funds for the proposed  municipal pier. Uberuaga said there is no room in the "lean" budget for more  than the $1.6 million that the city allocated last year and which is being  carried forward in the new budget. The new pier is estimated to cost $12  million, and the city so far has raised only $7.5 million.  </P> <P> The City Council voted May 7 to hire a professional fund-raising firm to try to  solicit the remaining money for the new pier.  </P></p>

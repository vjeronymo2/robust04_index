			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / TUC delegation will meet Lamont today MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, will meet trade union representatives today to discuss ideas for promoting economic growth. It will be the first meeting between the Trades Union Congress and the chancellor since the early 1980s. The trade union delegation will be headed by Mr Norman Willis, the TUC's general secretary, and other leading officials from the TUC's executive council and emergency energy committee, representing thousands of employees in the public and private sectors. The TUC requested a meeting with Mr Lamont last month, when the chancellor said he would be listening to the views of industry ahead of the Autumn Statement next week. A TUC official said yesterday: 'We are glad that he is seeing us as part of that process.' The TUC plans to restate the main points of its recent economic policy statement, A Call for Action, which emphasises the need for growth. It also wants a public investment programme and a long-term recovery plan based on specific industrial sectors. After 1983, when Mr Nigel Lawson became chancellor, communication between the Treasury and the TUC was channelled through the National Economic Development Office. Nedo is being wound down and will be abolished at the end of the year. The Treasury said that in spite of the demise of Nedo 'it would be useful to have an exchange of views'. Public-sector pay is likely to feature heavily in the discussions. There has been much speculation in the press that Mr Lamont will announce limits - or even a freeze - on public-sector pay increases, even though that would involve considerable technical and political difficulties. One TUC official said: 'If the government is going to have a public-sector pay policy we want to know what they are going to do. Are they going to scrap indexation arrangements or are they going to scrap the review bodies?' TUC officials see themselves as representing a broad-based coalition of political protest against recent government decisions.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bond auction limits gains in French equities POLITICS and corporate results helped bourses recover from Wednesday's losses, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS failed to capitalise fully on Mr Pierre Beregovoy's widely expected appointment as prime minister yesterday because of volatility in the bond market. Bond prices finally ended lower, following disappointing demand for the Treasury's 10-year bond auction. The CAC-40 index closed only 13.88 higher at 1,941.95, below the day's high of 1,946.95, in moderate turnover of FFr2.6bn. Perrier only accounted for FFr93.7m yesterday compared with more than FFr1.0bn a day earlier this week. Suez was active, rising FFr11.40 to FFr336.90 with 451,875 shares traded, on renewed talk that Suez and UAP had reached an agreement on their subsidiary, Victoire. Lyonnaise-Dumez was up FFr12 at FFr522, buoyed up by good 1991 results from its quoted waste management subsidiary, Sita. Shares in the latter rose by FFr25 to FFr1,940. Synthelabo, the small pharmaceutical company, jumped FFr79 or 6.6 per cent to FFr1,278 following the announcement of an extremely good performance in 1991 and a positive analysts' meeting. L'Oreal, which holds 50.1 per cent of Synthelabo, added FFr21 to FFr825. FRANKFURT was slightly disappointed by Deutsche Bank's 1991 profits, which although at a record high, came in below expectations. The bank also gave a cautious outlook for earnings in 1992. Its shares closed up DM1.50 at DM715.00, having been marked up in pre-bourse trading to DM717.90. The DAX index rose 14.36 to 1,721.66, just below its intraday high of 1,721.73, and the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, gained 2.00 to 700.95. Turnover advanced to DM6.2bn from DM4.8bn. The rift between the German cartel office and Allianz deepened yesterday, with the insurer sticking by its cooperation plans with Dresdner Bank, in which it has a 22 per cent stake. Meanwhile, Dresdner proposed Mr Wolfgang Schieren of Allianz for its supervisory board. The cartel office has told Allianz to reduce its holding in Dresdner, which it estimates to be 47 per cent. Allianz recovered DM6 to DM2,124 and Dresdner put on DM1.50 to DM351.50. BMW advanced another DM10.50 or 1.8 per cent to DM583.00, lifted by its good earnings outlook for 1992. Volkswagen rose DM5.20 to DM366.50. News that Siemens had secured a DM1bn order from the German postal service lifted its shares by DM7.30 to DM677.00, while Mannesmann added DM6.50 to DM285.80 on reports that a number of brokers had upgraded the stock. MILAN focused on the listing of San Paolo, and dealers crowded around the trading pit to witness the launch. The shares in the bank officially closed at L12,240, L40 above its issue price, but dealers suspected an active support operation by Mediobanca. The price dropped to L12,100 after hours. About 15 brokers were seen selling San Paolo shares on behalf of institutional investors while only 3 brokers were detected on the buy side. Reports about the number of San Paolo shares traded yesterday were conflicting, with some saying about 1m-1.5m shares while others put the figure at 3m. The Comit index rose 4.67 to 508.77 in turnover estimated at L90bn after L68.2bn. Dealers reported increased activity in call options, suggesting that few traders wanted to go short, with the market just above the year's low and in the event of better-than-expected results for the main parties in this weekend's general election. There was continued buying interest in stocks which reported good 1991 results in the past week. Benetton rose L99 to L13,450 while Sip added L28 to L1,473 with 5.5m shares traded, below the 8m mark reached earlier this week. ZURICH was stronger as foreigners actively sought insurance stocks. The SMI index advanced 11.3 to 1,838.0. Swiss Re registered shares rose SFr40 to SFr2,400 and Zurich Insurance registered shares were SFr60 firmer at SFr4,060. Roche bearers rose SFr10 to SFr4,300 ahead of its 1991 results today. AMSTERDAM finished a dull day slightly higher as a lack of news kept turnover to Fl 549.4m. The CBS Tendency Index rose 0.7 to 125.2. Fokker was the highlight on persistent rumours that Deutsche Aerospace was to make a bid. Fokker said that it would make an announcement on its discussions with the German group by the end of the month. The shares hit an intraday high of Fl 35.40 before closing 50 cents ahead at Fl 34.20. Begemann, the industrial group, announced a 15.6 per cent increase in 1991 net profit and gained Fl 1.00 to Fl 120.00, while Heineken was Fl 1.30 stronger at Fl 189.30 ahead of the release of its annual report. STOCKHOLM saw continued weakness in shares in the troubled banking group Gota. Its A shares fell SKr3 to SKr18, down 25 per cent since Monday. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 1.3 to 993.4 in steady turnover of SKr405m. VIENNA closed at its lowest level since the end of January. The 18-share ATX index declined 11.91 to 993.42. ISTANBUL weakened after interest rates were raised. The 75-share index closed down 74.41 or 1.8 per cent at 3,987.77.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - APR 2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1146.54  1146.03  1146.53  1147.94  1149.04  1149.50  1149.29  1149.08  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Day's High  1150.23    Day's Low  1145.91  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      Apr 1     Mar 31    Mar 30    Mar 27    Mar 26      1141.13   1149.80   1145.80   1140.84   1146.25  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

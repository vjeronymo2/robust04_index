			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION SOFTBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> COUNTY TEAMS LACK REQUISITE PITCHING PUNCH  </P> <P> Orange County teams are not projected to be heavy hitters in this season's  Southern Section softball playoffs, which begin today with wild-card games in  the 5-A division.  </P> <P> Part of the reason is county teams don't have the dominant pitching of the  past.  </P> <P> Of the 32 county teams participating in five of six divisions (Orange County  does not have 2-A leagues), only two are seeded.  </P> <P> Irvine, the highest-seeded county team, did not even qualify for postseason  play last year. The Vaqueros (18-7), the No. 1 team from the South Coast  League, are seeded third in the 3-A behind top-seeded La Mirada (25-1) and  undefeated Covina (21-0-1).  </P> <P> Irvine plays at home Thursday against Mayfair (15-9). Nine other county schools  made the 32-team 3-A bracket, including South Coast League teams San Clemente  (11-12), El Toro (12-8) and Mission Viejo (14-8).  </P> <P> In the 5-A, top-seeded St. Joseph of Lakewood (21-1) from the Angelus League  has the section's best pitcher in Lisa Fernandez -- the heir apparent to  Michele Granger.  </P> <P> Mater Dei (15-6-1), the third-place team from the Angelus League, and Marina  (18-9), Fountain Valley (18-6-1), Los Alamitos (14-10) and El Dorado (16-7)  made the 16-team bracket.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley might have the best shot at the finals, but it's a long one.  Fountain Valley has a strong pitcher in Rae Rice, and though her statistics  have not been great because she was injured, she has mended and is on the  upswing.  </P> <P> In the 4-A, Kennedy (18-4) is seeded fourth and one of 12 county teams in the  32-team draw. Kennedy, the Garden Grove league champion, is led by pitcher  Cheryl Longeway.  </P></p>

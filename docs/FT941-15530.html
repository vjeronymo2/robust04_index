			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Investment in Hungary Sir, Your article, 'Foreign investment projects in Hungary top Dollars 3bn' (November 23), concludes that by June 1993 Hungary received Dollars 3bn in foreign investment. In fact, Hungary received Dollars 5.5bn for the period examined in the UN study referred to. The study itself pointed out that the two sets of data used were not strictly comparable; and neither were the valuation methods used. You also stated that Germany is the largest investor in Hungary. This is not so - the US is in that position. The comparative data in the study show that, on an absolute basis, Hungary is the undisputed leader in attracting foreign investment to central Europe. Foreign investment is an important element in Hungary's transition to a market economy and industrial restructuring, and the government has taken a number of steps to attract international business to the country. Frigyes Banki, managing director, The Hungarian Investment and Trade Development Agency, Dorottya Street 4, 1051 Budapest, Hungary</p>

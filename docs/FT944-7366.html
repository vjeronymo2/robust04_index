			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / German output set to rise Western German companies are revising their production plans upwards for the coming months because of the continuing strong recovery in the economy, Ifo, the Munich-based Institute for Economic Research, concludes in its monthly survey. However, the retail sector in both eastern and western Germany remains one of the few which show little sign of growth, largely because consumer spending is still sluggish. This is despite recent official estimates showing that pan-German gross domestic product will grow 3 per cent next year. The more optimistic response by companies coincides with a record level of investment in eastern Germany for 1994. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, yesterday told the Bundestag, parliament's lower house, that a record investment level of DM180bn (Pounds 73.4bn), higher per capita than in western Germany, had poured into eastern Germany this year.</p>

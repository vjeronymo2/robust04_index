			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / How To Spend It: Take a cheap plunge in the art market THE ART market may be in a state of disarray, galleries may be folding, artists wondering how to pay their bills, but somehow the Contemporary Art Society manages to inject some fun and dash into the business of investing in a little art. Other galleries are posher, other works of art finer but the Contemporary Art Society in its annual collaboration with Sainsbury's brings art right into the mainstream of ordinary life. For a start there are the prices. They begin at Pounds 100 and the maximum is Pounds 1,750, far lower than the prices in most of the Cork Street galleries. There are the works of art - everything from original paintings, to drawings and sculptures. There is also the atmosphere - much more like a marketplace than a hushed and pompous gallery. People come and people go; paintings go and are replaced by others. Customers seem to come from almost every walk of life. Some are young, some are old and what many of them have in common is they have grown to like buying art this way and come every year. If you have a fine and distinguished collection of ancient masters, this is not the place for you but for those wanting to know where and how to start buying there could hardly be a better way. The Contemporary Art Society also runs a 'Collecting on a Budget' course for those interested in buying the works of young, undiscovered artists. It costs Pounds 120 for six evenings and aims to give an idea of how to buy, what is available, to take those interested to see studios, auction houses, print-makers and galleries. The exhibition is at Smith's Galleries, 25 Neale St, London, WC2 from October 27 to November 1, Tuesday to Friday, 11 am to 7 pm and on Saturday and Sunday from 11 am to 5 pm.</p>

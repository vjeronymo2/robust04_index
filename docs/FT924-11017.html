			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / ANC says Twickenham test match can go ahead THE Twickenham rugby test match between South Africa and England on November 14 looks likely to go ahead despite the withdrawal of support for all rugby tours by the National and Olympic Sports Congress (NOSC), South Africa's most powerful sporting body. Mr Steve Tshwete, African National Congress spokesman on sport, said the ANC had pledged its support for the match and would honour this pledge. He said, however, that future tours, and the 1995 rugby World Cup, which South Africa is supposed to host, were at risk. This week's statement by Mr Mluleki George, president of NOSC, has refocused attention on the use of sporting boycotts as a political weapon following the gradual lifting over the past year of the sports moratorium. Mr George was essentially repeating a point he made in April when he sought to have the August visit to South Africa by the New Zealand All Blacks cancelled: namely that the country's rugby authorities pay insufficient attention to developing the sport, preferring to focus on international tours. Mr George's frustration relates to a perception that the South African Rugby Football Union (SARFU), and rugby supporters in general, have been less than enthusiastic in embracing the new South Africa. In stark contrast to the nimble diplomacy practised by leading cricket administrators, rugby authorities have made little effort to hide their distaste for the ANC's considerable sporting influence. Tempting though it may be, however, to try to punish conservative whites by seeking rugby's isolation, this route is not without problems. Some question how Mr George can justify such a step when his grievance is more a matter of style than substance. For although rugby probably deserves its reactionary image, it has met the two prerequisites set down for a return to international competition: unity of administrative structures, and a development programme. On the latter front, R6m (about Pounds 1.3m) has recently been paid into a development fund. Since few blacks play rugby, few are likely to be concerned either way about Mr George's strictures. Whites are likely to have mixed feelings. Many will be resentful at the efforts to politically cleanse sport, though there would probably also be widespread support for the introduction of a younger, more progressive group of administrators to run the sport.</p>

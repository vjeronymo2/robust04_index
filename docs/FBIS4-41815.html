			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report attributed to VYBIR: "Money-Making Valves of the </F> Turkmenistan Pipeline"]    [Text] Relations between Ukraine and Turkmenistan are  beginning to normalize. The Ukrainian side announced this news  through the major state dailies. Beginning today, Ukraine's  debts to Turkmenistan, which totalled $671.9 million last year,  will not be paid by the government -- there are no funds for  this in the budget. A part of the payment has been ceded to the  Respublika consortium.    This consortium was formed by eight companies. The chief  founder is 31-year-old Ihor Bakay. The number and composition  of the founders changes periodically, depending on the tasks  performed by the concern. Earlier, Respublika dealt with the  sale of canned food, fish, and beer, enjoying significant  success. According to Ihor Bakay, Respublika would have never  taken on energy resources if it had not made a bad go of it on  the Turkmenistan market.    The consortium has not succeeded in settling accounts for  supplies to Turkmenistan in time. Since there were hundreds of  thousands of dollars involved, Respublika was given an  alternative -- to take upon itself the payment of the debt,  adjusting its own liabilities to meet this. With Bakay's  approval, events began to develop in a fantastic way. Here is  Bakay's account of what happened:    "Valeriy Ochakov, Turkmenistan's first deputy prime  minister,  immediately flew to Kiev to meet acting Ukrainian Prime Minister  Yukhym Zvyahilskyy. True, the meeting did not introduce any  significant changes in the deal. `The process was activated'  only after Turkmenistan had cut off gas supplies. Yukhym  Zvyahilskyy immediately flew to Ashgabat to meet with Niyazov.  An agreement at the governmental level was signed after a  couple of days. It was arranged so that the settling of  accounts will be simple -- one-third of the debt ($224 million)  will be paid in hard currency; the rest ($447.9 million) will be  paid in commodities."    Even prior to this agreement, however, trains with products  sent by Respublika to pay off the debt were leaving for  Turkmenistan on a daily basis.    How could this be possible without permission from  high-level  authorities -- it is difficult to say. In general, this case is  typical of the Ukrainian legal mess. Furthermore, Respublika's  gas program was given tacit approval by the Cabinet of  Ministers. Those trying to oppose their power have been  deprived of their cushy jobs.    After the settling of accounts began, it became clear that  Ukraine is not only sending trinkets to Turkmenistan. To cover  the debt, Ukraine has to dispatch 70,000 tonnes of rolled steel,  10,000 tonnes of foundry cast iron, 200,000 tonnes of processed  cast iron, 150,000 tonnes of ferroalloys, 50,000 tonnes of scrap  ferrous metals, 502,000 tonnes of aluminum, 140,000 tonnes of  ammonia, 2,500 KRAZ trucks, 300 LAZ jeeps, 400,000 tonnes of  grain, 80,000 tonnes of meat, and 100,000 tonnes of flour. In  addition, $1.6-million worth of medicine and $20-million worth  of special equipment for the Internal Ministry and other  services. The complete list is 10 pages long. True, due to the  efforts of officials from the Ministry of the Economy and the  Ministry of Finance, some items were removed from the list,  including 500,000 tonnes of zinc, hundreds of thousands of  tonnes of aluminum, copper, nickel, lead, and expensive scrap  nonferrous metals.    According to experts, the cost of goods proposed for barter  exceeds the sum of debt by several times. It was evaluated  that, having only used the credits allotted by the Ukrainian  Government for this operation, Respublika will be able to garner  profits in the area of $7 million. Moreover, profiting from  price differences is also possible. Thus, Respublika will buy  gas for $50 per 1,000 cubic meters. According to estimates by  leading Ukrainian economists -- between $65 and $101 [per 1,000  cubic meters]. The enterprises that pay three times as much for  energy resources will increase prices on their goods, as well.  As a result, imports of Turkmen gas by Ukraine can become  unprofitable.    It is already known how the Ukrainian side behaves under  such  circumstances. During the latest price incident [not further  identified], Yukhim Zvyahilskyy sold out a part of Ukraine's  strategic resources.    It is not polite, as the saying goes, to look in someone  else's pocket. We will add: providing your money is not  transferred into that pocket. Taking into account the prospect  for future price increases, we have asked Volodymyr Lanovyy,  president of the Center of Market Reforms, to comment on the  Ukrainian-Turkmen gas deal. He stated:    "This is a high-quality swindle. Having signed the agreement  with Turkmenistan, Respublika is able to buy hard currency at  prices three times lower than usual. In such cases, the  exchange rate in Ukraine stands at 13,100 karbovanetses per  dollar, while the market exchange rate is around 50,000  karbovanetses. Turkmen gas going to the corporation is 30  percent cheaper -- this money will remain in the corporation's  accounts with each payment cycle. Furthermore, enterprises will  be given obligatory state orders for the production of  commodities for Respublika. In turn, Respublika will sell these  commodities for hard currency, but the enterprises will be paid  in devaluated karbovanetses. In addition, they will not be paid  the full price, but only the production cost. The seller will  also be a two-time winner here."    Volodymyr Lanovyy is supported in this opinion by Sumin,  head  of the Ukrainian Union of Lawyers: "With the help of such a  structure, the national wealth of Ukraine and Turkmenistan feeds  certain Mafia-like structures. Thus, a big difference between  purchasing and selling prices is being transferred to foreign  accounts. By the way, according to the Ukrainian-Turkmen  agreement, the monetary side of the Ukrainian debt should be  paid to an appropriate account in the Deutsche Bank."    They say that the country which sells its national resources  to pay off debts may be declared bankrupt by the International  Court of Justice in The Hague. The CIS has created an economic  court, but, for the time being, this court is successfully idle.  Therefore, there are no reasons for being ashamed. The deal  will continue. The point is who will become the next exporter --  will this exporter be appointed privately and quietly in  governmental cabinets, or at an auction with the largest profit  for the country? Maybe, we would be able by this to avoid  rumors over fantastic bonuses in gas imports? All the more so  since competent sources report: Metals and bed pans are not the  only commodities which Ukraine is ready to barter to acquire the  desired energy resources. It is simply a pity that the blanket  is too short and someone is going to catch a cold.</p>

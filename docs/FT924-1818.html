			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Ferranti cuts pre-tax losses to Pounds 11m FERRANTI International, the electronics and defence company which came close to collapse following the 1989 discovery of huge fraud in its US subsidiary, yesterday announced reduced losses but said its markets remained tough. Mr Eugene Anderson, chairman, said that following the company's restructuring in the last two years, it needed orders to generate cash. 'We have bids out for about Pounds 400m of business. If we win only Pounds 100m, that would totally transform us. We're at a very critical stage,' he said. Pre-tax losses improved from Pounds 28.8m to Pounds 10.9m in the six months to September 30. This was because of reduced operating losses and no exceptional items, which cost Pounds 11.3m last time. Ferranti's shares slipped 1 1/4 p to 8 3/4 p, partly because of uncertainty about when certain large Middle Eastern defence contracts would be awarded. One analyst said: 'If they can pull in a few of those contracts in the second half, it would greatly help cash flow and their chances of finding an industrial partner.' Turnover fell from Pounds 212.4m to Pounds 109.4m. Most of the reduction stemmed from disposals, which last year included the sale of Ferranti's missile business to GEC. The rest was because of recession and falling defence expenditure. Outstanding orders fell from Pounds 272.1m at year end to Pounds 246.1m. Litigation is continuing in connection with the fraud, which involved the US subsidiary International Signal and Control and cost Ferranti an estimated Pounds 600m. Ferranti has recovered about Pounds 42m, mainly from ISC's auditor KPMG Peat Marwick, and it does not expect further significant recoveries. Mr James Guerin, former chairman of ISC, was given a 15-year jail sentence in June. Ferranti's net borrowings fell more than Pounds 20m to Pounds 74.1m but still exceeded shareholders' funds of Pounds 62.2m. A Pounds 60m term loan until September is likely to be renegotiated early next year, Mr Anderson said. Interest costs fell from Pounds 6.8m to Pounds 5.6m and there was a Pounds 2m tax credit compared with a Pounds 500,000 charge last time. The loss per share improved from 3.15p to 0.95p. No dividend is payable until the company restores a distributable reserve. Job cuts were made during the six months. The workforce stands at about 4,700, against 5,300 six months ago and 27,000 in 1989.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Fishermen meet to decide next step FISHERMEN from ports throughout England and Wales meet tomorrow to decide the next phase of their campaign against the government's fisheries policy. Some of the representatives - between 30 and 40 - attending the special meeting of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations executive in Derby are expected to favour more blockades, which in the past four weeks have disrupted shipping in and out of Teesport, Plymouth, and the Mersey estuary ports. Executive member Mr Bill Madine, chairman of the group's West Coast committee and organiser of Wednesday's Mersey blockade, has predicted the meeting will back further similar action. Protests would continue, he said, until the men received satisfaction from the government. 'The resolve of MAFF (the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) is starting to melt,' said Mr Madine, a trawler fisherman from Whitehaven, Cumbria. 'I would think some members will be saying, we have a roll on, let's keep it going.' Yesterday Mr Richard Banks, chief executive of the organisation said: 'Nothing is ruled out.' But he added he felt the maximum publicity may have been obtained from blockades considering three had been held, and suggested the meeting may decide on other action, saying: 'It ranges from non-compliance with the new regulations to doing other things.' He declined to elaborate further. The fishermen's blockades hoped to raise public awareness of their opposition to cheap fish imports and the new Sea Fish Conservation Act, which will restrict the number of days UK fishing boats can put to sea. The order allocating the days is to be placed before parliament shortly.</p>

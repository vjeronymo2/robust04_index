			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW TURNS DOWN 3.72 AS TRADERS AWAIT NEWS  </P> <P> The stock market sustained some scattered losses today after making a  short-lived run at record highs.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 10 points at its afternoon  peak, closed with a 3.72 loss at 2,929.70.  </P> <P> Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances on the New York Stock Exchange,  with 711 up, 774 down and 507 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 158.91 million shares, against 157.10 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index fell .66 to 199.00.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department reported this morning that retail sales fell 0.7% in  May, registering a sharper decline than most analysts had expected.  </P> <P> That evidence of continued softness in business activity helped push interest  rates lower in the credit markets.  </P> <P> Prices of long-term government bonds rose about $7.50 for each $1,000 in face  value, lowering their yields to the 8.38%-8.41% range.  </P> <P> But stock traders didn't show such clear-cut enthusiasm over the news. Analysts  said investors were a little unsettled by signs that consumer spending was  slipping at a time when economic growth appears to be sluggish at best.  </P> <P> In addition, traders appeared reluctant to chase after stocks in advance of  government reports Thursday and Friday on consumer and producer prices.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  rose between 1/8 point and 9/32 point, intermediate maturities rose between  5/16 point and 15/32 point and long-term issues were up 5/8 point to 11/16  point, according to the Telerate financial information service.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.94% as the discount fell 4 basis  points to 7.69%.  </P></p>

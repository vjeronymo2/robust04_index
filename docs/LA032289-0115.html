			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOGGS SAYS HE'S OFFERED HIS EX-LOVER $20,000 SETTLEMENT  </P> <P> Red Sox third baseman Wade Boggs has offered Margo Adams $20,000 to settle her  lawsuit against him, reversing his refusal to negotiate with his former lover.  </P> <P> "I just did it for the welfare of the guys and to get the thing over with  before the season starts," Boggs said in a story published in Wednesday's  editions of the Boston Globe. "But there's no word on it (being accepted by  Adams)."  </P> <P> Jennifer King, Boggs' lawyer in the suit, said that Boggs had been pressured by  the Red Sox into making the offer to the Costa Mesa woman.  </P> <P> "This isn't something Wade wanted to do," King said. "The team put pressure on  him. Teammates were concerned that depositions would be taken and they would  have to talk about their private lives."  </P> <P> Lou Gorman, Boston's general manager, denied that, telling the newspaper: "This  is something Wade wanted to do."  </P> <P> James McGee, Adams' lawyer, said he expected to receive the offer in writing in  the next few days. The Globe said Adams has told people that she has no  intention of accepting the offer.  </P></p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / BSkyB likely to win FA Cup rights BRITISH SKY Broadcasting is likely to win the rights to show live FA Cup games and England home internationals over the next five years in addition to English Premier League games. The BBC and British Satellite Broadcasting, before it merged with Sky, signed a Pounds 30m, four-year deal with the Football Association. The deal, which gives the BBC the right to show one live match for every round plus the semi-finals and final, has one more year to run. Under the terms of the original agreement, the two broadcasting organisations have the right to first negotiations for a renewal of the contract. It is believed that BSkyB - a venture in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake - and the BBC have an agreement in principle for a renewal. ITV has submitted a bid for the BBC part of the package. The BBC said last night: 'We cannot comment on negotiations which are in progress.' One of the conditions in the heads of agreement for the controversial Pounds 304m Premier League deal is that BSkyB reaches agreement with the FA. The fact that this is a condition of the Premier League agreement implies that BSkyB is confident of retaining its present access to FA Cup and international games. The ITV Association yesterday issued a writ against the FA and the Premier League for breach of contract in not keeping the terms of ITV's bid confidential. The FA is named because of uncertainty about the constitutional status of the Premier League when some of the negotiations were conducted. ITV is seeking damages of up to Pounds 20m for loss of profits over the five-year term of the Premier League agreement. ITV is also seeking an injunction preventing the Premier League from signing a deal with BSkyB until it has had a chance of making a further bid. A similar plea was rejected in the High Court on Tuesday. The writ seeks damages from BSkyB for 'inducing breach of the obligation to keep the bid confidential'. ITV has claimed that the substance of its Pounds 262m bid was communicated to BSkyB, enabling the satellite company to put in a last-minute improved offer. Meanwhile, BBC Television said yesterday it had won the rights to televise Liverpool's home matches in the European Cup Winner's Cup live next season. Mr Jonathan Martin, BBC Television's head of sport, said last night: 'Alongside the FA Cup, England's home internationals and the return of Match of the Day with Premier League games, the BBC's pattern of football coverage is shaping up nicely.'</p>

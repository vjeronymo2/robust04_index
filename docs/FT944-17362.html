			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft cuts debt by two-thirds to DM1.2bn Metallgesellschaft has reduced its net debt by two-thirds, and made a 'precision landing' on targets set earlier this year when creditor banks agreed a DM3.4bn (Dollars 2.2bn) rescue package, according to Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chairman. Debts of DM3.6bn at the end of the 1992-93 financial year had been cut to DM1.2bn by the end of September, he said yesterday. Bank liabilities had been reduced to DM4.1bn from DM7.6bn. The assets sale since he took control last December had generated DM4.2bn, and 90 subsidiaries had been disposed of or deconsolidated. Cost savings of DM500m this year would be followed by a further DM1bn by the end of the current financial year, when the company expects to show an operating profit of more than DM100m. In a scornful assessment of the synergies attributed to the old Metallgesellschaft, Mr Neukirchen said they should not be over-estimated. 'A company which simultaneously distributes aircraft galleys, holds stakes in bakeries and trades in developing countries' debt can only be improved by targeted disinvestment,' he added. Mr Neukirchen appeared to be responding to criticisms that the group has been reduced to a mere shadow of its former self by his radical onslaught on the alleged investment excesses wrought by his sacked predecessor, Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch. The company would concentrate on its core interests in trading, plant construction, chemicals and financial services, he said. Lead and zinc units would be rationalised further, and the environmental divisions would be tightened. The company would withdraw from loss-making recycling and environmental cleaning operations.</p>

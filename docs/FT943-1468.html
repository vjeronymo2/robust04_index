			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures passed another volatile day with the market moving skittishly in thin and nervous trading conditions. Volume was the lowest for some weeks at 10,030 - down from 13,799 on Wednesday - leaving traders with time on their hands and at the mercy of the rumour mill. The major buzz was the existence of a stock-loss trade on the FT-SE December contract. It was said to be set by a big US house and to be triggered at 3,000. At one stage the contract moved down to 3,007 only to be reversed by modest support. It reached a 3,042 best of the day around 3:30pm before closing at 3,031. At this level the premium to the cash market is around 10 points with the fair value premium running to some 15 points. Traders described business levels as 'very bitty', reflecting the 'almost complete absence' of views on the direction of equities at present. Many took the sensible course and went home early. Activity in traded options also fell, easing back to 31,858 lots from 37,003 the previous day. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted for just over half of the total. The most actively traded individual stock options were British Airways at 2,228 lots and Sainsbury (1,450 lots).</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / International Company News: Difficult environment constrains Holdains A SHARP deterioration in the business climate in the second half hampered earnings growth at Holdains, the paper and packaging company in South Africa's Malbak group, in the year to August 31. Although turnover rose by 19 per cent to R2.32bn (Dollars 811m) from R1.95bn, the squeeze on margins saw operating profits rise by only 12 per cent, to R193m from R173m. Part of this improvement was attributable to the consolidation of Carlton Paper Corporation's results for the first time. Attributable earnings were 3 per cent higher at R84.8m compared with R82m, but a rise in the number of shares in issue saw earnings per share fall to 349 cents from 358 cents. The dividend was maintained at 121 cents a share. Mr Ian Willis, chairman, said that, on a directly comparable basis, turnover had risen but operating profits had fallen due to reduced margins. He said the group had improved market share in some sectors despite a tough environment. The group, for the first time, disclosed divisional contributions to performance. The largest contributor was Kohler, the paper packaging arm, with a 36 per cent contribution to operating profits. Mr Willis did not offer a profits forecast, noting only that economic conditions were not expected to improve and 'demand for the group's products will remain depressed.'</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROOS UNABLE TO PULL BACK BILL EXTENDING CONSERVANCY  </P> <P> Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) attempted this week to retrieve a bill  from Gov. George Deukmejian's desk that would extend the life of the Santa  Monica Mountains Conservancy.  </P> <P> The unusual maneuver was blocked, however, by a parliamentary technicality.  </P> <P> The bill would extend the operation of the conservancy, which buys parkland in  the Santa Monicas, until 1995. The measure, sponsored by Sen. Herschel  Rosenthal, a Westside Democrat, received final legislative approval last week.  </P> <P> Roos, who had voted for the bill, won Assembly approval Monday to withdraw it  from the governor's desk. But later in the day the Assembly's chief clerk,  Brian Kidney, said the withdrawal was void because the legislation originated  in the Senate and any retrieval effort would have to begin there.  </P> <P> In an interview on Tuesday, Roos said the staff of the Assembly Ways and Means  subcommittee on bonded indebtedness, which he chairs, had voiced concern that  the conservancy was acquiring land encumbered by bonded indebtedness that the  state could be obligated to repay. Roos said his staff is reviewing whether the  state has become saddled with any major costs as a result of the conservancy  accepting gifts of parkland.  </P> <P> Conservancy supporters voiced fears that the legislation may face trouble with  the governor.  </P> <P> Joseph T. Edmiston, the conservancy's executive director, said the agency has  not acquired property with debts.  </P></p>

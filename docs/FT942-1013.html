			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / US court backs property rights The US Supreme Court has given new weight to the rights of property with a ground-breaking decision to limit local governments' power over private landowners. In upholding shop-owner Mrs Florence Dolan's lawsuit against the town of Tigard, Oregon, the court ruled that governments must prove that the planning requirements they impose on landowners must not only be related in nature to some legitimate public purpose but that also must be 'roughly proportional' in their impact. Mrs Dolan had challenged Tigard's demand that, in return for permission to double the size of her plumbing and electrical supply store, she set aside roughly 10 per cent of her property to building a storm drainage system and a bicycle path. The 5-4 vote revealed one of the principal fault lines between the court's right and left wings, and greatly increases the importance the justices attach to the 'takings clause' of the constitution, which prohibits the taking of private property for pub-lic use without just compensation. 'We see no reason why the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as much a part of the Bill of Rights as the First Amendment or Fourth Amendment, should be relegated to the status of a poor relation,' wrote Chief Justice William Rehnquist in the majority opinion. The First Amendment's right to freedom of religion, speech and association and the Fourth's right to be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures have generally ranked higher in the court's priorities. Justice John Paul Stevens, writing in dissent, said the court's right-wing majority had broken 'considerable and unpropitious new ground'.</p>

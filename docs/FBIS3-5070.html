			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The fourth working-level contact for the exchange of  the special envoys of the highest-level leaders of the North and  the South was held in the South side area of Panmunjom today.    The contact was held today because of our side's sincere  efforts over the four months since the third contact held in  October of last year.    As was reported, our side proposed the exchange of special  envoys of the highest-level leaders of the North and the South  in May of last year, and have made every effort we can for its  realization at the earliest date.    If the South side had taken a sincere position for the  exchange of the special envoys, as our side repeatedly demanded,  such as suspending the dialogue-negating, provocative nuclear  war exercise, not seeking the international joint cooperation  system designed to harm the fellow countrymen under the pretext  of the so-called nuclear issue; and apologizing, in particular,  for the violent remark that they would not hesitate to take  military countermeasures against the dialogue partner, the  working delegates' contact would have been concluded and the  special envoys of the two sides would have traveled between  Pyongyang and Seoul.    However, despite our side's just demand, the South side not  only enforced the large-scale Hwarang and Eagle-93 war exercises  one after another, but requested the United States not to hold  the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, even calling for so-called  sanctions against us. Thus, continuously conducting the outside  force-depending acts and antinational acts, the South side  caused the working-level contact to be suspended.    The contact today was held in camera. After the contact, the  head of our side's delegation held a news conference for  domestic and foreign reporters on the spot, and informed the  reporters of the status of the contact.    Our side first made clear our serious position [chinjihan  ipchang] for the working-level contact, and said that in light  of all the facts, the problem was that the South side has not  had the proper attitude and position for the realization of the  exchange of special envoys and attempted to crush [apsal] us  with the outside forces under the pretext of the nuclear issue  and putting the brake on the DPRK-U.S. talks. Our side made  clear that the South side should feel responsible for long  delaying the exchange of the special envoys of the highest-level  leaders of the North and the South, which are aimed at bringing  forth a turning point for peace and the peaceful reunification  of the country.    Our side stressed that the way of breaking through the  difficulties most promptly and smoothly at a time when the  threat of nuclear war is menacing the nation is exchanging  special envoys of highest-level leaders of the North and South  at the earliest date. Our side urged the South side to take  immediate steps to remove obstacles lying in the way of the  exchange of special envoys.    Regarding this, our side insisted that the South side should  stop all the large-scale nuclear war exercises against its  dialogue partner, give up seeking an antinational international  cooperation system, call off its attempt to bring in Patriot  missiles to South Korea, and withdraw its remarks that it will  not shake hands with its dialogue partner.    Our side stressed that these four points are just measures  necessary for successfully exchanging special envoys between the  North and South under a good atmosphere and environment.    Our side maintained that the two sides should wind up the  discussions on procedural matters concerning the exchange of  special envoys in an hour or so after the South side, at today's  contact, gives a satisfactory explanation on its stance toward  the four points in any form. After that, our side held, the two  sides should realize the exchange of special envoys of the  highest level leaders of the North and the South within the next  few days.    At the contact, the South side, however, declined to clear  its stance on the principled demands of our side from the  beginning, in a bid to justify its unreasonable stance toward  dialogue, the South side rep.    In connection with this, our side asked whether the South  side truly has the intention to realize the exchange of special  envoys and repeatedly urged it to clear its stance toward our  just demands.    Our side, most of all, stressed that a hostile large-scale  nuclear war exercise is the biggest stumbling block lying in the  way of exchanging special envoys and that the South side is  assuming a stance of wait-and-see by saying empty words about  suspending the Team Spirit nuclear war exercise, violating the  DPRK-U.S. agreement. Our side pointed out that the South side,  moreover, attempts to stage another large-scale nuclear war  exercise.    Our side said that the South side should give deep  thought as to what grave consequence the large-scale nuclear war  exercise would bring to the nation if the South side enforces  such a nuclear war exercise against us, and urged the South side  to make clear without delay its clear position, in the first  place, on suspending all hostile large-scale nuclear war  exercises for the survival of the dialogue and the nation.    Our side noted that the international joint cooperation  system is not aimed at realizing the denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula, but is, instead, the system of harming the  nation and hurting the national interests in collusion with the  outside forces [urichugun namchugi chuguhango innun kukje  kongjocheje yoksi minjogul sallinun tuksa kyohwangwa choltaero  yangnip toelsu opsumyo, kugosun choson pandoui pihaekhwarul  silhyonhagi wihangosi anira, oesewa hanchagi toeo minjogui iigul  haechiryonun minjok mohae chejerago chijok haessumnida]. Our  side stressed that the South side should abandon the policy of  depending on outside force and return to the true road for the  nation.    Our side also noted that the South side's attempt to bring  in  such modern weapons as Patriot missiles is an open threat to the  dialogue partner, and stressed that if the South side continues  bringing in war equipment and force confrontation despite the  consistent protests and denunciations of the people at home and  abroad, not only the exchange of special envoys but also the  situation on the Korean peninsula will proceed along toward a  grave phase which no one can predict.    Our side noted the fact that the South side, which absurdly  took a dialogue-negating position in the past, saying that it  cannot shake hands with the other side which has a nuclear  weapon, is now mentioning the exchange of special envoys, saying  that it cannot consider that we have a nuclear weapon. Our side  then said that if the South side has the true desire to conduct  the exchange of special envoys and the summit talks [choegowikup  hoedam] with us, it should not shake hands with the outside  forces with nuclear weapons but with the fellow countrymen  without nuclear weapons.    Saying that the North and the South are flesh and blood and  fellow countrymen despite the difference in ideology and system,  our side strongly urged the South side to make a decision to  make a new start from the position of national independence and  great national unity, in conformity with the demand of the  present situation, instead of making the nation victimized by  the outside forces. The South could not make any reply to this.    The two sides decided to further study the other side's  position and plan and discusst them at the next contact. The  two sides agreed to have the fifth working-level delegates'  contact at Tongilgak in our side's area of Panmunjom on 9 March.</p>

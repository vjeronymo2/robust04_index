			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEFENSE CLAIMS IT WOULD BE A 'CRUEL HOAX' TO DENY HEARING TO HARRIS  </P> <P> Responding to prosecutors' claims that Robert Alton Harris should die, defense  attorneys insisted Monday in a fat legal brief that the condemned murderer  instead is due a hearing on his new claim that mental disorders drove him to  kill two teen-age San Diego boys.  </P> <P> Without that hearing, Harris' San Diego defense lawyers said, the federal  Constitution's promise of a fair trial "will be a cruel hoax."  </P> <P> The legal papers, filed late Monday with the San Francisco-based U.S. 9th  Circuit Court of Appeals, were the last scheduled briefs ordered by the  intermediate-level appellate court before it conducts oral argument May 14 on  Harris' new claim.  </P> <P> The papers, filed in response to a brief that state prosecutors filed last  week, center on the same arguments that persuaded 9th Circuit Judge John T.  Noonan to stay Harris' scheduled April 3 execution -- with only four days to  spare -- to allow Harris' bid for a fact-finding hearing.  </P> <P> Harris, whose case has progressed farther through the court system than that of  any of the other more than 270 prisoners on Death Row, had been in line to  become the first person executed in California in 23 years.  </P> <P> Harris, 37, was convicted and sentenced to death for the July, 1978, murders of  Michael Baker and John Mayeski, both 16, of San Diego. He killed the boys after  stealing their car for use in a bank robbery.  </P> <P> The California Supreme Court upheld Harris' death sentence in 1981, and since  then has consistently rejected his appeals.  </P> <P> Although, in an April 2 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed Noonan's  decision to block the execution indefinitely, it has rejected Harris' appeals  four times, most recently on Jan. 16.  </P> <P> In the new appeal, defense lawyers Charles M. Sevilla and Michael McCabe claim  that Harris suffers from mental disorders -- including damage to the part of  the brain that controls impulse -- that affected him and impulsively drove him  through the killings.  </P> <P> Michael Laurence of San Francisco, an ACLU attorney and death-penalty expert,  also has taken part in the new appeal.  </P> <P> Evidence of those disorders, the lawyers said, was not presented to the jury  that sentenced Harris to death in 1979 because the two psychiatrists who  examined him did not do a good job. The jury should have heard that evidence,  the attorneys said.  </P> <P> In the brief they filed last week, prosecutors said Harris' new contentions are  "ridiculous" and urged a three-judge 9th Circuit panel to reject his challenge.  If Harris' position were upheld, they said, the result would be "unending  litigation to challenge the competence of previous (psychiatric) experts."  </P> <P> Prosecutors contended that Harris got what he had coming to him -- access to an  examination by psychiatrists who were known to be competent. In the brief filed  Monday, however, the defense attorneys repeated their claim that what he should  have received, but did not, was a competent examination by each of the two  psychiatrists.  </P> <P> Without "some assurance that the psychiatrist will perform competently,"  defense lawyers said, "there can be no fair access."  </P> <P> Defense lawyers also repeated their request that, should the 9th Circuit grant  Harris a hearing, which would be held in federal court in San Diego, it be  reassigned to someone other than U.S. District Judge William B. Enright.  </P> <P> In ruling for the third time against Harris, Enright said last March that the  defense team was "professionally not responsible" in bringing the new appeal.  To ensure the "appearance of justice," the case should be reassigned, the  defense lawyers said Monday.  </P> <P> The 9th Circuit panel that will hear oral argument in San Francisco consists of  Noonan and Judges Arthur L. Alarcon and Melvin Brunetti.  </P></p>

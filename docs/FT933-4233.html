			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei cautious as Hong Kong sets record INCREASING caution following a spate of downward corporate earnings revisions depressed activity, and the Nikkei average lost marginal ground, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index ended 43.91 easier at 20,918.19, its third consecutive decline. Small-lot selling by individuals, investment trusts and securities houses pulled the index down. Investors reacted to Tuesday's announcement by Nippon Steel, which now expects to fall into a loss for the current business year. The index slipped to the day's low of 20,816.78 in the morning. However, afternoon support from arbitrage-linked buying pushed it up to the session's high of 20,996.50. Volume totalled 298m shares, against Tuesday's 251m. Foreign investors, who had previously been active buyers, held the sidelines. Declines outscored rises by 586 to 391, with 193 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 6.96 at 1,682.82, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.09 to 1,288.57. Reports that Nikko Kyodo, a leading mining and oil refiner, had decided to liquidate its US subsidiaries depressed sentiment. The company expects to post losses of Y90bn due to the liquidation. Nikko Kyodo was the most active issue of the day, falling Y35 to Y510. Other oil issues fared poorly, with Mitsubishi Oil shedding Y20 to Y1,030 and Showa Shell Sekiyu Y10 to Y1,260. Steel companies were weak on the unexpected downward earnings revision by Nippon Steel, announced on Tuesday. The company said it would skip its interim dividend and would post a pre-tax loss of Y15bn for the current year to next March. Other leading steel issues, including Kobe Steel, NKK, Kawasaki Steel and Sumitomo Metal Industries, are scheduled to make similar announcements tomorrow. Nippon Steel retreated Y7 to Y360 and Kobe Steel declined Y9 to Y308. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y11,000 to Y930,000, declining for the fifth trading day in a row. The company said it would cut its long distance call rates, and it revised down its revenue for the current year by Y100bn. Ink and printing concerns were higher. Dainippon Ink moved up Y4 to Y544 and Dai Nippon Printing gained Y20 at Y1,710. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 47.09 to 22,871.14 in volume of 38m shares. Trading remained inactive ahead of Friday's settlements for September futures and options contracts. Roundup MIXED messages emerged from Pacific Rim markets. HONG KONG investors decided that they had been marking time for long enough and a wave of afternoon buying took the Hang Seng index up 60.42 to a record close of 7,607.13. The rise came as Sino-British friction took a back seat to comments by Mr Zhu Rongji, the Chinese vice-premier, that the country's economic growth was likely to be 13 per cent this year, in spite of the current austerity policy. Hopewell, the most active issue, advanced 20 cents to HKDollars 5.50 and was followed by Jardine Matheson, which gained HKDollars 2.50 at HKDollars 65. Hong Kong Electric moved ahead 60 cents to HKDollars 21.40. MANILA was helped by heavy foreign buying of Manila Electric, and the composite index rose 4.28 to 1,886.28. NEW ZEALAND benefited from better than expected Air New Zealand results, enabling the NZSE-40 capital index to overcome early weakness and close 4.56 higher at 2,000.35. Air New Zealand rose 13 cents to a year's peak of NZDollars 2.75. AUSTRALIA took its lead from the sharp falls on Wall Street and in the bullion price, and shares were marked lower from the opening. Some support emerged for blue chips at noon before investors again took profits towards the close. The All Ordinaries index finished 28.3, or 1.4 per cent, lower at 1,939.5, while the golds marker ended 127.8, or 7 per cent, down at 1,897.2. Among gold stocks, North Flinders Mines shed 70 cents to ADollars 12.50 and Plutonic Resources fell 31 cents to ADollars 6.60. SINGAPORE was lower for the second consecutive day as profits were again taken after the recent sharp rises. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 7.74 to 2,028.96.</p>

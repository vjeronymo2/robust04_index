			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREEDOMS  </P> <P> Sherry Jeffe in her column ("Children Unborn," Opinion, Sept. 3) portrays the  upcoming elections as a single-issue campaign dominated by abortion. True,  women and men have responded to the heavy-handed attempts of the New Right to  curtail freedoms with a backlash of their own. But the pro-choice debate  reflects only one facet of that backlash.  </P> <P> One cannot hold an anti-choice view without embodying a repressive attitude  toward freedom generally and women's rights particularly. So a pro-choice vote  chooses more than a pro-choice candidate and rejects more than back-alley  abortions. It rejects the chest-pounding attitudes and self-congratulatory  solutions of exclusion, curtailment, control, force, and domination responsible  for seemingly unrelated decisions like funding cutbacks for health care and the  arts and the erosion of civil rights. The issue of deteriorating freedoms  provides much of the underlying strength of the pro-choice movement.  Legislators who ignore that fact will misjudge its force -- and we'll be better  off without them.  </P> <P> KATE McFADDEN  </P> <P> Arcadia  </P></p>

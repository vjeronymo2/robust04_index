			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEXAS AIR LOSS WIDENS TO $885.6 MILLION IN '89;  </P> <P> AIRLINES: CONTINENTAL TURNED A $3.1-MILLION PROFIT FOR THE YEAR. EASTERN LOST  $852.3 MILLION.  </P> <P> Texas Air Corp., the nation's largest airline company, said Tuesday that it  lost $362.8 million in the fourth quarter of 1989 as subsidiaries Eastern  Airlines and Continental Airlines both posted losses.  </P> <P> Texas Air's deficit was widened from a net loss of $224.4 million in the fourth  quarter of 1988.  </P> <P> The latest quarterly loss pushed Texas Air's loss for 1989 to $885.6 million --  a record high for the U.S. airline industry. That compared to its 1988 loss of  $718.6 million.  </P> <P> Fourth-quarter revenue fell to $1.7 billion from $2 billion. For the full year,  Texas Air's revenue was $6.7 billion, down from $8.6 billion in 1988.  </P> <P> The October-December figures include a $56.1-million net loss for Houston-based  Continental, narrowed from a $99.2-million loss in fourth quarter 1988.  Continental's fourth-quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, up from $1.1 billion.  </P> <P> For the year, Continental turned a $3.1-million profit, reversing a  $315.5-million loss for 1988.

"In addition,  given the significantly negative factors affecting all airlines in the fourth  quarter, Continental stands out as the only major carrier showing marked  improvement in year-over-year fourth-quarter results."  </P> <P> Continental's figures included one-time net gains of $81.2 million from asset  sales and $10.6 million in retired debt.  </P> <P> Miami-based Eastern, which is reorganizing under federal bankruptcy court  supervision, showed a fourth-quarter net loss of $282.6 million on revenue of  $482.2 million.

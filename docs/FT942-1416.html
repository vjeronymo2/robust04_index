			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / MP warns on regional aid cuts The long-term future of international companies' plants in England may be jeopardised if the government cuts the regional aid it offers them to upgrade their facilities, Mr Doug Henderson, Labour MP for Newcastle North, warned yesterday. Mr Henderson said a foreign-owned company with a plant in his constituency had approached him for help after being told by the Department of Trade and Industry in the past week that its application for Regional Selective Assistance had been rejected. He said the benefits of attracting international companies making products for worldwide markets could be undermined if they found that further investment, needed to maintain a competitive edge, did not win government backing. He has told the DTI of his concerns and will next week table parliamentary questions, asking if the government is seeking to cut its regional aid budget. He said: 'If companies like the one in my constituency feel they are not getting the regional support they did in the past, and the support they could get in other European countries, they will be less inclined to invest in the future and that could mean jobs will be undermined.' On Wednesday, the DTI confirmed that it was tightening the allocation of RSA grants for projects in England, as part of public spending constraints. It was also placing greater emphasis on the quality of jobs the projects would create. The clampdown, which affects foreign investors and indigenous companies, is causing concern among economic regeneration bodies. Mr Henderson said the company in his constituency, which he declined to name, had received RSA in the past. It is understood it was seeking a seven-figure sum this time. The proposed investment included equipment modernisation and increased research and development. The company was a world leader in its field, yet had been told its project showed insufficient regard for skilling and high technology. The MP said the company had told him an estimated 30 companies in north-east England had been rejected for RSA recently. The DTI said it could not comment on individual applications on grounds of commercial confidentiality.</p>

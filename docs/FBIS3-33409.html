			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] (Francisco Jovel Roberto Roca), one of the  highest leaders of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front], has claimed that weapons seized from the FMLN during the  war have turned up in Chiapas State, Mexico. In addition, he  noted his concern that those weapons will fuel crime and  international gunrunning. "We continue to insist the government  has not given a satisfactory explanation of the weapons,  thousands of rifles and other war material, it seized from the  FMLN, which the Army has not shown nor have they allowed the  government to have some control over the number of weapons,"  Roca indicated. Regarding FMLN concerns, he said "for us, that  is very dangerous because we have learned that weapons of that  kind were found in Chiapas. Weapons that the Army reported  capturing from the FMLN have turned up elsewhere. We are  concerned that those weapons are serving to fuel gunrunning in  the region." [passage omitted] Roca affirmed international  institutions share the FMLN concerns. "We have talked at length  with different government representatives. We insist, however,  that the Salvadoran Government, in a stubborn manner that does  not contribute to peace, is refusing to allow an inspection of  those weapons." FMLN leaders dismissed reports it supplied  weapons to Mexico's Zapatist National Liberation Army. [passage  omitted]    Roca also denied there are armed groups unhappy with the  elections results. Commenting on this matter, he noted that  "they can say anything, but the truth has prevailed over any  kind of campaign they may conduct along those lines. There are  no weighty reasons that can justify the government's  speculation. It will be just the opposite because the elections  will hand the FMLN a significant share of institutional power,  if not the majority, in the political environment, and just  about all those who were active during the war and the many  thousands who have joined the FMLN now as a political force know  that."    Roca reiterated that the weapons topic is "simply and  plainly  a propaganda tactic used to hurt the Front at the polls. In  fact, they, the ones who are orchestrating this campaign, know  full well that what they are saying is a big lie, but these  people are used to conducting campaigns on what they refer to as  psychological warfare. They have not given up on that effort,  which is regrettable, is it not?"</p>

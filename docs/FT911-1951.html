			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (31): Guardian of the reforms - What has happened to Solidarity?  FT writers trace the evolution of the movement and discuss the future of trade unions / The resignation of Lech Walesa, so long the symbol of Solidarity, to take up the post of president of Poland, was a turning point for the union SOLIDARITY, the alliance of workers and intellectuals that was born in Gdansk's Lenin shipyard in 1980 and helped to oust communism across eastern Europe, has been forced to re-examine its role in the new democratic Poland. It has decided to return to its roots as a trade union. The election of computer scientist Marian Krzaklewski as Solidarity's new chairman, at its February congress, was seen as an endorsement of that move. Mr Krzaklewski said in his speech to the congress: 'I am convinced that the union chairman should remain outside political arrangements and pressures by various political centres.' The resignation of Lech Walesa, so long the symbol of Solidarity, to take up the post of president of Poland, was a turning point for the union. Mr Slawomir Rogucki, secretary of Solidarity's newly-created presidium, admits the union finds itself in a contradictory position. 'On the one hand, it has to be a union, and its charter says it has to defend the workers. On the other, Solidarity is still responsible for the fate of the reforms started two years ago,' he says. 'It's difficult to reconcile these two different roles, especially in a situation where the quality of life of many workers has fallen.' This can bring the union into conflict with the government. Solidarity is, for example, pressing for the abolition of the punitive tax on excessive wage increases - which has resulted in workers' wages falling in real terms  -in the second half of this year, with enterprises allowed to link tax-exempt wage increases with higher productivity. The wage tax is a pillar of the finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz's anti-inflation policy, the backbone of his whole economic programme. As many people have suffered under the Balcerowicz plan, the pro-communist trade union OPZZ and what Mr Rogucki describes as the 'post-communist forces' still enjoy support in Poland. 'They use populist slogans,' Mr Rogucki says. 'They don't feel responsible for the state of the country.' In the light of this threat, Solidarity feels it cannot relinquish its role as guardian of the reforms until Poland has reached full parliamentary democracy. 'We started this process, we have to finish it. But we don't wish to usurp the right of the government to rule. We don't wish to dominate. Solidarity must point out the mistakes of the government,' Mr Rogucki says. The difficulty is finding the balance, and not hindering the growth of opposition parties. Mr Rogucki points out that in a state conditioned to one-party rule, there is a danger that Solidarity might come to be regarded automatically as the sole power. Despite arguments from some delegates that Solidarity should take full responsibility for the reform process in Poland, and field candidates for all seats in the parliament, the union eventually voted to participate in the elections later this year, but not field enough candidates to risk winning an overall majority. It will, however, support the political parties that have grown out of it. Mr Rogucki sees Solidarity remaining as a single, united movement, rather than splitting into separate unions representing different trades and professions, although it is to be restructured. Fifteen different trade secretariats, with secretaries belonging to a national executive committee, will replace the current structure of 100-plus regional organisations.</p>

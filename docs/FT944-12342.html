			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Waldegrave defends milk change Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, yesterday defended deregulation of the milk market as more supermarket groups marked up the price of a pint by at least 2p. Mr Waldegrave said the move to a free market inevitably meant 'winners and losers', but the new arrangements were already 'releasing the creative energies of the industry'. He added: 'I believe that in a comparatively short time the change which has taken place will be seen in a more positive light.' The statutory Milk Marketing Board, sole buyer of milk from farmers for 61 years, was replaced yesterday by a powerful producers' co-operative, Milk Marque, which has won control of two-thirds of supplies in England and Wales. Retailers yesterday blamed their higher prices on the increased cost of milk supplied by Milk Marque to dairy manufacturers. Sainsbury, the biggest supermarket group, joined Tesco in raising milk prices to 28p a pint, and said butter and cheese prices would also be going up. Safeway put its price up to 29p a pint, but will lower it to 28p today 'to remain competitive'. Asda, the superstore chain, said its four-pint cartons were rising by 9p, or 2.25p a pint, to 92p because the new system had increase prices by 10 per cent. Mrs Gillian Shephard, former agriculture minister, said in June when she approved the new arrangements that consumers should not expect to pay more for milk. The agriculture ministry now says the increased prices charged to dairy companies by Milk Marque should add no more than 0.5p to a pint. But Mr Waldegrave denied yesterday there had been a shift in the government's view of the benefits of deregulation. 'It's never comfortable in the short term as you move into a new era of competition,' he said. 'But I'm a firm believer that competition is the best way in the long term of benefiting consumer interests.' His comments failed to placate the newly named Dairy Industry Federation, which represents milk processors. It is preparing to submit its case claiming abuse of monopoly power by Milk Marque to the Office of Fair Trading. Industry analysts expect the rise in milk prices to be short-lived. They say prices could fall as early as next year under pressure from an increase in milk on the European market resulting from the Gatt world trade deal, which will limit dairy exports and increase imports into the EU.

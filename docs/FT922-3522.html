			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / FT Law Report: Bank should explain documents BARCLAYS BANK PLC v O'BRIEN Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Purchas, Lord Justice Butler-Sloss and Lord Justice Scott): May 22 1992 A BANK seeking to procure a wife's signature as her husband's surety must take reasonable steps to try and ensure that she understands the effect of signing; and if it fails to take such steps it cannot enforce the security against her on the grounds only that the husband, in deceiving her into signing, was not acting as its agent. The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by Mrs NE O'Brien from a decision of Judge Marder QC that the plaintiff, Barclays Bank plc, was entitled to enforce a mortgage document signed by her to secure her husband's guarantee. LORD JUSTICE SCOTT said Mr and Mrs O'Brien were married in 1963. Their matrimonial home was in Slough. They purchased it with a Pounds 25,000 mortgage. Mr O'Brien had an interest in a company called Heathrow Fabrications and was its auditor. The manager of the Slough branch of Barclays Bank was Mr Roger Tucker. In February 1987 he was transferred to Woolwich. The company's account was transferred to Woolwich to be supervised by Mr Tucker. The company had an overdraft which, in April 1987, was agreed at Pounds 60,000. By June 15 it had risen to over Pounds 98,000. Cheques were being bounced. On June 22 it was agreed between Mr Tucker and Mr O'Brien that the company would be allowed a facility of Pounds 135,000 reducing to Pounds 120,000 after three weeks, guaranteed by Mr O'Brien. His liability was to be secured by a second charge over the house. Mr Tucker gave instructions for the necessary security documents to be prepared. He sent them to the Burnham branch (a sub-branch of Slough) to await signature by Mr and Mrs O'Brien. He instructed the sub-branch to advise Mr and Mrs O'Brien that the maximum facilities would be Pounds 135,000, to ensure that they were fully aware of the nature of the documentation, and to advise that if in doubt they should contact their solicitors before signing. Mr O'Brien signed on July 1. On July 2 he brought his wife to the sub-branch. The clerk failed to follow Mr Tucker's instructions. Mrs O'Brien signed. The clerk witnessed her signature. No explanation of the documents or their effect was given. She did not read the documents before signing. No one recommended that she should obtain legal advice. By October the indebtedness was over Pounds 154,000 and in November formal demand was served on Mr O'Brien under the guarantee. Mr O'Brien's liability was established by Judge Marder's judgment in the court below. He did not appeal. Mrs O'Brien did not fit the now rather outmoded pattern of down-trodden wife subservient to her husband. The judge said Mr O'Brien falsely represented to her that the charge was limited to secure Pounds 60,000 and would be released in a short time. Her evidence was that she was reluctant to put the family home at risk, but her husband insisted that she must sign. He told her it was only for three weeks. He became extremely emotional and said that if she did not sign the whole company would go bankrupt and their son would lose his home as well. Mrs O'Brien was concerned for her son and felt that, if it was only for three weeks and would do the trick, she would sign. She went to the bank where the documents were laid out for signing. She did not read them. They had been folded back to show the places to be signed. The principal reason the judge found in favour of the bank against Mrs O'Brien was that there was no evidence that in deceiving his wife Mr O'Brien was acting on behalf of the bank. For historical reasons equity in the past treated married women differently and more tenderly than other third parties who provided security for the debts of others. The authorities preceding Avon Finance v Bridger (1985) 2 AllER 281 did not depend on endowing the husband with the status of creditor's agent. Married women who provided security for their husbands' debts were treated as a special protected class of surety. Avon added to the protected class a case in which vulnerable elderly parents had agreed to provide security for the debts of their adult son. Post-Avon cases were not easy to reconcile with one another. In neither Kings North Trust (1986) 1 WLR 119 nor Barclays Bank v Kennedy (FT, November 15, 1988) was there any explicit finding that the debtor was acting as agent for the creditor. In cases falling within the protected class, security given by the surety would in certain circumstances be unenforceable notwithstanding that the creditor might have no knowledge of and not have been responsible for the vitiating feature of the transaction. That was supported by Turnbull v Duval (1902) AC 329; Chaplin v Brammall (1908) 1 KB 233; Avon Finance; Kings North Trust and Barclays Bank v Kennedy. In cases falling within the protected class equity would hold the security given by the surety to be unenforceable by the creditor if: (1) the relationship between the debtor and the surety and the consequent likelihood of influence and reliance was known to the creditor; (2) the surety's consent to the transaction was procured by undue influence or material misrepresentation on the debtor's part, and the surety lacked adequate understanding of the nature and effect of the transaction; (3) the creditor failed to take reasonable steps to try and ensure that the surety entered into the transaction with adequate understanding of its nature and effect and that the surety's consent was true and informed. Those requirements emerged from the authorities. The position of married women today was very different from what it was when the equitable principles underlying Turnbull v Duval and Chaplin v Brammall were being formulated. It was arguable that married women no longer needed protection. Many women did not. But in the culturally and ethnically mixed community in which we now lived, the degree of emancipation for women was uneven. Reliance by a wife on her husband to make the business decisions for the family was the justification for the tenderness of equity towards married women. That justification was still present. The old authorities pre-Avon Finance v Bridger were still good law. Each case within the protected class must depend on its own facts. But a clear written recommendation to the surety to take independent advice before signing would be advisable in most cases. If a creditor had taken reasonable steps, such as advising the surety to take independent advice or offering a fair explanation of the document before the surety signed it, there was no reason why equity should intervene. The judge rightly declined to find Mr O'Brien had been appointed the bank's agent. Mr Tucker's instructions to the sub-branch made it clear that the bank was retaining the responsibility of explaining to Mrs O'Brien the effect and nature of the documents she was to sign. The question was whether the bank took reasonable steps to try and ensure that she had an adequate comprehension of the effect of the charge. It did not. If Mr Tucker's instructions to the sub-branch had been carried out the answer would have been otherwise. Mr O'Brien was not the bank's agent, but the equitable principles established in the authorities required that creditors who took from married women security for their husbands' debts should take reasonable steps to see that they understood the transactions they were entering into. In view of Mrs O'Brien's misunderstanding of the transaction, it was not enforceable against her, save to the extent of Pounds 60,000. The appeal was allowed. Lord Justice Butler-Sloss agreed. Lord Justice Purchas gave a concurring judgment. For Mrs O'Brien: Simon Buckhaven (Stops &amp; Burton, Daventry). For the bank: Philip Goodenday (Harry I Alkin &amp; Co).</p>

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Advice for Nato's former enemies NATO'S FORMER adversaries will receive advice in meetings in London and Brussels this week on how to run western-style defence ministries and convert their bloated defence industries to civilian use. Senior defence officials, military officers and parliamentarians from the former Warsaw Pact are attending a seminar in London today and tomorrow on managing defence in a democratic system. The meeting could lead to secondment of UK staff to eastern European capitals. It has been organised by the UK Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence and Royal United Services Institute as part of a co-operation process launched by Nato late last year. Talks will focus on issues of budgetary and parliamentary control and will include discussions on the handling of last year's Gulf campaign and on Northern Ireland - an area where the relationship between civil and military powers is, to say the least, problematic. A further three-day seminar is set for Nato headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss defence conversion.</p>

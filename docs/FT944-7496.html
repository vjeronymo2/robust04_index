			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Granada focuses on expansion The Granada group is considering expansion in continental Europe through acquisitions in catering and services. The new focus was revealed yesterday as the television, leisure and services group announced a record pre-tax profit of Pounds 265m for the 52 weeks to October 1 - a rise of 51 per cent. Granada, following the failure of its attempts to acquire Gardner Merchant, the catering group, is faced with the prospect of increasing profits and a debt-free business within three years if it makes no new significant acquisitions. Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive, said: 'We might look at European motorways, European catering businesses and public catering.' The group, one of the largest ITV companies owning Granada Television and London Weekend Television, can add little to its UK television interests without a change in regulations. Mr Robinson said: 'The most likely outcome is that we don't have acquisitions over the next 18 months. I would like that not to be true but it will only not be true if we find the right thing.' He conceded the company might have to return more money to shareholders if the right deals do not come along. Yesterday Granada reported strong growth both in its existing businesses and in the year's two most recent large acquisitions - Sutcliffe Catering and LWT. Mr Robinson was bullish about the future. He said the company looked forward to 1995 with confidence 'in our ability to improve margins and with expectation that our own capacity to generate organic growth from our principal businesses will be enhanced by an improving economy'. Turnover rose 30 per cent to Pounds 2.09bn and operating profit grew by 46 per cent to Pounds 299m. Fully diluted earnings per share rose29 per cent to 32p. The dividend was lifted 14 per cent to 10p. If the British Sky Broadcasting flotation goes ahead at the mid-price Granada will get rid of around Pounds 120m in contingency liabilities plus a total of around Pounds 40m in cash. Some analysts are now looking for around Pounds 317m in profit in the current financial year. Yesterday Granada shares closed unchanged at 516p, after touching a high of 524p earlier in the day.

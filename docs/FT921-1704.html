			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment: Nordic Countries (13): Monetary stability sought - Iceland: The economy ICELAND'S financial system may not yet have gone so far in a liberalising direction as the other countries of the Nordic region but like them it has also embarked on an intense period of deregulation as it prepares to converge with the European Community's single integrated market. Unlike the rest of the non-EC Nordic countries Iceland is unlikely to seek full EC membership in the near future. However it does hope to benefit from the creation of the 19-nation European Economic Area (EEA) which is expected to integrate the economies of the EC with those of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) from January 1 1993. Iceland is set to gain 96 per cent customs-free access for its fish products in that wider market and, as fish accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the country's exports, it remains vital that the EEA works. The most important financial change for Iceland concerns the relationship of its currency to those of western Europe. The Icelandic government announced last October that since two thirds of the country's foreign trade was with the EC and European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries, and the other Nordic nations had pegged their currencies to the European Currency Unit, it intended to link the Icelandic krona to the Ecu as well - but not until 1993. The first step was taken last month when Iceland's exchange rate basket was reduced from 17 to three currencies consisting of the Ecu, the American dollar and the Japanese yen with a relative weight of 76 per cent, 18 per cent and 6 per cent respectively. The government is also taking the first steps in the development of a foreign exchange market for Iceland with powers being given to the country's central bank to intervene and adjust the krona's daily exchange rate. A new Central Bank Act is being prepared which will also enable the bank to influence short-term market interest rates. The government is apparently firm in its commitment to the establishment of Icelandic monetary stability, an objective that has proved hard to achieve. For most of the past 20 years, the economy has suffered from the consequences of high inflation. Stagnating export prices for fish in the late 1980s undermined efforts to uphold the value of the krona and forced the government into periodic devaluations to strengthen Iceland's balance of payments and secure some market advantage for the vulnerable fishing industry. But since December 1989 the average exchange rate of the Icelandic krona has remained stable. The present Icelandic government appears determined to stick to its objective of monetary stability even if this has meant carrying out increasingly unpopular economic policies that are squeezing real disposable income and increasing registered unemployment. Restrictive monetary measures have helped to keep down the annual rate of inflation to single figures in 1991 for the second consecutive year - quite an achievement for an economy that has had to live with an annual inflation rate of 20-30 per cent since 1983. Forecasts for this year suggest Iceland will maintain its relatively low inflation rate at about 2.5 per cent. If this happens, it will take the country below the inflation average in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, an unfamiliar experience for Iceland. But other economic indicators look grim. A 4.1 per cent cut in the country's gross national product is expected this year with a 6.1 per cent decline in national income which would be the biggest drop since 1950 and the fifth successive year of stagnation. The current account deficit is expected to amount to 4-5 per cent of Iceland's gross national product while the 1992 budget deficit will amount to 2.4 per cent of GNP; the same as last year. The outlook for the all-important fishing industry is murky. Reduced fish quotas are expected to lead to a 9 per cent decline in fish exports. At the same time, the indefinite postponement announced last November in the long-expected Atlantal project to build an aluminium plant in Iceland producing 200,000 tons a year has hit hopes of economic diversification. The lifting of controls on Iceland's financial system really gathered pace after the mid-1980s with an important step being taken in August 1990 when restrictions were lifted on long-term outward capital movements. There has been the emergence of mutual funds and leasing companies and the development of a securities exchange. The commercial banks themselves have also gone through a radical reorganisation through merger and amalgamation as their number has been reduced from seven to three. There are plans to change the Agricultural Bank into a limited company with the state's shares being offered to the public. But the opening up of Iceland to outside financial influences has led to some criticism from those who fear the small economy will be submerged as a result. This is why the Icelandic government continues to be much more cautious than its Nordic neighbours in its slow but steady move to greater liberalisation. Last March, for example, new legislation was introduced to encourage foreign direct investment into Iceland but it was made clear that only Icelanders or domestically registered companies had access to the country's fishing grounds and primary fish processing industry. Again, foreigners cannot acquire the right to harness waterfalls and geo-thermal energy. And non-residents must not acquire more than a 49 per cent stake in Iceland's domestic airlines. Investment by foreigners in domestic incorporated commercial banks is also restricted to 25 per cent although foreign commercial banks have been free to open branches from the beginning of this year.</p>

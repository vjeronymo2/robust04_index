			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS  </P> <P> Lincoln Kaplan has it all wrong when he states that Supreme Court Justices  William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun are the most sensitive to  "individual rights" (Opinion, Dec. 18). He is correct in saying these justices  care more about the individual criminal's rights than individual victim's  rights.  </P> <P> They don't care much about the individual's rights to a drug-free school or  neighborhood. If said justices will drop their invented and contorted  constitutional interpretations defending the rights to drugs and crime, then  inner-city residents can really get on with the job of reclaiming their  neighborhoods from the criminals.  </P> <P> JAY DAVIS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

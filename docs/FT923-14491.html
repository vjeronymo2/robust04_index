			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Financial profits set to account for half of Siemens' earnings SIEMENS is on target for an 8 per cent rise in net profits to at least DM1.9bn (Dollars 1.2bn) this financial year, but is feeling the impact of weak economic growth in important markets, said Mr Karl-Hermann Baumann, finance director. Around half of the German electrical and electronics group's earnings for the financial year to end-September 1992 would again come from financial profits on large holdings of cash and securities, he said. Operating profits of Siemens' industrial activities showed highly different trends, with some producing losses and others benefiting from a healthy order inflow. He declined to forecast the operating profits trend for the full year - in 1990-1991 lower operating profits were more than offset by higher financial earnings - noting that while some areas like telecommunications were making higher profits, semiconductors, computers and the US businesses were in the red. He said losses at Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme (SNI), formed by the acquisition of the ailing Nixdorf computers, were coming down more slowly than hoped. Semiconductors would show a higher loss because of the weak trend in the industry. In the US, losses would be higher, mainly due to the slow recovery from recession there. The German economy was also feeling the impact of weakness in foreign markets. But Mr Karlheinz Kaske, chief executive, said there had been 'a surge of business' from east Germany for modernisation of the infrastructure. 'This more than compensated for weakness in the standard products sector, which is still suffering the effects of a stagnating international economy,' he told the half-yearly press conference. However, Siemens' worldwide labour force of 415,000 people would tend to decline in the face of poorer orders in some sectors. Siemens has already reported an 8 per cent rise to DM859m in earnings for the first six months. Mr Kaske, who will be succeeded on his retirement in October by Mr Heinrich von Pierer, said its rail, automation, automobile electronics, telecommunications, power generation, and medical technology activities were all performing well. New orders rose by 5 per cent in the first eight months to DM57bn, with turnover up by 7 per cent to DM48bn. Mr Kaske repeated his forecast that turnover would show a gain of some 8 per cent to DM80bn for the full year, with new orders 4 per cent higher at DM86bn.</p>

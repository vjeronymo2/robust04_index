			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER THE GOLD;  </P> <P> BOXER TRIES TO COPE WITH SHADOWS ON CAREER  </P> <P> Anyone in this town should know better than to bet on a sure thing.  </P> <P> Here's the sure thing: a great young boxer, one of three U.S. gold medalists at  the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Discharged from the Army and marries his sweetheart.  Wins, easily, his first four pro bouts. Considered the best pro prospect from  the class of 1988. At 23, no history of any problems with drugs or the law.  </P> <P> So, do you bet on Kennedy McKinney or do you pass? Is he too good to be true or  is he the real thing?  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the bizarre story of McKinney's life since winning the gold  medal, the improbable last 12 months, is nothing new.  </P> <P> When the boxer tells of a gradual slide into drinking and eventual cocaine use,  it is as familiar as today's news. When he says he disappeared for three days  to take care of some personal business, it's not surprising. When he tells of  his arrest for something he didn't do, we nod knowingly. Of course.  </P> <P> So far have athletes fallen in our moral expectations these days that little  they may do is shocking. Promising athletes fall off the end of the earth with  such frequency that no one seems to miss them anymore.  </P> <P> That is why the story of Kennedy McKinney is trite. He is a living cliche. All  that is left is for him to announce soon that he has blown all his money,  pawned his gold medal and will soon be checking into a convenient alley.  </P> <P> To listen and believe McKinney's story and its well-marked trail of coincidence  requires a leap of faith. Or at least a suspension of the cynicism that is easy  to assume.  </P> <P> Still, he says he is one fighter who desperately does not want his life to be a  cliche. He apparently has a fight on his hands.  </P> <P> "Over in Korea, I put it in my mind: There was only one way I could come back  successful, and that was to win a gold medal. The training and dedication I put  into that was really unbelievable. Staying away from the partying and the  drinking. Going to bed on time, getting up on time. Eating the right thing. So,  there was no way I could lose, no way. I could have beat the world at that  point in time -- which I did."  </P> <P> McKinney was sitting in his attorney's office this week, trying to come up with  some coherence for his falling into cliche No. 1.  </P> <P> "Working so hard to get the gold medal, and being so determined . . . when I  got back it was party time. That's basically what it came down to. I just  partied a little too much," he said.  </P> <P> "I wasn't much of a party type until then. When I came back, it was just time  to party with the guys. Either they had tried out for the (Olympics) or they  had seen me on TV. It was there waiting on me, I guess. It was beer drinking  and going out to the clubs. Going out and having fun with your friends until 3  or 4. At that time I didn't have to be in (at a certain time. But) I had to be  in because I had a fiancee and I couldn't neglect her."  </P> <P> McKinney's life moved willy-nilly. He married and signed a pro contract two  months after returning to Killeen, Tex., where he had trained as a bantamweight  for the Army boxing team stationed at Ft. Hood. McKinney signed with manager  Fred Glusman for a $65,000 bonus.  </P> <P> He moved here in January.  </P> <P> "The party just kept going," he said. "I was enjoying it. I felt I owed it to  myself. It did get out of hand. It started in Texas, I guess you could say I  brought it here.  </P> <P> "Once we started getting into the gym, it didn't come to a screeching halt. It  slowed up a lot. It was like we ran into a school zone. That came from me. I  knew that my professional debut was coming up now, I wanted to look good."  </P> <P> McKinney had his pro debut Feb. 24 on the undercard of the Iran Barkley-Roberto  Duran fight in Atlantic City, N.J. He scored a second-round knockout.  </P> <P> And in his second fight, McKinney had an even easier time.  </P> <P> "That's when I figured, 'Hey, this is the same stuff, it's easy,' " McKinney  said. "That was a problem. Then I got back into partying."  </P> <P> By his third fight, McKinney was losing interest. The fight went six rounds and  his work was uninspired. He won his fourth fight, on the undercard of the  Thomas Hearns-Sugar Ray Leonard fight June 12. It was the worst kind of win,  for it did untold damage to McKinney. It drove him deeper into drugs.  </P> <P> Cliche No. 2 is cocaine. McKinney was a user.  </P> <P> "I can't pinpoint it. It just happened," he said. "A mistake. I was never a  heavy user. It was something that I did on occasions. I told my wife (Inga)  about it. She suggested I tell Freddy, my manager, about it. I did. I went and  got help. That's it. It was a problem that needed to be stopped."  </P> <P> McKinney had by then failed two drug tests. He checked into a rehabilitation  center for 28 days in July. When he emerged, he said, drugs were out of his  life.  </P> <P> "I was doing this for no one else," he said. "I was doing it for Kennedy  McKinney. So it didn't matter what I had to do. I wanted to correct that  problem. I went to them. They didn't have to find this out. I went and did it  because I wanted to do it."  </P> <P> McKinney had three weeks to train for his fifth pro fight, set for Aug. 28.  </P> <P> By his own admission, he was too eager to show everyone that his drug problem  was over. The fight was the means to that end.  </P> <P> "I rushed myself a little too much," he said.  </P> <P> The fight ended in a technical draw after 1 1/2 rounds, both fighters being  called for unintentional head butts.  </P> <P> "It was my very first draw," McKinney said. "It was hard to deal with. I  swallowed that with a big lump. It hurt. I can't believe that was on my record.  I guess it got me down a little bit. That was a period of an emotional letdown.  That draw took so much out of me. It took a lot out of my training. It had a  bad effect on me."  </P> <P> No sooner had McKinney collected his paycheck for the fight than he got in  trouble again.  </P> <P> Cliche No. 3 was going AWOL from training.  </P> <P> Early in September, two weeks ago, McKinney left town without telling anyone.  He missed three consecutive days of training. His wife called the police and  filed a missing-persons report.  </P> <P> Then McKinney returned, as suddenly as he had left. Where had he been, what had  he done and with whom? McKinney refuses to say.  </P> <P> "It was something that I had to do personally," he said. "If I had told (his  manager and trainer), they wouldn't have understood, from the beginning. If I  would have said, 'I have to do this, I have to have three days off,' they  wouldn't have agreed to that. I had to do it. There was no way I could have  gotten around it. It was a very personal problem of mine.  </P> <P> "My wife didn't know I was there for three days. She still don't know what I  had to do. Like I say, I still can't even tell her. I just want to make this  clear, it didn't have nothing to do with drugs at all."  </P> <P> Everyone had presumed that Kennedy was on a bender somewhere, snorting away his  career. McKinney knew enough to anticipate the reaction.  </P> <P> "Sure they thought it was drugs. That's exactly what they thought," he said.  "They didn't even give me the benefit of the doubt, to say, 'Well, McKinney, we  are going to give you a urinalysis test. If you come up positive, you are  finished.' They told me I wasn't welcome in the gym. I thought it would work  itself out."  </P> <P> It hasn't.  </P> <P> Cliche No. 4 was the arrest on Sept. 12.  </P> <P> McKinney was driving with Howard Hilliard and Nathaniel Smith that Tuesday  afternoon, looking for a man they knew as Nay Nay. This man had allegedly taken  $500 from Smith's hotel room.  </P> <P> "We saw a female standing on the corner with a blue outfit. She looked like Nay  Nay's girlfriend," McKinney said. "We pulled up across the street and said,  'Have you seen Nay Nay?' The young lady just broke off and ran.  </P> <P> "Automatically, we thought she knew where he was. She ran to a motel. I did a  U-turn and pulled into the motel. Howard got out of the car and went down to  the room and looked in. When he didn't see Nay Nay, he said, 'I'm sorry.' By  this time the motel manager came out. We tried to explain the story to him as  best we could. Then we kept driving, looking for the guy."  </P> <P> The motel manager called Las Vegas police and an hour later McKinney's car was  stopped. McKinney says they had no idea what the police wanted. When they were  told they were under arrest for kidnaping, they said in unison, "Kidnaping  who?"  </P> <P> "If I had tried to kidnap the young lady, I'm not dumb enough to keep driving  around in the same neighborhood, knowing the manager had got my license plate  number," McKinney said. "I'm not that dense."  </P> <P> McKinney spent four days and three nights in jail before being released last  Friday.  </P> <P> The charges against McKinney and Smith have since been dropped by the district  attorney, who cited insufficient evidence.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the story of McKinney's arrest was flashing across the nation. The  next day, the story of his drug rehabilitation broke and his mysterious  disappearance was reported.  </P> <P> "They had the paper in jail, they had the TVs on," McKinney said. "The other  guys knew who I was. They asked me, 'Man, were you in the Olympics?' I said,  'No, that was my brother.'  </P> <P> "I was very embarrassed. When I found out that it was in the paper and on the  TV and everybody heard about it, I just hung my head."  </P> <P> McKinney has shielded his wife from reporters. He feels his actions have  already embarrassed her enough. McKinney was especially upset that the drug  rehab story had leaked. It colored everything else.  </P> <P> "That's exactly what came to their mind, drugs," he said. "I was condemned  right there. People will label me as that for a while. But I can fight through  that. I've fought through a lot of things. It won't be easily washed away, but  in time it will be washed away."  </P> <P> McKinney's attorney, Dominic Gentile, is angry that the drug rehab story has  been linked to McKinney's arrest.  </P> <P> "There's no way," he said. "It's a cliche, I'll give it to you, but there's no  way it holds any substance. Nobody would have cared that the guy got arrested  and the charges were dropped. Nobody. They bring up this drug stuff and right  away, 'Oh, he must have been broke. He's burned up all his money. The fame went  to his head.' And none of it's true. There's nothing there."  </P> <P> Cliche No. 5 is trouble with a fighter's management.  </P> <P> It has variously been reported that McKinney's contract with Glusman and his  promotional agreement with Top Rank have been terminated. They have not.  </P> <P> "When prior to this incident (the arrest) he hadn't come to the gym for a  couple of days, he was running in the streets," promoter Bob Arum of Top Rank  said. "Freddy Glusman was at his wits' end. The incident then occurred and  Glusman and the investment group . . . well, it was embarrassing to them."  </P> <P> Included in the group of investors who "bought" into McKinney are basketball  Coach Jerry Tarkanian of the University of Nevada Las Vegas and the mayor of  Las Vegas, Ron Lurie.  </P> <P> Arum talks of a reconciliation between Glusman and McKinney. But Glusman said  last week, "I have no desire to talk to Kennedy McKinney."  </P> <P> For his part, McKinney wants to start over, without the cliches.  </P> <P> "That gold medal has such a high standard in boxing," he said. "That's not too  good, either. I had to drop my pride down a little bit and start all over  again. Forget that I'm a gold medalist. Work toward my goal -- world champion.  </P> <P> "All this has happened and I've taken a good, long look at myself. It's time to  start all over. Set some new standards. That's what I'm going to do. To myself,  I'm not the gold medalist anymore. To myself I'm a young boxer struggling to be  a world champion."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Earl Gustkey contributed to this story.  </P></p>

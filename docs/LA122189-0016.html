			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WESTLAKE VILLAGE BANS MENORAH IN CITY HALL  </P> <P> A Jewish center's request to display a Hanukkah menorah next to the Westlake  Village City Hall Christmas tree has been denied by officials who said the  eight-day celebration is not a national holiday and that it lacks the secular  appeal of Christmas.  </P> <P> City Manager Larry Bagley, who rejected a request made earlier this month to  display the menorah, also said the City Hall reception area was too small to  accommodate decorations for cultural holidays not endorsed by the state or  federal government.  </P> <P> The decision has ignited fears of anti-Semitism among Jews and prompted dozens  of concerned telephone calls to Chabad of the Conejo, a community group with  synagogues and cultural centers in Westlake Village and Agoura Hills, associate  director Rabbi Yitzchak Sapochkinsky said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Sapochkinsky said he did not think the city's motives were anti-Semitic,  although he called the decision by Bagley "a shameful thing."  </P> <P> Bagley said he knew of the U.S. Supreme Court decision last July that a  menorah, like a Christmas tree, is a secular symbol and therefore could be  publicly displayed without violating constitutional bans on governmental  endorsement of religions. But Bagley said the decision simply allowed -- but  did not require -- that menorahs be displayed.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't want anybody of any particular cultural group to feel we weren't  concerned or didn't have good thoughts for their religious or cultural  symbols," Bagley said.  </P> <P> Sapochkinsky estimated that several thousand Jews live in the Conejo Valley,  mostly in Thousand Oaks and Agoura Hills. Both of those cities approved Chabad  center requests for permission to display a menorah, and the Thousand Oaks City  Council last week held a menorah-lighting ceremony at the start of its regular  meeting.  </P> <P> Westlake Village Mayor Bonnie Klove said the council would not reconsider  Bagley's decision before the start of the eight-day Hanukkah celebration  tomorrow night. She said that while a Christmas tree is a secular symbol, a  menorah is a religious symbol.  </P> <P> Mayor Pro Tem Ken Rufener agreed in a Dec. 11 letter to Rabbi Moshe Bryski,  Chabad's regional director. "Christmas is a festive season shared by people of  all religions and ethnic backgrounds," Rufener wrote. "Surely you are aware  that Jewish families in our community, as well as Christian families, give and  attend Christmas parties."  </P></p>

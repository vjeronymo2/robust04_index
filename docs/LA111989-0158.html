			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S UGLY, BUT KINGS BEAT CAPITALS;  </P> <P> HOCKEY: FIGHT IN FINAL SECONDS MARS 5-3 VICTORY THAT EXTENDS THEIR UNBEATEN  STRING TO FOUR GAMES AND EVENS THEIR RECORD AT 10-10-1.  </P> <P> Steve Kasper scored on Washington's empty net with 32 seconds left to wrap up  the scoring in the Kings' 5-3 victory at the Forum Saturday night, but the game  wasn't over.  </P> <P> There was still time for one last scuffle. The last in a long series.  </P> <P> As far as Marty McSorley was concerned -- and many in the sellout crowd of  16,005 agreed with him -- he would have been remiss to let Neil Sheehy leave  the ice without paying for the way he had treated Wayne Gretzky, Bernie  Nicholls, Luc Robitaille and the rest of the Kings throughout the evening.  </P> <P> So McSorley cross-checked Sheehy from behind, knocking him to the ice. And  while Sheehy was face down on the ice, McSorley reached down and punched him.  </P> <P> It was not a pretty sight.  </P> <P> "A lot of things happen on the ice that don't look good," McSorley said. "A lot  of things happen on the ice that aren't felt in the stands, that aren't felt in  the pressbox, but are felt by all the players. . .  </P> <P> "I wanted our guys to know that after all the little things they took all  night, I'm there for them. It is not open season on Wayne Gretzky and Bernie  Nicholls. . .  </P> <P> "Yeah, I knocked (Sheehy) down, but he knew I was there. He turned away. I had  confronted him, and he turned away. So I knocked him down. And then I drilled  him -- no, I didn't drill him, I hit him. Nobody rushed him off to the  hospital."  </P> <P> Sheehy, who is 6-feet-2 and 210 pounds, had been giving the Kings' stars  trouble. And McSorley, who is 6-1, 230, takes that rather personally.  Especially when Gretzky is involved, and Gretzky had picked up his only  roughing penalty of the season trying to answer Sheehy's roughness on his own  in the first period.  </P> <P> As for whether McSorley had attacked Sheehy? McSorley said: "That wasn't an  attack. He was involved in a scuffle. He just wasn't as involved as I was."  </P> <P> Even the coaches were involved in the confrontations that turned the game into  a marathon of mini-bouts.  </P> <P> But in the end, the Kings survived.  </P> <P> The Kings' record went to 10-10-1 as they remained undefeated in four straight  to take over sole possession of second place in the Smythe Division.  </P> <P> The Capitals dropped to 6-10-4.  </P> <P> It was a game played in spurts and spats. A little game action, a little  jostling, a little jawing. And then, somehow, the Washington net would get  knocked off its mooring, stopping play and sparking more debate.  </P> <P> The clock stopped for a couple of minutes toward the end of the third period  while King Coach Tom Webster and Washington Coach Bryan Murray shouted and  pointed at each other and acted as if they might climb the plexiglass between  the benches to get at each other.  </P> <P> No, it wasn't the Kings' usual style, but it was interesting.  </P> <P> Readers of the Washington Post would have expected to see the "chippy" style  that the Capitals play, the style that leads to short fuses, after seeing the  comments that Murray made after practice at Culver City earlier in the week.  </P> <P> "I'm not encouraging (my team) to go out instigating fights," Murray said. "I'm  encouraging them to play a physical, solid type of hockey. So when teams play  against us and go in to get the puck, they know they'll pay a price. So if they  beat a defenseman and get between him and the boards, they know they're going  to get hit. That goes a long way toward playing well and getting the overall  play to a good level."  </P> <P> Murray and Webster were not discussing styles of play when their war of words  erupted. Said Murray: "Dave Taylor was gonna flip his mask down and I said to  him, if you're going to go after people, take your mask off. Don't be pouncing  on guys from the back while you wear a shield to protect yourself. And then  Webster made a comment to me. That's all."  </P> <P> Webster shrugged it off as "Nothing big. The kind of thing that happens in the  heat of battle."  </P> <P> No, it was not the Kings' kind of game, but, still, Gretzky was able to get two  assists, helping on the two power play goals that gave the Kings their 2-2 tie  after two periods.  </P> <P> A goal by Kelly Miller on the Capitals' first shot, 7:24 into the game, gave  Washington the early lead.  </P> <P> Bernie Nicholls tied it at 9:20 with a slapshot from the top of the left circle  on the Kings' first power play. Robitaille gave the Kings a 2-1 lead early in  the second period with his first goal of the night, scored on a wide-open net  after Washington goalie Don Beaupre left the crease to chase a shot by John  Tonelli that Tonelli gathered up and sent out front to Robitialle.  </P> <P> Ciccarelli tied it before the second period was out. Geoff Courtnall had  flipped the puck toward the Kings' net, pulling goaltender Kelly Hrudey out to  his right. Ciccarelli got to the puck in time to take advantage of the moment.  </P> <P> The Kings scored two quick goals at the start of the third period -- Dave  Taylor passing to Robitaille and getting it back for the score at 1:14 and  Robitaille scoring at 6:16 on a pass from McSorley as he and McSorley and  Nicholls all rushed into the Washington zone -- but that was not a safe lead.  </P> <P> Dave Christian's goal at 7:39 kept Washington in the game.  </P> <P> </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> The Kings will play at home Wednesday against the Chicago Blackhawks. In fact,  the Kings will play their next six of seven at home. . . When Dave Taylor  scored in the third period Saturday night, it was his first goal in 15 games.  That is the longest stretch without a goal of Taylor's career. . . Going into  Saturday night's games, Wayne Gretzky led the National Hockey League in scoring  with 40 points (including 30 assists, which is also best). Mario Lemieux of  Pittsburgh had 34 points. . .. The annual Skate with the Kings outing is today  from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at the Culver City rink. Tickets are $8 for King  booster club members, $10 for non-members.  </P></p>

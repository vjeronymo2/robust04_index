According to (Andres Rosenthal), Mexican deputy  secretary of foreign relations, yesterday's meeting, held by a  subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives, which was  summoned by Robert Torricelli, is anti-Mexican and seeks to  interfere with the domestic affairs of his country. (Rosenthal)  said that according to the Mexican people, it is unacceptable  for the U.S. to try to judge or tarnish the reputation of his  country because of some people's resentment that Mexico enjoys  normal diplomatic relations with the Cuban Government.  Furthermore, (Rosenthal) added, Torricelli is one of those who  is offended at having lost the battle against the free trade  agreement, which was recently established among Mexico, the  United States, and Canada.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (4): Room with a zoom-in view - Selling from home - Putting a back-room operation up front has worked for Unipart, a lap-top gives each home-based sales person a clear set of goals UNIPART started a radical experiment in teleworking in 1991 when the recession was making most companies cautious about trying new technology. Chairman John Neill took a long-term view of how to get a strategic advantage, and challenged his managers to find a new way of working that would concentrate on customer support, writes Claire Gooding. What happened is described by Stan Thompson, senior sales manager. 'They saw the chance to take a back-of-house resource and to put it out up front. That meant losing two layers of management, and it put us in tune with what was happening.' The structure of regional and divisional managers was replaced with a network of 31 home-based territory managers reporting straight to the centre, working flexible hours but within a planned sales programme. The computer system developed with the sales and marketing consultants Softa has resulted in a two-way traffic of information. The system gives an accurate, postcode-driven positioning of each customer in the territory. 'The system focuses on areas of opportunity,' explains Thompson. 'We can assess the market penetration of product based on 10 key products, which represent 75 per cent of turnover. That means we can give customers a fix on what is selling and take advantage of specific market opportunities.' All the managers are equipped with laptop computer and telecommunications equipment connected to a central mainframe. Each individual has a business plan and logs on every morning to be reminded of current goals. Campbell Young, one of the business development managers, is based in Witney. His office is a room above the garage attached to his three-bedroom bungalow, where he spends on average nine hours a week. He logs onto his Dell 325 laptop every morning to pick up messages. I can take a look at sales territory and people, schedules, or the sales and marketing plan. I can look at the figures and show my own performance against target, comparing it with the rest of the UK.' Young has been with Unipart seven years, but is new to computers and teleworking. 'The system tells me on a daily basis what I need to do. For instance, I might need to sell a certain amount of steering and suspension before Wednesday to meet target. It focuses in on where the real opportunities are.' He has to think hard about any disadvantages. 'I don't miss the office. Any good sales idea gets spread by e-mail or phone. You have to see it as a tool, concentrate on your job. It's people that sell things, not computers.' Unipart spent Pounds 120,000 on computer equipment for use in the field, but just as important was the assessment of the teleworkers. 'The software and the supplier are very important. So was the profile of the people we employ,' says Thompson. The investment of Pounds 100,000 with Softa was easily justifiable according to Neill. In announcing Unipart's results in February 1993 - sales were up from Pounds 556.7m to Pounds 661.4m in 1992, with profits up Pounds 4.4m - he attributed success to 'the approach we have taken in involving and motivating staff. TECHNOLOGY FILE Software: Teleworkers use Field Force System 1.43, with Winfax Lite Fax Software, PC-Anywhere and Palantir client software, on Dell 386 laptops. Hardware: Central system is a Dell 450P 486 processor with 320MB disc and 16MB RAM, running two Palantir servers for OS/2.

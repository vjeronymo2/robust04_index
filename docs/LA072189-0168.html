			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 3 SOVIET WARSHIPS VISIT NAVAL BASE IN NORFOLK  </P> <P> Three Soviet warships steamed into the Norfolk Naval Base today for a five-day  good-will visit that will include cookouts, sightseeing tours and shopping  sprees.  </P> <P> The visit to the Navy's largest base is the second time since World War II that  Soviet warships have docked in the United States. Three Soviet vessels visited  Boston harbor in 1975.  </P> <P> The guided-missile cruiser Marshal Ustinov, the destroyer Otlichny and the  oiler Genrikh Gasanov docked at Pier 7 about 8:30 a.m. after exchanging 21-gun  salutes with Ft. Monroe at the entrance to the Hampton Roads harbor.  </P> <P> "They're sharp-looking. The sailors look good," said U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. John  Lloyd as he watched from the pier. "They did an impressive job of ship handling  when they reached the pier."  </P> <P> The 1,100 Soviet sailors will spend much of their time mingling with sailors at  the base.  </P> <P> "They're going to have barbecues, cookouts," said Capt. Paul W. Hanley, an  Atlantic Fleet spokesman. "We expect there will be quite a lot of  person-to-person contact."  </P> <P> The Soviet sailors will tour the Navy base, eat at a pizza parlor and  McDonald's, visit a shopping mall and grocery and hardware stores and take a  bus trip to the Busch Gardens amusement park in Williamsburg.  </P> <P> The Soviets will reciprocate the hospitality by opening two of the ships to  visitors and offering performances by a song-and-dance troupe.  </P> <P> Next month, three Navy ships will visit the Soviet Black Sea port of  Sevastopol.  </P> <P> The exchange program was arranged last summer when Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev,  the Soviet chief of staff, visited the United States as the guest of Adm.  William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  </P></p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Hospital withdraws redundancy notices AN ESSEX hospital has withdrawn redundancy notices to 160 employees, whose jobs were being contracted out to the private sector, following revised government guidelines on European Community legislation. Goodmayes Hospital, which will become the Redbridge Hospital Trust on April 1, said it had been advised last year by the Department of Health that Transfer of Undertakings Regulations (Protection of Employment), or Tupe, would not apply to its contracting-out of domestic services for its new hospital. Where they apply, staff must be retained on existing terms and conditions. Mr Colin Houghton, personnel director, said revised guidelines issued earlier this month had caused him to seek legal advice and withdraw the notices. Negotiations would take place with ISS Mediclean, which was to have taken over the contract, to see if it still wanted to bid. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday praised the performance of NHS trusts as she confirmed that another 138 would become operational from April 1. A total of 156 are now fully operational in Britain, she said.</p>

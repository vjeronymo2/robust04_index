			<p>930312 FT  12 MAR 93 / Building society chief suspended Dr Edmund Farrell, chairman of the Irish Permanent Building Society, which is due to be floated on the Irish stock exchange this year, has been suspended by the company's board while transactions relating to his Dublin home are investigated, Tim Coone writes from Dublin. The IPBS is Ireland's largest building society, with mortgage lending estimated to be in excess of IPounds 2bn (Pounds 2bn). It is doubtful that the flotation can go ahead until this inquiry is completed.</p>

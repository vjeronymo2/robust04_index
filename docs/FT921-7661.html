			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Beurre Heseltine Butter wouldn't melt in the mouth of Mr Michael Heseltine. From the moment he rejoined the cabinet in November 1990 he has been as good as apple pie. Not a whisper of ambition emerges from his lips; not a shadow of a flicker of a disloyal expression can be discerned on his face. He has adopted a new role. He has an almost conventional haircut. He is the Conservatives' Character. His formal appellation of environment secretary is an inadequate description of his present position within the administration. Character is his correct title. It is his alone. There is no other. Not even Mr Kenneth Clarke deserves it; he is still an understudy. We have now had 14 months of beurre Heseltine. Surely it cannot last? I think it can, at least for another eight weeks or so. Character will hugely enjoy adding himself to the Tory campaign. In Wednesday's economic debate we saw what he can rustle up when there is nothing in the pantry. Teasing the shadow chancellor for his attempts to establish Labour's respectability at City luncheons he said of Mr John Smith: 'All those prawn cocktails for nothing] Never have so many crustaceans died in vain] With all the authority that I can command as secretary of state for the environment, let me say . . . 'Save the prawns]'.' As for Mr Neil Kinnock, whose famous ruminations about phasing in higher taxation took place at Luigi's restaurant, Character invited the house to picture 'the leader of the opposition fighting to prevent long strings of spaghetti slipping through his fork, while the minutiae of national insurance contributions slipped through the caverns of his mind'. It was 'economics bolognese'. These trifles diverted our attention from Mr Smith's devastating attack on the economic record of Mr John Major's government. It was a great service to the prime minister from the man who, just a year and a bit ago, had attempted to replace She who regarded herself as the sole bonne femme (or, as Mr Heseltine might have put it, mauvaise femme). If you take Character's characteristic explanation, Wednesday's performance was normal service resumed. He was cooking up no sweet dish for himself, least of all a future bid for the leadership of his party. Nothing has ever been further from his thoughts. During his four years in the wilderness there were, of course, many unworthy suggestions that he had resigned from Mrs Margaret Thatcher's cabinet and subsequently kept himself in the limelight with the single purpose of becoming prime minister. The many of us who conversed with him during that time all unaccountably came to the same conclusion: he was after the top job. Mr Heseltine will have none of this. He was determined to He was surprised how wary of him the younger ministers were survive as a politician after leaving the cabinet, that was all. As he accepted the ever-increasing number of invitations to speak at this or that Tory rally people began to ask if he was ambitious. Being honest, he acknowledged that, like everyone else, he was. That was how the myth grew. He did not expect to win in November 1990. His achievement was to survive, unlike all the others who had departed from Mrs Thatcher's cabinets. The test of Character will come after April 9, if that is to be polling day. Before he returned to the fold the supposition was that he would be called on to lead the party if Mrs Thatcher lost an election, or won it by a wafer-thin majority. That was then. Now is different - or is it? The odds are that Mr Major will either win by a handful of seats or find himself swirling about in a hung parliament. Character will presumably want everyone to believe, although he probably suspects that they will not, that what applied when Mrs Thatcher was leader has no validity when Mr Major's goose is the one that may be about to be cooked. In any case, Mr Heseltine's firmly expressed forecast is that the Conservatives will return with a decent majority. If they do, his loyalists will insist that the party has him to thank for it. Before he became leader Mr Major was asked whether he would appoint the then highly controversial Mr Heseltine to his cabinet. His reply was that he wanted to win the next election. Yet giving Mr Heseltine any big-spending department is a political statement. It says that the government will put up with a certain brand of interventionism. Mr Major offered him the small-spending Home Office, but Character was too wise to accept that mess of pottage. His three preferred departments were environment, defence and industry. Using environment as a base he has involved himself in many of the politico-industrial decisions that cross Whitehall desks. He could have done the same from either of the other two departments. The chosen route of the Channel tunnel rail link into London is his. If a local authority wishes to bid for some of the Pounds 750m City Challenge money on offer, it must first demonstrate that its relationships with its police department and local businesses are cordial. Treasury rules for accounting for European Community regional aid must be amended, as, after some delay, they were. He does not always get his own way, but he does so often enough. When Character first returned to office he was surprised by how wary of him the younger ministers and officials were. It has taken time to allay their fears. Now he finds himself close to the prime minister, not quite his deputy - Mr Major is too sensible for that - but one of the inner circle of strategists, able to go where he pleases and speak on any subject he likes. If the Conservatives win well, and Mr Major has the courage to keep him, Mr Heseltine will surely become his deputy for micro-economic management, just as Mr Douglas Hurd is for foreign affairs. If not, there may be an awful mess in the kitchen.</p>

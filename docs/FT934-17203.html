			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Bundesbank 'will not act as central bank for Europe': Tietmeyer begins term with commitment to stable D-Mark and cutting inflation MR HANS TIETMEYER launched his term as president of the Bundesbank yesterday with a strong affirmation of the German central bank's commitment to monetary stability. Speaking in Frankfurt at a ceremony to mark the handover from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Mr Tietmeyer underscored the Bundesbank's commitment to cutting German inflation. He said that would continue to take precedence over broader international considerations. The Bundesbank's 'central and most important task' remained the defence of the D-Mark's stability, Mr Tietmeyer said. 'This is not only our task as defined by law but also my personal conviction.' Germany's central bankers were not 'stability fanatics', he said. The Bundesbank would go on considering the international implications of its interest rate policy - but there was no scope for it to act as a central bank for the whole of Europe. That was not selfish 'egotism', Mr Tietmeyer added, but 'just the opposite: in the future Europe will need a stable German anchor currency and a politically and economically stable Germany'. Taking over from Mr Schlesinger after a period of turmoil in European currency markets, with Germany in deep recession, Mr Tietmeyer pitched his inaugural address at domestic and international observers of German monetary policy. For the domestic audience, he explained the limitations of the Bundesbank's interest rate policy, repeating his predecessor's argument that the bank could not be expected to bail out German industry by reducing the cost of money. Government, industry and unions had to play their part. 'Even if a (German) recovery soon gets under way, many structural problems have yet to be solved,' he said. 'Interest rate cuts which are not justified in terms of our stability objectives cannot solve economic or structural problems.' Mr Tietmeyer dismissed arguments that widening the bands within the European exchange rate mechanism had dealt a death blow to European monetary union. 'I could only go along with this judgment if the wider bands had been abused by countries for competition-distorting devaluations. Happily, there are no signs that this has been the case,' he said. The widening had been necessary, given the ERM's loss of credibility, and differing economic fundamentals among European Community members. Speaking at the ceremony, Chancellor Helmut Kohl supported the Bundesbank's policy, saying a currency's stability remained decisive in determining a country's attractiveness as a place to do business. In his farewell speech, Mr Schlesinger said that monetary stability was not a 'German obsession' but rather provided a 'guarantee of political and social stability, of personal freedom and justice, and a bond which links the east and west of our Fatherland better than anything else.' On one of the principal Bundesbank messages for foreign consumption, there was no ambiguity. Speaker after speaker rammed home Germany's claim to house the mooted European Central Bank in Frankfurt.</p>

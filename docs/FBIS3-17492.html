			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Kakovkin: </F>   [Text] Ryazan [no date as received] -- According to the  results of the March 27 elections to local representative  authorities in the Ryazan region, summed up today, only 12 out  of the needed 19 deputies to the regional duma have been  elected. Elections were recognised as valid in all the rural  constituencies, while the minimum turnout of 35 per cent was not  registered at any of the constituencies in the city or Ryazan  itself. This is why only one deputy to the regional duma was  elected there.    According to the current regulations, repeated elections may  be held there no sooner that in three months. So far as the  future of the regional duma is concerned, a final decision will  be taken by the regional electoral commission today after the  final count of votes. The decision will hardly be positive,  because one more deputy is needed to make the quorum.    Nizhniy Novgorod -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Evald  Kessariysky:    The results of elections to the representative bodies of  power were rather promising in that region. An average of 32  per cent of electors took part in the voting. 32 deputies were  elected to the regional legislative assembly, and repeated  elections will be held in 13 constituencies.    The turnout was rather high in the city of Nizhniy Novgorod.  According to preliminary results, 25 deputies were elected  there. Repeated elections will be held in nine constituencies.    Tambov -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Russkiy:    Elections have been recognised as valid in the Tambov region  with a population of 1.5 million, Chairman of the Regional  Electoral Commission Nikolay Vorobev told ITAR-TASS. 43.3 per  cent of electors took part in the voting. Thirty deputies were  elected to the regional duma and 16 deputies -- to the city  duma. A Tambov mayor was also elected for the first time ever.  According to the preliminary information, the incumbent mayor  of Tambov Valeriy Koval, 42, leader of local democrats, was  elected to that post. He defeated a candidate from Rutskoy's  party and a representative of communists.    Voronezh -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Starukhin:    Residents of the Voronezh region, and especially urban  dwellers, did not show much enthusiasm about the Sunday  elections to local representative bodies of power. According to  preliminary results, only 23 per cent of electors took part in  elections to the Voronezh municipal council, and elections can  be recognised as valid only in seven constituencies out of 17.  Turnout was a little higher during the elections to the  regional duma, because residents of rural areas took part in  them. A total figure is 42 per cent. However, the needed  minimum was not reached at ten urban constituencies, and  repeated elections will have to be held there. Elections seem  to be valid in the remaining 35 constituencies, mostly in rural  areas.</p>

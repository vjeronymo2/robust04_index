Howard Dee, former ambassador to the Vatican and chief  government peace negotiator with the communist rebels, said the  acceptance of Jalandoni's request removed a stumbling block in  the talks.    Dee, however, did not say when and where the meeting could  take place.    He said the government's panel position was that the issue  be  included in the talks in Hanoi the capital of Vietnam.    The National Democratic Front (NDF), political arm of the  Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), has set a number of  preconditions before it could sit down for talks in Vietnam.    Among these are the release of 300 political prisoners and  the government's insistence that the negotiation be conducted  under the framework of the Philippine Constitution.    The second precondition has proved the most difficult to  overcome.    However, Dee said that the preliminary meeting could still  proceed by taking up issues such as the ground rules for  substantive talks, safety and immunity guarantees for peace  representatives, and all other technical arrangements.    Dee also reminded Jalandoni that when they signed The Hague  Declaration in September 1992, they agreed that "no precondition  shall be made to negate the inherent character and purpose of  the peace negotiations."    "With the onset of the New Year, and the hope it brings, we  urge Mr. Jalandoni to come to the negotiating table to implement  The Hague Declaration so that together we may give peace a  chance," Dee said.    He said Vietnam has already agreed to host the talks but  would not take direct part in it.    Hanoi wanted to adopt Jakarta's position in facilitating  only  peace talks between the Philippine government and dissident  factions, like the Muslim secessionist and communist guerrillas.    The last time government representatives talked with  communist leaders in the Netherlands in September last year when  the Ramos government first opened its doors for peaceful  resolution of the 25-year-old Maoist rebellion.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ninety minutes ago, Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk voted in the election of people's deputies of Ukraine  at polling station No. 4 of the Kiev central constituency No.  22. After he voted, the chief of state answered several  questions from Ukrainian and foreign journalists.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent of Russian news agency  MOSKVA] What kind of new Ukrainian parliament would you like to  see and where should it lead the country?    [Kravchuk] I would like it to be responsible,  reform-oriented, and professional so that it can lead the  country along the way of reforms, democracy, friendship,  cooperation, and partnership with all states of the world, so  that it will lead the country to good- neighborly relations with  those countries which are our [word indistinct].    [Unidentified correspondent] [passage indistinct]    [Kravchuk] I say, we must follow the way of reforms, reforms  only.    [Unidentified correspondent] Do you have a market economy in  mind?    [Kravchuk] A market economy, reforms along the way toward a  market. There is no alternative here. You know, those states  which [words indistinct], as they say in Ukrainian [words  indistinct], they are following the road toward a market. This  refers to Russia, to Belarus, and to other states. Some of them  made rather good progress and others were less successful,  however, they all are moving along the road of reforms. It  seems to me that this question is connected with the following:  There are forces which think or understand things differently  [word indistinct]. But on the whole [words indistinct].    [Unidentified correspondent] Recently you expressed doubt  that there would be a full-blooded parliament as a result of the  election. Will you ask for additional legal powers? Will this  end up with presidential rule?    [Kravchuk] Why? I said that parliament, as a matter of  fact, could assemble if 300 deputies were elected but that it  would not be a full-blooded parliament because it will lack 150  deputies. These 150 deputies make up one third of the entire  number of deputies in parliament, so this means that 12 million  citizens would not be represented in parliament -- 12 million of  the adult population or 17 million if we take into account the  entire population. Therefore, the parliament which does not  represent the whole of Ukraine cannot make decisions. And then,  to be frank, let us imagine that there are 300. There would  need to be an ideal situation for 300 deputies to vote for any  decision unanimously. It means that constitutional decisions  [words indistinct].    [Unidentified correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, the  population of Ukraine has been waiting impatiently for this day.  A new era, so to speak, is beginning in the life of Ukraine.  Do you link this election with the fact that Ukraine will open  a new, so to say, page?    [Kravchuk] I think today will not yet show whether a new era  begins or not. This will probably be determined after the  parliament is elected, if it is elected. I would like this to  happen. Then, after it assembles and proclaims its concept, its  program, its attitude toward reforms, democracy, and  transformations, only after this it will be possible to say  whether the new era has begun or not. Today this is our wish  only. I hope the people who come to the polling stations want  this to happen. Whether this happens or not will depend on how  they vote, who they vote for, and on the level of responsibility  of those who are elected to parliament and their attitude toward  this people.    [Unidentified correspondent] [passage indistinct]    [Kravchuk] I think that, no matter how events develop there,  Crimea will be with Ukraine and will tackle all issues with  Ukraine. Here is an interesting fact. Water has been supplied  to Crimea from Ukraine, where they opened the valve, seeds for  the sowing campaign have been delivered from Ukraine, and  everything is being delivered from Ukraine. So far... [pauses]  Not much effort is needed, for example, to reset the hands of  the clock. Not much effort is needed for this. However, one  needs to exert efforts so as to switch over to reforms, to  economic programs. So far, this is a matter of resetting clock  hands, voting, and so on -- that is to say, this is being done  so far at the level of political battles.    I always say: Let us deal with the economy. Crimea lives  together with Ukraine. I do not believe that the people of  Crimea, the population of Crimea, will display an irresponsible  attitude toward this action [word indistinct]. After all,  everything will depend on whether reforms develop in Crimea or  not, whether the life of the people improves or not.    [Unidentified correspondent] What if the situation becomes  worse?    [Kravchuk] I believe we will not allow this to happen. [end  recording]</p>

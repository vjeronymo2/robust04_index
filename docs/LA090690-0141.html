			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL REPORT;  </P> <P> VISTA SCHOOLS SCRAMBLE TO HOUSE STUDENTS  </P> <P> For the first time in four years, the doors of a new school will not be opening  in the Vista Unified School District this September.  </P> <P> However, Supt.  </P> <P> Rene Townsend says the district does hope to have an elementary school open  next fall to accommodate Vista's growing school-age population.  </P> <P> The district opened five schools in the last four years -- two in 1987, two in  1988 and one in 1989.  </P> <P> According to the San Diego County Office of Education, district enrollment has  grown 40% in that time, from 12,512 in 1986-1987 to 17,520 last year.  </P> <P> This year's break from school openings "wasn't a total breather," Townsend  said. "We changed our whole calendar to accommodate growth."  </P> <P> In fact, the only reason the district is not opening a new school this year is  that it did not have the money to do so, Townsend says. As a result, Vista kids  now attend school in one of three, year-round calendar tracks.  </P></p>

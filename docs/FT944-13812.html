			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Management: Open to suggestion Company suggestion schemes can pay handsome dividends if the arrangements are well packaged and backed by attractive rewards for employees. A study carried out by the Industrial Society* found that companies which have taken dusty suggestions boxes down from the walls and revamped their schemes are benefiting from a stream of new ideas. The society has produced an information pack for employers which includes guidance and examples of successful schemes from 12 organisations. Some of the more productive schemes include: Land Rover's relaunched scheme. This reaped suggestions worth Pounds 2m in its first year. One suggestion that less fuel should be put in the tanks to drive cars from the production line saved Pounds 25,000 a year and earned Pounds 5,000 for the employee who suggested it. In the Rover parent company a suggestion that industrial gloves could be recycled saved the group more than Pounds 100,000 a year. The staff member who made the suggestion received Pounds 5,000. Another Pounds 5,000 was awarded to a woman who suggested an alternative printing process to replace the need to laminate the covers of car handbooks. That saved Pounds 30,000 a year. Midland Bank's Bright Ideas scheme. Subsequent proposals saved more than Pounds 250,000. East Midland's Eureka scheme. This helped save Pounds 22,000. Some Pounds 5,000 has been paid out in rewards to staff. 'Suggestion schemes are vital because they encourage innovation, quality and cost savings,' says the Industrial Society's Georgina Tate. 'Good schemes promote employee involvement and commitment.' *The suggestions scheme information pack is available, price Pounds 35, from the Industrial Society information service.

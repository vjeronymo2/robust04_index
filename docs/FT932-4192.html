			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: High debt levels continue to dog Lep LEP GROUP, the freight forwarding and security group which was last year restructured by its banks, yesterday reported continuing heavy losses for the year to December 31. Turnover fell from Pounds 1.51bn to Pounds 1.47bn, mainly reflecting the sale of the Swift physical distribution businesses in the UK, the Netherlands and Belgium. Operating profits before exceptional items were flat at Pounds 26m. However, exceptional items of Pounds 18.7m (Pounds 47.3m) and net interest of Pounds 41.9m (Pounds 38.3m), resulted in a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 34.3m, compared with Pounds 59.1m last time. Mr David James, the company doctor who was appointed chairman by the banks, said the maintenance of operating profits was particularly encouraging, given the recessionary conditions afflicting the world markets in which the Freight Forwarding operation was engaged, and the US domestic market in which the National Guardian Corporation operated. Last August Lep's banks agreed to convert Pounds 180m of debt into 85 per cent of the group's enlarged equity, after the group had been brought to the brink of bankruptcy by debts of more than Pounds 500m. Despite the debt-equity swap, Lep's bank borrowings fell during the year by only Pounds 76m, from Pounds 469m to to Pounds 393m. The group said the scale of the reduction was limited by the devaluation of sterling and the crystallisation of certain liabilities. The group said the need to service and ultimately discharge this very substantial level of debt would significantly influence future strategy options. Under the three-year facility granted by Lep's banks last summer, interest can be rolled up, but the group will clearly have to contemplate significant disposals at some stage. Mr James said the financial reconstruction had provided the company with the time and financial resources needed to develop and improve the the trading prospects of the group's principal remaining subsidiaries. Losses per share were 8.7p, compared with 45.6p last time. No dividend was declared and it is not expected that the distribution will be resumed in the foreseeable future.</p>

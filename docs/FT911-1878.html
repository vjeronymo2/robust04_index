			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Observer: Game of the name Leningrad, cradle of the Bolshevik revolution, is to hold a referendum whether to go back to its pre-revolutionary name of St Petersburg. The June 12 poll will coincide with elections to the new post of Russian president. Anatoly Sobchak, the Soviet second city's radical mayor, previously wanted the name-change issue postponed. He had argued that Leningrad could not afford to waste its scarce resources on such a matter in the middle of the country's worst economic crisis since the Second World War. However, emigre author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who is also an ardent patriot, has objections of a different nature. In an open letter from his home in Vermont, he tells Leningraders they should abandon the idea of a name sounding like 'Sankt Peterburg' because it has too Germanic a ring. Instead, he suggests a completely new name: Svyato-Petrograd. This amalgamates the Russian words for saint, city, and Peter, in that order. The city, founded by Peter the Great, was re-titled Petrograd, after the first 1917 revolution in February, then later called 'Leningrad' in honour of the Bolshevik leader. His real name, of course, was Ulyanov.</p>

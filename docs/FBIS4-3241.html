The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps' Cable  Television Station was built in 1992. It uses a high-quality  450-M cable transmission system, with 47 channels.    The hookup provides Urumqi area with an air-and-underground  transmission system, which helps improve both the content and  quality of the programs.    Sha Ming, vice chairman of the autonomous regional committee  of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and  director of the Department of Radio and Television under the  autonomous regional government, spoke at the meeting. He said:  Cable television stations are a component part of television  undertaking, whose equipment is expensive to purchase and  maintain.

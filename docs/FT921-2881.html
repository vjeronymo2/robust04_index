			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Targeting voters wastes valuable ammunition - The fight for those marginals that may prove crucial to the election IN THIS election there are 500 seats where the outcome is not in doubt. In the 150 seats where there is a chance of change, 80 per cent of voters will vote as they did last time - even though a few of them may need a little encouragement to go to the polling booth. The election will be decided by at most 2m people (say 12,000 people in each of 150 constituencies). On a more ruthless estimate there will be 80,000 key voters (say 2,000 in each of 40 constituencies). Rational campaigners should focus all their efforts on these target voters. As the identification of marginal seats has become more precise, parties have indeed focused more of their efforts on them, targeting resources on the constituencies most likely to be won and lost. With computers it is easier to build up marked registers, showing occupations and past canvass returns and records of voting. Subject to the limits on election expenses, direct mail can be sent to particular groups and above all to opinion leaders - not only doctors and journalists but also publicans and hairdressers. Money can be raised, workers can be recruited, membership can be maintained in ways impossible in the past. Does it make a difference? Can voters be efficiently targeted either collectively or individually? Is it possible to identify and persuade the minority of voters who have a special propensity to float? Targeting has three problems: How to identify the individual targets. There seldom is enough evidence to isolate subgroups. How to speak to the targets in the right persuasive language. How to address any appeal to those who will be attracted by it without letting it reach those who may be alienated. A pledge to end fox-hunting may drive away as much support as it attracts. Over 40 years of election watching I have listened to much talk about organising mutual aid (workers from safe seats helping out in marginals), about reaching out to opinion leaders, about listing old people's homes where postal votes may be garnered, and about employing other campaigning gimmicks. I have found little evidence that these efforts have much effect. About 10 per cent of people are entitled to a postal vote but it tends to average a mere 2 per cent. In no constituency in Britain is 5 per cent reached and there has been only a modest link between the size of the postal vote and the marginality of the seat. Party organisations plainly fail to deliver on this most obvious of opportunities. The point is that local campaigning is nothing compared with national campaigning. Not 10 per cent of voters will encounter their local candidate, but more than 90 per cent will be exposed to leaders of the parties on TV. It is on television and in the press that the parties make their case. Does that give them the opportunity to target voters? They can hardly focus solely on marginal seats since these are scattered across the various television and newspaper markets. But can they target especially vulnerable voters, people whose social condition or occupation or policy views make them especially open to persuasion? A generation ago the chief publicity officer of the Conservatives was convinced that the election would be decided by the wives of the skilled working class, C2 women. But when the election was over it seemed that the appeals achieved nothing. The targets had, if anything, moved less towards the Tories then the rest of the nation. There is a popular legend that the C2s won the 1979 election for the Conservatives. There was a large 8 per cent shift among C2s to the Conservatives when Mrs Thatcher was elected, but no bigger than the 8 per cent shift among the DEs. The cause lay far more in the working class's disillusion with Mr Callaghan's government and the winter of discontent than in any special targeting. The swing in marginal seats was no greater than in the rest of the country. At the mass level, targeting is difficult because the parties are addressing a collective audience. Giveaways to a supposedly vulnerable sub-group will have no appeal to the bulk of the audience and may excite cynicism. There is always the question: 'Where's the money coming from?' The trouble with targeting is that we are multiple personalities. An old-age pensioner may be house owner, animal lover, anti-European and retired farmer. A single parent may have diverse interests and prejudices far removed from any stereotype. Any attempt to appeal to such people under one heading may offend them as general citizens. The assumption of a common interest among a common category may be misconceived. Mori recently found that 33 per cent of the unemployed would vote Conservative. This, allowing for their class composition, is very little below the national figure. For an issue to have a significant impact on the election outcome it must satisfy three conditions: It must be salient to the electorate. If they don't know or care about it, it can't sway votes. The public must be aware of a party difference on it, if it is to affect their preference. Opinion must be skewed on the subject. If the public is evenly divided then as many voters will be alienated as attracted. Relatively few issues meet this triple test of a public that cares, that is informed of the party's stand, and that is unevenly split. For example, some people care passionately about fox-hunting and know that Labour will vote against and Conservatives for. However, it is an issue where there are as many votes to be gained as lost. On other issues, such as crime or cruelty to children, the public does not differentiate between the parties. Targeting is logical, inevitable and largely ineffective.

Four million German marks have been invested in  the factory's ultramodern equipment, not counting the cost of  the basic adaptation and modification of the building which the  Kovin municipality donated to Hemaform for this purpose.    Dr. Borivoje Antic, Serbian health minister, and Pavle  Todorovic, Serbian minister for the protection of the  environment, were present at the ceremony inaugurating the new  factory in Dubovac.    Engineer Miodrag Babic, general director of Hemofarm,  informed journalists that the factory will produce 100 million  capsules or 3.8 million packages of high-quality antibiotics  annually. Thanks to the most modern technology, 30 people will  work here initially, in two shifts.    "Hemaform built this factory -- just as it did the natural  medicines factory on 12,500 square meters in Vrsac -- under the  difficult burden of international sanctions," Mr. Babic said.</p>

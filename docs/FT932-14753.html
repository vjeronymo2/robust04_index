			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI surges Heavy US interest following a strong recommendation by one New York broker prompted ICI shares to rise sharply for the second consecutive trading day. PaineWebber, already a keen supporter of the company, raised its first-quarter earnings estimates and its 1993 prediction. It cites a recovering UK economy and the benefit of corporate cost-cutting on margins. Traders said US investors now hold less than 7 per cent of ICI shares compared with more than 20 per cent of most of the leading internationally traded companies. They added that there was a growing belief that ICI had been undeservedly mauled by the UK financial community. In London ICI shares rose 34 to 1201p.</p>

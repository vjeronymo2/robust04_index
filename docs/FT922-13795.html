			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Japanese bank shareslose their lustre: Heavy selling has sent the sector down twice as fast as the Nikkei The slide of Japanese bank shares has been an important factor in the remarkable loss of confidence in the Tokyo market this week. Heavy selling of bank shares has sent the sector index down by 28 per cent over the past 11 days, while the Nikkei average has declined 15 per cent. In the past, banks shares have traded at an exaggerated premium to the market as a whole. The price/earnings ratio of the banking sector was 55 per cent higher than that of the Nikkei index in August last year; now it is only 8 per cent higher. 'The asset premium of Japanese bank stocks is starting to be stripped,' says Mr Alan Bell, of Baring Securities in Tokyo. Banks own 22 per cent of Japanese equity. Their strategic shareholdings in leading clients and in fellow members of larger corporate groups, the keiretsu, are seen as the glue that holds the Japanese corporate system together. In return, bank shares are held by bank affiliates, client companies and members of the same corporate groups. Even after companies raised increasing amounts of capital from bond and equity markets in the 1980s, these relationships continued to be close. For banks and companies, the obligation to maintain stable stakes in each other was not a burden when the market was rising. As a result, bank shares are seen in Japan as the least traded, most illiquid sector of the market. While the ratio of stable shareholdings for Tokyo stocks is estimated at 60 per cent, the ratio for bank stocks was about 85 per cent. Once the stock market turned downwards, however, companies started to look again at their holdings of bank shares. 'Companies, already squeezed for profits due to the economic downturn, have started to liquidate holdings of loss-making bank shares,' says Mrs Mineko Sasaki-Smith, head of research at Credit Suisse in Tokyo. A company typically owns shares not only in its main bank, but also in a range of related banks. It is these less-strategic holdings that are now being sold. Meanwhile, banking relationships have forced banks to support ailing clients. For example, to help out Tobishima, an ailing property developer, its banks have agreed to cut interest rates on Y210bn (Pounds 900m) in debt from about 6 1/2 per cent to 3 per cent for a year; an affiliate, Tobishima Urban, will have the interest rate on Y790bn of debt cut to 1 per cent indefinitely. This restructuring, announced last week, has added to the pressure on bank shares - especially those of Fuji Bank, Tobishima's lead lender. The bank had already forecast a 74.9 per cent decline in net profits to Y30bn, due to losses associated with a fraudulent loan scheme. Its share price has dropped 42 per cent during the past two weeks. More downwards pressure has come from selling by foreign investors. Last year, as the stock market slid, foreign investors were almost the only buyers around, concentrating their purchases disproportionately on the banking sector. They hoped to benefit from the impact of falling interest rates on banks' profit margins. Bank shares totalled 20 per cent of foreign exposure to the Tokyo market in September 1991, up from 13 per cent the previous year. Now interest rates seem to have bottomed, and foreign investors have been disillusioned by the continued slide in the market. In short, investors in Japan and abroad have realised that the banks have been more badly bruised by Japan's financial turmoil than they had previously conceded. There is a deeper worry at work, however, than simply a re-rating of an underperforming sector. Banks had been leading beneficiaries from the sharp rise in stock and property prices in the late 1980s. They made big unrealised gains on their cross-shareholdings, and were allowed to count a proportion of these unrealised gains as capital under the Basle standards agreed by central banks, which take effect at the end of this year. What was a benefit has now become a burden. As unrealised gains have fallen in line with the stock market, the banks' once healthy capital-to-asset ratios have dropped below the 8 per cent ratio set by the Basle accord. With the Nikkei index at the 17,000 level, the average ratio of capital to assets for Japan's long-term credit banks and city banks is at around 7.5 per cent, according to Mr David Atkinson of Salomon Brothers in Tokyo. To bolster the ratio, banks have turned increasingly to selling subordinated debt to life assurance companies, traditionally stable holders of bank shares. The life companies have indicated that they would like to maintain their net exposure to the banking sector unchanged, by selling bank stocks. The fear of a wave of selling by the life companies hangs over bank shares. It is unclear, however, whether life assurers are really selling: they are likely to get better returns by exercising patience. Bank shares probably have further to fall. Baring Securities' Mr Bell says they could drop another 20 per cent and - since they make up a quarter of the Nikkei index - the fall could push the stock average down another 1,000 to 2,000 points. The leading city banks, who are expected to post an average 30 per cent increase in basic business profits, argue that their balance sheets remain sound. A Sanwa Bank official says: 'the fall in our share price is not very good for our image, but there's no real harm'. Image has certainly suffered. The Industrial Bank of Japan, the country's most prestigious bank, has seen its market value drop 79 per cent since the height of the 1989 bull market. Where once it towered above its western rivals in market capitalisation, it is now worth only slightly more than Deutsche Bank. Even if, as the Japanese banks insist, they suffer no long term damage from the decline in their share prices, they will not soon recover the lustre of the 1980s.</p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RENAMING OF BLVD. STIRS IRE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET  </P> <P> When Lynwood city officials renamed Century Boulevard in honor of Dr. Martin  Luther King Jr. last month, they forgot to tell South Gate. And South Gate had  a stake in the decision because one side of a nine-block stretch of the  boulevard is in that city.  </P> <P> The name was changed along a 3 1/2-mile segment of Century Boulevard in  northern Lynwood. South Gate merchants and residents, however, are concerned  about the boulevard where for nine blocks it is in Lynwood on one side and  South Gate on the other.  </P> <P> South Gate City Atty. Bruce Boogaard said if the two sides cannot agree, one  side of the street could be named Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard while the  other side could remain Century Boulevard.  </P> <P> That is exactly what could happen, Lynwood Councilman Paul Richards said. "If  they don't want the change, South Gate will have Century and Lynwood, Martin  Luther King."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lynwood's Right Challenged  </P> <P> South Gate officials question the right of Lynwood to change the name of that  segment of the boulevard without telling them.  </P> <P> "Lynwood doesn't have the right to change the name of streets in our city,"  Councilman William H. DeWitt said.  </P> <P> "We have a Martin Luther King Jr. Hospital. There's a Martin Luther King  Boulevard in Los Angeles. We don't need another," said South Gate resident  Maria Morales.  </P> <P> The executive director of the South Gate Chamber of Commerce, Russell Lamkin,  said: "It is stupid. All this will cost merchants a lot of money to print new  letterheads and stationery."  </P> <P> Merchant Cirilo E. Poots said he moved to 3077 Century Blvd. in South Gate  about five months ago and believes a name change would disrupt his business.  </P> <P> Poots, who owns Cirilo's Customs Tailor, said customers who frequented his  previous location in Huntington Park are just beginning to come to his new  shop.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'This Is Not Good'  </P> <P> "I had to leave my Huntington Park shop because the city bought it as part of a  redevelopment area," Poots said. "Now, they want to change the name. This is  not good."  </P> <P> Although Lynwood officials have apologized and asked that representatives from  both cities get together and talk over the problem, neither side seems willing  to change its position.  </P> <P> "I would hope they would change," Lynwood Mayor Evelyn Wells said. "It is up to  them and their people. Hopefully, they will come along with us."  </P> <P> But South Gate Councilman Gregory Slaughter said: "Everyone (in South Gate) is  opposed to this change."  </P> <P> During a council meeting Monday, Slaughter voted against meeting with Lynwood  officials to discuss the problem. The other four South Gate council members  voted to hold talks, but with some misgivings.  </P> <P> "I'm opposed to changing Century Boulevard to anything," South Gate Councilman  Robert Philipp said. "I don't see the benefit to South Gate or Lynwood."  </P> <P> South Gate Mayor Herb Cranton said he would arrange a meeting with Mayor Wells  to see whether a compromise can be worked out. Cranton also asked the city's  administrative staff to poll merchants and residents in the nine-block area to  see how they feel about the change. Philipp said he supports a survey but  believes most people oppose the change.  </P> <P> Unofficially, DeWitt said he counted 24 businesses and 40 homes in the area.  DeWitt said he also believes most people in the poll area would be opposed to  the change.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State Law Allows It  </P> <P> According to Boogaard, state law allows a city to change the name of a street  within its boundaries. But Boogaard said there is no law requiring cities to  "meet and confer" on a name change of a street located within the borders of  each.  </P> <P> "Historically, cities meet (to decide on name changes) as a matter of courtesy  to residents who border the street," he said.  </P> <P> South Gate Councilman DeWitt is concerned about giving the nine-block segment  of the boulevard two names. "That would be confusing, especially during  emergencies where ambulance drivers or police would be trying to find an  address," he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Joseph Wang, Lynwood public works director, said new street signs  have been put up at some of the major intersections in Lynwood. Wang said it  will take about two months to complete the task.  </P> <P> He said he is prepared to change the signs in South Gate, too, if that city  agrees to the name change. Signs on Century Boulevard between Alameda Street on  the west and Long Beach Freeway on the east are being changed to Martin Luther  King Jr. Boulevard. The portion in South Gate is on the north side of the  boulevard between Santa Fe Avenue and Long Beach Boulevard.  </P></p>

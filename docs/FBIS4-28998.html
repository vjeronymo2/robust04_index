			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Last Part" of report compiled by National Assembly </F> Standing Committee on voters' views submitted to the Ninth  National Assembly's fifth session]    [Text] Concerning the wage system, voters in many  localities asked the government to continue its efforts to study  and improve the wage system to make it just and rational.  Voters in many localities hold that the reclassification of  compensation plans for competent cadres and retirees in  accordance with Decree No. 05-CP, dated 26 January 1994, is  irrational because it does not reflect good care for the  retirees. Besides, the wide coefficient between wages for  active civil servants and the pension for the retirees  represents an unfair situation. All voters in localities raised  issues related to the policy toward local cadres and held that  since the application of Decree No. 46-CP, various villages have  experienced numerous difficulties. The streamlining of  personnel and the limitation of expenditures for village cadres  and activities of mass organizations at the grassroots level are  not appropriate because it creates a bad feeling for the local  cadres who have made great contributions to the people. The  fact that many key cadres at the grassroots level resigned has  caused confusion in the social life of localities. Many voters  suggested that the National Assembly should question the  minister concerned and chairman of the Government's Cadre  Organization Committee regarding the promulgation of Decree No.  46-CP. The voters held that this decree was not in conformity  with the party's line on consolidating and strengthening the  local administration. Voters of the education sector expressed  their indignation in the reclassification of the compensation  plan. They said that this has created an unfair condition in the  promotion process because in the past one only needed three  years to get a step increase, now they have to wait for six  years.    Regarding social policy, most voters expressed concern over  the unemployment problem. Voters in provinces and cities said  that a large number of youth in cities and the rural areas are  jobless. This is a direct cause leading to social vices such as  gambling, drug addiction, prostitution, and theft. The voters  suggested that the state invest more in programs to resolve the  unemployment problem, considering this an important measure to  stop social vices. Many voters held that efforts to send  Vietnamese workers abroad is the state's correct policy aimed at  resolving the unemployment issue at home. However, the  government should take essential measures and reach agreements  with foreign countries to protect the interests of Vietnamese  workers abroad. Many voters paid keen interest in the policy  toward wounded soldiers, families of the fallen combatants, and  those who have contributed meritorious services to the state.  Most voters held that the present allowances for families of  fallen combatants are too low. They suggested that the state  should formulate a better policy toward those who have made  great contributions to the state to maintain the principle of  gratitude while educating the younger generation and developing  the fine tradition of our nation.    Voters throughout the country welcomed the party and state  lines in solemnly organizing our nation's major anniversaries,  including the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the Dien  Bien Phu victory. The voters held that the solemn commemoration  of the Dien Bien Phu victory created a significant impact in the  feeling of all Vietnamese. Voters in many localities asked the  state to promulgate a regulation on treatment for those who have  performed meritorious service for the state. They said that  they have asked for this regulation on many occasions; however,  their request was ignored. They also asked that when the state  completes the draft regulation on this issue, it should be made  public to solicit the people's ideas.    IV. Implementation of the National Assembly's resolution on  practicing thrift, opposing waste and corruption, and  suppressing smuggling.    All voters in localities welcomed the National Assembly's  resolution on this issue, which was adopted at the Ninth  National Assembly's fourth session. The voters highly appraised  the National Assembly's determination in the struggle against  lavish spending of state budget, corruption, and smuggling which  are the pressing issues at present. Many voters noted that the  government has made great efforts in implementing the National  Assembly's resolution. However, results attained in this regard  are low while social vices tended to increase in various  meticulous forms. Voters commended Dong Nai, Song Be, and Tay  Ninh Provinces for their efforts in dealing with car smuggling  cases. The press recently reported, however, that the  government has not taken prompt action against a number of  business units that imported motorcycles without proper  permission. The voters held that efforts to suppress corruption  and smuggling is an important, yet very difficult task. As a  result, the state should formulate more concrete and effective  measures to deal with this issue while urging state agencies  from the central to grassroots levels to seriously oppose  corruption and smuggling. Voters in some localities suggested  that the state should review the organization of the Steering  Committee for Opposing Corruption and Smuggling because low  results were obtained in this task. Many voters suggested that  the National Assembly should set up a special committee to  review verdicts of some cases which were still questioned by the  people and to speed up investigation of pending cases, and that  the National Assembly should formulate law or regulations on  opposing corruption and smuggling.    Voters in many localities suggested that the state review  policies and regulations aimed at eliminating officialism and  procedures that lead to annoyances and extortion. Efforts  should be made to simplify and publicize the procedures for  issuing driving permits and registration for car and motorbike  owners.    Voters in many provinces and cities also suggested that  during the fifth session the National Assembly deputies need to  consider and evaluate the recent situation through practicing  thrift and combating corruption and smuggling. Voters in some  localities suggested that in order to implement the National  Assembly's resolution on practicing thrift and combating  corruption and smuggling, there should be a motivational  campaign for the masses with good coordination between criticism  and suppression. Importance should be attached to the tasks of  law building; avoiding redundant, conflicting, or inconsistent  laws and regulations; and solving conflicts between economic  interests and responsibilities.  <H5>  Voters' Opinions on the National Assembly's Legislative </H5> Tasks.    According to the reports of provincial National Assembly  deputy groups, voters acknowledge the National Assembly's  efforts in its law building activities. The large number of  laws passed in 1993 -- such as the law on land, the law on tax  on agricultural land use, the law on oil and gas, the law on  business bankruptcy, and the draft laws to be passed in the  National Assembly's current fifth session -- are proof of the  National Assembly's good performance of its legislative  function, thus contributing actively to building a law-governed  state in socialist Vietnam.    Voters, however, expressed great concern over ineffective  law  enforcement. They think one cause is the lack of guidance,  education, and mass motivation in law enforcement. Voters  suggested that adequate funds should be allocated to law  education campaigns and effective measures should be developed  to consolidate and clean up agencies in charge of investigation,  prosecution, and jurisdiction.    Voters in many provinces and cities held that the  publication  of draft laws in the print media -- giving people the chance to  voice their opinions and suggestions -- is evidence of the  democratic and popular characteristics of legislative work,  making it a regular political activity of the people. Many  discussion sessions were held at all levels -- resident groups,  hamlets, villages, districts, cities, and so forth -- with tens  of thousands of attendees offering many valuable and useful  suggestions.    In addition, in the campaign to solicit voters' suggestions  for the National Assembly's current fifth session, the following  suggestions were raised by many voters:    -- Draft laws should be publicized early and the  discussion time should be increased so that voters have the  appropriate time to study them.    -- Along with the publication of draft laws in newspapers,  there should be additional guiding documents to make the  discussions more effective and of better quality.    -- Before a decision is made to amend a law, the law  should be reviewed to check for provisions that are no longer  suitable.    -- Voters in some localities expressed concern over the  draft amendment to the law on organization and election of  people's councils and people's committees. They submit that  several provisions in the draft contradict the 1992  Constitution. Some voters think that the new draft is not as  good as some other drafts that were brought up for discussion  before.  <H5>  Voters' General Opinions on National Assembly Activities. </H5>   Most voters expressed delight at the constant improvement of  the National Assembly's activities. They held that the National  Assembly has performed its legislative function well in the  recent past and has tried to improve its supervisory role.  Deputies' activities have also changed for the better.  Deputies have shown a high sense of responsibility, maintained  regular and close contact with the people, and listened  carefully to the people's opinions and aspirations.    Voters in many localities, however, suggested that the  National Assembly should strive to strengthen its controlling  and supervisory roles, especially over the two important  National Assembly resolutions passed by the fourth session -- on  tasks for 1994 and on practicing thrift and combating corruption  and smuggling activities. At each session, the National Assembly  should review and evaluate the implementation of its resolutions  so that it can develop suitable measures to improve  implementation.    The task of the National Assembly deputies and provincial  deputies groups to meet with voters has become more effective  and regular. They still think that deputies need to improve and  reform their communication with voters for the sake of better  quality and greater efficiency.  <H5>  Other Issues. </H5>   According to the reports of the provincial deputy groups  from  Ha Tay, Ha Bac, and Vinh Phu, the voters repeated their petition  to split their provinces.    The above is a summarized report on the opinions and  suggestions made by voters nationwide to the National Assembly.  The National Assembly Standing Committee solemnly submits this  report to the deputies and deputy groups.</p>

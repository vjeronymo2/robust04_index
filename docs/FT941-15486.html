			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Neotronics affected by European recession Neotronics Technology, the Hertfordshire-based specialist gas and water analysis equipment manufacturer, staged a modest recovery in its second half, but still reported a 23 per cent contraction in annual profits. Mr Paul Gotley, chairman, said trading remained difficult following recession in many of the group's main markets, especially Europe. Turnover for the 12 months to end-September improved to Pounds 21.4m (Pounds 19.3m), but after a deficit of some Pounds 550,000 emanating from the group's currency hedging policy and redundancy costs of Pounds 252,000, the pre-tax line fell from Pounds 3.03m to Pounds 2.33m. Mr Gotley said benefits of the acquisition in 1992 and subsequent integration of Solomat Instrumentation, the water and air quality analysis business, were becoming apparent. The results took in a full year from the offshoot, against nine months last time. Future growth, he said, depended on new technology. The formal launch of the group's Electronic Nose (Neotronics Olfactory Sensing Equipment) is scheduled for this month. The device is intended to play a substantial role in aiding manufacturers in the food and drink, cosmetic and perfume and medicine industries in quality control and product standardisation. Earnings per share dipped from 7.65p to 5.73p; a proposed final dividend of 1.75p maintains the total for the year at 2.6p.</p>

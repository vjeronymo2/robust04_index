			<p>941108 FT  08 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nice work share for those EU commissioners Sir, The photograph of Jacques Santer, the EC president, and his commissioners on your front page (October 31) reminded me of the scene at the local Jobcentre which I have to visit every fortnight - too many people chasing too few jobs. It is comforting to know that the commissioners have the opportunity to work share, and that their rates of remuneration are not affected. Roger Saoul, 78 West Hill, London SW15 2UJ</p>

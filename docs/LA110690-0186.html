			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WITH MUSTANG RANCH MEMORABILIA, IRS PLANS BAWDY, GAUDY AUCTION  </P> <P> When it comes to selling a brothel, the Internal Revenue Service has a few  hang-ups.  </P> <P> Condoms and paintings of bare-breasted women are OK at next week's tax sale of  the Mustang Ranch. But dirty movies are out.  </P> <P> Among the gaudier items to be sold when the auction of the 100-room bordello  and its contents begins Nov. 13 are teddy bears, pajamas, sequined and  feathered gowns and pocket-sized ceramic liquor bottles decorated with naked  women.  </P> <P> What's not for sale at America's best-known legal brothel is a small collection  of porno flicks that were found in the purple, mirror-walled Orgy Room when the  IRS seized the property Sept. 21 for $13 million in back taxes owed by Joe and  Sally Conforte.  </P> <P> "The IRS can't sell anything illegal," said Richard Flakus, chief collection  agent in Nevada.  </P> <P> The defunct house of ill repute has sparked interest for use as a nursing home,  a halfway house and a girls reform school, said Dierdre Pagni, an IRS manager.  </P> <P> "A religious group expressed an interest as well," she said, declining to give  details.  </P> <P> A U.S. Bankruptcy Court trustee had hoped to operate the bordello and pay off  its debts but came up against licensing and cash flow problems, and the IRS  padlocked the place before it could reopen. It had operated as a legal bawdy  house since 1971.  </P> <P> The 50 or so ladies of the night who worked there since the IRS moved in have  gone on to other ventures.  </P> <P> The IRS hopes to earn at least $1.8 million when the property falls under the  auctioneer's gavel.  </P> <P> The beds won't be sold individually. They are attached to the floor and linked  to other parts of the place via buzzers.  </P> <P> But for those who want a little of Mustang's colorful history, there are signs  posting service charges, Mustang Ranch matchbooks and complementary coupons.  </P> <P> Also in the catalog is a music box from the suite used by the bordello manager.  It plays "Somewhere My Love."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- A symposium of  officials and members of the General Federation of Trade Unions  of Korea on the immortal exploits performed by the great leader  President Kim Il-song in building trade unions was held here  Monday.    Speakers there said that one of the immortal exploits  performed by the great leader in building trade unions is that  he had provided deep roots of the federation by forming the  anti-Japanese trade union, a mass political organization of the  working class, during the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle.    They noted that another exploit is that he, basing himself  on  this tradition, founded the General Federation of Trade Unions  of Korea after the liberation of the country, and has indicated  in a scientific way the character and duty of the federation in  each period and at each stage of the development of the  revolution and wisely led the work to this end.    They also recalled that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il  has further developed in depth the idea and theory of building  the chuche-orientated trade unions and built up the  organizations into a reliable assistant and defender of the  Workers' Party of Korea.</p>

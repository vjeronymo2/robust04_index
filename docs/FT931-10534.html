			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Construction Contracts: Flood control scheme MOTT MACDONALD has been commissioned by the National Rivers Authority (Anglian Region) to design and supervise construction of the fourth and final phase of the Pounds 20m barrier banks project - this focuses on the northern and central sections of the banks. The 65km barrier banks in East Anglia protect up to 75,000ha of agricultural land and have a history stretching back some 300 years when drainage of the Fens began. Remedial works for the final northern and central phase will involve the removal of cracking clay soils and their replacement with imported fill and reprofiling of significant lengths of embankment using imported material, some of which has been won locally. In order to transport materials to the site some 10km of haul roads (generally granular sub-base over geotextile) will have to be constructed, in addition to the 35km already provided in earlier phases.</p>

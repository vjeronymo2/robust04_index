What Will It Be Like? And What Should We  Expect From It?"]    [Text] Some oracles were foretelling the speedy demise of  the new parliament even before its birth. The logic of their  arguments was as follows.    Parliament will pursue its own line and display  recalcitrance. This will not be to the liking of the president's  circle, which will decide the fate of the Federal Assembly.    No, the body of the people's elect does not afford grounds  for expectations that it will agree to play the part of  legislative decorator of the designs of the executive.  Therefore, there are perfectly realistic grounds for the  pessimistic forecasts concerning the breakup of parliament.    Nonetheless, a new "action" against the new parliament,  elected in accordance with rules laid down by the executive  itself, could prove to be almost suicidal for the latter. An  authority entangled in endless improvisations would become  helpless and unproductive and, consequently, totally unneeded,  except by the persons crowded on Olympus and around it.    A new political situation has arisen. For the president, who  came to power on a wave of almost nationwide support and who has  managed largely to lose it, the time has come to reflect in  earnest on how he will be remembered historically: a servant of  the people, to fidelity to whom he took the oath, or a  submissive servant of his immediate entourage. So from the  viewpoint of his historical reputation the first president of  Russia should abandon any thought of the breakup of the newly  elected parliament, even if the latter displays an independence  that does not suit the president.    The new parliament could perform an innovative role. It has  for the first time been formed on a multiparty basis. The  organization of its work on the principles of the interaction of  clearly structured party factions is a new aspect, which will  make it possible to represent more precisely the interests of  various groups of society and to take this more fully into  account in lawmaking.    It is important, however, that this objective possibility  not  be blocked once again by endless speechifying, wrangling, and  scuffling at the microphones. Much here will depend on who is  endowed with the right to turn the microphones on and off and  keep an eye on strict observance of the standing orders and  parliamentary procedures. Such a person is called different  things in different countries. In Germany he is the president of  parliament, in Anglophone countries, the speaker. Not to be  confused with Snickers, which, as the advertisement claims,  everyone enjoys.    For the success of the work of the Federal Assembly and,  possibly, for the fate of the fledgling Russian  parliamentarianism, in general even, it is important that the  speakers of both houses not resume the failed experiment of  making the speaker some double of the head of state. Otherwise  the country's political life would once again be reduced to a  playing of the already dog-eared "whose side are you on" card.  The danger of this primitive relapse has not been eradicated  completely. The personality of the politician who occupies this  seat is so important, therefore.    There is no doubt that the figures of speakers are  determined  on the basis of a "balance of interests." In the State Duma, on  a balance of interests of the party factions. In the Federation  Council the interests of the regions will, most likely, clash  with the position of the center, that is, the president. The  result is not obvious. There is no doubt that the members of the  Federation Council, the vast majority of whom being pragmatic  people, will treat the president's nominee for speaker with  respect. But that same pragmatism will determine the limits of  the concessions also. Would the regional leaders have sufficient  respect for Yeltsin to agree to a "Shumeyko," for example? And,  on the other hand, would the president have the patience to  "accept" a candidate of the regions who is inconvenient,  perhaps, like E. Rossel, say?    It would seem that any conflict with the upper house of  parliament would further complicate the position of the  president, who, according to the Constitution, does not have the  right to dissolve the Federation Council, incidentally. In any  event, the spread in terms of options of the relations of the  president and the regions and, accordingly, in terms of the  candidates for speaker of the Federation Council is great: from  "compromise" (Gonchar?) to radical (Tuleyev?). Any serious  complication with the Federation Council could show the  president that it is no longer 1991. The president understands  this, evidently. Do his associates understand it?  <H5>  Time of the Wreckers Is Coming to an End </H5> <H6>  Appeal of the International Democratic Reform Movement to  Members of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation </H6>   The International Democratic Reform Movement Executive  Committee welcomes the start of business of the State Duma and  the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of Russia and  wishes that it may be fruitful and constructive. We call on the  political blocs and parties and each deputy to display  state-minded wisdom, cast aside personal ambition, and  concentrate joint efforts on the revival of the fatherland. The  time of the Herostratuses and the wreckers is coming to an end,  and the time of the creators is coming, and creation in  isolation is impossible.    We express the hope that the fruitful work of the  Russian parliament will lend new impetus to the activity of the  CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, which, following the October  events, has virtually ceased. We are sure that without the  reconstitution of the common fabric of the Eurasian space no  state of the former Union can develop normally.    Our movement declares its readiness for constructive  cooperation with the new Russian parliament in any form  acceptable for this.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Liberal edges ahead in Colombian election Colombia's presidential elections were set last night to go into a second round, with preliminary returns suggesting the Liberal party candidate, Mr Ernesto Samper, had a slight lead over his nearest rival. With 67 per cent of the vote counted, Mr Samper had 45.6 per cent of the vote and his leading rival, Mr Andres Pastrana of the Conservatives, 44.3 per cent. Because neither polled 50 per cent, a second round will be held on June 19. Election day was relatively calm, following an election campaign that has not so far been marred by the violence of the previous presidential election campaign in 1990, when three presidential candidates were killed. However, abstention was high. In some polling stations fewer than 40 per cent of those eligible to vote bothered to turn out. A record 18 candidates stood for the presidency, each for the first time with a vice-president on the ballot. However, the Liberal and Conservative parties, which have dominated Colombian politics since the 19th century, continued to do so. The former guerrilla movement, M-19 - which blossomed briefly as an alternative democratic force before being co-opted into the establishment - looked set for third place. Mr Antonio Navarro, who won more than 12 per cent of the vote in 1990, had polled 4 per cent of the vote according to the preliminary returns. Voter apathy has been blamed in part on the great similarities perceived between the programmes of both leading candidates. Mr Samper, 43, has already fought one election to win the Liberal candidacy. He has campaigned for a softening of the economic modernisation programme. He has emphasised job creation, raising social investment to 15 per cent of GDP and subsidising agriculture, much which has been hit by lower tariffs. Mr Pastrana, 39, a former television presenter, senator and mayor of Bogota, also stresses social investment and education but gives the private sector a strong role in his proposals. Mr Pastrana appears to have won support from younger voters, and from a high proportion of women.</p>

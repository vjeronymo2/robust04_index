The law on public officials' elections and prevention of  electoral fraud, amendments to the political funds law, and the  local autonomy law were signed by President Kim Yong-sam on  Tuesday.    The law on public officials' elections and prevention of  electoral fraud pulled down the upper limit of election campaign  expenses while allowing free outdoor campaign speeches. The law  bars anyone convicted of violating the election law from getting  a public post for 10 years. His civil rights will also be  limited under the new law.    Moreover, the new law prohibits political parties from  admitting new members during campaign periods and bans  neighborhood meetings. Party rallies in the form of discussion  gatherings are also prohibited from 30 days before the official  campaign period and public disclosure of candidates' personal  assets is required.    Candidates or political parties can ask the government to  arbitrate in disputes over bribery, violence or meddling by  government officials in campaigns.    The new political funds law introduces a system in which all  monetary transactions must be accompanied by receipts issued by  the Central Election Management Committee [CEMC], and raises the  government's political fund subsidies to 800 won from 600 won  per voter.    In addition, it allows the formation of support  organizations  by party local chapters. It also allows collection of campaign  funds at rallies and anonymous contributions if they are  accompanied by receipts issued by the CEMC.    As for the local autonomy law, heads of local governments  are  allowed to ask the voters about decisions on major issues.</p>

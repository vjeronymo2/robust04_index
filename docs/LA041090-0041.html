			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO GOING 'PRIVATE' TO FUND ROADS, PORTS, PHONES  </P> <P> For a country with a virtually empty treasury, Mexico has ambitious plans.  </P> <P> By the time his term ends in 1995, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has  promised 2,400 miles of new, four-lane highways and bridges, a $10-billion  overhaul of the antiquated telephone system and increased spending on social  services.  </P> <P> So how does the Harvard-educated economist expect to pay for this? A big part  of the answer is privatization -- handing over major parts of the economy to  private enterprise.  </P> <P> Salinas and his predecessor, Miguel de la Madrid, have cut the number of  state-owned companies to 746 from the 1,155 there were in 1983. Another 344 are  slated for divestiture -- either by sale, liquidation or gift.  </P> <P> As a turn-around strategy for corporations, the plan is classic: Spin off  peripheral subsidiaries and invest the money from the sales in the core  business.  </P> <P> The question is whether the strategy can work for a nation like Mexico, where a  system of state economic dominance has assured political stability. That system  has been in place as long as Eastern Europe was Communist.  </P> <P> Salinas has made some adjustments.  </P> <P> To ensure adequate investment in the divested companies, sales agreements often  are conditioned on buyers' commitments to modernize plants and equipment that  the financially strapped government has neglected.  </P> <P> Besides selling off companies, the government is taking bids from corporations  to build toll roads, ports, thermoelectric plants and cellular telephone  systems, public projects that previous Mexican administrations would have  undertaken themselves.  </P> <P> Corporations finance the projects and operate them long enough to recover their  costs and turn a profit -- by charging tolls, for instance, in the case of  roads. Afterward, they will turn the projects over to the government.  </P> <P> Early results are positive.  </P> <P> A badly needed bridge is under construction between El Paso, Tex., and the  neighboring Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez. Roads are being built between the  industrial centers of Monterrey and Nuevo Leon in the north as well as between  the resorts of Cuernavaca and Acapulco in central Mexico.  </P> <P> Government subsidies to state-owned companies fell to less than $500 million in  1989, contrasted with $5.4 billion in 1982.  </P> <P> That has freed money for other uses. This year, for example, the federal budget  for education increased -- after adjustment for inflation -- for the first time  in eight years.  </P> <P> The sales have also permitted better economies of scale, supporting the  country's export drive.  </P> <P> The Monterrey-based Alfa Group, one of Mexico's largest industrial  conglomerates, was able to consolidate marketing and administrative operations  after buying a state-owned company that makes ingredients used to manufacture  synthetic cloth. The acquisition complemented plants that Alfa already owned,  said Juan Morales Doria, executive vice president of the corporation.  </P> <P> Even the union leaders in some state-owned companies see a positive side to  privatization. The leader of workers at Telefonos de Mexico has called for  rapid privatization of the government-owned telephone company. Meanwhile, the  head of the oil workers union has said the petrochemical industry needs private  investment in order to modernize.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, there are concerns about the long-term consequences of  privatization. They range from fears that the soundest companies are being  sold, leaving the weakest to founder, to outright skepticism about the motives  behind the sales.  </P> <P> Underlying such worries are questions about how far the government will go in  privatizing industry and about what will be left of the implicit economic and  social pacts that have kept Mexico stable.  </P> <P> At the heart of these pacts was an economic system that Mexicans call state  capitalism. That system made the government responsible for the bulk of  Mexico's investment capital, providing not just roads and schools but also raw  materials at subsidized prices for domestic manufacturers.  </P> <P> For 30 years after World War II, the system seemed to work. The economy grew at  an average rate of 6% a year. However, fiscal deficits also grew as the  government absorbed failing companies to save jobs and assure continued  domestic production of everything from buses to refrigerators.  </P> <P> A decade ago, the government tried to cover these deficits by exporting oil  from the state-owned petroleum monopoly, then by taking out billions of dollars  in foreign loans.  </P> <P> The effort backfired. Plummeting oil prices and soaring interest rates  increased the deficits as the government struggled to keep up debt payments.  There was no money to buy planes for the government's two commercial airlines  or new equipment for the 64 state-owned sugar mills.  </P> <P> That forced Mexico's leaders to re-examine the country's economic strategy.  </P> <P> Encouraged by its creditors, Mexico opted to give private enterprise a greater  role in the economy.  </P> <P> De la Madrid, who was president then, scrapped plans for 80 new state companies  that existed in name only. Special funds that provided low-interest loans for  everything from financing roads and bridges in border areas to promoting  manufactured exports were abolished and their functions taken over by state  development agencies.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the sales and liquidations began. By early 1986, the government had  put 172 companies -- from hotels to auto parts makers -- up for sale.  </P> <P> At that time, the government said that the telephone company, airlines, steel  mills, food-processing plants and a state-subsidized grocery chain were  strategic and would remain in government hands. Since then, the airlines and at  least one of the food-processing plants have been sold.  </P> <P> The telephone company and grocery stores were among the 66 companies targeted  for sale at the beginning of this year. Last month, the names of two major  steel mills and all state-owned mining interests were added to the for-sale  list.  </P> <P> Today, the industries that remain strategic -- untouchable, not for sale -- are  electric power, banking, oil and basic petrochemicals. But as more companies  are sold, rumors persist that even parts of these industries will eventually go  on the auction block.  </P> <P> These concerns about the future exacerbate present worries that the government  has sold larger, profitable or easily restructured companies, while smaller,  troubled state companies have languished without buyers.  </P> <P> Government officials partially addressed that concern last month by announcing  plans to package the small companies in groups for sale to venture capitalists.  </P> <P> Not everyone in Mexico accepts the government's strategy.  </P> <P> Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, Salinas' strongest opponent in the 1988 presidential  election, has been especially outspoken in criticizing privatization.  </P> <P> Buyers include multinational corporations -- for example, Anglo-Dutch  Unilever's $74 million purchase of a cooking oil and pasta plant near Mexico  City -- and Mexican entrepreneurs. Consortiums of foreign and Mexican  businesses have been assembled for large buyouts, such as that of Mexicana  Airlines for $140 million.  </P> <P> Cardenas said he would have preferred to see companies simply given to their  workers. The government has given 20 companies to worker groups and another 29  are scheduled for such transfers this year.  </P> <P> Most of the firms transferred have been agricultural distribution and marketing  companies, which were given to farming cooperatives. Worker groups also get  preference in sales of companies. However, such sales have not always been  successful.  </P> <P> For example, the National Farmers' Federation was the winning bidder in the  January, 1988, sale of Algodonera Comercial Mexicana, a cotton marketing firm.  But by August, 1988, the farmers were missing payments, and the government  repossessed the company.  </P> <P> Early in the Salinas administration, the company was sold again, this time to a  group headed by a Mexican businessman for $737,000 in cash and $2 million to be  paid after the company is reorganized.  </P> <P> The Mexican government has been quick to turn down some multinationals.  Chrysler's offer for DINA, a consortium of auto parts and bus manufacturing  companies, was rejected as inadequate in October, 1988. A year later, the  company was sold to a group of Mexican entrepreneurs.  </P> <P> Such examples illustrate both the setbacks the Mexican government has  encountered in its privatization efforts and the determination of the Salinas  administration to overcome setbacks.  </P></p>

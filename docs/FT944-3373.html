			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Brussels delays VAT proposal The European Commission yesterday announced it is delaying publication of proposals setting out a value added tax regime to make business transactions across Europe's single market simpler and swifter. The announcement is a setback to Commission ambitions to establish a common system of VAT between member states, with businesses only required to register once to trade within it. It also raises doubts about the likelihood that the switch from existing transition arrangements to the definitive regime will be made on the scheduled date of January 1 1997. Mrs Christiane Scrivener, commissioner responsible for indirect taxation, said it would be 'premature' to produce proposals before the end of the year. She said the transitional arrangements had been a success and that it would be dangerous to change them at this stage. Instead the Commission will launch a green paper, to be published by the end of March, examining options for the definitive regime.</p>

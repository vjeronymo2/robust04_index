			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAC PARANOIA: CONGRESS FACES CAMPAIGN SPENDING;  </P> <P> POLITICS: HYSTERIA WAS THE OPERATIVE WORD WHEN LEGISLATORS REALIZED THEY COULD  NOT RETURN HOME WITHOUT TOUGHER CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS.  </P> <P> A veteran Democratic aide explained recently why senators were so eager to pass  legislation tightening federal campaign-finance laws. "Everyone is hysterical,"  the Senate staffer said. "They want to pass a bill. No matter what is in it."  </P> <P> Hysteria, however carefully concealed, aptly characterizes how members of  Congress from both parties have recently handled a host of problems related to  an increasingly toxic and controversial mix: Setting and enforcing rules on the  connection between money and politics.  </P> <P> The frantic haste by both the Senate and House to pass campaign-finance bills  in the final days and hours before they began their August recess gave the best  evidence of the volatile financial-political brew. On display were both the  politicians' continuing fears of the problem, real or perceived, of  special-interest money and their unwillingness to make the fundamental changes  required to reduce the influence.  </P> <P> In the current political climate, many lawmakers feared going home without  being able to tell their constituents that they had confronted the  special-interest groups. But they were wary of causing self-inflicted wounds by  cutting off the sources of campaign money on which they have become so  dependent.  </P> <P> The Senate Democrats' plan passed, 59-40, over the objection of all but five  Republicans, after months of back-room negotiations. It would impose voluntary  spending limits pegged to a state's population, give reduced broadcast and mail  rates as incentives to candidates who agree to abide by the limits and ban  contributions from political-action committees (PACs). The level of hypocrisy  matched the hysteria. The Senate Democrats' agreement to the PAC ban and a  reduction from $1,000 to $250 in the ceiling on campaign gifts from  out-of-state contributors triggered strong objections from agitated party  insiders. These monetary sources, have been far more important to Democrats  than to Republican candidates, who raise more of their funds in smaller amounts  by mail.  </P> <P> GOP senators, for their part, said that they opposed the Democratic demand for  spending limits. That change, they said, would benefit incumbent senators, most  of whom are Democrats, and would be detrimental to lesser-known challengers who  must spend more money to spread their message. But the Republican claim  sidesteps the fact that because nearly all incumbents raise far more than do  their challengers, a spending limit could help to level the playing field.  </P> <P> Although House Democrats also included a spending limit, their package differed  significantly from that of their Senate brethren. The House bill preserved  PACs, setting a $275,000 ceiling on the total that a candidate could raise from  them. That limit exceeds the amount that more than 300 House members raised  from special-interest groups in 1988. The House bill also failed to restrict  large, out-of-state contributions which, according to campaign-finance experts,  are more likely to be given in exchange for influence-peddling. The most  egregious aspect of the House charade came when a more sweeping Democratic  version initially passed on a voice vote, partly with the help of silent  Republicans who opposed the stiffer version. Embarrassed Democrats quickly  regrouped and defeated the "good-government" version, 122-128; 158 members,  mostly Republicans, voted "present" to protest each version.  </P> <P> In both the House and Senate, members were willing to pursue the partisan  imperative because they were confident Bush would fulfill his promise to veto a  campaign-finance bill with spending limits.  </P> <P> A week before the Senate passed the campaign-finance bill, it voted to denounce  Sen. Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.) for violating Senate rules limiting outside  income and restricting the use of a home-state condominium. Although the vote  was 96-0, the debate prompted heated exchanges on the standards for proper  financial behavior.  </P> <P> Several senators nearly jumped down each other's throat as they discussed the  committee's investigatory procedures in the Durenberger case. "I was not  present during the public hearing but I watched it on TV," said Sen. Don  Nickles (R-Okla.) "I did not really see a special counsel (in charge of the  investigation.) I saw a prosecutor. And it bothered me." Sen. Warren Rudman  (R-N.H.) heatedly responded on behalf of the Ethics Committee: "It is offensive  to me personally to have Robert Bennett (the special counsel) referred to that  way."  </P> <P> Paying rapt attention, though not participating, on the Senate floor were the  "Keating Five," the senators -- including Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) -- accused  of seeking regulatory favors in exchange for campaign funds from Charles H.  Keating Jr., the discredited and bankrupt savings-and-loan boss. The Ethics  Committee may issue preliminary rulings in their case next month.  </P> <P> Most senators have little to say publicly about the Keating case. But they are  well aware of the potentially damaging impact on the senators under  investigation. Like Durenberger, none of the five face reelection this November  and they are attempting to carry on with business as usual.  </P> <P> A mood of hysteria also has increasingly surrounded the onset of this  November's election. Many lawmakers, Democrats and Republicans, have been edgy  lately as they prepare for a fall campaign in which "incumbent" may be a  nine-letter political synonym for "scum."  </P> <P> Politicians have abundant financial problems to answer for in this fall's  campaign: the catastrophic S&amp;L mess; the federal deficit and, lest we  forget, the 25% pay raise that House members voted themselves last fall after  rejecting a 50% boost.  </P> <P> In each case, members of Congress understand that they have been part of an  institutional failure to respond to real problems. In the past, most of them  have been able to keep their distance, as individuals, from these hot wires.  The difference in 1990 may be that voters are demanding accountability and  seeking culprits.  </P> <P> Pollsters from both parties have found a drop of roughly 10%, when they ask  voters whether they are inclined to reelect incumbents. Most lawmakers will  survive this year if only because few face opponents who are even semi-credible  or have adequate financing. But both parties are gearing up for surprise  election setbacks.  </P> <P> This atmosphere helps to explain why one of the most popular political  activities these days is the lineup of nervous incumbents, in a modern-day act  of expatiation, returning their contributions from savings-and-loan executives.  Whether their new-found purity removes their earlier sins will be up to the  voters.  </P></p>

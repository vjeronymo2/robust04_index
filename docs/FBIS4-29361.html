			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The Posts and  Telecommunications Ministry should hike the limit on its life  insurance policies to allow for more medical care and welfare  for Japan's aging population, an advisory group to the ministry  said in a report Thursday [16 June]. The midterm report was  drawn up by a private group commissioned by the head of the  ministry's Post Office Life Insurance Bureau.    Noting that the current limit of 10 million yen for life  insurance policyholders is not enough for high-quality coverage,  the report urged the ministry to allow more expensive policies  and pointed to a need for the contents of coverage to be  improved. The report also urged active marketing of  high-quality policies in the area outside of life and standard  nonlife insurance.    The sector, which includes cancer and nursing care coverage,  is dominated by foreign companies and the United States is  requesting the sector's liberalization to be put on hold.</p>

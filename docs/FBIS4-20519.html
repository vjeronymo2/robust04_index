			<p>Research   in Eastern Germany   <F P=102> BR0403160794 Bonn TECHNOLOGIE-NACHRICHTEN  MANAGEMENT-INFORMATIONEN in German 14 Jan 94 p 2 </F>  <F P=103> BR0403160794 </F> <F P=104>  Bonn TECHNOLOGIE-NACHRICHTEN  MANAGEMENT-INFORMATIONEN </F>  <F P=105>  German </F> BFN     [Text] The Commission of the European Union has just agreed  to the extension of three special measures designed to promote  industrial research in the new federal laender. These funding  measures, which are specially tailored to the needs of small-  and medium-sized enterprises [SMEs], were launched back in 1990  and 1991 and have already achieved initial positive results in  terms of the stabilization of industrial research in the new  federal laender. The [word omitted in original] of industrial  research in the new federal laender was primarily up to private  industry, stressed Federal Research Minister Dr. Paul Krueger,  although the radical changes that the new laender were currently  undergoing necessitated a substantial commitment on the part of  the state over a transitional period. The three special  measures concerned consist in:    1. Funding for R&amp;D Staff Expansion    SME's receive subsidies equivalent to 50 percent of the  salaries of scientists and engineers newly recruited to set up  or expand their in-house R&amp;D capability. Since 1990, 932  mainly  small, innovative businesses have been funded to the tune of 45  million German marks [DM], making it possible to secure 2,800  industrial research jobs.    The deadline for applications for inclusion in this measure  has been extended to 31 December 1995.    2. Contract Research East    Also since 1990, SME's have been receiving 50-percent  subsidies when they award R&amp;D contracts to specialized  R&amp;D  contractors in Germany and abroad. This offer of funding has to  date been taken up by 863 businesses for 1,273 R&amp;D contracts.  Subsidies totaling DM110.4 million have thus set contracts for  an overall value of DM225 million in motion.    3. Contract Research West-East    This measure supports research facilities and firms that  obtain R&amp;D contracts from elsewhere, in particular from the  original federal laender and eastern Europe, with 35- to  40-percent subsidies. The rate of take-up is particularly  brisk, and the trend is extremely satisfactory. The measure  helps the research facilities in the new federal laender to  adapt to market requirements. Since 1991, 485 facilities have  taken advantage of this program to win a total of 1,024 R&amp;D  contracts for an overall value of DM208 million, the BMFT  [Federal Ministry of Research and Technology] share amounting to  DM80.8 million. Between them, these two varieties of contract  research contributed to the preservation of about 2,000 jobs in  industry-oriented research in 1993.    The deadline for applications for inclusion under these two  measures has been extended to 31 December 1994, after which  firms may apply to the nationwide "Joint Research in the SME  Economy" program, which has recently been relaunched by the BMFT  and, if initial impressions are anything to go by, is really  gathering momentum.</p>

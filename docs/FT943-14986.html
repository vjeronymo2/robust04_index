			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Observer: MI6 remains inscrutable Bad luck all those who hoped that MI6, that branch of Britain's intelligence service which supposedly concentrates on keeping Britain safe from foreign spies, would be adopting as high a public profile as its sister organisation, MI5. The Secret Intelligence Service has moved quietly into its expensive new Vauxhall Cross HQ, adjacent to London's Vauxhall Bridge, without even bothering to have an official opening to thank the representatives of the British taxpayer. It admits to a postcode (SE1 1BD), but its new telephone number remains a state secret. Indeed, the secrecy is such that Observer hears Britain's taxpayers can no longer use the coin-operated public telescope on the other side of the River Thames to inspect the country's substantial investment in MI6. It disappeared in mysterious circumstances earlier this year and cannot be traced. So much for the openness of government promised by the prime minister.</p>

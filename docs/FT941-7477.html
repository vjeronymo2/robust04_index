			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: SKF posts return to the black SKF, the largest maker of ball and roller bearings, signalled it had turned the corner to better times yesterday when it announced its first quarterly operating profit for two years and sharply reduced losses for 1993. The group made a SKr40m (Dollars 5.04m) profit after financial items in the last three months of the year, reversing a SKr1.42bn deficit in the same 1992 period. This reduced losses for the full-year to SKr669m, compared with SKr1.77bn in 1992. The group predicted a profit for 1994, helped by improving market conditions and the benefits of cost-cutting. It noted that the European market, which accounts for 60 per cent of sales, was picking up, even though the German and French markets remain weak. The weaker krona enabled the group to raise 1993 sales by 10 per cent to SKr29.2m from SKr26.6m. Adjusted for disposals and currency factors, sales fell 4 per cent because increased demand for the group's products in North America and the Asia Pacific region was unable to offset weak trends in Europe. The group was badly hit by the downturn in Europe's car industry, its most important customer segment, although it noted that its own sales fell less than the overall 15 per cent decline in car sales. At the operating level, profits amounted to SKr97m, compared with a SKr1.18bn loss in 1992. However, financial expenses increased to SKr766m from SKr592m as the weak krona increased the cost of financing foreign currency loans. The group's main bearings and seals unit cut losses sharply to SKr329m from SKr1.26bn as sales rose to SKr27.2bn from SKr22.7bn. There was also a reduced deficit at Ovako Steel, where losses fell to SKr351m from SKr442m despite a 6 per cent drop in sales to SKr2.89bn. The loss per share before extraordinary items was SKr5.70, compared with SKr13.20 in 1992.</p>

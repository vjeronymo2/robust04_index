			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / World Trade News: US nears tuna deal with Mexico THE US and Mexico are near accord on arrangements to end dolphin deaths in tuna fishing nets, paving the way for lifting the US embargo on imports of yellowfin tuna from Mexico, Venezuela and some 20 other nations. The embargo was condemned by a Gatt disputes panel last year as against international fair trade rules, to the fury of environmental groups who want to use trade sanctions to enforce 'green' behaviour. Mr Jesus Seade, Mexico's ambassador to Gatt, told its governing council yesterday that the proposed multilateral accord would involve a five-year moratorium from March 1994 on yellowfin tuna fishing using purse nets in the eastern tropical Pacific. Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, said the White House was putting forward legislation to Congress to promote an international solution to dolphin protection and end the embargo. The Gatt panel on the US embargo, imposed on Mexico, Venezuela and about 20 countries re-exporting yellowfin tuna from these two countries, was originally requested by Mexico. It later dropped the issue to promote talks on a North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>

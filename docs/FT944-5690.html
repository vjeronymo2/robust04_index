			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Railway inspector numbers increased The Health and Safety Executive has increased the number of railway inspectors to 46 in response to the proposed privatisation of British Rail. The addition of eight inspectors comes in a year in which the number of crashes involving passenger trains doubled, although the number of passengers and staff killed on the railways in 1993-94 was the lowest on record, the executive's railway inspectorate said in its annual report. Mr Stanley Robertson, the chief railways inspector said the extra inspectors were required because companies 'with little or no previous experience of operating on the railway and managers with limited experience of safety issues may enter the railway industry as the BR monopoly is broken. 'Unless considerable care is taken, there can be no confidence that risk will be effectively controlled right from the start and that important matters will not fall between the safety arrangements of the various parties.' New regulations had been introduced and companies involved in railway operations were required to present 'safety cases' explaining their procedures. Even so, 'co-operation and safety interaction between operators will be an important element in safety cases,' the report said. Railtrack, which has taken over BR's track and stations, has had its safety case accepted by the inspectorate. But others have not been sufficiently detailed. The number of 'significant' train accidents - those potentially the most dangerous to passengers - increased from 133 to 142 in the year to March. Passenger deaths fell to 17 from 28 the year before.

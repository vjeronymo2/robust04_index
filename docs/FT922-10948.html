			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Rand Mines falls sharply THE WEAK gold price and higher operating costs combined to cut net profits by 71 per cent for the four gold mines in the Rand Mines group during the March quarter. After-tax profit dropped to R7.3m (Dollars 2.54m) from R25m the previous quarter. The results testify to how vulnerable marginal gold producers are to small variations in the cost of mining, or the price of gold. Total ore milled, average yield and gold production, at 11.6 tonnes, was virtually unchanged from the previous quarter. However, total costs rose by nearly 5 per cent to R370m while revenues were lower because the average gold price received dropped 2.3 per cent to R32,817 per kg. Only the Blyvooruitzicht mine made a working profit from its underground operations. The other mines enjoyed relief from their surface operations, but Harmony is near the end of its surface reserves and the reserves at ERPM and Durban Deep are very low grade. The main cause of the fall in group profits was the performance of Harmony, by far the largest of the group's mines, and the largest marginal producer in the industry. Its net profit declined to R6m from R18.3m, in spite of increasing underground gold production.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" Program] </F>   [Text] Four Russian submarines, currently in the Pacific  Fleet, will leave Russian territorial waters in the near future  to join the naval forces of North Korea. TOKYO SHIMBUN  newspaper reported in its evening issue [date not given] that a  contract on export of the submarines has already been signed by  representatives of Moscow and Pyongyang. Quoting a high-ranking  source in the Pacific Fleet command, the newspaper claims that  talks with North Korea on delivery of four submarines have been  conducted by representatives of the Russian naval forces in  complete secrecy.    The sum of contract is not known. Currently, the submarines  schedule to leave for DPRK are being used for training purposes  and are practically unsuitable for combat missions. They were  all built in the sixties. A source in the Pacific Fleet command  assessed that after necessary repairs, the submarines would join  the North Korean combat subunits. However, it is not out of  the question that they would be dismantled, and the spare parts  used to repair other North Korean submarines.</p>

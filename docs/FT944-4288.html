			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / S Korean carworkers strike Workers from four South Korean motor vehicle companies yesterday staged strikes to protest at the government's decision to allow Samsung to produce passenger cars. The stoppagereflects worries that Samsung's entry into the car industry will result in production overcapacity that could threaten the future of one or more current manufacturers. The strikes involved Kia Motors, its truck subsidiary Asia Motors, Daewoo Motor and Ssangyong Motor, all of which are considered vulnerable to a challenge by Samsung. A refusal to strike by workers at Hyundai, the country's largest carmaker, weakened the industrial action.</p>

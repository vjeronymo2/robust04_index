			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER SHORTAGES IN SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> In typically bureaucratic fashion, the editorial again suggests support to  restrictions on watering lawns and gardens as apparently the key solution to  water conservation. I'll bet my mortgage we "faceless dogs" will next be told  to establish rigid accountability of how often we wash our armpits and flush  our toilets.  </P> <P> Come on! Is this our best shot? No way!  </P> <P> I fully appreciate the need for water conservation but I expect water  conservation measures to be more creative, widespread, and practiced equally by  all users.  </P> <P> It is especially disturbing to me to see construction of street medians and  freeway sidings consisting of grass, shrubs and trees that require regular  watering, and other maintenance we can ill afford. Where are the regulations  that put restrictions on these extravagant practices and place heavy fines on  violations?  </P> <P> I say ban the use of vegetation entirely, wherever feasible, and encourage the  use of brick/stone or other materials that require no water at all. Where  vegetation is permitted, the watering should be of the drip/soak type.  </P> <P> JIM DE LEO  </P> <P> La Verne  </P></p>

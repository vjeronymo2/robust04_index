The Rostov Interior Department  informed INTERFAX that the terrorists were being detained at a  preliminary investigation prison in the city. The investigation  is expected to continue in the new year.    According to INTERFAX reporters, on Thursday the local  administration is planning a reception for the participants in  the operation to release the hostages.    Meanwhile, the Chechen Interior Ministry has informed  INTERFAX that not a single dollar banknote has been found on the  territory of the Chechen republic: The terrorists claimed that  they scattered banknotes flying over the republic. Earlier  reports said several banknotes were found near Mineralnyye Vody.  It is believed that the terrorists scattered the banknotes when  they flew on a helicopter from Mineralnyye Vody to Makhachkala  with the purpose of misleading law enforcement bodies.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Business may win postal discounts LARGE BUSINESS users may be given greater scope to secure discounts from the Post Office through sorting their own letters and delivering them in bulk to designated collection points, Mr Edward Leigh, junior trade and industry minister, told the Commons yesterday, Ivor Owen writes. While ruling out complete deregulation of letter deliveries, he indicated that the wider use of 'downstream access' to introduce greater competition was among the options being considered. Insisting that full de-regulation would not be appropriate, Mr Leigh said 'some routes would be inherently unprofitable, and a free market would not provide them at an affordable price'. Mr Leigh reaffirmed that it was intended to maintain a universal postal service with a uniform tariff so as not to disadvantage less accessible areas. On the privatisation of Parcelforce, the Post Office's parcels division, he said the government was still considering the timing and the most appropriate method.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nevetheless, the trading of options based on the Index, including long-term options based on either the full or a reduced-value of the Index, raises several concerns, namely issue related to customer protection, index design, surveillance, and market impact. The Commission believes, for the reasons discussed below, that the Amex has adequately addressed these concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Customer Protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as Hong Kong Option Index options, can commence on a national securities exchange. The Commission notes that the trading of standardized exchange-traded options occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure, among other things, that; (1) The special risks of options are disclosed to public customers; (2) only investors capable of evaluating and bearing the risks of options trading are engaged in such trading; and (3) special compliance procedure are applicable to options accounts. Accordingly, because the Index options will be subject to the same regulatory regime as the other standardized options currently traded on the Amex, the Commission believes that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection of investors in Index options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Index Design and Structure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that it is appropriate and consistent with the Act to classify the Index as a broad-based index. In addition, the basic character of the reduced-value Hong Kong Option Index, which is comprised of the same component securities as the Hong Kong Option Index, and calculated by dividing the Hong Kong Option Index by ten, is essentially identical to the Hong Kong Option Index. Specifically, the Commission believes the Index is broad-based because it reflects a substantial segment of the Hong Kong equities market. First, the Index consists of 30 actively traded stocks traded on the HKSE. Second, the total capitalization of the Index, as of February 28, 1994, was US$222.214 billion, with the market capitalization of the individual stocks in the Index ranging from a high of US$23.48 billion to a low of US$549 million, with a median value of US$3.89 billion. Third, the Index includes stocks of companies from a broad range of industries and no industry segment comprises more than 25.78% of the Index's total value. Fourth, no single stock comprises more than 14.92% of the Index's total value and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index accounts for 45.86% of the Index's value. Fifth, the Index component stock listing and maintenance criteria will serve to ensure that the Index maintains its broad representative sample of stocks in the Hong Kong stock market. <FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>  Accordingly, the Commission believes it is appropriate to classify the Index as broad-based.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33036,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 5. The Amex has represented that the companies included in the Index represent at least thirty different broad categories of business covering almost the entire range of business activity conducted in Hong Kong.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id., citing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> letter from Nathan Most, Senior Vice President, New Products Development, Amex to Richard Zack, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated August 17, 1993. SR-Amex&hyph;93&hyph;14.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Surveillance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In evaluating derivative instruments, the Commission, consistent with the protection of investors, considers the degree to which the derivative instrument is susceptible to manipulation. The ability to obtain information necessary to detect and deter market manipulation and other trading abuses is a critical factor in the Commission's evaluation. It is for this reason that the Commission requires that there be a surveillance sharing agreement in place between an exchange listing or trading derivative product and the exchange(s) trading the stocks underlying the derivative contract, and that the agreement specifically enables officials to surveil trading in the derivative product and its underlying stocks. <FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>  Such agreements provide a necessary deterrent to manipulation because they facilitate the availability of information needed to investigate fully a potential manipulation if it were to occur. For foreign stock index derivative products, these agreements are especially important to facilitate the collection of necessary regulatory, surveillance and other information from foreign jurisdictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that a surveillance sharing agreement should provide the parties thereto with the ability to obtain information necessary to detect and deter market manipulation and other trading abuses. Consequently, the Commission generally requires that a surveillance sharing agreement require that the parties to the agreement provide each other, upon request, information about market trading activity, clearing activity, and the identity of the ultimate purchasers and sellers of securities.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another change from existing rules concerns who can become an EPN user. Because EPN is essentially a sophisticated e-mail/database system that does not involve traditional clearance or settlement functions, the risk to MBS from defaulting EPN users is limited to their fees. As a result, the standards for applicants to become EPN users are significantly less demanding than those which are applicable to applicants that wish to become full participants of MBS. It is anticipated that some applicants that do not qualify as full participants of MBS may still qualify and be able to become EPN users. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the EPN service will time stamp messages, the new rules provide that this time stamp will be valid, binding, and enforceable as a determination of good delivery of the message. Under EPN, when a seller initiates a pool notification message and EPN receives and redelivers the message to the buyer, this action will represents the good delivery of the message because it is made available to the buyer whether or not the buyer physically retrieves the message. The buyer's retrieval of the physical message is not part of the good delivery process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rules also provide that several reports will be issued to EPN users. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  In addition, the new EPN rules provide for an EPN user fund. This is intended to be similar in purpose to but smaller in scope than the existing MBS participants fund. The EPN user fund is intended to protect MBS in the event that any EPN user defaults in payments of fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> One of the reports issued by MBS to EPN users, the Message Detail Report, will constitute a confirmation. The Message Detail Report, which lists the contents of each message, will constitute the sole confirmation of messages between EPN users to be processed by MBS. As the sole confirmation, the Message Detail Report will evidence a valid, binding, and enforceable contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that MBS's proposed rule change is consistent with Section 7A of the Act <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  and in particular with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  Section 17A(b)(3)(F) requires, among other things, that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. The Commission believes that MBS's proposal to establish the electronic pool notification service is consistent with this obligation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(F) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, in order for participants in the mortgage-backed securities market to notify other participants of pool information, they must manually telephone or fax the information to other participants. Historically, billions of dollars of fails have occurred and continue to occur each month because sellers are not able to communicate with buyers because of the buyer's telephone and fax limitations ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , busy signals preventing the exchange of information). The establishment of the EPN service should help to significantly prevent fails in the mortgage-backed securities market by making the notification process more efficient and more reliable by replacing a manually intensive communication system with an electronic communication system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

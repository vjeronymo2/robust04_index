			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Water company appeals to MMC on price caps South West Water yesterday became the first privatised utility to appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission over the 10-year price limits set by the industry regulator in July. The MMC's decision will affect only South West Water. This contrasts with British Gas's appeal in 1992 over proposed rates of return on its pipeline and storage business, as opposed to price caps. The company requested an industry-wide review of the gas market. South West last night wrote to Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of the Office of Water Services, asking him to refer his findings on price increases and connection charges in two separate appeals. The process, which will begin next month, is expected to take up to six months. South West is believed to have prepared a detailed submission for the MMC, arguing it has been singled out from the other nine UK water and sewerage companies for particularly harsh treatment. The regulator is widely thought to have taken a tougher approach with South West, as it has had the highest charges and price increases since privatisation in 1989. A crucial element of South West's position is believed to be that three years ago Ofwat promised the company price increases after 1995 similar to its current 11.5 percentage points above inflation. This was necessary, South West argues, to fund increased investment obligations agreed with Ofwat. In the event, Mr Byatt has said South West may raise prices by 1.5 percentage points above inflation next year - a ratio known as the K factor. This falls sharply to an average K of 0.5 over 10 years. It is estimated that each point increase in K adds roughly Pounds 2m to South West's revenues. The company is likely to argue it must have a K of between 3 and 5 to meet its obligations. The price review has also reduced South West's charges for connecting customers to water and sewerage networks from Pounds 1,189 to Pounds 400. This could hit South West's revenues by up to Pounds 5m a year. Mr Byatt has also allowed only about half the Pounds 1bn investment requested by South West for the next 10 years. South West will press the argument that it has been singled out by claiming that, unlike other companies, Mr Byatt has not allowed a budget for issues such as foul flooding and river discharges. South West will also argue that Ofwat has not taken account of the unique demands on its services which lead to higher costs. The company's network must serve 1.5m residents and the 6m tourists who visit the region every year. The company is also likely to ask why Mr Byatt ranks it as average or below on efficiency when an independent study that he commissioned shows the utility performing on average or above.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Aftershock of rebels' revolt will rumble on In the end, only a handful of Tories defied the government last night but the consequences of the mini-rebellion are likely to rumble on for months, with serious consequences for the government, as well as the rebels. Most of the 18 Eurosceptics who last week signed a motion opposing the European Communities Finance bill fell into line in the face of Mr John Major's determination to call a general election if the bill was defeated. But seven hard-core MPs abstained in a crucial vote on a Labour amendment. They were: Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend E), Mrs Teresa Gorman (Billericay), Mr Tony Marlow (Northampton N), Mr Nicholas Budgen (Wolverhampton SW), Mr Richard Shepherd (Aldridge Brownhills), Mr John Wilkinson (Ruislip Northwood) and Mr Christopher Gill (Ludlow). Mr Michael Carttiss (Great Yarmouth) abstained on the second reading division, after voting with the government on the amendment. Mr Richard Ryder, the government chief whip, immediately wrote to the seven MPs who abstained on the amendment, withdrawing the Conservative whip - effectively suspending them from the parliamentary party. It was unclear whether Mr Carttiss would also be suspended. Withdrawal of the whip is a serious punishment which bans MPs from taking part in the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, from sitting on back-bench Tory committees, or voting on party issues such as the election of a new leader. Tory MPs said it was the first mass withdrawal of the whip since the second world war. The consequences could be serious for the government, which theoretically loses their support and sees its majority cut from 14 to zero. In theory, Mr Major will find himself leading a government with a Commons minority of two if Mr Carttiss is also disciplined, and three if Labour, as expected, wins the forthcoming by-election in Dudley West. He could even find himself with a minority of five if Sir Richard Body (Holland with Boston), carries out a threat to resign the whip in protest at the drift of government policy. In practice, Mr Major can rely on the support of the rebels on most issues, and on the 10 Ulster unionist MPs, all of whom voted with the government in both divisions last night. However, the technical loss of support will make the management of the government's parliamentary business more difficult, and could threaten control of important parliamentary committees. Most of the rebels will probably try to emulate Mr Rupert Allason (Torbay), whose suspension from the Tory whip for abstaining in the Maastricht vote last year, was lifted after he apologised and demonstrated an impeccable voting record of support for the government. If they remain in the cold, they could be prevented from standing as official Conservative candidates at the next general election, effectively ending their parliamentary careers. Some rebels, including Mrs Gorman and Mr Wilkinson, say their constituency organisations have already been warned that they must deselect their rebel MPs or face disbandment and replacement by more compliant local officials. The hardliners sat defiantly on the Commons benches through the divisions, chatting amiably to less courageous Eurosceptics, and making no attempt to hide their refusal to support the bill. All are long-time opponents of the EU. Sir Teddy, for example, has campaigned against British membership for longer than most MPs have been in parliament. He told the Commons: 'I am not in any way trying to rock the government. But, quite frankly, I hope the government should accept that there are some of us who would think it outrageous, impossible and wrong to vote for extra cash for the EU.' Mrs Gorman, a right-wing populist who is frequently at odds with senior ministers, was the only Tory MP to question the cost of the contributions deal in the immediate aftermath of its negotiation by Mr Major at the 1992 Edinburgh summit. Mr Budgen may have more problems than most of the rebels because he does not have the full support of his constituency organisation. Mr Gill, who has the strong backing of his constituency party, said he was resigned to losing the whip. 'If the constituency wants to be represented by a sheep then they can go down to Ludlow livestock market and buy one,' he said. Mr Wilkinson likened Mr Major's attitude to Brussels to the appeasement of Adolf Hitler by Neville Chamberlain. 'The danger is that, like Neville Chamberlain, Mr Major will be swept away from office - perhaps as a consequence of his weakness - some two years hence,' he said. Last night the lobbies of the Commons were echoing with the sound of less courageous Euro-sceptics explaining away their unwillingness to join the rebellion. The repentant rebels all had cogent reasons for backing down: some feared deselection, others accepted the government's promises on EU fraud, many were keeping their powder dry for the 1996 inter-governmental conference.</p>

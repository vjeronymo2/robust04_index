			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Juan Contino Aslan, first secretary of the Union </F> of Young Communists, from the Turquino Peak at 0400 GMT on 1 Jan  -- recorded]    [Text] People of Cuba: Congratulations, on the first minute  of 1994, our thoughts are with you, you heroic people, Mambi and  rebel people, invincible people, supreme support of the  fatherland -- every happiness and victory belong to the people,  belong to Cubans, belong to those who forged our yesterday,  consolidate our today, and struggle and will struggle for our  tomorrow.    The enemies of Cuba miscalculated. Those who dreamt of our  collapse see us taller today. Those who wished for our downfall  do not know the immense good fortune of having a free  fatherland. Those who forecasted our death cannot stand to see  us brimming with life.    We are the fruits of a tree with deep roots in the earth of  our patriotism. The true child of a people of Mambises is not  born a traitor. Forty-eight hours before his death, Camila said  that the values and pride of the Cuban people are today as high  and solid as the invincible peak of the Turquino. And it is here  that the invincible values and pride of Cubans arise today, to  the highest point in Cuba, to ratify with Camilo that it will be  easier for us to stop breathing the pure air of the Sierra than  to relinquish a principle, than to bend a knee to imperialism,  than to compromise a single revolutionary ideal, than to be  disloyal to the fatherland, to socialism, the Revolution, and  Fidel.    We have arisen with Cuba since 1868 and will continue to  rise  for her for all times. These are times for rising up to confront  all difficulties and preserving with our actions the  fatherland's past, which is now once again our present, a more  beautiful present because it is the time to preserve our dreams,  the memory of so many heroic lives, so much blood that  fertilized the idea. Thank you, Mambises, for teaching us to  fight without surrender. Thank you, Mella, for having left us  your great love for the party you founded. Thank you, Guevara,  for your genuine lesson for the 21st century. Thank you, Celia,  for your permanent presence, together with Marti, on this peak.  Thank you, Fidel, for this daily lesson in Cuban revolutionary  spirit. Peaceful rest for our dead, for whom it will not be  necessary to raise their arms in defense of our fatherland  because it will never be torn to bits.    Viva forever the dead -- our happiness. [Crowd: Viva!]  Eternal life to our party, our revolutionary slogans, our  socialism, and our fatherland.    Invincible commander of all times: Here we are. Onward! This  is also the generation of the centennial. Viva the 35th  anniversary of the Revolution! [Crowd: Viva!] Viva the people of  Cuba! [Crowd: Viva!] Viva the party! [Crowd: Viva!] Viva Fidel!  [Crowd: Viva!] Socialism! [Crowd: or death!] Fatherland or  death! [Crowd: We will win!]</p>

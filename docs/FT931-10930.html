			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Mario the plumber goes educational Love 'em or hate 'em, few have found it possible to ignore computer games for Nintendo consoles. Now the lovable hero of many of these games, Mario the Brooklyn plumber, has turned his attention from high adventure to something more educational - painting and composing music. Mario Paint enables would-be artists to draw, paint and animate characters on the screen using a mouse, the controller familiar to many personal computer users. Nintendo says this is the first computer game to be controlled by a mouse rather than a joystick. (The mouse is included in the Pounds 59.99 price of the package, and plugs directly into the Nintendo 16-bit Super NES console.) If the console is also connected to a video cassette recorder, pictures or animated sequences created on the screen can be recorded. Music can also be added, by arranging in sequence a number of picture elements which appear on the screen. A picture of a jumbo jet, for example, would represent one note, a flower another and so on.

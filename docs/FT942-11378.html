			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Mexican banker faces civil action - A now-defunct US trade finance group alleges fraud Correction (published 9th May 1994) appended to this article. The chairman of Mexico's fourth-largest banking group is being sued by a New York trade finance company, which alleges it was defrauded of about Dollars 70m. Mr Carlos Cabal Peniche, head of Banco Union, Banca Cremi and Fresh Del Monte Produce, one of the world's largest fruit companies, was last month served in Mexico City with a summons and complaint by Eastbrook Inc, a now-defunct trade finance company, according to lawyers. The suit, first filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York last November, alleges that between 1986 and 1991, Mr Cabal and two former employees of Eastbrook directed more than Dollars 70m of loans to Mr Cabal's personal bank account or to shell companies controlled by Mr Cabal. Of the total, just Dollars 30m was paid back, it is alleged. A criminal investigation into alleged bank fraud by former employees of Eastbrook - including an investigation into transactions between Eastbrook and Mr Cabal - was set aside last week, according to sources familiar with the case. While Mr Cabal was not the target of the criminal investigation, his companies were Eastbrook's largest clients, and he had been requested 'to co-operate with the District Attorney', according to a statement of April 8 by Mr Stephen Kaufman, Mr Cabal's lawyer. Eastbrook Inc is owned and controlled by Mr Khalid bin Mahfouz, a former director of Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce International, the international bank which collapsed with huge losses after widespread fraud was discovered. Mr Mahfouz pleaded guilty, and with other defendants, paid fines amounting to Dollars 225m on charges arising out of the BCCI investigation. Separately, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accounting firm, has issued a statement casting doubt on the future of Fresh Del Monte Produce (previously known as Del Monte Fresh Produce), the fruit company Mr Cabal and other Mexican investors bought for Dollars 536m in 1992, out of the UK bankruptcy proceedings of Polly Peck International. Coopers said Fresh Del Monte's problems with its shippers - it is out of compliance with charter agreements on six ships - and recurring operating losses 'raise substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern'. The company has also been hit by low fruit prices. The Coopers statement is attached to a filing with the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, as required by Del Monte's private placement last April of Dollars 300m of 10-year notes with institutional investors, managed by Morgan Stanley. It shows Fresh Del Monte had losses of Dollars 22m last year, after losing Dollars 21.1m the year before. The civil suit brought against Mr Cabal by Eastbrook and the financial problems of Fresh Del Monte Produce are not related. Mr Cabal, 37, rose to prominence after buying, with a group of investors, Banco BCH (now known as Banco Union) for more than Dollars 300m in November 1991 from the Mexican government. In 1992, Mr Cabal and investors took over Fresh Del Monte Produce. Last year, he took control of Banca Cremi. Banco Union helped Mr Cabal finance the purchase of Fresh Del Monte Produce. Last month, Mr Cabal was on the verge of acquiring Del Monte Foods Corp of San Francisco for about Dollars 1bn (including company debt), when the deal collapsed at the last moment. He was advised by Morgan Stanley in the aborted acquisition. The suit brought against Mr Cabal says two former employees of Eastbrook, Mr Lus Vicente Arce and Mr Noushir Hasan, channeled more than Dollars 34m to Mr Cabal's personal account, and more than Dollars 35m to shell companies, without fully informing Eastbrook. The suit says the officials received substantial financial benefit from Mr Cabal in return for making the loans. Mr Kaufman said: 'The claim against Mr Cabal is without foundation and is unwarranted because Mr Cabal has an unconditional release from Eastbrook'. Mr Kaufman was referring to a settlement between Eastbrook and Mr Cabal or the companies he represented, in which money was paid to the US company, although there was no admission of any wrongdoing. Mexico's finance ministry said no investigation was being opened into Mr Cabal. Mexico's state development bank, Nafinsa, helped finance Mr Cabal's purchase of Fresh Del Monte Produce; the ministry said it looked into Mr Cabal's affairs when he bought BCH in 1991 and found nothing amiss. Eastbrook's lawyers said the settlement between the finance house and Mr Cabal only covered certain Cabal companies, and not Mr Cabal personally. They maintained the settlement did not release the Mexican businessmen from the current suit. CORRECTION In an article in the International Companies and Finance section of May 5 1994 headed 'Mexican Banker Faces Civil Action', we wrongly described Mr Mahfouz as having pleaded guilty to charges arising out of the 'BCCI investigation'. We accept that last December the New York County District Attorney and the Federal Reserve dropped all federal and state criminal and civil charges against Khalid Bin Mahfouz in connection with their BCCI investigation. We apologise to Mr Mahfouz for any distress or embarrassment that may have been caused to him and his family by the error.</p>

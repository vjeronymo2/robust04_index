			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Italians to build Tube link ITALSTRADE, the civil engineering arm of Italy's IRI state holding company, has signed a letter of intent for a L80bn (Pounds 35m) contract to build parallel tunnels beneath the Thames for a crucial section of London Underground's Pounds 1.7bn Jubilee Line extension. The 2.5km tunnel, linking the new Canary Wharf Tube station with that at Canada Water on the south bank of the Thames, will pass 35 metres below ground level. Construction, which involves Italstrade and two smaller Italian building groups, will take four years. Italstrade, Italy's second biggest civil engineering group, has also given details of three other important contracts not previously announced. Work has begun on the L200bn extension to Tangiers of the Casablanca-Rabat motorway in Morocco. In Turkey, the company has won a L285bn contract to build the Berke dam on the country's border with Syria; while in Romania, construction recently started on a L240bn terminal building for Bucharest airport. Italstrade has been short-listed for a second Jubilee Line contract from London Underground for a parallel 2.85km tunnel from London Bridge to the new Canada Water station. The Dollars 63m deal would take just under four years to complete.</p>

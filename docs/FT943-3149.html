			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: W Canning doubles to Pounds 3.64m at midway W Canning, the speciality chemicals company which sold its electronic components distribution division in July, doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.64m at the interim stage. The Birmingham-based company reported increased turnover for the six months to June 30 of Pounds 60.9m (Pounds 56.1m), including Pounds 34.9m (Pounds 33.1m) from speciality chemicals and Pounds 26.1m (Pounds 19.8m) from electronic components distribution. Mr David Probert, chairman, said that as a speciality chemicals company, Canning intended 'to remain in and close to its core businesses, which are capable of significant organic growth.' The company was in a strong position to finance this growth and to make acquisitions 'if suitable opportunities arise.' At the end of the period net borrowings were Pounds 10.2m. The group's chemicals division raised operating profits from Pounds 2.95m to Pounds 3.29m. The sale of the electronics components side, which made Pounds 1.22m (Pounds 777,000), will lead to a Pounds 13m exceptional loss in the 1994 accounts, related to goodwill. The interim dividend is again 2.94p. Basic earnings per share rose to 7.5p (2.1p). Last year's figure included an exceptional item of 3.3p.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Isle of Man to take assets of Nadir company: Hillgate will be struck off register after failing to file annual returns since 1990 HILLGATE, a company owned by Mr Asil Nadir and registered in the Isle of Man since 1973, is due to be struck off the island's companies register next month for not filing annual returns since 1990. Under Manx company law, assets of companies struck off become the property of the Manx treasury. Mr Nadir is listed as Hillgate's major shareholder. Hillgate's assets include a Jersey-registered company, Restro, which was used by Mr Nadir for his dealings in Polly Peck group shares. Both companies are his personal companies and not part of Polly Peck. Mr Neil Cooper, Mr Nadir's trustee in bankruptcy, said yesterday: 'We considered getting involved (with Hillgate) but on a risk-reward basis it did not seem the right way to proceed.' The Manx company was set up originally as part of a legal capital gains tax avoidance scheme. Such schemes were popular at the time, particularly for takeovers and flotations. By exchanging UK company shares for shares in an offshore company in a 'paper-for-paper' transaction capital gains tax was avoided when the shares were sold to the public. Hillgate was first incorporated as Wearwell Holdings and changed its name in 1980. In December 1990 three Manx nominee directors resigned and since then the company has been without directors and has filed no annual returns. In addition to Mr Nadir's shareholding of 800 B shares there is a block of 97 A shares held by a nominee company. It has not been possible to identify the beneficial owner of these shares. Polly Peck also placed its group of five Voyager companies in the Isle of Man, which are the subject of litigation in the Manx courts. Polly Peck administrators are trying to reclaim shares in Voyager believed to be worth about Pounds 8m that were transferred to Mr Nadir a few days before the administrators were appointed. They claim the share transfer was not valid as they alleged the resolution ordering it was made at an illegally-constituted meeting in northern Cyprus. The case is due to be heard on July 6 in an Isle of Man court. Meanwhile, Mr Christopher Morris, administrator to Polly Peck at Touche Ross, said yesterday that he had been in correspondence with the Conservative party concerning Mr Nadir's political donations. He said he would seek advice on the issue soon from the company's creditors' committee.</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Fimbra loophole - Investor protection fears A LOOPHOLE in investor protection is affecting investors who have dealt with members of Fimbra - the Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory Association - since the Financial Services Act came into force in 1988. Some are finding that although the investments they bought were long term, the protection offered by Fimbra was not. In many cases protection ended when the firm left Fimbra, or, at most, 12 months after its departure. The result is that an investors with a complaint against a former Fimbra member may have only the costly option of suing for redress. Fimbra says it cannot compel former members to submit to the free Consumer Arbitration Scheme even if they have since become appointed representatives of another Fimbra member. If the former Fimbra member becomes a tied agent of an insurance or unit trust company, the regulator Lautro, the Life assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation, has no responsibility for dealing with complaints about business conducted under Fimbra banner. Investors have no recourse to the Investors Compensation Scheme, which only handles claims against firms declared insolvent officially. The regulatory gap appears primarily to have snared investors who bought home income plans from a number of Fimbra members in the late 1980s. The plans were packaged investments combining a mortgage and an equity-linked bond, sold as capable of simultaneously financing the loan and providing an income. Real life departed from the sales scripts when house prices fell against a background of rising interest rates. By the time problems became acute and investors complained - often that risk warnings had been inadequate - Fimbra said it was too late. This message was repeatedly conveyed to about 20 investors who had dealt with Findley Insurance Brokers. John Kirby, Fimbra complaints manager, wrote to one couple last July: ' . . .investors (in dispute with Findley) do not have a right to refer their dispute to the Fimbra Consumer Arbitration Scheme as an alternative to court action, because Findley ceased to be a member of Fimbra on May 1 1991. 'The firm's membership of Fimbra ceased prior to the amendment in December 1991 of the Consumer Arbitration Scheme rules which enabled the referral of disputes for up to twelve months post-membership. You will understand that the association is not empowered to retrospectively impose obligations on firms which have ceased to be members in their won right.' Sympathising with the investors' problem, Kirby said they must rely on their 'normal legal rights' in order to establish a claim. Writing to another Findley client, in October, to reject a June request for arbitration, Iris Baker, of the Fimbra complaints department, explained that Fimbra's rules were binding in contract only, so that when Findley resigned on May 1, 1991 it immediately ceased to have any obligation under the Arbitration Scheme in respect of claims made after that date. 'As a matter of contract law, it is not open to Fimbra to impose on a unilateral basis, a new obligation or a new duty on a former member after mutual contractual duties have become non-existent by resignation.' Baker wrote: 'It follows that the amended 1991 Arbitration schemes rules against Findley, a non-member, but could only operate prospectively in respect of actual and future members as at December 1, 1991.' Although Fimbra could 'invite co-operation' from Findley, Baker said that it could not, as a matter of law, compel submission to arbitration. 'You will no doubt wish to consider the merits of pursuing the claim through the courts,' she concluded. The investors were highly dissatisfied, feeling that Fimbra could have taken a much tougher line with Findley: the firm had effectively remained under its regulation, having joined the Fimbra-member network Countrywide Independent Advisers as an appointed representative. Last November, Countrywide's compliance officer Andrew Ruff informed an accountant representing some of the investors that the network had 'advised' Findley to submit to arbitration. But it was not until last week that he was able to confirm Findley's agreement. 'Our role has been to act as an honest broker, to see if we can't assist with a sensible solution', said Countrywide managing director Peter Tamm, who joined the firm in October. He said the network had not been aware of any disputes with investors when Findley became an appointed agent in 1990. These only came to light in March 1992. Tamm said the network prided itself on vetting both agents and products  - it had never approved the sale of home income plans. He conceded some surprise at Fimbra's assertion that it could only 'invite' co-operation: 'I would have thought they did have some sort of suasion, especially since the membership of Fimbra is not entirely severed - it is at one remove,' Tamm said. 'Nevertheless, Fimbra makes its own rules so I guess they know.' At Lautro, Colin Hawtin said the organisation would want to be aware of any complaints against Fimbra members becoming tied agents in case of any impact on their fit and proper status. He added: 'There is a weakness there: as an investor you bought from an independent financial adviser when the Financial Services Act existed, something is wrong but he is a tied agent and you don't have any recourse. You are on your own and there is nothing Lautro can do about it.' However, Hawtin said information about complaints passed among regulators would lead member companies to keep former independent tied agents under special scrutiny. Meanwhile, the committee setting up the Personal Investment Authority is looking at ways of ending the 12-month limitation on responsibility for Fimbra quitters.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Angolan peace talks, which went into recess last  week, are likely to resume tomorrow. This has been diclosed by  Conde [as heard], assistant to UN Special Representative Alioune  Blondin Beye. That UN official also said that there is no  danger that the talks might collapse. He expressed concern,  however, about continuing military clashes in general, and in  particular about bombardments by the Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola- Labor Party, MPLA-PT air force against  cities controlled by the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola, UNITA.    It is noteworthy that the team led by Faustino Muteka, which  surprisingly left the Zambian capital last week, has now been  back in Lusaka since yesterday. When the Angolan peace talks  resume tomorrow, they will be focusing on the issue of the  second round of presidential elections. This has been disclosed  by a UN source quoted by the Portuguese Broadcasting  Corporation, RDP.    Meanwhile, UNITA Information Secretary Dr. Jorge Valentim  has  said today that the second round of presidential elections will  depend on three indispensable factors of a material,  psychological, and political nature. He noted that the second  round of presidential elections will be held when the country  has achieved stability and the administrative sector is ready to  provide equal service to all people, irrespective of where they  may live or the party they support. It is necessary that the  people experience security so that all political parties can go  openly about their political work.    For the second round of presidential elections, UNITA is  demanding that the former National Electoral Council, CNE, be  scrapped. UNITA has also demanded parity with the government in  the future CNE.</p>

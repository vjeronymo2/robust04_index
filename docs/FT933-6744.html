			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Babangida expected to give up grip on power today GENERAL Ibrahim Babangida, Nigeria's military ruler since 1985, was set to relinquish power today after bowing to pressure from fellow army officers to hand over to a non-elected civilian administration. After plotting for weeks to extend his rule, Gen Babangida is understood to have abandoned plans to install himself at the head of an 'interim government'. During tense meetings of the ruling military council this week, Gen Babangida's service chiefs are said to have threatened open rebellion if he insisted on clinging to power. The 52-year-old soldier, veteran of three coups, was told by his officers he had discredited the armed forces by reneging on a pledge to return Africa's most populous nation to democracy. His decision to annul the June presidential poll, they said, was responsible for plunging Nigeria into the worst political crisis since the 1967-70 Biafran war. The resolution of the crisis is likely to be an anti-climax. A farewell military parade in the capital Abuja will see off the troublesome general. It will be followed by an inauguration ceremony for the interim civilian administration. Diplomats believe the new government will be composed largely of members of the outgoing Transitional Council, a civilian team appointed by Gen Babangida six months ago which has been singularly ineffective in arresting Nigeria's economic decline. Chief Ernest Shonekan, chairman of the Transitional Council, is tipped to become Nigeria's new president. Gen Babangida, however, is not expected to remain active behind the scenes. His officers, led by Gen Sani Abacha, the defence minister, are reported to be too angry to let him stay. 'Babangida will probably spend some time cooling his heels at his mansion in the Ivory Coast,' a diplomat in Lagos said. The Babangidas also own property in France and Switzerland. But the military are not expected to leave the stage entirely. One of the key questions still to be answered is whether the National Defence and Security Council, the ruling military body, will dissolve itself with Gen Babangida's departure or continue in some advisory capacity. 'We still don't know whether we are getting another military government with a civilian facade, or a truly civilian administration,' Gen Olusegun Obasanjo, a former president and the only Nigerian military ruler to have voluntarily left office, said yesterday. 'If Babangida completely leaves the scene, perhaps the people will learn to live with a non-elected administration. But it is clearly no substitute for a democratically elected government.' Chief Moshood Abiola, winner of the aborted presidential contest, said yesterday from his self-imposed exile in London that he had not abandoned his claim to the presidency. 'I will return to Nigeria as soon as it is safe for me to do so,' he promised. 'I cannot mount a challenge while my life is in danger.' Chief Abiola said it would be a 'mortal error' for western governments to recognise Nigeria's new leaders.</p>

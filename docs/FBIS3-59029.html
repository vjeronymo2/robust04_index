			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Munich (DPA) -- The Ifo Institute for Economic  Research believes a recovery is in sight following the sharp  downturn in investments in German industry. "There are  increasing signs that the rapid decline in industrial  investments is coming to an end," the Munich-based institute  writes in its latest analysis.    In the more probable event of a clear acceleration in the  export sector and further, more pronounced interest rate  reductions, a real increase of 3 percent (following minus 3  percent in 1993) in plant investment can be expected in 1994.  If, however, the pressures of the domestic economic situation  were to increase, a further slight decline of 1 percent is  possible.    In either case, the negative development in investment  expenditure in industry is likely to continue, in the more  favourable scenario by minus 6 percent, in the unfavorable one  by minus 11 percent (following the minus 12 percent calculated  for 1993). In 1992, investment expenditure in industry was 127  billion German marks [DM] and DM721 billion for all economic  sectors. Investment in the former east German states continues  to rise, whereby the mining, energy, and services sectors -- as  well as, in the medium term, transport -- predominate.    Investment in the former East Germany increased by around 15  percent, despite the recession in 1993. In broad sectors of the  west German economy, however, the downturn in investment was  much more pronounced than even in the most unfavorable scenario,  for example in trade, transport, industry, and also agriculture,  according to the Ifo. In the medium term, the high investment  level of the early 1990's could be regained in 1996 at the  earliest. In the purchase of capital goods, data processing  equipment and office machinery are likely to remain key areas of  growth until 1998. The Ifo Institute warned against hoping for  overly large economic impulses from the GATT agreement on the  liberalization of world trade, reached in mid-December 1993. A  definitive assessment of the outcome is not possible yet. The  agreement is basically positive, although only partial success  had been achieved in some areas. Failure has only been prevented  by excluding some areas or giving compensation. To describe the  agreement as a "huge" or "mega economic program" is certainly an  exaggeration, the Ifo Institute writes.    It should be borne in mind that the liberalization will  begin  in early 1995 at the earliest and will be completed gradually in  five or more stages. "At least some economic impulses can peter  out as a result. In addition, it cannot be assumed that the  tendency to solve structural problems through protectionist  measures no longer exists." Sanctions were still not envisaged.  The main reasons for the prolonged nature of the GATT  negotiations -- the great conflict of interests between  industrialized and developing countries in some areas and the  large number of negotiating partners -- continues to exist and  in the future will continue to make multilateral liberalization  steps more difficult. The discussion on a GATT with several  speeds therefore could remain topical.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Milos Vasic, Filip Svarm, Isabelle Lasserre, </F> Paja Rovic, and Pepi Orlov: "War and Trade: Private Initiative"]    [Text] What is the connection between the downing of  four airplanes over Bosnia and the price of a pack of cigarettes  in Tesanj, Gojko Susak's fortune, poker gambling machines from  Banja Luka, and oil for transformers? Is the Krajina blood money  earned in western Bosnia the backing for the solid dinar? How  are 10 television sets smuggled with the help of a wounded man?  You can find the answers to all these--and other--questions in  this article.    Why are wars even waged? There are two theories about that:  the romantic one and the realistic one. The romantic  interpretation cites "historic rights," "living space,"  "national dignity," and "the state is more important than  bread." The realists do not believe all this, but they have  nothing against it: They expect wars to begin, and sometimes  they even help the process along (depending on investments that  have been made and the pace at which money turns over). Wars are  able to turn into business at a surprising speed, and romantics  are not skilled in business dealings. They are there to perish  heroically or afterwards, as cripples, to marvel at the fact  that they have nothing while the realists are getting rich. For  example, there is a well-reasoned theory to the effect that the  war in Laos (1960-75) was not waged against communist  aggressors, but was instead about achieving a monopoly over the  opium trade.    In order to turn war into successful business, there must be  authorities who--by their very nature--impose obligations and  restrictions that generally do not suit their subjects. The  foundation of ruling authority lies in romantic, ideological  presumptions, but miraculously there are usually realists among  those in power. For example, authorities introduce various  measures for patriotic reasons: universal military conscription,  a prohibition on the misappropriation of weapons and military  equipment, restrictions on the movement and activities of  citizens of other nationalities, a prohibition on cooperation  with the enemy, and similar expected and seemingly normal  things. However, you cannot eat patriotism, and it is not noted  for generating profits (except in some cases, to be discussed  later). All the noted prohibitions and commands, it turns out,  are transformable into quantities of German marks [DM], which  depend primarily on the laws of the market. In a nutshell, this  means: Whoever pays is exempt. The conditions for this  transformation were created very quickly in the 1990 Balkan  wars. Specifically, the belligerent Serb lands, the republic of  Serbian Krajina [RSK] and the republic of Srpska, are very poor.  Under the normal conditions of the old Yugoslavia, they survived  exclusively as part of an economic and market entity and with  state support for underdeveloped areas (aside from two or three  regional exceptions). Both states made it through the first  phase of the war with the help of mother Serbia and through  plunder. However, as the Vikings discovered in their day, the  plunder economy has one major shortcoming--something can be  pillaged only once. That phase is now complete, which is  reflected in the increasingly poor state of public security in  these lands: Plunder has become a normal affair, so that now  some people need to be reeducated, because they have gotten used  to it; they have used up the effects of others and moved on to  their own people. This is a critical period of history: Now, it  is necessary to move on to some more organized, institutional  form of business.  <H5>  Market Laws </H5>   The first and traditional economic resource is the  population  and its elementary needs for survival: food, clothing, alcohol,  cigarettes. Whoever establishes a monopoly over satisfying these  vital needs is the winner. For example, a certain Zeljko Holman  of Zenica has become the main supplier of food to that large  city; half of the total supply has passed through his hands  since the war began. He founded the HOS [Croatian Defense  Force], put together a team of 30 people who never saw the  front, declared himself a general (although he has a sixth-grade  education), and started up the Zagreb-Zenica trade, which lasted  until Easter 1993. That was when the cooperation between Croats  and Bosnians ended; someone else wanted control over the food,  Holman was arrested, and allegedly they are still beating him at  the Zenica Culture and Education Center to find out where the  money is. Serb brothers have also turned a good profit in  Zenica: There are two brothers who had an exclusive monopoly  over cigarettes and Cerali tractor-trailer trucks for months. A  pack went for DM10 retail. Incidentally, a record in these wars  was registered in 1993 in central Bosnia: A carton of Marlboros  cost DM500.    This is a case of the unbending natural law of supply and  demand. In Zenica, the prices at the illegal market in Gluva  Bukovica, at the foot of Mt. Vlasic, where Serbs and Muslims  trade were as follows in January 1994: white flour--DM20; a  liter of cooking oil--DM20; a kilogram of meat--DM15; a liter of  brandy--DM10, and so forth. In other places (primarily in  central Bosnia), there are more luxurious items available: A  gram of cocaine costs DM300 (DM150 in Belgrade); a gram of  "domestic" grass DM10-12 (Belgrade: DM3-5). All of these  transactions are the result of private initiative by individuals  and a free black market where there is no competition. The  profit margins are great, but do not even approach those  realized on the state level. Because it can block free trade  through administrative hurdles, the state is beginning to charge  for freedom of trade. As long as the end buyer pays the state  racket and as long as the dealer can endure the reduced profit  margin, the state is financially stable.    State revenues from taxes, rackets, its own  black-marketeering, and the exploitation of natural resources  (sometimes suicidal--as in "Hadzic's barricades") can hardly  cover the costs of extended warfare. After all, war is a costly  pastime, and if it does not bring some sort of benefit or a  stable peace quickly, the state is in trouble. For example,  soldiers of the republic of Srpska are already publicly  grumbling that Serbia charges them "a high price for every  bullet and shell"; for months now, the armed forces of the RSK  have received payments of food and basic necessities in kind  instead of actual wages. The events in Banja Luka in September  1993 are the best illustration of the crisis in the republic of  Srpska: Reservists rioted because their families were starving  (and they, in the trenches, were too), while dealers and  swindlers were growing nice and rich. Dr. Radovan Karadzic put  down the rebellion, while promising protection to "business  people," on whom--as he put it--"the future depends." Patriotism  is patriotism, but money is money....    Because of all this, all the warring states in the Balkans  are forced to enter into certain transactions that are  completely understandable to realists, while among romantics  they elicit confusion that sometimes borders on despair.  <H5>  One Hand Washes the Other </H5>   Transactions between states also depend on supply and  demand:  who has something and who needs it. Thus, the Bosnians have  people but no weapons; the Serbs have weapons but are short on  people; the Croats, with both people and weapons, are somewhere  in-between, but they have tactical and strategic problems. These  things vary from region to region, just as tactical interests  vary. Because of that, we have seen all possible alliances  between two parties against a third. This began back during the  war in Croatia, when the Bosnian police of Alija Delimustafic  cooperated fraternally with the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army];  then the JNA fraternally armed the just-established HVO  [Croatian Defense Council] in Kiseljak; then the Bosnians and  Croats fraternally clobbered the Serbs, the Serbs and Muslims  clobbered the Croats (Herzegovina, Kupres), and the Serbs and  Croats seriously united against the Bosnians (although they  regularly supplied ammunition to them in Herzegovina), all the  way up to several days ago, when yet another Croat-Bosnian pact  was signed.    The best reflection of this in practice can be found in  central Bosnia, i.e., the Kiseljak-Kresevo front. This began in  the summer of 1992 with the renting of artillery to HVO forces  (with or without crews and ammunition); it continued through the  renting of tactical services (artillery support), and concluded  with the sale of major weapon systems and ammunition. At one  point in 1993, the Serbs sold the HVO one T-55 tank, one "Praga"  (a two-barrel 30-mm antiair gun on a tank chassis), and 2.5  million rounds of various ammunition for a sum that was later  disputed. Specifically, the HVO contends that it paid DM4.5  million, while the Serbs contend that they received DM4 million;  one Serb source says that he believes the Croats and wonders  where the half a million marks went.  <H5>  Case of Bihac </H5>   It is not only the Serbs and Croats who are doing business.  The example of Cazin Krajina and Fikret Abdic's autonomous  province of western Bosnia [APZB] shows that local tactical  circumstances result in realistic alliances. As Miroslav  Lazanski writes in his new biweekly ARGUMENT, there is fierce  fighting around Bihac between units of the 5th Corps of the Army  of Bosnia-Herzegovina under the command of Atif Dudakovic and  Fikret Abdic's forces, which include Serbs. "The probable goal  of operations by the Serb army and Fikret Abdic's forces in this  region is... to break out to the banks of the Una River,  whereupon this region would be territorially divided between the  republic of Srpska and the autonomous province of western  Bosnia." VREME has learned from independent sources in the field  around Bihac and from our special reporter who stayed in Bihac  that at least since the end of 1993, entire military units of  the Serb armed forces of Krajina [SVK] and of the MUP [Ministry  of Internal Affairs] of Krajina have been fighting for Fikret  Abdic. Legend has it that Babo asked his friend from Bijeljina,  Zeljko Raznatovic, whether he could take Bihac for him; when he  heard that Arkan was demanding DM8 million, Babo reportedly  concluded that for that amount of money he could take Bihac  himself, and he turned to Captain Dragan. The bulk of the aid  from the RSK is provided by the people of Capt. Dragan  Vasiljkovic from his "Alpha" training center, while the rest is  filled in by SVK soldiers and special units of the MUP of  Krajina. It appears that authorities in Serbia are familiar with  the entire operation, because weapons and equipment are  allegedly received through them. The people fighting in the APZB  are listed in Serbia as being on leave. The operation is  organized on-site in Velika Kladusa by a certain major with the  SVK. The going rate for this fighting is as follows: DM2,000 for  five to seven days of action; DM1,000 for one day of  reconnaissance inside enemy territory; DM200 for a prisoner;  special rewards for each occupied town (DM1,000-2,000 per  person). Renting fire support and other services costs the  following: DM50 for each day at the RSK military hospital in  Vojnic; DM50,000 per day for three T-55 tanks with crews;  DM50,000 per day for a battery (six pieces) of 122-mm howitzers  plus DM1,000 for each fired shell if the artillery is on APZB  territory, but if it is fired from Serb territory, then only the  ammunition (between DM1,000 and DM3,000, depending on the type  of ammunition); one day of antitank support from a "Gazela Gama"  helicopter costs DM100,000.    VREME's reporter in Bihac says that "Gazela" helicopters  fired on the towns of Srbinje and Sokolac during her stay there  (in early March), and also reports continuous artillery fire  against Bihac from the Grabez and Golubic plateau. French  Colonel Legrillet of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] has  confirmed this activity. The 5th Corps of the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina presented an ultimatum to Abdic to surrender  by 10 February, or else it would move on Kladusa; four days  before the ultimatum ran out, the Serb offensive against Bihac  and the forces of the 5th Corps began, so that the pressure was  taken off of Abdic. At the same time--interestingly  enough--UNPROFOR headquarters in Zagreb was systematically  ignoring and downplaying events on the Bihac front (the  situation is normal, an occasional mortar shell here and  there...).    Where does Fikret Abdic get the money to pay for all these  services and goods? It has long been known that Abdic imports  from Croatia into the APZB much more food, fuel, and other goods  than the local population needs. Also, a large part of the  "Agrokomerc" capital has been successfully turned over abroad  (purchasing arms for Croatia), while it is felt in Zagreb that a  large part of the capital of the powerful Herzegovinan war-mafia  lobby is moving by way of Babo and his friend Alija  Delimustafic. Thus, Babo is buying for the Serbs what they need  and charging them both in cash (trade) and in services  (warfare). At present, this suits the Croats in tactical terms;  UNPROFOR has closed its eyes (and that costs money), while  Serbia is making a political point out of Fikret Abdic: He is a  model of exemplary "coexistence" and ethnic tolerance....  <H5>  Sad Ending </H5>   However, everything changes if the Washington Bosnian-Croat  agreement by some chance goes into effect. In that case, two  important players in the Balkans become superfluous, or even  detrimental: Fikret Abdic and Gojko Susak. If the Bosnians and  Croats actually, sincerely enter into a new alliance, without  the usual back-stabbing (as has happened many times in the  past), Abdic is left all alone: The Croats do not need him, and  he is left without oil and food, and in that case the 5th Corps  quickly grows stronger; nor do the Serbs need him any more,  because he has neither money nor goods. If the Croats have  really decided in favor of an alliance with the Bosnians, it  will not work, nor will anyone believe them, as long as several  Herzegovinan political figures are a visible presence at Jelacic  Square. Gojko Susak sensed this immediately, given the fact that  two weeks ago he started grumbling about "swallowing a bitter  pill": The Serbs say that "he has a bee in his bonnet," i.e.,  that thought is being given to him. Specifically, Dr. Tudjman  was wrong to enter the war in Bosnia at Herzegovinan insistence,  and the entire adventure went awry. Now he must acknowledge that  he made a mistake; someone must pay for this, and Dr. Tudjman  would rather not be that someone. The list of other candidates  is not a long one....    Here we arrive at one interesting political speculation of a  completely hypothetical nature, although it is quite reasonable.  In the event of a successful Bosnian-Croat alliance, it is not  only Abdic and Susak who are superfluous and detrimental; the  logic of Realpolitik says that Mile Martic will also not be as  desirable as he is today. He has the least money, and in that  case his state is the most threatened; in any attempt to abandon  Krajina to Croatia (because in that case defending its  sovereignty would be too costly), Martic is superfluous. The  same is true of Herceg-Bosna; Mate Boban is already on thin ice  in Zagreb, even though he still holds real power.    When all of the above is considered, we arrive at a natural  junction of interests: Who is most interested in undermining and  subverting the Washington accord? Susak, Boban, Martic, Palama,  and Abdic, more or less in that order. If that is true--and it  appears to be--then nothing is impossible, especially since  everything has already happened in the past. It is known that  the RSK air force has already conducted combat missions in  Bosnia (bombing and helicopter support) for the VRS [armed  forces of the republic of Srpska], but also for the HVO and APZB  forces, for monetary compensation. Relations between the RSK and  UNPROFOR are so poor that neither side was interested in  insisting on this: UNPROFOR would not know what to say (it is  tied up anyway), while the RSK would have to explain why its  airplanes are flying over Bosnia but did not fly against the  Croats during the offensive at Medacki Dzep. The very fact that  all sides continue to refuse to take responsibility for the  bombing of Novi Travnik and Bugojno and for the four ill-fated  airplanes is clearly disturbing here; the romantics have  perished, while the realists are not foolish enough to  acknowledge it. It is unknown whether the Herzegovinans paid for  it while Serbs from the two states did the flying in order to  subvert the Bosnian-Croat alliance, but it will be learned  sooner or later.  <H5>  Catch-22 </H5>   No war is pretty, on the contrary. However, these wars of  ours have managed in record time to degenerate into cynical  business dealings and ordinary plunder as the main motives.  Since the motives and interests of all sides are similar (which  is not to say identical), mutual understanding is somehow  inevitable: If the momentary ally is in trouble, we will sell  him a pack of cigarettes for DM10, or a tank, shells, and so  forth for the price that he is able to pay. Thus, the "Border  94" campaign in the republic of Srpska revealed that there is a  great deal of trade going on with "the enemy" (tanks,  ammunition, weapons, vital strategic materials). Everyone aims  at transformer stations (which are repaired by UNPROFOR) because  a lot is earned on oil for transformers; wounded Serbs being  treated in Serbia have the right to a television set, so that as  many as 10 plundered television sets are smuggled in for each  wounded person and his permit. Strategic installations of the  military industry, such as "Kosmos-Cajavec" in Banja Luka,  produce electronics for poker gambling machines--a serious  business that yields serious money (and heads roll because of  those machines, too) supplying the significant Eastern European  market.    Avramovic's solid dinar has been introduced in the republic  of Srpska and the republic of Serbian Krajina (20 million have  been issued); if each dinar is backed by foreign exchange--and  Martic and Karadzic swear that such backing exists--then where  are the marks coming from? Certainly not from the economy and  exports. What remains is rentals of personnel and military  technology, money from the Herzegovinan political lobby, the  remainders of the pillaged stashes of money and [trange-frange]  with Serbia (importing food and vital necessities and sucking  foreign exchange out of the populace). Who is whose "enemy" now?  The answer is offered in the classic study of all  warfare--Catch-22, by Joseph Heller. There, Milo  Minderbinder offers an interpretation of why he has agreed with  the Americans that they first bomb an overpass, and also agreed  with the Germans to defend it. "The Germans are not our enemies.  True, we are at war with them, but Germans are prominent members  of our syndicate, and I must protect their rights...." Later  Milo agrees with the Germans to bomb his own air base, because  he has run out of cash. A scandal results, the newspapers  bluster, mothers of recruits protest (which we know something  about), but Milo has the impeccable logic of a war realist: "In  a democratic state, the people are the government. And are we  not a people? So why should we not hold on to our money and  eliminate the middle-men? Quite frankly, I would like most of  all for the governments to give up war and turn this entire  field over to private initiative." If war has become the only  branch of the economy that can turn a profit--why not?</p>

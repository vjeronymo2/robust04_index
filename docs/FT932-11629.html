			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Books: An inner journey into angst / Review of a saga of American hopes and dreams HOME FIRES by Donald Katz HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 618 pages THE GENERATION of young Americans who settled down to start families just after the second world war could hardly have dreamed of the problems lying ahead. After years of Depression and global carnage, they believed that all they had to do to put the eruptions of the previous two decades behind them was work hard and live right. And they did just that, creating an era of unrivalled prosperity. But it was an affluence which brought psychological pressures to bear on the American family that Ma Joad or the mothers of GIs never had to confront. This muddying of the American middle class idyll in post-war America is the subject of Donald Katz's exhaustive and compelling Home Fires. It chronicles the Gordons of Long Island, a family so affected by their times that if a novelist invented them he would be criticised for crudely obvious characterisation. But the Gordons are a real family, their name unchanged for purposes of the book, though it was changed in 1948, when Sam and Eve Goldenberg, recently moved to the suburbs, decided to alter it to the more homogeneous Gordon. Like many couples married during the war, Sam and Eve were the children of poor immigrants who simply wanted a better way of life. Fortunately, they lived in an era in which hard work could achieve that. Sam, a master electrician, was able to transport his wife and four children from the South Bronx to suburban Nassau County, where large tracts of land were being subdivided and 'developed' for young soldiers and their war brides. At first, suburban life was everything Eve and Sam hoped, especially when contrasted with the cramped poverty of their urban childhoods. The spacious yard, the big car, the Saturday night dances at the club. So what if Sam had to work ungodly hours, catching only the briefest glimpses of his kids each night? So what if Eve, who had dreamed of being a torch singer, grew so bored by the drudgery of suburban housewifery that she would throw plates against the wall to remind herself she was alive? They were living in the suburbs. They had made it. The cracks began to show when the kids hit their teens. Susan, the eldest, was a headstrong girl who, perhaps because of her father's absence during the first few years of her life, just could not seem to abide the man. Lorraine was equally rebellious, while Sheila developed a bad case of nerves from the 'duck and cover' nuclear war drills at school And what to make of the sensitive Ricky, so different from his macho father, already the butt of neighbourhood bullies? With the 1960s the family came comprehensively unglued. Susan went off to Vassar and then London, fuelling her rebelliousness with a taste for drugs. Lorraine got pregnant at the age of 17 and moved to New York, where she began using heroin and singing with a radical feminist pop group. And Ricky's penchant for show tunes and his mother's make-up was giving Sam serious pause in his dreams of having his son one day inherit the family business. By the end of the decade the kids seemed to have been everywhere - swinging London, Berkeley, Greenwich Village. Two even made it to Woodstock. And Sam and Eve were sitting in their big suburban split-level, their heads reeling, feeling like the parents Bob Dylan sang of when he proclaimed 'Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command.' With the 'Me' decade of the 1970s, this dissolution intensified. Though Susan received an advance from Random House to write a feminist manifesto, she soon sank into a bizarre re-enlightenment cult and ended the decade as a junkie on the streets. Lorraine discovered yoga, transplanting herself and her four kids - Magdelana, Ram, Shiva and Gupal - to an ashram in Yogaville, Virginia. Sheila opened a health food store but then married a yuppie and moved back to the 'burbs. And Ricky, to nobody's surprise but Sam's, came out of the closet and moved to New York during the heady days of Gay Liberation. With the 1980s, as if to provide an ironic commentary on Ronald Reagan's cynical and hypocritical focus on 'family values', the Gordons slowly came back together. Susan seemed to be winning her fight with drugs, while Lorraine extricated herself from the sway of her guru. Sheila replaced her ageing mother as the focus for family gatherings, while Ricky and Sam came to terms with the son's sexuality. Home Fires is a compelling study of the American family at the historical moment when it came under intense and often damning scrutiny. The affluence and subsequent leisure of the post-war years saw a genie of self-absorption released from the American bottle. Not surprisingly, it was the institution of the family that came under the most pressure. Whereas, as Eve often states, people of her generation had no time to be themselves, her children had time for nothing else. And though it is tempting to see all their nascent efforts at self-definition - the cults and drugs and movements - as being wildly comic, it is worth bearing in mind that Americans born between 1943 and 1956 were inner pioneers just as much as their ancestors had explored terrestrial wildernesses. We laugh at them from the vantage point of having learned from their mistakes. Indeed, if the book has one weak point, it is that the Gordons are so typical of their era that they become archetypical. For every fad, there is at least one of them who manages to indulge it to the hilt. That said, this is a finely written book which makes for compelling reading. Its heroes are undoubtedly Sam and Eve, who endure their children's vagaries and accusations with patience, wisdom and humour, enabling them to survive travails that would have buried most other parents. It is a strength which allows for the reconciliations that close the book, just as Reagan and his acolyte Bush, who talked about family values but never meant a word of it, leave the stage for the first Baby Boomer president.</p>

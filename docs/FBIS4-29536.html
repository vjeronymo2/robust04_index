			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Kim Sung-pok] </F>   [Text] As former U.S. president Jimmy Carter was in  Pyongyang to defuse tensions sparked by the suspected North  Korean nuclear weapons program yesterday, a crack appeared in  the South Korea-U.S. tuning of nuclear strategy against the  North.    An unusually heavy mood was felt at Chongwadae [presidential  offices]. Even there were signs of embarrassment as Carter's  first round of talks with North Korean leader Kim Il-song and  subsequent press conference received a quick response from  Washington indicating the resumption of dialogue.    Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential aide handling the North  Korean nuclear issue, avoided reporters. He meets the press  daily to give them background briefings at his office, a daily  practice since tension over the nuclear standoff increased.    Instead, he huddled with his aides in charge of national  security affairs, defense and diplomacy.    He had an unscheduled meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Korea  James Laney. Chong was to receive a visit from Russian  Ambassador to Korea Georgiy Kunadze who observers said was to  explain to him his government's position on the U.S.-led draft  sanctions resolution to be put to the United Nations Security  Council. But he canceled the meeting with Kunadze to meet Laney.    Chongwadae appeared embarrassed to find out that Carter's  visit to Pyongyang, which was billed as private and  self-initiated, can in no way be viewed in that context.    In his June 10 telephone conversation with President Kim  Yong-sam who was leery of possible adverse affects of Carter's  planned visit to the North, Clinton assured him that the trip to  Pyongyang was self-initiated and had nothing to do with his  administration.    Clinton also assured President Kim that he will not change  his mind in pursuing sanctions against the renegade communist  country whatever conciliatory message Carter may bring from  Pyongyang.    President Kim has stressed from time to time that no  dialogue  will be sought with the North until the first-phase of U.N.  Security Council sanctions are imposed. He has also added that  this position was agreed to by the United States.    Since Pyongyang's unilateral refueling of the 5-megawatt  nuclear reactor without monitoring by the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA), President Kim has held the belief that a  lack of tough measures by Seoul and the international community  has allowed the North to take the initiatives at every turn of  developments. Now it is necessary to turn the tables around,  stressing the need to impose sanctions.    However, yesterday's dispatches from Pyongyang quoting  Carter  and the quick response from the White House have Seoul and  Washington turning toward dialogue rather than determined action  by the international community.    During his two and a half hour dinner meeting with Carter on  the eve of his departure for Pyongyang, President Kim reportedly  said he did not want to add to the "burden" on Carter's  shoulder, a position indicating that he did not ask Carter to  convey any important message of his own to Kim Il-song.    He was said to have only explained in detail his  government's  position against the North's nuclear ambitions.    Apart from the discrepancies between Seoul and Washington,  there are some mistakes in judgment on the part of Chongwadae  staffers and officials of the National Unification Board.    They failed to give due weight to Carter's visit.    It was too late when a Chongwadae staffer learned that  Carter  would be greeted by Vice Foreign Minister Song Ho-kyong of North  Korea at the truce village of Panmunjom.    Pointing out the fact, the official stressed the need to pay  attention to Pyongyang's intention which he said is to regard  Carter as a "political negotiator" not just a visitor on a  private mission.    But this was not taken seriously by senior officials, it was  said.</p>

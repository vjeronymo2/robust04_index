			<p>BFN     [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- The Bundesbank has warned federal  and laender politicians not to increase taxes any further. "The  tax screw cannot be tightened all the time without putting  economic growth and stability at risk," the Bundesbank  economists say in their 1993 annual report. The reintroduction  of the solidarity tax at the beginning of 1995, the increase in  mineral oil tax, and the increase in pension insurance  contributions "will pave the way for a further considerable  increase in the total tax burden."    In view of the high public indebtedness, which, at 1,740  billion German marks, reached 56 percent of the GDP at the end  of 1993, the Frankfurt central bank pleaded for more severe  corrective measures in monetary policy. "An early return to  sound public finances that bring back the lost breathing space  for private investors and savers and that are convincing in the  medium term, could mobilize growth and open up new  perspectives." The Bundesbank concedes, however, that this  consolidation process will take several years.    The economists at the Bundesbank assess Germany's economic  recovery somewhat more cautiously than the Federal Government.  For eastern Germany, the central bank calls for a change in  wage policy, with lower growth rates. The Bundesbank states  that "prospects of the German economy have brightened up  lately." Yet, there is "no clear upward trend in industrial  production for the first few months of 1994" visible in western  Germany at the moment. But conditions for a recovery, and thus  a final defeat of recession, have clearly improved.    At the opening of the Hannover Trade Fair on Tuesday [19  April], Chancellor Helmut Kohl spoke of an economic spring when  he said: "A number of economic figures indicate an upward  trend." According to the Bundesbank experts, a permanent  stimulation of exports "has become likely." However, this will  only happen "if the recovery in the world economy continues and  western German industry manages further to strengthen its  competitiveness." The latest wage round settlements are rated  favorably in this connection. Beside the chemical industry  compromise with a 1.5-percent wage increase, the metalworkers  agreement is considered a particularly significant settlement.  It does not involve any real increase of income for the  employees, and thus no additional cost for the employers.    According to the Bundesbank, "a change in wage policy is  crucial" for improving competitiveness in eastern Germany. In  1994 alone, basic wages in the metalworking industry will  increase by 12 percent over 1993. An end of the catching-up  process with western German wage standards could contribute a  great deal to preserving existing jobs and improving the  opportunities for unemployed people. If the wage policy course  of adjusting to the western German level continues, the pressure  to decrease the gap between wages and productivity by means of  further job cuts will increase.</p>

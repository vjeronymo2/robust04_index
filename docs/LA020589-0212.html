			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RAINS PUT END TO CSUN SOFTBALL TOURNAMENT  </P> <P> Softball Coach Gary Torgeson of Cal State Northridge officially canceled the  Tournament of Champions because of rain Saturday. It was the tournament's only  cancellation in 7 years.  </P> <P> Six games were completed Friday before rain washed out the remaining 2 days of  play. Northridge defeated Nevada Las Vegas, 1-0, in 8 innings Friday.  </P> <P> Torgeson said that the tournament was canceled because the rain made the  softball field at Northridge unplayable.  </P> <P> "It would have wrecked our field to play on it and some of the other teams did  not want to take that chance," Torgeson said. "Safety was the primary reason."  </P> <P> The rain also proved troublesome for Valley-area baseball teams. Northridge's  doubleheader at home against Cal Lutheran also was canceled because of rain.  </P> <P> Moorpark College's game against L. A. Mission on Saturday was rained out. The  game has yet to be rescheduled but Friday's game against Antelope Valley, which  also fell victim to the rain, will be played at 2 p.m. Monday at Moorpark.  </P> <P> Valley College's game at Fullerton College was postponed until Monday at 2. The  Monarchs' Friday game against Long Beach City College was postponed until 2  p.m. on Feb. 13 at Valley.  </P> <P> Pierce College's game at Long Beach, scheduled for Saturday, was postponed  until 2 p.m. Feb. 27 at Long Beach. This weekend's Glendale-Citrus tournament  was washed out. RALPH NICHOLS  </P></p>

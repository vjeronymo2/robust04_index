			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Marley declines 67% to Pounds 8m THE REVIVAL in the UK housing market is starting to boost sales of some building materials according to Marley, the UK construction products group which yesterday announced a 67 per cent fall last year in pre-tax profits. Profits after exceptional provisions of Pounds 10.4m slumped from Pounds 25m to Pounds 8.1m reflecting the deep recession in the UK construction industry last year. UK profits fell from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 1.2m after a Pounds 2.3m second-half loss. Up to a third of group sales are generated from the UK housing market, according to Mr David Trapnell, chief executive. US profits by comparison almost doubled from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 7.7m. The German residential market continues to show little sign of flagging as far as Marley's products were concerned, said Mr Trapnell. The DIY market in eastern Germany remained particularly strong and profits in western Europe rose from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 12.9m last year. The group, as forecast, paid a final dividend of 2.1p making a total of 4.2p for the year compared with 6.35p in 1991. Earnings per share after exceptional provisions, mostly to cover closure costs and redundancies in the UK, fell from 6p to 0.7p. Net borrowings as a percentage of shareholders' funds, following write-downs and currency movements, rose from 41 per cent to 57 per cent. Marley, in spite of increased gearing, generated a positive operational cashflow last year. About 80 per cent of worldwide turnover was from the building industry, according to Mr Trapnell. He had been encouraged by an increase in UK sales of plumbing and drainage products and thermalite blocks during the past four to six weeks. 'I believe we have seen the bottom of the cycle. Much now will depend upon how UK housing starts respond to increased demand seen recently from house purchasers,' he said. Sales of roof tiles however, remained depressed. Prices of building materials, where supply was continuing to outrun demand, were likely to remain under pressure said the Marley chief executive. The group reiterated its intention to sell its UK brick businesses, where it holds a 2 per cent market share, should a buyer 'at the right price' be found.</p>

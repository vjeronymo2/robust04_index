Today it addresses the sons of our  Palestinian people everywhere and in all places of residence on  the beloved homeland or in the areas of gathering outside it,  and all its political and social forces, and all its patriotic  activities and jamahiri organizations, and all our brothers in  the Palestinian detachments and the nationalist personalities,  in order to reaffirm anew the importance of consolidating our  national unity -- especially in these fateful and decisive times  we are all passing through. It calls for more cohesion and  unity at this great battleground and in the labor pains in which  we are living and working, in order to realize the establishment  of a patriotic Palestinian authority to complete the Israeli  withdrawal from the Gaza sector and the Jericho area as a first  step along the path of retrieving the inalienable national  rights of our Palestinian people and the establishment of our  independent Palestinian state whose capital is Holy Jerusalem.    Now that we are about to enter, with God's permission and  His  assistance, a new major, important, and historic period to be  characterized by the creation of the first Palestinian authority  in contemporary history on the land of our beloved homeland,  this requires us all to work together in order to reconstruct  and rebuild the national infrastructures, institutions, and  bodies at all the political, economic, social, and institutional  levels.    Therefore at these crucial and historic moments, we are  inviting all the national forces, factions, unions,  institutions, and figures to meet and stress what brings us  together and not what separates us and let those assembled  adhere to the former. This should be entrenched in the minds  and souls of everyone, in order to build our free and proud  homeland for a people of freemen, militants, fighters, and  believers. This will be a homeland of unity, light, hope, and  faith which will be able to gain the trust of the people of the  world who following this unique Palestinian experiment.    The PLO Executive Committee welcomes the efforts made by  some  brethren with a view to strengthening national unity and  reinforcing the bases of the democratic process and regards  these efforts as a blessed action which proves the health and  vitality of the Palestinian arena and our people's determination  to rally around the Palestine Liberation Organization which  leads its national struggle. Therefore, the PLO Executive  Committee calls on all the Palestinian brethren and factions to  contribute to the enrichment of the national dialogue and its  deepening in order to strengthen our capacity to complete the  recovery of our inalienable national rights, including our  people's right to return, self-determination, and the  establishment of their independent state with holy Jerusalem as  its capital.    This is the time for unity and not for disunion. This is the  time for solidarity which is based on common denominators and  not on elements of division. This is the time for joint action,  and let amity govern our practices and our relations and what we  agree on and what we disagree on. Let us come together, hand-in  hand, to wage our sacred battle to build the Palestinian  national entity; and let us direct our attention to the national  interest of our people, our homeland, and nation within the  framework of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole  legitimate representative of our people, the protector of its  interests and the leader of its struggle.    The revolution will continue until victory.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Fishing for medical clues The lamprey, delicacy of medieval monarchs and among the most primitive of fish, is the model for an ambitious computer simulation project funded by the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and headed by Thelma Williams at St George's Hospital Medical School, London. The idea is to simulate the detailed interaction between nerves and muscles, the rest of lamprey's body and water, which produces its characteristic eel-like swimming motion. The lamprey's anatomy and nervous system are simple and well understood compared with more advanced animals. Nerve cells in its spinal cord generate rhythmic neural patterns, which activate muscles to contract alternately on opposite sides of the fish, without commands from the brain. The ultimate aim is to provide more general information about the way animals move. This would help to underpin medical progress in treating locomotive disorders. BBSRC: UK, 0793 414668</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergei Shmelyov: "Radioactive Moscow"] </F>   [Text] To say that Moscow is becoming a radioactive  disposal site is like saying that a heroine-mother is becoming a  woman. Unfortunately, our capital is long been such a disposal  site.    Employees of the Radon Scientific Production Association  cleaned up 1,160 radioactive contamination sites in Moscow and  vicinity from 1979 to 1992.    So-called "historical" radioactive wastes account for a  large  part of these nonplanned radioactive waste sites. According to  secret instructions issued by the People's Commissariat of  Internal Affairs, spent radioactive substances were buried  underground (in undeveloped areas, refuse dumps, ravines, and  ditches) at what was considered a safe depth--one at which gamma  radiation at the surface would not exceed 300 microroentgens per  hour. But yesterday's outskirts and undeveloped areas are now  being built up.    There was no system to track migration of radiation  emitters.  No one kept a map of the burial sites, which was simply  impossible.    Today these radioactive remains are "surfacing" in the most  unpredictable places--flowerbeds, children's sandboxes, bomb  shelters, beach restrooms, private apartments, garages,  basements, military compounds.    In addition to the "historical" radioactive waste sites, new  "pirate" dumps are being discovered from time to time.    Two instruments with ionizing radiation emitters were  recently found in a pile of construction refuse on Shcherbakov  Street. A container of thorium ore was found at the building at  6 Donskaya Street, and a one-kilogram cobblestone emitting a  small amount of radiation was found on Saykin Street.    A metallic emitter giving off 630,000 microroentgens per  hour  was accidentally found by an electrician in a basement at the  Hammer and Sickle Plant. (Average background radiation in the  Russia's central belt 10 to 15 microroentgens per hour, and 15  to 20 in cities.)    A "radioactive" private garage was discovered this winter on  Fersman Street. The wood floor and metal covering were "glowing"  in places at up to 900 microroentgens per hour.    Just three months ago, workers finished clearing up the  notorious 26th kilometer of the Moscow Ring Road, where nearby  vacant lot occupies the site of a former refuse dump. The  operation took almost seven years. That's how long it took our  wise city fathers to just to solve some simple organizational  matters and to come up with the best plan for containing the  site.    There were some spots emitting abnormally high radioactivity  at up to 720,000 microroentgens per hour. Now the radiation has  been reduced to the standard average European level. A parking  lot will be built on the site.    A building housing a former hydropathic treatment facility  at  Hospital No. 54 in Eastern Okrug was giving off 72,000  microroentgens per hour. The heating battery was especially  contaminated. The radiation emitted by some construction refuse,  books, and abandoned equipment parts was somewhat lower.    Initial measurements in the yard of an apartment building on  Chernyshevskiy Street in Elektrostal revealed surface  radioactivity of up to 600 microroentgens per hour.    Almost 60 metric tons of low-radioactive soil and slag was  removed from Noginsk and Ramenskiy. And it's still not certain  that no more remains.    The main radioactive items that the clean-up crews have  found  in Moscow are chemical vessels, phosphors, foil, ruberoid, ore  specimens, reference ionizing radiation emitters, and parts of  various instruments and smoke detectors containing radioactive  elements.    Thefts of radioactive materials for resale made their  "season  premiere." A container with 16 kilograms of thorium sand was  found by a police patrol right outside the Kursk Train Station.  According to the markings, the contraband was being sent from  India to Japan. Our customs service is sometimes simply unable  to identify radioactive materials. In addition to those in  Moscow, "pirate" radioactive waste sites have been found in St.  Petersburg, Irkutsk, Izhevsk, Kansk, Maykop, Iskitim, and  Gatchina.    Not a single fundamental issue relating to radiation safety  has been solved in the form of legislation as yet.    We're going to start dying not from food shortages, but from  contaminated foods.</p>

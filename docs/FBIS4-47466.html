Grabovskiy, Technical </F> Institute, St. Petersburg; UDC661.183.123]    [Abstract] One of the leading trends in research is the  modification of coal-derived adsorbents with various additives,  such as shale kerogen, liquid products of shale, and petroleum  residues, which significantly enhance both their sorption  properties and their selectivity in leaching out metals from  solutions. The present work is a study of the relationship  between the composition and nature of the charge in the  preparation of adsorbents from coal with petroleum asphaltites  and their by-products for the purpose of determining the most  active form for the adsorption of arsenic from effluent water.  An adsorbent, derived from coal dust and containing 8 percent  moderately concentrated asphaltite (66 percent asphaltites), was  found to have a sorption capacity to extract arsenic from  effluents that is 1.5-1.8 times greater than the best foreign or  domestic products.

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Letter: Better a small spread and a round of golf Sir, Thirty years ago, when inflation and interest rates were last at today's sort of levels, local building society managers ran their businesses on a '5-4-3' rule: lend money for mortgages at 5 per cent, borrow it at 4 per cent, and then be on the golf course by 3 o'clock. Now, though, my building society's mortgage rate is 8.3 per cent, and it borrows money from me at 5.3 per cent gross. This is a spread of 3 points, compared with 1 percentage point 30 years ago. Have building societies become three times as efficient as they were more than a generation ago? Are these the true economies of scale from all those amalgamations of small building societies? Or is this the true cost of automating cash dispensing and the back room operations? Can any of your correspondents think of a similar industry where 'progress' has been so costly to the public? Personally I'd prefer a 1-point spread and my manager on the golf course at 3 o'clock. Mark Hull, 10 Oakthorpe Road, Summertown, Oxford, OX2 7BE</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 2 Apr (PL) -- With positive results for the  Cuban-Zambian bilateral ties and economic cooperation, Zambian  Foreign Minister Remmy Kaindu Gilly Mushota ended his visit to  Cuba today.    Mushota, who was invited by his colleague Roberto Robaina to  visit Cuba, negotiated cooperation agreements in the sectors of  sugar industry, agriculture, education, public health, sports,  and international relations.    The building of a sugar mill in Zambia by Cuban  professionals  in Zambia, scheduled to start in 1995, was one of the agreements  discussed during this visit. It was reported that the agreement  will be ratified by Zambian President Frederick Chiluba on his  next visit to the Caribbean nation.    An increase in the number of Cuban physicians sent to  Zambia,  the continuation of the studies of 43 Zambians in local  education centers, and the exchange of sports trainers were  other issues discussed by Mushota and Cuban officials.    Regarding possible pressure from international financial  institutions and the United States to block Chiluba's announced  visit, the foreign minister said in a news conference that his  is an independent and sovereign country and its development  programs are not established in Washington.    He added that negotiations with the IMF and the World Bank  had ended, precisely the previous evening, and Zambia was to  receive a $150-million loan to promote its economic programs.    "They are our partners in cooperation, not our owners.  President Chiluba will come to Cuba with Zambian money and not  with money from the IMF," Mushota observed.    The two countries started to strengthen their bilateral ties  on 19 June 6572 [year as received], when diplomatic relations  were established. During his two-week visit to Cuba, Mushota  visited places of scientific, historic, and cultural interest in  Havana and the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba, before leaving  for Jamaica on Saturday, to continue his tour of the Caribbean.    The Zambian territory, which has 174,000 square km, is  mostly  covered by a plateau that runs from the Malawi tectonic trench  to a swampy region bordering Angola. It is the world's third  largest producer and number one exporter of copper and has other  important mineral resources.</p>

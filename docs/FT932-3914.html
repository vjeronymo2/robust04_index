			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: 600 Group hit by competition on prices THE 600 Group reported a Pounds 1.26m operating loss for the year ended March 31, due to a further reduction in UK and European orders and 'severely increased' price competition in several key market areas. The manufacturer and distributor of machine tools and mechanical handling equipment said the deficit compared with a loss of Pounds 7.78m, restated to conform with FRS 3. Turnover increased from Pounds 98.5m to Pounds 99.2m, although Pounds 4m was due to exchange rate movements. After lower interest costs of Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 2.1m), the pre-tax loss was Pounds 2.39m, compared with a restated Pounds 2.46m. The final dividend is reduced from 1.5p to 1p, making a total for the year of 2p (2.5p). Losses per share fell from 6.8p to 5.9p. Explaining the pay-out cut, Prof Michael Wright, chairman, said: 'Although the group is in a sound financial position and we believe that we have encouraging prospects for the future, market conditions have continued to deteriorate.' Amid persistent recession in main markets, the reduced operating loss reflected the group's policy of reducing overheads and rationalising manufacturing capacity. Prof Wright said a key objective was to ensure the group had the market position and financial resources to enable it to trade profitably through any future demand fluctuations or economic disturbances. 'This is being achieved by continued and detailed attention to cash flow, with the aim of substantially reducing borrowing.' In 1992-93 the group suffered a Pounds 3m non-recurring cash outflow on restructuring its lathe business, and a Pounds 2m VAT payment relating to the previous year's Pounds 9.3m sale of the surplus Colchester Lathe site. In spite of this, net borrowings increased by only Pounds 2m to Pounds 9m, indicating the success of controls on working capital.</p>

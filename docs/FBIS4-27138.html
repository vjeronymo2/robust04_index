			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 28 (YONHAP) -- Negotiations between the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and North Korea over  safeguards on nuclear facilities in the communist country  failed, Demitri Perricos, safeguards director at the UN nuclear  watchdog, said here Saturday.    Perricos and one other IAEA senior envoy sent to Pyongyang  to  discuss possible measurements of fuel rods unloaded from an  experimental 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon nuclear compound on  Tuesday, arrived in Beijing together with the chief of IAEA team  that conducted inspections in nuclear reprocessing facilities  since may 17.    The procedures proposed by North Korea were insufficient for  IAEA to determine safeguards of the nuclear facilities and the  talks ended in failure because the stalinist country refused the  UN body's demand to stop unilateral unloading of the fuel rods,  calling it political restriction, Perricos said.    He said North Koreans refused to accept nuclear safeguards,  admitting that IAEA and Pyongyang failed to narrow differences  over lasting safeguards measures such as by regular and ad hoc  inspections.    The senior IAEA official was, however, cautious in  forecasting the failure in talks could lead to sanctions against  North Korea, saying it was up to the United Nations to decide.    He said he told North Koreans that talks could be resumed if  they wanted to.    Perricos said his team had sent short report on the results  of talks with North Korea and nuclear inspections to the IAEA  headquarters on Friday, but added that he didn't know whether  IAEA Director-General Hans Blix reported the results to the UN  Security Council.    He said the final report would be submitted at the IAEA  headquarters when they arrive in Vienna.</p>

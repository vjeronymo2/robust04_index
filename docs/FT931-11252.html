			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak back in the black with Dollars 299m EASTMAN Kodak, the photographic equipment company, reported fourth-quarter net earnings of Dollars 299m, compared with a Dollars 400m loss a year ago, and forecast its latest restructuring plan would produce a solid increase in 1993 operating earnings. The company, with a lacklustre profits record in recent years, has been showing signs of a more aggressive approach to its problems, including the announcement of 2,000 redundancies. Mr Kay Whitmore, the chairman, reiterated the company's penitential tone when he declared that from now on Kodak would 'better align our structural costs with realistic volume projections. We will view the world as it is, and not as we might wish it to be. And our view will be fixed on increasing shareholder value.' The fourth-quarter earnings worked through at 92 cents a share and compared with a loss of Dollars 1.23 a share in the same period of 1991, when the company took after-tax restructuring charges of Dollars 597m, or Dollars 1.84. Revenues rose 6 per cent to Dollars 5.40bn from Dollars 5.08bn. For the full-year net earnings were Dollars 1.15bn, or Dollars 3.53 a share, compared with Dollars 17m, or 5 cents, a year ago. The 1991 figures were reduced by Dollars 1.03bn of after-tax charges, while in 1992 a Dollars 152m beneficial accounting change was almost offset by Dollars 141m of restructuring charges. However, Mr Whitmore acknowledged that 'with sluggish volume and cost inflation putting pressure on operating margins, the sale of certain investments was a large factor in the net earnings gain' for 1992. In the fourth quarter the imaging business produced earnings of Dollars 316m, against a 1991 loss of Dollars 189m, while the information business suffered a loss of Dollars 12m, down from a loss of Dollars 65m, excluding restructuring charges.</p>

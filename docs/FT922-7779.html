			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Black ready to bid Dollars 75m for NY Daily News MR CONRAD Black, chairman of the Daily Telegraph group will make a formal bid for the New York Daily News, the loss-making daily, in the middle of next week. Mr Black is expected to bid around Dollars 75m (Pounds 42m) for the famous daily bought last year by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. The purchase price is calculated to meet trade creditors and severance terms for those who will lose their jobs. The bid will come with undertakings to protect the newspaper's future and commitments to modernisation including the installation of new presses. However, in return the unions would have to accept a 35 per cent reduction in full time jobs and recognise, as happened at the Daily Telegraph more than five years ago, that management has a right to manage. Mr Black is not convinced that his bid will be accepted - at least first time round - but believes these are the sort of terms needed to guarantee the newspaper's future. On April 28, the Telegraph chairman was given four weeks to work out a deal with the paper's management, unions and creditors. Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, publisher of the US News and World Report, is also seen as a possible buyer. Mr Black has also decided, after initial doubts, that he is seriously interested in bidding for Mirror Group Newspapers when it comes on the market, although he is unlikely to get involved in an auction. The private Maxwell business which controls a majority of MGN is in administration and effectively owned by a range of banks. The Telegraph chairman who owns about 200 newspapers worldwide - most of them small North American dailies and weeklies - has worked out a recipe for expanding his media empire. Increasingly he plans to buy publishing companies either in receivership or close to it. The aim then is to improve the management, modernise the product and, where possible, relaunch on a rising economic tide.</p>

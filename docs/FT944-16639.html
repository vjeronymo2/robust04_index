			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sappi leads S Africa out of the woods - Pulp and paper group has become a global force Sappi, the South African pulp and paper company which this week announced it was acquiring US producer SD Warren for Dollars 1.6bn, has long had the goal of becoming a global player in the paper industry by 2000. Guided by Mr Eugene van As, executive chairman, the unexpected announcement seems to indicate that the company has achieved its target a few years earlier than anticipated. In the process it has become South Africa's first truly global industrial company, following a route previously trodden only by the country's big mining houses. By adding SD Warren, which is dominant in the US coated paper market, to its operations in South Africa and Europe, the company has become one of the world's bigger paper producers. More notably, it is now the global leader in dissolving pulp and coated wood-free papers, both fast-growing niche markets in the paper business. 'I am delighted with the acquisition. It complements our existing operations and will play a key role in our future success,' says Mr van As. In spite of his confidence in Sappi's future, the road ahead is far from certain, and analysts and shareholders are not unanimous in their support for the latest move. The company remains dominant in the local market, with a 50 per cent share of the broader pulp and paper industry, and its interests encompass everything from raw timber to finished papers. It owns 340,000ha of forest in the southern Africa region - which will in effect be doubled to 765,000ha with the addition of SD Warren's timber interests - and has a wide range of domestic plants covering craft papers, fine papers and pulp. Sappi's Saiccor plant, acquired from UK-based Courtaulds in 1988, has long been the world's largest and lowest-cost producer of dissolving pulp, which is used in the production of viscose for rayon fibre and cellophane film. It is undergoing a R1bn (Dollars 280m) expansion and the bulk of its production is targeted for export. Given the size of its share of the local market, Sappi has for several years been diverting an increasing portion of local production for export. It has also formed a wide-ranging international trading company. Complementing this, it made its first foreign acquisition in 1990, buying five paper mills in the UK. Two years later, the company bought German-based coated paper producer Hannovier Papier. Nevertheless, during this period, South Africa's long recession and a global slump in paper prices severely weakened local sales. The situation was further aggravated by increased competition from imports, particularly from Brazil and Finland, which have taken advantage of South Africa's traditionally low tariffs on paper products to exploit the top end of the local market. Adding to Sappi's woes, the European recession severely dented its newly acquired operations there, and Hannovier has so far been a disappointment - as well as a severe drain on resources. Worse, Hannovier's recent losses have severely dented Sappi's bottom line becauses of the continued depreciation of the rand. In response, the company's earnings plunged and it was forced to suspend dividends. Sappi reported after-tax earnings of R142.2m for 1993-94, down from R604m as recently as 1990. But the domestic market has picked up and Hannovier, which appears to have turned the corner, is expected to make a significant contribution to earnings this financial year. Nevertheless, most analysts had expected Sappi to wait before making another international foray, giving itself time to consolidate its existing operations and build up cash. But the lure of SD Warren appears to have been too great for Mr van As to resist. The Dollars 1.6bn purchase price is high in terms of the current standing of paper stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, but as the Hannovier deal showed, Mr van As is always willing to take a gamble. The attraction lay in the overall quality of SD Warren, its strengths in an area where Sappi has considerable expertise, and positive industry projections for sales in the coated wood-free sector, which are expected to outstrip all other main paper and board products over the next five years. The relative ease of finding partners and putting together a financial package seems to have been equally important. Traditionally, South African companies have trod cautiously in the international arena, hampered by strict exchange controls at home and the country's political reputation abroad. Now, however, as mining house Gencor's Dollars 1.3bn acquisition of Billiton in July demonstrated, South African companies have gained a new acceptability. Indeed, as Sappi's executives noted with some surprise, several banks competed vigorously to organise the Sappi deal, in spite of the company's inability to raise money domestically or borrow against local assets because of exchange restrictions. 'Having been the pariahs of the world for so long it was very pleasing to see some of the best banks in the world competing to do business with us,' says Mr van As. 'For Sappi this was a once in a lifetime opportunity and we were fortunate to have on our side financiers with a breadth of vision and a commitment to make the deal succeed.' However, with a new debt/equity ration of 1.25, up from its current level of 0.4 and nearly five times the company's stated aim of a ratio of 0.35, Sappi and its backers will need both vision and commitment to make the venture succeed.</p>

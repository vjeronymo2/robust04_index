			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Plutonic bids for rival gold miner PLUTONIC Resources, the Western Australian gold miner, yesterday continued the trend towards rationalisation in the gold mining industry by bidding almost Dollars A81m (USDollars 55.3m) for rival mining group Forsayth NL. Plutonic is bidding 25 cents cash a share for Plutonic and has already reached agreement to buy an 18.4 per cent interest in the company from FAI Insurances at the same price. However, Forsayth shares quickly moved above the bid price, gaining 3 cents to 26 cents on Australian stock exchanges yesterday. Forsayth directors advised shareholders to take no action on the offer. Plutonic plans to fund its bid mainly through its Dollars A70m cash holdings, built up through proceeds of the rich Plutonic mine. The company is one of the few cashed-up and debt-free West Australian gold miners and has been looking for acquisition targets for some months. In contrast, Forsayth is recovering from a string of losses, returning to the black with a Dollars A5.6m net profit in the latest year. FAI Insurances directors said yesterday that the company had made a profit of more than Dollars A8m on its sale of Forsayth shares to Plutonic.</p>

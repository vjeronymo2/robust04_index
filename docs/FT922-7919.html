			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Globe-trotting Czechs seek new markets - The search to replace Soviet sales THE SEARCH by Czechoslovakia for new markets last month took President Vaclav Havel to Japan and South Korea while his prime minister, Mr Marian Calfa, set off for South Africa at the head of a 50-strong delegation of Czech and Slovak businessmen. Such top-level globe-trotting reflects the urgency of finding new export outlets to replace the former high dependence on Soviet trade. But it also marks a desire to re-establish a presence in global markets beyond the European Community and attract new investment to update Czechoslovakia's product range and increase the attractiveness of its exports. Until this happens the country remains locked into its existing pattern of exporting a wide range of relatively low- or medium-technology engineering and consumer goods while importing energy and raw materials from the former Soviet Union and more sophisticated investment and consumer goods from the west. Despite these product limitations, willingness to trim margins and easier access to the EC and markets of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) have already made western Europe the main market for Czechoslovak exports. This has helped offset the loss of the former Soviet bloc trading system Comecon, which accounted for 61 per cent of overall trade in 1989 but less than 30 per cent last year. Growth in trade with the west however has not yet been strong enough to compensate for the collapse of Comecon. Total exports of 321bn koruna (Dollars 11bn) in 1991 were 94 per cent of their 1990 level and nearly 30 per cent down on the Dollars 14.3bn of 1989. Imports have shrunk even more sharply to Dollars 10.1bn from Dollars 13.2bn in 1990. Lower imports reflect both a recession which cut gross domestic product by nearly 15 per cent last year and the shift away from energy-intensive, polluting heavy industry. Imports of crude oil from Russia, for example, dropped from 16m tons in 1989 to 11m tons last year. With imports dropping faster than exports, Czechoslovakia's balance of trade recorded a 25bn koruna surplus in 1991. The collapse of exports to the former Soviet Union in particular has deepened the domestic recession, especially in Slovakia with its heavy concentration of arms factories and other plants geared specifically to the old Soviet market. Within the lower overall volume, however, trade with EC markets grew strongly, to account for 40.7 per cent of Czechoslovakia's total exports last year compared with 24 per cent in 1988. A third of imports came from the EC, against only a quarter from the former Soviet Union, although imports from the former Comecon countries as a whole were virtually identical to the EC share at 32.2 per cent of the total. The trend towards closer integration in the EC is expected to continue as Czechoslovakia, along with Hungary and Poland, reaps the benefits of a recent association agreement with the EC. Germany, which accounts for two-thirds of the estimated Dollars 800m foreign capital invested in Czechoslovakia last year, took 19.4 per cent of Czechoslovak exports and supplied 20.1 per cent of all imports in 1991. It is expected soon to replace the former Soviet Union as the largest single export market. But the influence of the German-speaking world does not stop with Germany. Austria and Switzerland are also becoming important trading partners. In 1991, Efta, of which they are members, accounted for 10 per cent of Czechoslovakia's total trade. Business with Efta countries is expected to be boosted by a recent trade agreement which takes effect on July 1. But, as indicated by the official visits to Asia and Africa, and the opening soon of a trade office in San Francisco to supplement existing offices in New York and Washington, Czechoslovakia is also looking further afield. Until now trade with the Pacific rim countries has been minimal. Czechoslovak exports to Japan for example were a mere Dollars 71m last year, mainly traditional consumer goods such as Bohemian glass and porcelain and hops for brewing Japanese beer. Exports to South Korea were only Dollars 8m. Japan traditionally likes to boost trade links before following up with investment, and in the long run the main purpose of the high-profile state visit to both Japan and South Korea was to raise Czechoslovakia's profile as a profitable venue for investment. Africa was also neglected under the old regime, with trade limited mainly to shipments of military materiel in obligatory support of Moscow's support for revolutionary regimes. The visit to Pretoria last month was recognition that if political developments allow South Africa to become the dynamo for the economic regeneration of southern Africa, a new market would be created in which Czechoslovakia would also intend to participate.</p>

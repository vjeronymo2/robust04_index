			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY'S GENERAL PLAN TO BE OVERHAULED  </P> <P> The city plans to spend $500,000 during the next two years to overhaul its  general plan, a revision that will shape development in the city through the  end of the decade.  </P> <P> City officials are seeking expert consultants, who, along with city staff  members, will review areas such as land use, traffic, smog, growth management  and waste recycling.  </P> <P> Except for revising the plan for housing needs and making some other minor  changes, the General Plan has not been updated since 1976. The 14-year-old  housing plan was revised first because the state requires it be updated every  four years. The state recommends that the core of the general plan be updated  every 10 years.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission in March called for changes in the general plan, saying  the aging document has complicated and, in some cases, even hindered the  regular development process.  </P> <P> In particular, outdated zoning has often caused bureaucratic headaches for  commissioners and city staff officials handling new development proposals,  commission Chairwoman Geri Ortega said Thursday.  </P> <P> The land-use section of the plan, which regulates zoning, is scheduled to be  revamped as soon as the city hires a consultant, according to a city officials,  who expect the section to be completed by June, 1991.

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Government may cut OECD budget THE GOVERNMENT is considering cutting its contributions to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - a move which could lead to a sharp reduction in the organisation's assessment of member countries' economic performances. Just over 6 per cent of the OECD's budget comes from the UK. The Foreign Office - which last year contributed Pounds 5.2m to the OECD - is seeking support for its reduction from the other 23 members. If the British move is successful, the budget allotted to the OECD's core economic activities, including annual surveys of member countries and twice-yearly economic forecasts, could be reduced. The proposal comes at a time of Treasury sensitivity about independent assessments of the UK economy which is still struggling to emerge from its longest recession for 50 years. The UK delegation to the OECD said a high value was put on OECD economic work, but refused to comment on the proposed cuts because discussions on the overall budget were in progress. In order to succeed, Britain will have to convince other members that some of the organisation's economic output is expendable. British representatives will stress that world and domestic economic conditions are forcing it to seek cuts in its contributions to all international organisations. Britain is also anxious to see 'efficiency improvements' which could affect the organisation's economic studies. However, some member countries place a higher value than others on the surveys and forecasts and would be unhappy to see the OECD's economic activities reduced. One reason for the UK unease is the possible inclusion of criticism about the domestic economy in January's annual survey.</p>

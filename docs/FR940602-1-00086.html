Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These regulations are proposed under the authority of sections 2002, 3004, 3005 and 7004(b) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 3004 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), requires owners and operators of treatment, storage, and disposal facilities to comply with standards ``necessary to protect human health and the environment.'' These standards are implemented generally through interim status standards applicable to facilities that achieve interim status under RCRA section 3005(c), and through permits that are issued by EPA or under authorized State programs. EPA continuously strives to improve the hazardous waste management standards in order to ensure protection of human health and the environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The role that combustion plays in hazardous waste management has changed dramatically over the last decade and a half. With the recognition that land disposal of hazardous waste could present long term pollution problems, larger use of combustion ensued. However, waste treatment alone will not totally solve the problems associated with hazardous waste disposal. Therefore, EPA decided to take a fresh look at how to achieve a fully integrated waste management program that gives source reduction its proper emphasis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  While the Agency is committed to source reduction as its primary approach to waste management, it believes that there will continue to be a role for waste combustion, provided it is done safely and in compliance with federal regulations. Combustion is a proven waste treatment technique to address many types of wastes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To this end, on May 18, 1993, the Agency announced its Draft Strategy on Waste Minimization and Hazardous Waste Combustion. EPA issued the strategy in draft form as the starting point for the debate on what source reduction/recycling actions and regulatory changes the Agency should pursue. The Agency has been aggressive in involving all the stakeholders as part of the national dialogue on these national policy questions. In addition, since EPA and the States are partners and co-regulators in hazardous waste management, any evaluation of the role of waste minimization and hazardous waste combustion in the hazardous waste management system must be a joint federal and state effort. Thus, EPA and the States have used, and will continue to use, a joint EPA/State committee to further develop the national strategy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the context of a national dialogue on waste minimization and hazardous waste combustion, the Agency has identified a number of specific actions it would pursue to ensure that existing combustion facilities operate safely and without unacceptable risks to human health and the environment. These actions include: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Aggressive use of waste minimization measures in permitting and enforcement efforts that involve generators of combustible waste, as well as incinerators and boilers and industrial furnaces (BIFs); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Ensuring that a comprehensive risk assessment, including indirect risk, is conducted at each facility site; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Use of omnibus permitting authority to include dioxin/furan emission limits and more stringent particulate matter standards in new permits, where necessary to protect human health and the environment; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Giving low management priority to permitting any new incinerator and BIF capacity, unless the new facilities would replace and be a significant improvement over existing capacity; in other words, the draft strategy makes interim status combustion facilities the highest permitting priority, in terms of processing permits, in order to bring these facilities under more comprehensive environmental controls. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the draft strategy calls for development of mechanisms to facilitate increased public participation in the permitting process. By developing such mechanisms, EPA hopes to allow the public early access to information about the facility and an opportunity to participate in permitting decisions regarding hazardous waste storage, treatment, or disposal facilities (TSDFs) that may affect their communities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By providing citizens an enhanced opportunity to participate in facility permitting, the Agency is striving to give citizens more input into decisions about facilities that may impact their communities. This may be particularly so in low income or minority communities where the lack of this opportunity has been felt strongly. Consistent with the Agency's efforts to ensure environmental justice, EPA intends that this rulemaking will give people in such communities increased opportunity to affect RCRA permitting decisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Training body's failure reveals funding minefield The appointment of receivers by the Department of Employment at South Thames Training and Enterprise Council on Wednesday singled out the Tec for weak financial controls and trading losses. But it also illustrated some of the funding pressures that are faced by the employer-led training bodies. Leaders of Tecs, which administer government training in England and Wales, say they operate under one of the most rigorous funding and auditing regimes in the public sector. Tecs are audited up to five times a year - by the Department of Employment head office, one of its regional offices, the National Audit Office, the European Commission and Companies House. The 82 Tecs are set up as companies and receive most of their funding - a total of about Pounds 2bn a year - from the government. But unlike quangos, which are funded by grants, Tecs are paid in arrears for services delivered. The Tecs act as purchasing authorities, contracting with private-sector training providers to deliver services such as Training for Work, the scheme for the unemployed. If a Tec fails to meet the targets that it sets with government, it does not get paid. It must also prove that the contracted services have been delivered before payment is received. It is understood that South Thames Tec has lost Pounds 2m over the past eight months, primarily because it did not provide satisfactory evidence of its claims to the government. Ms Gwynneth Flower, chief executive of Centec in London, said the claims evidence had to come from training providers, and therefore financial control was crucial. 'The principal threat I would see in a Tec is if it does not manage its contractors effectively.' Tecs must also provide extra services - such as childcare - which the government does not fund. These are paid for with the surpluses they make on government-funded programmes. They find contractors to provide training for less than the amount the employment department would pay the Tec for the service. It is believed that South Thames Tec was trying to provide services it could not afford as it was not making a surplus. Mr David Liddell, acting chief executive who replaced Mr Michael Hanson when he resigned in August, said: 'We would have been spending over the budgeted government income deliberately because we thought we had surpluses from the previous year.'</p>

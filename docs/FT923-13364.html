			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / OFT chief hints at action to regulate CD prices SIR Bryan Carsberg, the newly appointed director-general of fair trading, has raised the possibility of instituting regulatory action over the high price of compact discs just three months after his predecessor rejected the idea. In a letter last week addressed to Mr Nigel Griffiths, a Labour frontbench consumer affairs spokesman, Sir Bryan said he wanted to 'review the evidence personally' before deciding on whether a case 'exists for additional work and perhaps formal regulatory action'. Mr Griffiths wrote to Sir Bryan last month requesting a new inquiry, saying the investigation by Sir Gordon Borrie, the previous director-general, had left consumers feeling dissatisfied. Sir Gordon said at the beginning of April that an inquiry by the Office of Fair Trading had found no evidence of collusion between record companies and retailers. Compact discs were more expensive than cassette tapes and vinyl records and this could not be explained by differences in production costs, Sir Gordon said. He made clear, however, that CD prices were high because consumers were willing to pay more for them. 'In other words, the prices of CDs have settled around a level which, on the whole, the market appears willing to bear.' He added: 'There appears to be no action the office could take to stimulate a sharper degree of price competition than our inquiries now suggest prevails, however beneficial such competition might be to consumers.' In his letter to Mr Griffiths, Sir Bryan, who took up his post last month, says: 'There are some indications that the price of compact discs is higher than it should be but the evidence so far is not clear-cut, and the identification of causes of excessive prices, in the structure of the industry, is difficult.' The OFT said yesterday that Sir Bryan would examine the evidence already collected before deciding whether further investigations should be carried out.</p>

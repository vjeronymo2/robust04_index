			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLUE JAYS WATCH HELPLESSLY WHILE RED SOX CLOSE IN;  </P> <P> AL EAST: TORONTO LOSES IN BALTIMORE, 6-3, THEN SEES BOSTON ON TELEVISION NEARLY  FINISH OFF THE DIVISION RACE.  </P> <P> The deal came down a few minutes before 11 o'clock Monday night in the  visitors' clubhouse at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium. The Toronto Blue Jays  stood in their cleats and uniforms and watched on a television screen as the  Boston Red Sox collected one, two, three outs in the ninth inning.  </P> <P> The Blue Jays had this moment to themselves, their clubhouse still closed to  reporters. The big room smelled of sweat and ointments, and it was silent. No  one threw a chair. No one cursed, at least not above a whisper. The players  turned from the television and lined up and ate the dinner a caterer provided.  </P> <P> There wasn't much to say once the reporters were allowed in. What could they  say that the standings didn't? The Blue Jays lost a game they had to win, the  Baltimore Orioles skewering their postseason hopes, 6-3. They are two games  behind the Red Sox with two to play.  </P> <P> "We'll come back out here tomorrow and see if we can get some help," Manager  Cito Gaston said. "If Boston loses two and we're lucky enough to win two here,  who knows, we'll see. But it looks pretty bad right now."  </P> <P> The players milled around, reconciling their plight. They complained that they  should have scored more runs off the Orioles' starting pitcher, Jose Mesa.  Kelly Gruber, the Blue Jays' third baseman, sat on a couch afterward.  </P> <P> "Mesa was pretty fortunate to get away with what he did," Gruber said. "We hit  the ball pretty hard off him and had him shaking his head out there. But a lot  of balls didn't fall.  </P> <P> "We had the lead for the first six innings and you looked up and we only had  three hits. We should have had more."  </P> <P> As Mesa warmed up before the top of the sixth, the scoreboard delivered news  from Boston: The Red Sox's lead over the Chicago White Sox was up to 3-0. The  Blue Jays understood that their margin of error had been pared from a thread to  nothing, but they still could take a nervous comfort in their 3-1 lead.  </P> <P> They started the game with two runs in the first, making the statement they  wanted about not letting the Red Sox get away easily and held the lead until  the sixth. But David Wells, the Blue Jay starter, walked Bill Ripken to begin  the bottom of the sixth.  </P> <P> The next batter, Mike Devereaux, lined a 2-and-1 pitch into the stands behind  left field. Suddenly, the score was tied. One out later, Randy Milligan bounced  a single. Jeff McKnight sacrificed him to second. Up came Bob Melvin with a  chance to break the tie. His sharp single to left gave the Orioles a 4-3 lead.  </P> <P> Mesa (3-2) wound up the winning pitcher after 7 2/3 innings. He gave up three  runs and four hits for his second victory over the slumping Blue Jays in 19  days. Toronto has lost five of its last six games.  </P> <P> Kevin Hickey got one out and Gregg Olson finished for his 37th save.  </P> <P> The Orioles made it 5-3 in the seventh on Ripken's single, and Sam Horn hit a  homer in the eighth to make the score 6-3.  </P> <P> With the Blue Jays down to their last batter, Mookie Wilson, the scoreboard  flashed the latest from Boston: The Red Sox, having blown a 3-0 lead, scored in  the the eighth. Wilson struck out and it was all but over.  </P></p>

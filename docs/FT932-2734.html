			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Anagen ready for market and plans to raise Pounds 15m in placing ANAGEN, a biotechnology company with no sales to date, is coming to the market via a placing which will raise Pounds 15m. The group is capitalised at Pounds 46.5m. Anagen is developing AN2000, a line of fully automated immunoassay systems. This is a method of measuring the presence of cancer markers, fertility hormones and other substances in blood. The company is placing 15m 10p shares at 100p each. The cost of the flotation was Pounds 600,000 and Pounds 2.9m will be used to pay off short-term borrowings. The remaining Pounds 11.5m will be split between working capital and the funding of a new system, AN500, to detect contamination in food. With spending on research and development running at an annual rate of Pounds 3.5m, Mr Mervyn Sennett, managing director, said the company would not be cash flow positive until the third quarter of 1995. The company will not be ready for commercial production until this November, although its product is currently in pre-production. Its development costs - Pounds 14.5m so far - are financed by a consortium of venture capital firms led by Schroder Ventures and include CINVEN, the venture capital arm of the Coal Board pension fund, Electra Capital, Norwich Union Venture Capital and Questa. Dealings are expected to start on June 24.</p>

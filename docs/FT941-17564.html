			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Zimbabwe moves to boost foreign investment: The Harare government's far-reaching package of trade and payments liberalisation measures Zimbabwe has floated its currency, launched a two-tier foreign currency market and devalued the official exchange rate by 17 per cent to ZDollars 8.2 to the US dollar. Mr Richard Hove, the acting finance minister, and Dr Leonard Tsumba, governor of the central bank, also announced the abolition of direct import allocations, the launch of foreign currency accounts (FCAs) for companies and an increased ceiling for dividend remittances, all effective from January 1. The far-reaching package had been widely trailed and contains no surprises. For foreign companies, the two most significant changes are the increase in the ceiling on dividend remittances to 50 per cent of after-tax profits from 25 per cent previously, and the abolition of so-called surplus funds. These apply to all pre-1979 companies - that is, foreign companies that invested in the former Rhodesia before the start of the Lancaster House independence conference in September 1979. Post-1979 companies have long been allowed the higher 50 per cent rate, while companies investing after May 1, 1993, may remit 100 per cent. The abolition of surplus funds means that foreign multinationals with excess cash can now invest anywhere in the money market. Until now, they have been required to deposit with their banks, earning a maximum of 5 per cent. They can now invest at money market rates in excess of 25 per cent. From this week, exporters will retain 60 per cent of their export earnings (up from 50 per cent previously) and can hold these for up to 90 days in a foreign currency account with a Zimbabwe bank. The balance of 40 per cent must be sold to the central bank at the official exchange rate. With the abolition of direct import allocations, importers will have to buy their foreign currency requirements from the new interbank market where there is likely to be a small premium of around 1.5-2 per cent. Prior to the weekend devaluation, export retentions were trading in the unofficial market at a premium of 23 per cent, but most of this will have been eliminated by the 17 per cent devaluation. The government will use its 40 per cent of the country's export earnings to pay for public sector imports, fuel and debt service. From today, the central bank will no longer provide subsidised forward exchange cover for importers, who will have to buy it much more expensively from their commercial bank. All invisible payments - dividends, royalties, licence management fees - will have to go through the interbank market and pay the premium. The 10 per cent tariff on imports brought in under the open licence system has been abolished, and the surtax on imports reduced to 15 per cent from 20 per cent previously. Individual holiday allowances have been liberalised, with travellers allowed up to USDollars 2,000 and the tax on such allowances has also been abolished. Government officials hope the new measures will boost foreign investment and, to that end, the regulations covering portfolio investment have been further liberalised. Foreign investors can now buy a maximum of 35 per cent of the equity in companies listed on the Zimbabwe stock exchange - up from 25 per cent previously. An individual foreign investor may now buy 10 per cent of the shares of a quoted company, compared with 5 per cent before. Foreign investors were re-admitted to the Zimbabwe exchange only last July, since when there has been an inflow of more than ZDollars 100m (USDollars 12m at the new official parity). Dr Tsumba admitted that the devaluation would be inflationary but, because import taxes had been lowered, believed the impact on inflation, currently 22 per cent, would be no more than 3 per cent. There is some grumbling from businessmen, who are unhappy at the further devaluation (the Zimbabwe dollar has depreciated by 70 per cent over the past three years). But the package is likely to be well-received, especially by foreign companies which will welcome the liberalisation of dividend regulations and the greater financial flexibility provided by the interbank exchange market and the disappearance of the surplus funds requirement. Zimbabwe has now implemented the bulk of its trade liberalisation reforms under its five-year structural adjustment programme. Increasingly, the spotlight will now shift to the area of least progress - public sector reform. With official figures showing a disconcerting surge in government borrowing, which will fuel inflation later in the year if it remains unchecked, the government must now move to restructure the public sector.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKE SCHOOLS A BRIDGE TO HOME  </P> <P> It often seems that we have subdivided and subcontracted life. We go to two  employers for our money, one or two schools for our education, a Burger King or  Pizza Hut for dinner. As Ralph Nader said without too much exaggeration in the  recent Utne Reader, "At this time in American history, corporations are more  important in raising children than parents . . . Who's raising the kids?  Kindercare is raising them. McDonald's is feeding them. HBO and Disneyland are  entertaining them."  </P> <P> Unlike our farming ancestors, or even the grandparents who ran small shops,  today's husbands, wives and children spend most days under separate roofs. Even  dinner hour sometimes seems to have disintegrated into individual servings, and  weekends are usurped by errands.  </P> <P> So, it is no wonder that some regard schools as another institution of our  split lives, a replacement for family. We are often ambivalent asking the  schools to take over any more -- to serve breakfast as well as lunch, to teach  ethics as well as English. To add hours and days to their schedule and subtract  them from our own.  </P> <P> For every analyst who thought that a longer school day provided a balance beam  across the great divide of family and work, there was another who thought it  led in the wrong direction. For everyone who thought a longer year would help,  there was another who thought it would cloud the real needs of children.  </P> <P> This is part of a much deeper debate about the direction of change, about work  and families, institutions and human values. This debate underscores much of  what passes for "policy" discussions. But in this early September light, I  remain focused on the immediate -- the need to alter the school calendar and  clock.  </P> <P> There is no evidence, after all, that today's limited school schedule has made  the work world adjust to family needs. Nor is there any reason to believe that  a changed schedule would slow progress toward that goal. What we have right  now, in most places, is parents who work and kids who wander.  </P> <P> A voluntary after-school program -- as many communities can attest -- wouldn't  take children away from families, but from the streets or from the television  set. At their best, such programs enrich a child's life. At a minimum, they  offer security.  </P> <P> This week, when class is out, millions of working parents face their daily pop  quiz: "It's 4:00. Do you know where your children are?" Schools can fill in the  blank.  </P></p>

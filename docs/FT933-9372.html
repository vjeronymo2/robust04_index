			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Leaving school POTENTIALLY the most valuable innovation of last week's report by Sir Ron Dearing on the national curriculum in England and Wales was the announcement that he is to consult until the end of the year on changes to education from the ages of 14 to 19. His big idea is that the age 16 need not have any great educational significance. In the UK's main competitor countries, after all, 14 is more important. At this point, children embark on courses which are designed to keep them in full-time education until the age of 18 or 19. This runs against the traditional British educational culture, where 16 is regarded as the standard leaving age, and academic A-levels are the educational 'gold standard'. But disquieting international comparisons released last week by the Department for Education suggest that Britain's focus on academic education to the age of 16 encourages children to leave school early. In 1990, only 40 per cent of the UK's 16-18-year-olds stayed in full-time education. This was the lowest figure for any of the countries surveyed: the German rate was 89 per cent. In other European countries, national curriculums are narrow and their purpose is to ensure that all children study at least a core of essential academic subjects. Some will add to that core academic subjects for a career in higher education. But others will concentrate, without any feeling of stigma, on vocational education. Unfortunately, the national curriculum in England and Wales has had exactly the opposite effect. It accounts for too much of pupils' time to allow worthwhile vocational courses. Technology covers several technical disciplines, and does not allow children to develop specific skills. Britain's problem seems to be that it does not motivate children, who by 14 have already lost any interest in academic subjects. A programme of vocational education could give them extra confidence, along with worthwhile skills and work habits. The government has made several changes to vocational education. General National Vocational Qualifications are now to be called 'vocational A-levels' and are proving popular with 16-year-olds. Further education has been released from local education authorities, and has been given extra funds for expansion. But the changes have lacked focus, and what is most needed is a change in culture. Reform of vocational education need not be a controversial matter. It has steadfast backing from employers, and enjoys the support of teachers' unions, and of the Labour Party. High unemployment has also helped the chances of engineering a cultural change. With limited job opportunities available, youngsters are getting into the habit of staying in full-time education for longer. If the right courses are introduced, they might continue to do so even when the job market is buoyant once more. The opportunity is there to be grasped.</p>

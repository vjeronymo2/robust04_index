			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Birru from Sanaa] </F>   [Excerpt] Yemen has informed the UN secretary general and  the Arab League secretary general that it has decided to observe  a cease-fire as of midnight tonight. This was announced by  Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah who also said that  the statement issued by the foreign ministers of the Gulf  Cooperation Council [GCC] countries in Abha yesterday was not  cordial toward his country, and does not help in implementing  the UN Security Council resolution. After criticizing any  outside interference in Yemeni affairs, Basindwah said he hopes  that the neighboring countries will review their stands as it is  in these countries' interest to be on the side of legitimacy, or  at least to adopt a stand of neutrality. He said that the Gulf  stand will encourage the southerners not to respect the  international resolution.    In reply to a question on a possible Saudi military  intervention in Yemen, Basindwah said he believes that it will  not reach the extent of military interference. He added that he  has summoned the GCC ambassadors to inform them about Yemen's  indignation at the Abha statement.    As for what Sanaa will do if the proclaimed Democratic  Republic of Yemen [DRY] wins recognition, Basindwah said that  Yemeni unity was attained by the Yemeni people, and recognition  will not change anything with respect to the existence of a  legitimate Yemeni state.    Basindwah said that the Yemeni officials held no contacts  with any Gulf country since the decision [proclaiming the  establishment of the DRY] was issued. [passage omitted]</p>

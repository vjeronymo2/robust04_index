			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Continuum of Care <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This program makes possible the first steps in a ``continuum of care'' system designed to assist homeless persons find permanent housing and regain independent living. Outreach/assessment activities, drop-in centers, and essential life-saving services may be funded through this program. Funds may also be used to prevent homelessness through short-term rental assistance, legal assistance, and other services related to individuals and families remaining in their own housing. The program facilitates the creation, improvement, and operation of emergency shelters and transitional housing as well as the provision of services such as case management, substance abuse treatment, and job training. For projects serving families, the projects and activities should serve the family together and work to strengthen the family structure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A continuum of care system consists of three basic components:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) A prevention plan and outreach activities designed to bring homeless persons into a system and assess their needs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Transitional housing combined with rehabilitative services; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Placement into permanent housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. Statutory Amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice addresses section 832 of the NAHA (104 Stat. 4359), which contains numerous amendments to the McKinney Act, and several amendments to the ESG program in the 1992 Act. These statutory amendments supersede applicable provisions of the program regulations found at 24 CFR 576. The Department is publishing in this notice a description of the statutory changes to assist Indian tribes in complying with program requirements, including the NAHA and 1992 Act amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Affordable Housing Act Amendments: The NAHA changes are described in the following Sections I.B (1)&hyph;(6) of this NOFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Extension of eligibility to Indian tribes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 832(f) of NAHA expressly extends eligibility for assistance under the ESG program to Indian tribes, and has the effect of applying the same formula as used in the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program for determining the amount of ESG funds to be set-aside for Indian tribes. The one percent figure for the Indian tribe set-aside is dictated by sections 832(f)(3) and 913(b) of NAHA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Administrative costs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 832(b)(1) of NAHA permits recipients to use up to 5% of an ESG Program grant for administrative purposes. This amount equals 5% of the total of amounts of ESG funds requested for all other eligible activities. Administrative costs include: costs of accounting for the use of grant funds; preparing reports for submission to HUD or to the State; obtaining program audits; conducting environmental reviews; coordinating program activities; and similar costs related to administering the grant. These costs do not include the costs of carrying out other activities eligible under the ESG program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Use of funds for essential services.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 832(c) of NAHA increased from 20% to 30% the percentage of a grant that may be used to provide essential services. Consistent with this amendment, the Department will apply its waiver authority in section 414(b) of the McKinney Act to the new, higher 30% limitation. As with the previous 20% cap, the 30% limit is to be measured against the aggregate amount of each emergency shelter grant to an Indian tribe. Section 832(f)(6) of NAHA makes the limitations on the provision of essential services applicable to Indian tribes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Use of funds for prevention of homelessness.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Homelessness prevention was added as a category of eligible activities by section 423 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;688, approved November 7, 1988), which also treated these activities as ``essential services.'' However, section 832(d) of NAHA withdraws homelessness prevention activities from categorization as ``essential services'', and imposes a separate limit of 30% of the aggregate amount of assistance to any recipient, including an Indian tribe, that may be used for efforts to prevent homelessness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, under NAHA, essential services and homelessness prevention are now each subject to a 30% cap. However, unlike the category of essential services, there is no statutory authority to permit a waiver of the cap on the amount of assistance that may be used for homelessness prevention activities. By its express terms, the statutory waiver is available only in the category of essential services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

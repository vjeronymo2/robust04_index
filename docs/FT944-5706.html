			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Portillo forecasts rosy work prospects A sustained fall in unemployment was forecast by Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, when the Commons resumed the Budget debate yesterday. He said there would be job opportunities as business created prosperity and foreign investment was attracted by the framework established by government policies. Mr Portillo clashed with Ms Harriet Harman, shadow employment secretary, who described him as the 'enemy of measures to put people back to work and the enemy of the unemployed'. He maintained that Labour's support for the introduction of a minimum wage and other measures imposing additional costs on employers would result in higher unemployment. Mr Portillo defended the cut in spending on the training-for-work programme. He said that only about a third of the participants had succeeded in getting a job even after months of training. Predicting better results from a smaller budget, he said: 'We will raise the proportion getting jobs to 50 per cent.' Ms Harman accused Mr Portillo of being opposed to a statutory minimum wage because of 'dogma and not because of economic analysis'. Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, told Tory backbenchers opposed to the increase in VAT on domestic fuel to 17.5 per cent that it was an essential part of Budget arithmetic. Mr Nelson suggested that the review of debt management could lead to the introduction of certain new types of bonds. 'Exotic bonds may be on the menu,' he said. The budget debate was adjourned until Monday.</p>

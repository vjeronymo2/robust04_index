			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Palestine terrorist Imadal Mekdav [name as  published], a Shiite who over the past few days became the most  wanted man in this part of the continent, has again been located  in Lebanon by Israeli security forces posted to that country.    Commissioner Enrique de Jesus Martinetti, chief of the  National Police Intelligence Department, reported that he has  received a confidential report confirming this data from the  Israeli Intelligence Service.    "He (Imadal Mekdav) has again been located in Lebanon, and  the Israeli Intelligence Service is on his heels. In any case it  has been suggested that we continue the investigation, just in  case there are ramifications," Martinetti said.    The police chief confirmed that Imadal Mekdav and another  person arrived in a South American country--presumably Paraguay  or Argentina--some weeks ago with the objective of attacking an  Israeli diplomatic seat.    "This man and another Shiite came to Paraguay or Argentina.  One of them returned immediately to the Middle East, but the  other remained," the intelligence chief said.    Martinetti indicated that at present it is not known whether  the Shiite came to Paraguay or to Argentina. "What is known is  that the Israelis warned the Paraguayan and Argentine police  forces that two Palestinians had arrived in one of the two  countries, with unknown intentions. One of them remained  somewhere around here. The report indicates that he came to  carry out sabotage actions," Martinetti said.    "These people are fundamentalist fanatics that want to  expand  the struggle, known as the intifadah, against the Israelis in  other parts of the world. And one of their ways is to attack  diplomatic seats," he added. [passage omitted]</p>

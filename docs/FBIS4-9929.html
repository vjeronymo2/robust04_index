			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "TV Today Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Guyanese President Cheddi Jagan arrived this  afternoon on an official three-day visit. He was welcomed by  Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, who told the media that the  reported presence of Bishop Nel Beltran in Cuba for an alleged  guerrilla summit has not affected the good relations between  Colombia and the island.    [Begin Sanin recording] I will meet with the prosecutor  general to hear his final conclusions on this investigation. The  Colombian Foreign Ministry always said it believed the bishop.  We also said there were indications, but there were no  conclusions on the matter. Fortunately, we did not rush into  this or jump to any conclusions. When you wanted us to make some  sort of statement, we said we would not make any statements  until Cuba responded. [end recording]</p>

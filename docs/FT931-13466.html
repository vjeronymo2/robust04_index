			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Sunday shopping curbs supported PRESSURE ON the govern-ment to speed up reform of Sunday trading laws in England and Wales intensified yesterday as MPs voted decisively to allow a private member's bill seeking tight restrictions on Sunday opening to progress to line-by-line committee stage scrutiny. Mr Ray Powell's Shops (Amendment) Bill - backed by the Keep Sunday Special campaign - received its second Commons reading by a majority of 173 (214 votes to 41). Supporters of the proposals later called on the government to accept their offer to consider constructive amendments to the bill in order to get a law on to the statute book by this summer. But Mr Peter Lloyd, Home Office minister, told MPs the changes deemed necessary by the government were 'more than can be managed' in a private member's bill committee. He said he would be 'disappointed' if the government's Sunday trading bill, offering MPs a choice between options ranging from full-scale deregulation to a tightening of existing laws, was not ready in the next few weeks. But he admitted he held out little hope of bringing such a bill before the House until autumn. Mr Michael Schluter, director of the Keep Sunday Special campaign, said the campaign would continue to co-operate with those drafting the government's bill but reserved the right to ask its supporters to oppose the measure if it did not include 'proper employee protection'.</p>

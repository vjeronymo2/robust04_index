For  some weeks now the international crisis-management scene has  become tangibly more lively, more active, and thus more  complicated. The main reason: Moscow has started to gain  profile as a new foreign policy figure. This can be seen from  Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev's virtually hectic activities  in the Bosnian conflict and in the crisis between Israel and the  PLO.    This new role of Russia's already has obvious consequences.  It has made the United States give up its so far very passive  foreign policy role under Clinton and pursue a constructive  policy. It has become visible in the Bosnian conflict and in  the efforts to restart the negotiations between Israel and the  PLO in the Middle East. No matter how limited Yeltsin's  possibilities may be because of his serious domestic problems,  this new foreign policy dualism has positive aspects for  international affairs. Competition is the best means on the  international political scene for overcoming budding  isolationist trends in Washington. Therefore, today's meeting  between the two foreign ministers, Kozyrev and Christopher, in  Vladivostok is of particular importance. One can expect  important decisions on the course and progress in the Bosnian  conflict and in the Middle East.    For the Europeans there is good reason to reconsider their  own role in view of this development. It is high time for them  to develop their own predictable foreign policy position. If  this is not done, they will remain at the mercy of others  instead of being partners in the new game of international  political forces.</p>

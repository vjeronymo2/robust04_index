			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The President, Flight Lieutenant J.J. Rawlings, this  morning, opened the second session of parliament at the  International Conference Center in Accra. He reviewed the  overall performance of the government over the past year and  outlined its program for this year. President Rawlings touched  on all aspects of national life. Tina Teoda attended the  opening ceremony:    [Begin recording] [Teoda] President Rawlings said the past  year saw some positive developments on the political front but  wished that challenges relating to the constitutionality of  certain government actions be confined to sober and principled  issues. He said many of the issues raised in constitutional  cases before the Supreme Court involved serious practical  problems, not just for government but also for the public at  large. President Rawlings said it would be ideal if the public  would inform the police about meetings and demonstrations for  the necessary precautionary measures to be taken.    [Rawlings] I would also wish that challenges relating to the  constitutionality of certain government actions will be confined  to sober and principled issues and not become what sometimes  seems to be a legal or political thought. Mr. Speaker, Ladies  and Gentlemen, many of the issues raised in constitutional cases  before the Supreme Court involve serious practical problems not  just for the government but also for the public at large. On  the terms of one of these rulings, the police feel powerless to  prevent gatherings likely to lead to violence such as those  relating to stool disputes and can only intervene when trouble  actually erupts. While a permit may not be required before  public processions and demonstrations are held, we believe that  it would be judicious to impose a duty on the public to inform  the police in advance before such processions and demonstrations  to enable them institute the necessary precautions and security  measures. We shall examine the Supreme Court decision to see  whether the necessary flexibility exists to enable us introduce  a bill in this House to that effect for the sake of the public.    [Teoda] Touching on the recent court decision on celebrating  the anniversary of the 31 December Revolution, President  Rawlings says the government will respect the constitutional  provision of the Supreme Court but cannot allow one arm to stage  a coup d'etat against the other.    [Rawlings] The recent narrow majority decision of the  Supreme Court about the celebration of 31 December Revolution  also raises fundamental questions about the store of the Supreme  Court's functions vis-a-vis the legislative powers of parliament  and indeed the prerogative of the executive. The experience of  constitutional democracy teaches us that nothing is gained from  confrontationist or subversive attitudes from elements in any  arm of government. Mr. Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen, we will  respect the constitutional provision of the Supreme Court, but  we cannot allow that almost government to stage what was a coup  d'etat against the other government. And come to think of it, I  thought the Constitution had proscribed coup d'etats in any  form. In any case, it is true that the year 1994 will see these  two arms of government complementing each other for the sake of  our people.    [Teoda] The president said accountability is not a mere  watchword and must reflect in the smallest actions of all. He  said the country still has to contend with adverse external  economic factors. He outlined the program for this year.    [Rawlings] The main thrust of our economic program for 1994  will be to further accelerate rural and self urban development,  employment generation to mount the program of vigorous  diversification and promotion to build on the progress that has  already been made, as well as to attack waste and malfeasance in  public finance management and expenditure. As you all know, the  auditor-general's report submitted to parliament last year  revealed a very painful and unacceptable catalogue of waste,  irresponsible resource management in several ministries, and  malpractices in various departments and organizations. This  will be unforgivable at any time and more so when our resources  are stretched thinly to cover our many responsibilities to the  people of this nation. The irregularities revealed by the audit  will be followed up and appropriate action taken. Even more  important, steps will be taken to prevent their recurrence in  the future. The Ministry of Finance as well as all the heads of  all sectors and organizations have been charged to strengthen  measures to ensure effective financial management within all  government bodies, including all otherwise independent bodies  such as commissions, councils and boards, which depend on  government funds. Accountability is not a mere watchword. It  must reflect in the smallest actions of each one of us. It is  not enough to be satisfied with our own personal integrity and  good intentions if those working under our authority and  supervision dissipate resources whether through laxity and  carelessness, or with selfish intent. We have undertaken a  review of the present structure of the government machinery with  a view to enhancing efficiency and avoiding waste. Accordingly,  the existing ministerial arrangements will be rationalized and  function amalgamated where this would not affect the focus of  the sectors concerned.    [Teoda] President Rawlings also examined the country's  present and future roles in international affairs. He hinted  that there would be a re-orientation of foreign service  officers and ambassadors to be more effective in promoting the  interests of the country. He commended [word indistinct] and  urged parliament to continue working in the spirit of openness.  [end recording]</p>

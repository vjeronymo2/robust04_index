			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOX WILL BE FORCED TO GIVE SPONSORS FREE AD TIME;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: THE NETWORK IS RENEGOTIATING COMMITMENTS WITH ADVERTISERS BECAUSE  ITS RATINGS HAVE FALLEN SHORT OF PROJECTIONS.  </P> <P> Fox Broadcasting Co. is falling short of ratings projections and will have to  give several million dollars worth of free advertising time to dissatisfied  sponsors, according to industry executives.  </P> <P> The so-called fourth network has gotten off to a shaky start after ending its  third year with a very strong performance. Now Fox is in the unhappy position  of having to renegotiate a portion of the $550 million in advertising  commitments made earlier this year.  </P> <P> So worrying is the audience shortfall that the network has stopped selling  advertising time for the fourth quarter in order to use what's left for  "make-goods" -- the bonus spots given away to advertisers when shows don't  attract enough viewers.  </P> <P> Fox is performing "considerably below what people had estimated," said Richard  Kostyra, executive vice president at the J. Walter Thompson ad agency in New  York. "The numbers have fallen so dramatically that they are using most if not  all of the available inventory for make-goods."  </P> <P> During the first three weeks of the new season, Fox has attracted 5.7% of the  national TV audience. Although it pulled in 6.2% of the audience in the third  week -- its best performance so far -- that is still below the average 7% that  industry executives said it promised advertisers.  </P> <P> "It will be extremely difficult for Fox to hold their guarantees," said Steve  Grubbs, senior vice president at BBDO Worldwide, another New York ad agency.  </P> <P> But Jamie Kellner, president of Fox Broadcasting, said: "We are capable of  making good on our guarantees." He noted that Fox had not yet run new episodes  for all of its shows and said it was too soon to judge viewing patterns.  </P> <P> "Historically, Fox takes a dip in September and October while the networks are  promoting their new shows, but we build after that," Kellner said. "We're  comfortable where we are right now."  </P> <P> Fox Inc. Chairman Barry Diller said the network could handle the current  make-goods situation without hurting the network's bottom line. "It will have  zero economic effect on the company."  </P> <P> The networks customarily keep unsold commercial time in reserve for make-goods.  But with a soft advertising climate this fall, Fox is unlikely to sell all of  its commercial units. So the network is giving away advertising time that it  could not sell anyway.  </P> <P> If ratings do not pick up, however, Fox could be forced to run make-goods in  place of ads it had sold.  </P> <P> This fall, Fox aggressively expanded its schedule from eight hours of  prime-time programming to 12, slightly more than half the hours broadcast by  the other three networks.  </P> <P> Fox's biggest gamble -- moving "The Simpsons" from its secure Sunday berth to  take on NBC's "The Cosby Show" on Thursdays -- is still to unfold, but "Cosby"  already has trounced reruns of "Simpsons."  </P> <P> The first new episode of "Simpsons" airs tonight, and how well or badly the  series performs will be anxiously awaited by Fox executives. Fox hopes that  "Simpsons" will have a "halo effect" on the shows that follow it, similar to  how "Cosby" has boosted overall ratings for Thursday night on NBC.  </P> <P> Advertising executives said Fox has promised "Simpsons" sponsors, who paid  between $300,000 and $400,000 for a 30-second commercial, that new episodes  will attract at least 27% of the TV audience. But reruns since August have  averaged only 15%, and that has some wondering if the lower ratings are a  harbinger of how the new episodes will do.  </P> <P> NBC's "Cosby," which is perceived by many network insiders to be rickety with  age as it enters its seventh season, has attracted about 35% of the audience  and continues to be one of the top-rated shows in TV.  </P> <P> Many of the advertisers who bought time in "Simpsons" are major Hollywood  studios, which paid a premium to reach the 18- to 34-year-old moviegoing  audience. This presents a major problem for Fox if the new time period should  fail, since studio advertisers want to promote their weekend movie releases on  Thursdays and they cannot be switched to another night.  </P> <P> At the same time, Fox has suffered setbacks in its ambitious expansion plans.  </P> <P> The network is behind schedule in producing films for a planned  movie-of-the-week program for Monday nights, and production delays for its  animated children's shows are forcing it to substitute planned episodes with  reruns at the last minute.  </P> <P> As a result, Fox affiliates are on their own for nine of the 13 Monday nights  through the end of the year, including two during the crucial November  "sweeps," when ratings for local stations determine ad rates for the next  quarter.  </P> <P> Last week, Fox substituted old "Tom &amp; Jerry" reruns for its new animated  series "Peter Pan and the Pirates" while production snafus from overseas  suppliers held up delivery of the episodes.  </P> <P> Networks customarily take a bullish attitude to predicting how their new fall  shows will perform. At the same time, they are usually wise enough to reserve  commercial time in the likely event that ratings don't perform up to snuff.  </P> <P> "Our strategy was to sell a lot (in advance) because we anticipated a lower  demand (later), especially in the fourth quarter," said John Nesvig, vice  president of advertising sales at Fox. The network generally is considered to  have sold more of its inventory than any of its competitors.  </P> <P> Nesvig confirmed that Fox was using unsold inventory for make-goods and did not  expect to sell much commercial time in the fourth quarter. "We will make our  fourth-quarter budget," he said.  </P> <P> Related story and review in Calendar, F1  </P></p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Arts: Drama when the veneer cracks - Alastair Macaulay reviews plays by Alan Ayckbourn and one of his proteges, Tim Firth Alan Ayckbourn has long been more than a playwright; he is an institution. The Stephen Joseph Theatre-in-the-Round in Scarborough, which he directs, is a home for plays by other authors, ancient and modern, as well as by himself. It was there, under the Ayckbourn aegis, that Tim Firth's Neville's Island was first performed in 1992; now it has just received an important new production at the Nottingham Playhouse. Meanwhile back in Scarborough, the maestro has just presented his own latest oeuvre, Communicating Doors. Curiously, it is Firth's play that is the more Ayckbournian of the two; also more funny and more serious. Neville's Island is a comedy in which madness, insecurity, malice, and cruelty breed, violently and rapidly, amid terminally middle-class characters: four men on an Outward Bound training course in the Lake District. Marooned for two days on an island, their civilised veneers soon crack; and, one way or another, so do they. Firth's achievement lies in how he keeps this increasingly ghastly situation funny. By the end, characters have come close to murder, suicide, and utter despair; they look like savages; and yet there is still a funny side. When Roy, the most haunted character, goes barmy, all he can do is sing the first line of Oklahoma, desperately, over and over ('There's a bright golden haze in the meadow]'); and Gordon yells at him 'Don't you know anything from Hello, Dolly]?' And it is Roy - this most crazed, absurd, and unhappy of the four men - who gives the play its most moving sense of beauty and finer feeling. From a perch halfway up a tree, he addresses God about the thrill of seeing a gyrfalcon for the first time. You laugh at the absurdity of this; but only at first. Finally, you start to share in his rapture and gratitude. James Fleet's performance is very fine; he never plays anything as a Mad Scene, and makes Roy's thoughts, whether eccentric or lyrical, quietly luminous to us. Tony Slattery plays the central role, Gordon: who is one big torrent of sarcasm, blame, and abuse. Slattery is a naturally funny man, and the audience cannot help taking to him. Gordon does most to make us laugh at the other characters, and at the whole situation; but it is Gordon whose heartless diatribes drive Roy and Angus off the deep end. An interesting oxymoron; yet Slattery's performance reveals a slight weakness in the play - that Gordon is actually its least fleshed-out character. We see how desperately selfish and addicted to bourgeois comfort he is, but we never really sense his nervous system. (And he keeps hammering home Gordon's jibes as if every other word were in italics.) Near the end, Neville bitterly exclaims how grateful he is not to be as negative and fundamentally miserable as Gordon. At the time, this makes a big impact. But until then Neville and Angus have been too wimpish to be true. (When Gordon, for minutes on end, castigates Roy and drives him bonkers, they stand by with barely a whimper of protest. You can feel how Firth wants to draw Roy's madness, Gordon's nastiness, and the play itself, for another half-hour.) Not that this is likely to trouble any observer at Nottingham, for Jeff Rawle invests the mild and feckless Neville with such an extraordinary wealth of convincing detail that he becomes the passive, well-meaning, blinking heart of the play. The play is directed by Jeremy Sams, and is probably his finest achievement (as a director) to date. Only a few touches, such as the slightly stagey way Angus and Gordon are allowed to make their big speeches facing straight out into the auditorium, remind us that Sams began to direct only two years ago. Lez Brotherston's wooded-island-shore decor is both poetic and realistic. I saw the play on a Monday night; the Playhouse was impressively thronged. The audience was kept laughing right up to the bitter end: quite a feat. Ayckbourn has frequently made powerful comedy out of mental cruelty and nervous breakdown. After Neville's Island, I went to Scarborough expecting to see a master-class in how to handle such themes. But what do you know? In Communicating Doors, Ayckbourn is experimenting with different material altogether. Even the characters are, for him, unusual. Four of them are VIP class, accustomed to staying in the major London West End hotel where the action occurs; and one of them is a prostitute - an expensive dominatrix clad in leather. (This play, by the way, replaces the one Ayckbourn had announced, Private Fears in Public Places: which was to have been about the changes wrought to a marital relationship by a chance encounter at an airport.) Ayckbourn loves to develop his virtuosity as a craftsman. In The Time of My Life (another 1992 Scarborough premiere, seen in the West End in 1993), he let the action of his play move to and fro in time, spanning a period of two years. Now he takes this idea far further. When the characters of this new play step through the 'communicating doors' of the title, they find themselves stepping either 20 years forward or backward: so that the play jumps from 2014 to 1994 to 1974. Can people step back in time and rewrite the past (like Superman stopping the world and setting it into reverse)? Ayckbourn keeps us in suspense about this until well into Act Two. To my surprise, I found that Ayckbourn of Communicating Doors reminded me of the virtuoso baroque playwrights who delighted in the play-within-the-play and the world-within-a-world (Shakespeare in A Midsummer Night's Dream and elsewhere, Corneille in The Illusion, Lope de Vega in The Great Pretenders)  -for Ayckbourn shuttles not only between decades but between genres too. Are we watching science fiction about time travellers? Or a thriller about high-placed men using women and then trying to kill them? Or a farce about who will get caught in whose room? Ayckbourn keeps juggling. But you cannot really get involved in the world of the magnate Reece, his sinister pal Julian, and his first and second wives Ruella and Jessica. At times the play's clevernesses seem designed mainly to distract us from the emotional thinness at its core. The more you admire its structural dexterity, the more you sense its basic frivolity. Ayckbourn has some fun, of course, about the year 2014, with talk of prostitutes being state-controlled ('I'm public, not private'), of the new fad for Virtual Sex ('with a mouse in one hand and a joy-stick in the other'), and of English civil war ('Do you think this truce will last?' 'There'll be no more trouble from Lewisham. It's just Croydon being difficult now.'). Yet, though there are good jokes throughout the play, it is disappointing to realise how few of them were organic. (The best such, hilarious in context, occurs as Ruella and Poupay, in 1994, try to plan retrieving a document from 2014 and delivering it to 1974. 'It's a kind of relay,' suggests Ruella. 'Yeah,' says Poupay, 'I can't wait.' To-be-or-not-to-be': pass it on.') Ayckbourn himself has directed. Things are held together by the zest and edge of Liz Crowther as Ruella, and (after a shallow start) Adie Allen as Poupay, the nationalised dominatrix. The other performances are so thin as to be virtually see-through. And, when you do see through, all you see is just another of Mr A's maze plays: amazing, more or less, but only casually absorbing. Neville's Island continues at the Nottingham Playhouse until February 19. Communicating Doors is in repertory at the Stephen Joseph Theatre-in-the-Round, Scarborough, until February 26. Ayckbourn's next play is expected to have its premiere in April</p>

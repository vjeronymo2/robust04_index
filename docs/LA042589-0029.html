			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STUDIO CITY GROUP PRESENTS 2 RADAR GUNS TO L.A. POLICE  </P> <P> Three Studio City children Monday presented Los Angeles police with two  gift-wrapped radar guns, purchased with some loose change from the youngsters'  allowances and nearly $1,600 from residents concerned about speeding motorists  in their hillside neighborhood, organizers of the event said.  </P> <P> Joseph T. Rinella said he got the idea for the gift because speeding cars made  it unsafe for his son, Ryan, 8, to ride a bicycle on neighborhood streets. Ryan  Rinella donated two weeks' worth of allowances -- totaling $10 -- to help pay  for the guns, his father said. Two other children, Matthew Schofield, 8, and  Tiffany Shields, 14, also contributed their allowances and joined Ryan Rinella  in presenting the guns to police.  </P> <P> The guns are designed for hand-held use by motorcycle officers, Rinella said.  </P> <P> Rinella, chairman of the traffic and safety committee of the Studio City  Residents' Assn., said he decided last week to ask friends and neighbors to  help pay for the guns. Rinella said it took five hours of phone calls to raise  the money. The donations averaged $10 to $20, he said.  </P> <P> Police Capt. Bruce W. Mitchell said that before the donation, the department  had 17 radar guns for the 205 traffic officers assigned to the San Fernando  Valley. He said one of the guns will be used to check speeds of cars near  schools in the Studio City area and the other will be used in residential  areas.  </P></p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / World Trade News: US eases curbs on foreign telecom carriers A TANGLED trade dispute between the US and the UK is expected to be resolved as a result of a decision yesterday by the US telecommunications authorities to ease the regulation of foreign-owned telecommunications carriers. The decision is expected to pave the way to more competition in international telecommunications. It could eventually lead to sharply lower international call charges on a number of routes, including the busy US-UK route. The Federal Communications Commission is to relax rules automatically treating foreign-owned carriers providing international services from the US as 'dominant' and impose on them a heavier regulatory burden than on most US-owned carriers. In future, carriers will be presumed dominant only on those routes where they are affiliated to a carrier at the other end of the route and where that foreign carrier is a monopoly. The relaxation followed pressure from the UK government and a petition from Cable and Wireless, the UK-based telecommunications group, which has operations in the US. The UK's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) had argued that the old rules were discriminatory and insisted that they be changed before it would license a new form of competition, known as international simple resale, between the UK and the US. Resale would allow a new class of operator to lease international circuits in bulk from established carriers such as AT&amp;T and resell services to end customers. It is expected to put downward pressure on international call charges, which are well above costs. The DTI, which last month permitted resale to Australia, Canada and Sweden, is now expected to add the much larger US market to its list of authorised countries. Last night it said it was 'very pleased' with the FCC's action.</p>

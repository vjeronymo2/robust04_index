			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Limited Sovereignty, Another Face of America's </F> World Order"]    [Text] One of the most dangerous concepts that the U.S.  Administration has come up with and tried to enforce in its  international policy is the concept of limited or restricted  sovereignty.    This administration considers any developments aimed at  realizing this suspicious objective as part of the grounds for  establishing the new world order. This order is a unipolar  order that ignores the will and aspirations of other peoples and  the role they are supposed to play in the balance of  international interests and relations, which are based on the  principles of mutual respect and noninterference in the affairs  of other countries.    Last year in particular, the United Nations witnessed  massive  efforts to propagate this concept of limited sovereignty. It  saw attempts to provide this concept with an international cover  that would lend it legitimacy, thus giving the United States and  its allies the chance to pressure other nations and governments  to bow to their illegal will to dominate, using the banner of  human rights as a pretext for intimidation, terrorism, and  forcing their evil designs without facing any resistance to such  dangerous trends.    In this context, it is enough to refer to the current  General  Assembly session debates in which blatant calls were made to  propagate this U.S. concept. These calls tried to sugar coat  their arguments with sweet-sounding words and resounding phrases  with dubious meanings.    Regrettably and incredibly, the UN secretary general has  become a party to this process, and in his discussions he openly  propagates this concept of limited sovereignty. He does this  despite the fact that everything indicates that this concept is  an attempt to violate the sovereignty of nations, or at least  deprive them of their right to practice their sovereignty over  their internal affairs under the same pretexts that are raised  occasionally in the interest of the United States and its allies.    Any people that is proud of its dignity and basic right to  sovereignty over its own land and affairs must denounce and  reject the concept of limited sovereignty. This is not because  it is rude to interference in the internal affairs of a country  that enjoys sovereignty and independence, but also because it  brings international relations back to the stage when the law of  the jungle prevailed. It would allow the strong to impose their  mandate and threaten to use brutal force against those who are  smaller and weaker by materialistic standards.    Hence, the logical question is that if the United States  wants-- through these suspicious efforts--to interfere in the  internal affairs of countries under the pretext of protecting  human rights, is it prepared to accept that the interfere of  others in its own affairs for the same reason? Human rights  violations are numerous and dangerous in the United States in  particular, and in the colonialist West in general. Shouldn't  other nations have the same right that the United States  proclaims for itself but at the same time denies to others?    Despite these designs, whose nature and timing may or may  not  be calculated, the peoples of the world will eventually win.  This determination will certainly have the final say on all  practices, violations, and conspiracies that target the world  peoples and their honorable forces that believe in justice,  right, and principles.    The experiment of steadfast and mujahid Iraq is a model that  opens the way for those who reject any form of injustice,  arrogance, aggression, mandate, and hegemony.</p>

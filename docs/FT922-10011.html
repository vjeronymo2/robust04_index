			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Seoul team to discuss losses SOUTH KOREAN officials led by Mr Huh Sung, assistant foreign minister, left Seoul for Los Angeles yesterday to discuss compensation for Korean residents who suffered losses in the riots, Reuter reports. Mr Kim Dae-jung, leader of the main opposition Democratic party, also led a 28-member team to Los Angeles to gather information and discuss compensation measures with officials there. South Korean students chanted anti-American slogans outside the US embassy, demanding that Korean residents in Los Angeles be compensated for riot losses. China told the US yesterday to put its own house in order after the race riots in Los Angeles before telling Beijing to clean up its human rights record. 'You apologists who proclaim the importance of human rights, waving your clubs condemning and interfering in other countries' internal affairs - why don't you open your eyes and look at your own domestic situation?' the People's Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, said. 'It is a terrible irony that in this country which boasts of its human rights, white policemen's brutality can be deemed innocent and black people suffer insult,' it said.</p>

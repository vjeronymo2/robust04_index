			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOOVER HIGH TO CELEBRATE GYM'S 50TH YEAR  </P> <P> Not much has changed inside the Hoover High School gymnasium in the 50 years  since Johnny Babick, Rupe Crosthwaite, Bob Gremmett, Percy Hussong, Roy Muelchi  and Jack Siegel had their names announced before the start of a high school  basketball game.  </P> <P> The rectangular wooden backboards have been replaced by glass, the school has  added a couple of championship banners, and murals grace two of the inside  walls.  </P> <P> But a step inside the Hoover gym is otherwise like a step backward in time.  </P> <P> Tonight, Babick, Crosthwaite, Gremmett, Hussong, Muelchi and Siegel will again  be taking another walk to midcourt before the start of Hoover's City Central  League game against Madison. This is fitting; they were part of the first  Hoover varsity team to trot out after the gym was built for the 1939-40 season.  </P> <P> The group will be honored along with other players who participated in that  first game on Nov. 28, 1939, as Hoover celebrates the building's 50th  anniversary before tonight's 7:15 tipoff.  </P> <P> Others to be honored include Max Fitzenmeyer, Charlie Hampton, Ray Minor, Bob  White and Walt Woodbury, all of whom played on the alumni team that defeated  the Hoover varsity in that first game. Hampton, who later coached the Cardinals  for 11 years, led all scorers with 10 points.  </P> <P> But the Hoover gym has been more than just the site of 2,000-plus high school  games. Hoover has also seen the air balls of recreation leagues and slam dunks  of NBA players. The Boston Celtics, Atlanta Hawks and Cleveland Cavaliers have  practiced there, along with several foreign teams in training for the 1984  Olympics. And all -- one estimate is 50,000 games -- have been played on the  same oak floor.  </P> <P> The original floor was an inch thick, nearly twice the depth of those installed  today. An eighth-inch was sanded off after it was damaged by a 1980 flood.  </P> <P> The gym has proved a great investment, considering the number of games it has  staged. It was built for $185,000 -- or a little less than the average price of  a new home in the county today. RICK HAZELTINE  </P></p>

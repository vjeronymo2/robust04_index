			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / International Company News: Uruguayan airline privatised Uruguay has completed its first privatisation with the sale of 51 per cent of Pluna, its national airline, to a consortium of Argentine and Uruguayan companies. Mr Juan Piaggio, Pluna's president, said the consortium paid Dollars 2m cash and assumed the carrier's liabilities of Dollars 20m. The consortium is led by the Buquebus ferry company, which runs passenger services between Buenos Aires and ports in Uruguay. The buyers selected Varig, the heavily loss-making private Brazilian airline, to operate Pluna on a contract for 10 years. Mr Alberto Fajerman, Varig's assistant planning director, said the airline will take over Pluna's financial and commercial management as well as operating its aircraft. Mr Fajerman said Varig 'will receive a fixed payment and a variable amount' linked to Pluna's performance.</p>

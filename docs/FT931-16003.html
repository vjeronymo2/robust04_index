			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Superwoman is shackled: The reaction to Japan's royal bride-to-be Japan has a severe case of royal fever. Amid the gloom of recession, this week's announcement that Crown Prince Naruhito, seemingly destined to a lonely life of bachelorhood, has finally found a bride, has provoked a range of emotions from tears of joy among shoppers to a forecast that the economy will grow by an extra 0.8 per cent this year. There is a general sense that the crown prince, the 32-year-old heir to Japan's Chrysanthemum Throne, has chosen well. Miss Masako Owada, 29, a career diplomat, speaks English, French and German, shares his love of ski-ing and tennis and, after a stint at Harvard, studied, like the prince, at Oxford University. But his choice has also provoked a debate about the role of women in Japan. Miss Owada, whose father is vice foreign minister, is on a fast track in her career. She has sat in on negotiations with Mr James Baker, the former US secretary of state, and Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative. She has also been responsible for policy formulation on semiconductors, one of the most sensitive trade issues between the US and Japan. Her career will be sacrificed for the cloistered life of loyal wife to the crown prince, responsible for official tree planting and paper-folding festivals. Miss Owada, likely to be wed in May, has already handed in her notice, and her decision has provoked dismay among some Japanese women, who are painfully making their way through the male-dominated hierarchies of business and the government bureaucracy. 'I can't believe she's giving up her job,' said one career woman, expressing her shock over the resignation of Miss Owada, dubbed 'Superwoman' by the media. By contrast, many Japanese men, who feel threatened by the emergence of stronger career women, are sure she has done the right thing. 'Japanese women should follow her example, they're just not made for the workplace,' says one male office worker. But Miss Owada's acceptance of the imperial proposal has also inspired hope that she may be able to weaken the stifling influence of the Imperial Household Agency, the division of the civil service that is in charge of imperial matters and keeps the imperial family aloof from the public. Many Japanese want their royal family to become more accessible, and see the British royal family as a model. The agency's determination to maintain its tight control over royal affairs and the mystique of the imperial family was shown in a recent controversy over Prince's Aki's hair. The agency was outraged by an unauthorised snapshot of Prince Akishino, the younger brother of the crown prince, having a strand of hair swept from his forehead by Princess Kiko, his wife, moments before their wedding. The picture was banned by news agencies and the photographer was sacked. Another sign of the agency's strong grip on royal affairs was its ability to impose a black-out on media coverage of Prince Naruhito's search for a bride. It blamed previous media reports for his difficulty in finding a match and said that, as the next emperor and spiritual head of the Shinto religion, Naruhito should be protected from press intrusion. On a more worldly level, Japanese businessmen are hoping that the imperial marriage will stimulate the sluggish economy. Consumer spending revived before the wedding of Akihito, the current emperor, and empress Michiko in 1959. The research arm of Nippon Life, the country's largest life assurer, estimates the royal engagement could add as much as Y3,300bn (Pounds 17bn) in consumer spending this year through sales of commemorative souvenirs and new housing demand triggered by an increase in the number of couples getting married. Electronics manufacturers hope for a boost from a new 'Michi boom' - the sharp increase in sales of television sets to people wanting to watch the 1959 wedding. Most Japanese now have a television set, but that has not stopped profit-starved executives from suggesting that a royal wedding could be just the thing for high-definition television, which has so far been an over-priced flop. The imperial wedding will certainly be over-promoted, with the Japanese government suggesting yesterday that it would be made a national holiday, and media organisations already assigning squadrons of reporters to prepare programmes on every conceivable royal issue. But whether the imperial marriage is a flop depends on Prince Naruhito, who will either take Miss Owada by the hand and lead her into a new era of openness or ensure a life of frustrating, refined confinement. The prince has expressed a desire for a more informal relationship between the imperial family and the people, and has complained about excess security precautions. Film footage of the prince's life behind the palace walls this week showed him jogging, apparently alone, until the camera panned to the right, showing a pack of security officials scurrying behind him. Having observed the British royal family during his time as a graduate student at Oxford, the prince recently expressed his admiration for the Windsors' social profile. After their recent problems, however, the crown prince may well be hoping that his journey through married life proves somewhat smoother.</p>

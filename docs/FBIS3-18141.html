			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Umberto Bossi, [secretary of the Northern League],  has started the election campaign in Piacenza today and has  attacked [Berlusconi's] Forza Italia: "It is the creature of  the old Christian Democratic Party. We understood that  immediately and we captured it with the trap of a free-market  alignment [polo liberista]," he said. He then made a direct  appeal to voters: Beware, within the freedom alignment [the  alliance with Berlusconi], there is only one free-market group:  The League.    Bossi made his forecast: In a month's time, the League will  have 120-150 members of parliament. The first bill we will  present will be the expropriation of the assets that parties  gained during Bribe City.</p>

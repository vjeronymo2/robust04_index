			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Sri Lanka hopes for Dollars 800m in foreign aid SRI LANKA hopes to get more than Dollars 800m in aid for 1994 from the World Bank-sponsored consortium which meets in Paris on Friday. 'The point is our economic liberalisation programme is on course and we were the pioneers in this region,' said Mr Ranil Wickremasinghe, the prime minister, in an interview. Donors have also been impressed by the smooth transition after the assassination of President Ranasinghe Premadasa on May 1. However, some of the more obvious vote-buying measures introduced by Mr Premadasa on the eve of recent provincial elections, such as price reductions and wage rises, may have to be abandoned. The civil war in the north and east still requires costly defence spending, the current budget for which is SLRs20bn (Dollars 419m) or more than half the aid receipts. 'We are receiving only one message from the donors - negotiate or else there may be humanitarian intervention,' a central bank official said. Mr Premadasa's policy was to rely on trade and investment, not aid. His successor is taking the same route.</p>

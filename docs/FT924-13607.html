			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Maybelline may make flotation MAYBELLINE, the US cosmetics company which was acquired two years ago by Wasserstein Perella, the New York-based investment banking business, may be coming to the stock market. The company, based in Memphis, Tennessee, yesterday filed a registration statement for 3.145m common shares with the US Securities and Exchange Commission - a move which, by a privately-owned company, usually presages a flotation. According to the filing, the company estimates that the net proceeds of the offering would be around Dollars 65m, and would be used to prepay a portion of the a term loan outstanding under the company's bank credit agreement. Merrill Lynch and Wasserstein Perella Securities are underwriters for the potential offering, and have an option to purchase another 555,000 shares to over-allotments. However, Mr Robert Hiatt, Maybelline's president and chief executive, last night declined to be drawn on the timing of the potential initial public offering (the US term for a flotation). Maybelline was bought by Wasserstein's Dollars 1.1bn merchant banking fund in 1990 from Schering-Plough, the large drugs group. It has been one of the most successful constituents of the fund, which is dominated by a 40 per cent stake in Isosceles, the troubled British food retailer. Wasserstein paid around Dollars 300m for the cosmetics business, after an earlier deal with MBP Acquisition Corp, a consortium which included Playtex Family Products, fell through. At the time, Maybelline was making operating profits of around Dollars 30m on sales of approximately Dollars 300m.</p>

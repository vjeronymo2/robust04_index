			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Letter: A heedless course of action Sir, Having returned from many years overseas, I have been particularly impressed by the high standard and efficiency of the Royal Mail and therefore am baffled that privatisation of this service is being considered. To have guaranteed delivery of first class mail the next day, Saturday deliveries, two deliveries per day prior to Christmas and to contribute substantial profits to the Treasury is an achievement of which the employees and management of the Post Office can be proud. I am convinced that citizens of other countries would be prepared to pay far more in postal charges for the privilege of this quality of service. Those of us who have endured sporadic and indifferent postal services can only shake our heads in bewilderment that such a heedless course of action is being contemplated. The old aphorism must ring true in this case: 'If it isn't broken, don't fix it.' Mark Oxenham, 21 Hampton Gardens, Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire CM21 0AN</p>

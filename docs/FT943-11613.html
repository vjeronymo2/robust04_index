			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Property: Nervous investors Total returns from commercial property investments continued to slide in June as investors remained nervous about the direction of interest rates and the lack of any serious recovery in rents, according to Independent Property Databank, a research group. The IPD index of monthly total returns fell in June to 0.9 per cent, the lowest level for 12 months and the third consecutive monthly fall. Retail provided the only encouraging news with total returns rising to 1.4 per cent from 1.2 per cent in May. Total returns from offices fell from 1 per cent to 0.3 per cent and industrial property returns fell from 1.4 per cent to 1 per cent. The declines reflect the concerns of a jittery market with funds unlikely to increase investment until rents start to catch up with previous sharp rises in capital values of buildings. The increase in total returns from retail investments was prompted by a 0.2 per cent rise in shop rents last month, the first increase recorded by IPD since December 1991. Rents for office and industrial properties continued to fall but at a much slower rate, indicating that rental decline may be coming to an end. Overall rents failed to move last month. Capital values are continuing to stagnate; for offices they declined by 0.4 per cent in June, the first monthly fall since May last year.</p>

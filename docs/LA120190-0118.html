			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GULF WATCH: DAY 121;  </P> <P> A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS  </P> <P> Diplomatic Front:  </P> <P> President Bush offered to send Secretary of State James A. Baker III to Baghdad  to meet with Saddam Hussein and invited Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz to  Washington to discuss a possible peaceful solution to the gulf crisis. But the  President said he would not engage in discussions that would result in anything  less than Iraq's complete withdrawal from Kuwait.  </P> <P> If Iraq does not pull out of Kuwait by the Jan. 15 deadline set by the U.N.  Security Council, the United States is prepared to use military force and is  confident it has "enough power to get the job done," the President said. He  rejected suggestions that any action be delayed for months to give sanctions  more time to work.  </P> <P> There was no immediate response from Baghdad, but Iraq's ambassador to France,  Abdul Razzack Hashimi, called the President's announcement "a very important  step toward peace." Meanwhile, a statement by Iraq's Revolutionary Command  Council called the U.N. ultimatum "illegal, null and void" and accused  Washington of buying the votes of other nations.  </P> <P> Embassy Front:  </P> <P> Easing a four-month siege of the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait, Iraqi officials have  delivered fruit, vegetables and cigarettes to diplomatic personnel inside the  mission, President Bush disclosed. The action appeared to be either a public  relations gesture or to signal Iraq's desire to keep the embassy standoff from  prompting a military confrontation.  </P> <P> Military Front:  </P> <P> Sens. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio) accused the Bush  Administration of overstating the short-term threat posed by any Iraqi nuclear  weapons program. The President, however, said he is "not going to err on the  side of underestimation."  </P> <P> The French military deployment:  </P> <P> Troops in Saudi Arabia: 5,500  </P> <P> Other troops in region: 9,500  </P> <P> Jet fighters: 24  </P> <P> Helicopters: 72  </P> <P> Armored vehicles: 300  </P> <P> Warships: 10  </P></p>

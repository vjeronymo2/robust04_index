			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang mass  meeting took place today in welcome of a non-commissioned  officer Kim Chol-chin and a soldier Kim Kyong-chol of the Korean  People's Security Forces.    They had been taken away by the enemy in late January after  falling unconscious in a storm on the sea. But they steadfastly  defended the authority of the great leader President Kim Il-song  and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and bravely fought as  soldiers of comrade supreme commander, undaunted by the enemy's  relentless threat, appeasement and deception, and returned in  triumph.    When they drifted on the sea, General Kim Chong-il, supreme  commander, took all the measures necessary for saving them.  Upon hearing about their heroic deeds, he placed great  political confidence in them, granting them the honor of being  members of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and the title of  the Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the  "Kim Il-song Youth Honor Prize."    Addressing the meeting, Chairman of the Central Committee of  the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea Choe Yong-hae  said the heroic deeds displayed by them in a showdown with the  enemy clearly showed that if anyone bravely fought the enemy  with the revolutionary faith and indomitable will of trusting  and following only comrade supreme commander, he could surely  win in any adversity and return to the socialist homeland.    He called on all the working people to keep themselves in  full combat readiness to cope with the new war provocation moves  of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique,  and rise up like a mountain and defend the honor of chuche Korea  by becoming a fortress and shield, rifles and bombs, when  comrade supreme commander issued an order.    Kim Chol-chin said that they could return to the bosom of  the  great general after showing the prowess of young soldiers to the  enemy, because they were encouraged by the deep trust and  paternal affection of comrade supreme commander and they had the  rock-firm faith that they would win, guided by the general.    Representatives of factory and office workers, youth and  students vowed to defend the socialist homeland like an  impregnable fortress and dynamically accelerate socialist  construction with a rifle in one hand and a hammer or a pen in  the other, keeping in their mind the rock-firm faith that they  will surely win in any circumstances as General Kim Chong-il  leads them.    Present at the meeting was Kim Chung-rin, secretary of the  Central Committee of the WPK.</p>

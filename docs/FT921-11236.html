			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Food and Wine: Bangers and burgundy - Nicholas Lander meets the man behind London's top dining clubs MARK BIRLEY would have been a very successful restaurateur. Instead, he became the king of clubs. The success of Annabel's, London's smartest night club, which he opened in 1963, was followed by three other private clubs, Mark's Club, Harry's Bar and the Bath and Racquets Club. Restaurateurs view clubs with envy, coveting the membership and the annual income it brings. At Birley's clubs the annual membership fee is Pounds 500 plus a Pounds 250 entrance fee - overseas membership is Dollars 250 (Pounds 138). The size of the clubs' membership is secret but each must have several hundred members with more at Annabel's. Any restaurateur would be thrilled to start the financial year with rent and rates paid for. Clubs have other advantages. Competition is less intense, they can be extremely discreet (Mark's Club does not even have a sign on its door), they do not have to post their menus outside and there is no need to curry favour with guidebooks, court restaurant reviewers or follow the whims of gastronomic fashion. The licensing advantage which clubs used to hold has almost disappeared, but private clubs are less prone to police scrutiny. However, there are disadvantages too. Clubs have to maintain a much higher staffing level and fill more administrative jobs, such as membership secretary. As meeting places they must stay open longer and cater for the unprofitable country member who wants coffee and the newspapers at 10am. As one restaurateur who also owns a club put it: 'In my club the staff are all ready at 9am - in the restaurant they are just putting their bow-ties on at 11.45am.' There are commercial limitations, too. Once ensconced there is no guarantee that a member will spend. Clubs also have to be more flexible in their menu content: at Mark's Club grilled tuna with garlic butter sits alongside bangers and mash. And clubs cannot advertise themselves out of a recession. On a Saturday night, when the West End is full nearly all London clubs are either at their quietest or closed. Into this delicate financial equation Birley has introduced the convictions that would have made him a successful restaurateur. The dining room must satisfy the eye as well as the stomach; it must be comfortable and not a hushed temple to gastronomy. Above all, it must be spotlessly clean. Birley justifies his clubs' membership fees quite simply. It allows him to close each club for three weeks every year so that it can be entirely refurbished - a luxury no restaurant can afford. It also allows staff a complete break which minimises staff turnover and permits a quality of crockery, cutlery and glassware that would last no more than a week in a normal restaurant. The clubs' interiors exude his own vision of comfortable good taste. Mark's Club, with the bar on the first floor above the dining room, still gives the feeling of being a much-loved private house. At Harry's Bar great attention has been paid to the fixtures and fittings - the chandelier is Venetian, the tables and chairs were especially commissioned but it was the artistic touch to the food which thrilled me. A gleaming silver glass-topped carving trolley proudly bore an enormous parmesan. Near the entrance were a large basket of wild mushrooms and a silver wine cooler containing bottles of their own raspberry, juniper and camomile grappas. Birley's has strong views on food and wine. Over a lunch of Morecambe Bay potted shrimps, grilled plaice, spinach and new potatoes, he expounded the virtues of simple, well-cooked food. He has an exceptional talent in Michael Hasler, who has been chef for the past 20 years at Mark's Club. The black mushroom soup which I tasted there would grace any top French restaurant. The wine lists contain some of the most sought-after wines produced in France. At Harry's Bar Italian wines are a speciality. At Harry's Bar, Birley may have lost the battle for simplicity to Alberico Penatti, the chef described by one supplier as one of the best judges of fresh produce in London. As you sit down a wooden tray of excellent salami and ham is placed before you; home baked grissini and bread follow as does a tray of small pizzas. After the main course come bowls of chocolate coffee beans and top quality 'chocolate flake'. The Pounds 3 cover charge is high but you could easily make a profit. Dinner costs Pounds 50-Pounds 60 per head without wine. It is expensive but was impeccable - spaghetti with fresh sardines, a classic rendition of ribollita, the Tuscan vegetable soup, a ragout of snails, fillet of beef and polenta and the extras that make Italian food so exciting - liberally grated fresh parmesan and lashings of superlative extra virgin olive oil. There are many dishes I would happily return for: a warm salad of carp; scampi and watercress; and turbot with artichokes and black truffles. A big compliment to Harry's Bar came from an Italian businessman entertaining an American at the next table. Without bothering to look at the menu he told the waiter: 'I know what I want and I will order for us both.' He obviously thought he was back in Italy. Membership details for all the four clubs are available from 46 Charles Street, London W1X 7PB. Tel: 071-491-1478.</p>

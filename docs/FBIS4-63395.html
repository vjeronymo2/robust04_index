			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nilolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovsky]    [Text] Kremlin Chief of Staff Sergey Filatov in an  interview with Interfax was airing views on Moscow's relations  with Russian regions.    IF [INTERFAX]: What are the center's priorities in relations  with regional governments?    FILATOV: One of the main priorities is the signing of power  sharing agreements with different parts of the country. The  negotiating process is under way with Kabardino-Balkaria,  Bashkiria and Russia's western exclave of Kaliningrad. It will  take some time to adopt an appropriate federal law. In the  meantime, each individual republic or region tries to resolve  the power sharing issue with Moscow in its own way. In my view,  there are no serious rifts, let alone conflicts, between Russian  regions or ethnic groups. The main difficulties are economic  ones.    IF: Despite recession, Russia appears to have been spared  the trouble of major ethnic conflicts, doesn't it?    FILATOV: I think it is most important to take advantage of  the atmosphere of ethnic harmony to be able to meet the economic  targets the government announced early this year. The thing is  the government had failed to halt last year's production slump  because of bitter political confrontation having, as it were, to  start afresh this year..    But there must be a certain sequence in what we do. The  government tried to put a firm lid on inflation which has led to  a further fall in output. What we need most during this painful  stage of redistribution of labor is political stability.    The government faces a formidable job of luring new  investment and technologies, providing job training programs and  arranging redistribution of the workforce. It also has to  contemplate the arrangement of public work and decide what is to  be done with a would be army of unemployed.    Yesterday, I had a meeting with the students of the Moscow  Energy Institute only to face a barrage of criticism, most of it  quite justified. I told the audience that most of its  suggestions could have been put in place in normal conditions  but when the government had to do so many things at a time.    I am sure we will overcome all hardships on the path of  reforms if people realize the need for civic peace. We will  manage to achieve the economic targets the president set early  this year.    More importantly, it must be realized that we have had to  live in warlike conditions for the past 80 years. Millions of  people have died in various wars. Now is the time to get away  from the negative trend and banish the very thought of civil  confrontation.</p>

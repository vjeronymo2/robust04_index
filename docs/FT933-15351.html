			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Hunt outlines industry 'pact' MR DAVID HUNT, employ-ment secretary, yesterday underlined his commitment to a more interventionist role for the government in setting a framework for industrial competitiveness. Speaking at the annual conference of Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs), he went further than other ministers to define partnership between industry and the government. 'Some may see partnership as corporatism by another name,' said Mr Hunt. 'But I do not. Corporatism implies a degree of state influence over the economy so pervasive that the roles and responsibilities of business and government get blurred.' The key foundation for successful partnership was the clearest definition of the responsibilities of the partners. The role of government, he said, was: To do that which needed to be done, but which others could not do for reasons of law or market failure. To set the framework of standards and institutions to see that they evolved as the need of the people changed. To influence attitudes, for example through positive support for enterprise. Where necessary to remedy market failure through direct intervention and to organise and co-ordinate strategies to bring inward investment. Earlier, the Tecs agreed to set up a new national council to replace G10, the group of 10 chairmen which represents Tec concerns to government.</p>

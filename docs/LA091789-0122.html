			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL NOTES;  </P> <P> USC, UCLA LOSSES MAY SIGNAL ARRIVAL OF NEW WAVE IN PAC-10  </P> <P> Is it basketball season yet in the Pacific 10 Conference?  </P> <P> How else do you explain Southern Cal losing a 13-point lead with six minutes  left, and ultimately the game, to Illinois in its season opener Sept. 2?  </P> <P> Or last Saturday, when UCLA lost, 24-6, to down-and-out Tennessee at the Rose  Bowl? Both the Trojans and the Bruins were considered two of top 10 teams at  the time, and both were expected to contend for the national championship.  </P> <P> Those defeats have breathed new life into the conference's other teams,  especially Oregon State and Washington State. Both teams are unbeaten going  into Saturday's suddenly meaningful showdown in Pullman, Wash.  </P> <P> "If they (the Beavers) can stay healthy, they can challenge for the Pac 10  championship," said first-year Washington State Coach Mike Price, who took over  when Dennis Erickson departed last spring for Miami. "If we can stay healthy,  we can compete for the Pac 10 championship. The only difference between the  haves and have-nots is depth."  </P> <P> Oregon State knows about being have-nots. The Beavers hadn't won back-to-back  games in 11 years, and are looking to make it three straight for the first time  since 1970. Oregon State has not gone to the Rose Bowl since 1964.  </P> <P> In fact, this marks the first time since 1915 that Oregon State and Washington  State each will be unbeaten going into their annual game.  </P> <P> A big reason for Washington State's early-season success is quarterback Brad  Gossen. A junior, Gossen took over when Timm Rosenbach, the nation's leader  last year in passing efficiency, put himself in the National Football League's  supplemental draft. Gossen leads the country in passing efficiency, with 31  completions in 49 attempts, five touchdowns, one interception and 605 yards.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Southern Cal Coach Larry Smith wasn't happy with some of the things  he saw during that nationally televised, 14-13 defeat to Illinois in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> He will make some wholesale changes for Saturday's game against Utah State.  </P> <P> Included among the changes is the benching of starting halfback Aaron Emanuel  and starting strong safety Cleveland Colter, a preseason All-American  candidate. Smith also made two changes on the offensive line.  </P> <P> "It could be a long time before our offense gets back to where it was, maybe  not even this year," said Smith. "It takes a long time to develop that synch.  I'm not saying it's going to be miserable, but ... "  </P> <P> The victory over UCLA gave the Tennessee program its most significant win, and  much-maligned Johnny Majors his biggest boost, since the Volunteers pounded  highly favored Miami in the 1986 Sugar Bowl. It took a lot of the preseason  heat off Majors, whose team lost its first five last year and finished 5-6.  </P> <P> "The past is the past," said Majors, whose Volunteers are 2-0 and ranked 17th  entering Saturday's game against Duke. "We can't let anybody think about it. We  need to be as hungry as we can be, because we have a lot of improvement to  make."  </P> <P> The Blue Devils are 3-1 against Tennessee since Majors returned to Knoxville,  Tenn., 13 years ago, and Duke Coach Steve Spurrier is 3-0 against Southeastern  Conference teams.  </P> <P> The SEC is 6-1 this year against non-conference opponents, and has five teams  in The Associated Press top 25. Nine of the 10 teams received votes.  </P> <P> It will be three years come December since Bobby Ross left Maryland for Georgia  Tech -- with a short stop in Buffalo as the Bills' quarterback coach -- and it  has becoming increasingly apparent that the former Terps coach made, at best, a  questionable career decision.  </P> <P> As bad as things are in College Park, Md., they are a great deal worse in  Atlanta, where Tech has yet to win an Atlantic Coast Conference game under  Ross. The Yellow Jackets, who lost, 38-28, last week to North Carolina State,  will go for 15 straight ACC defeats Saturday at home against Virginia.  </P> <P> "We have a big challenge," said Ross. "We go into the game feeling we can win.  The game we already played shouldn't tear us down. We have to look to the  positive and build from there."  </P> <P> One thing has not changed since his days at Maryland. Ross is certain never to  be on the list of the most quotable college football coaches. Then again, after  Lou Holtz, it is a pretty short list.  </P> <P> Though Holtz is eminently quotable, he is a master of double talk. Before the  Kickoff Classic two weeks ago, the Notre Dame coach was asked about how tough a  game he expected from Virginia.  </P> <P> "They're a very good team," Holtz said of the Cavaliers, who would lose to the  top-ranked Fighting Irish, 36-13. "They beat Clemson last year, and Clemson  beat Oklahoma in the Citrus Bowl."  </P> <P> Asked earlier this week for his reaction to Virginia's upset last Saturday at  Penn State, and how the Nittany Lions might stack up later in the year against  Notre Dame, Holtz said, "I never compare scores of games."  </P> <P> The Cavaliers, after getting scored on the first five times Notre Dame had the  ball, haven't given up a touchdown for six quarters  </P> <P> How young a team does Mack Brown have at North Carolina? In the Tar Heels'  season-opening rout of VMI, 29 North Carolina players were making their  collegiate debuts.  </P> <P> Before the season began, the Florida State-LSU matchup in Baton Rouge, La.,  appeared to be one of those games that would have a big impact on this season's  national championship.  </P> <P> Now, it won't make a dent. That is the result of two straight defeats for the  Seminoles (to Southern Mississippi and Clemson) and LSU's season-opening loss  at Texas A&amp;M.  </P> <P> "The game has taken on a whole new look since the beginning of the year, when  it looked like the game of the century," said Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden.  'But it still ought to be a heck of a game."  </P> <P> But will anybody watch (on ESPN)?  </P> <P> Indiana tailback Anthony Thompson, one of those mentioned prominently for this  year's Heisman Trophy, is the only active collegiate player listed in a recent  book called "NCAA Legends."  </P> <P> Thompson did not add to that legend last weekend. Though he rushed for 117  yards in a 17-14 season-opening defeat against Kentucky, Thompson was stopped  trying to go over the top of the goal line in the closing minutes.  </P> <P> The Wildcats, who led the country in graduation rate last year, have a chance  to go 2-0 this week against North Carolina.  </P> <P> Last Saturday's nationally televised game between woeful Wisconsin and powerful  Miami drew a crowd of 38,000 in Madison, the lowest single-game attendance  there since 1968. Last year's game against Western Michigan drew 830 more  people.  </P> <P> Through last weekend, the nation's field-goal kickers seemed to be making the  adjustment of going without a tee. More than 70 percent of field-goal tries  have been successful, better than the season high of 68.2 set in 1984.  </P> <P> Quote of the Week: "They were clearly such a dominant team over us, it's  frightening. Either they have been greatly miscalculated, or this might be the  poorest team we've had here," UCLA Coach Terry Donahue after his Bruins lost to  Tennessee.  </P></p>

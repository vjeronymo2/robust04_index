			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Carson Float -- A story on Dec. 13 incorrectly reported that the Carson City  Council voted to eliminate funding for a city float in future Rose parades. In  fact, the council voted to notify parade officials of their interest in having  a municipal float in the 1992 event. However, the council did not approve city  funding for the float and some council members said the city will not make a  financial commitment toward the cost of a float.  </P></p>

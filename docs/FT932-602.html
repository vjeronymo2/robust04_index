			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Arts: Ceremonial Handel - Concert The Battle of Dettingen, when the combined might of the German and English armies led into battle by George II turned the course of the War of the Austrian Succession, took place on 27 June 1743. Handel celebrated the victory with his Dettingen Anthem, 'The King shall rejoice in thy strength, O Lord' and the grandest of all his ceremonial pieces, the Dettingen Te Deum. On Saturday in St James, Piccadilly, the Lufthansa Baroque Festival marked the 250th anniversary with performances of both works, a roster of British soloists and the St James Baroque Players joining forces with two German choruses, the Volks-Chor Grosswelzheim and the male-voice Liederblue Dettingen. It was an appropriately grand, festive occasion, attended by Their Royal Highnesses the Princess of Hesse and the Rhine (the Lufthansa Festival's Patron) and the Prince of Wales. The conducting was shared between Ivor Bolton and the Kapellmeister of the Volks-Chor, Franz-Peter Huber. It took a while for the performances to bed down - an opening Purcell anthem, 'O Sing Unto the Lord', conducted by Huber, seemed unsteady in rhythm and ensemble, and the chorus just too large to negotiate nimbly the work's extrovert complexities. But Handel's solo motet Silete venti was much more convincing, with the soprano Lorna Anderson in dazzling form - splendid agility, easy, gracious phrasing and tight, even trills. The German choir always seemed a little on the ponderous side, with the female voices distinctly more focused and responsive than the men; woolly, weak tenors are evidently not just a characteristic of British choirs. The odd exposed word apart, however (a strange 'Alleliu-jah' at one point, an 'Appossells' at another), Handel's English texts were convincingly delivered. The Te Deum was delivered by Bolton with bracing rhythmic attack and forthright orchestral playing - excellent trumpets and woodwind - and deft work from the soloists. Lorna Anderson was joined by Julia Gooding; and the male trio of Christopher Robson, Martyn Hill and Michael George was concentrated and intense at 'Thou sittest at the right hand of God'. It was, however, the most imposing and theatrical moments that came off best, the grandiose opening and the closing choruses: Handel at his most unabashedly festive and populist.

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Survival mission / A look at the rescue service provided by a large practice of company doctors When the Miller family set up Prestwick Holdings in 1969, it had a simple strategy - to be among the leading mass producers of printed circuit boards for electronics assemblers in Europe. The company prospered for most of the years leading up to flotation in 1985. But since then Prestwick has stumbled though management changes, a boardroom coup and a collapse in profits that has left its shares languishing at less than half the issue price. It might have been worse, however, without the intervention of Postern, the UK's only specialist corporate rescue service that brings a number of company doctors together in one organisation. Headed by chairman Sir Lewis Robertson, a respected administrator and a chairman of several companies which have been rescued, Postern attempts to be fireman, resuscitation unit and convalescent home rolled into one. Its work at Prestwick bore fruit in July when, seven months after being appointed by the Millers and other shareholders, new management seconded from Postern orchestrated a Pounds 4.5m rights issue that patched up a battered balance sheet. But the bruising year spent appeasing mercurial banks and lurching from crisis to crisis vividly illustrates how company rescues rarely progress in a predictable fashion. 'Most of our companies are absolutely at death's door and facing closure when we start,' says Archie Coulson, the Postern director who heads the rescue team and is now chairman at Prestwick. 'But recovery is not a straight line, it's a very jagged path.' Normally Postern is called in by banks trying to prevent a company they have backed from going down in flames. But in the case of Prestwick - which is slightly smaller than the two largest UK independents, Exacta and ISL, both unquoted companies with sales of about Pounds 40m each - it was the Miller family that appealed for help. The family's action was prompted by disquiet about the diversification strategy adopted by the then management in 1992, by which time no Millers were on the board despite their 25 per cent shareholding. The move that upset Eric Miller, brother of the co-founder and former director, was Prestwick's Pounds 2m investment in Electroconnect, a designer of PCB prototypes bought the previous year. 'Prestwick had negligible profits and the balance sheet was very stretched with 100 per cent gearing,' says Miller. 'Debt was not being whittled down. It was suggested we talk to Lewis Robertson at Postern.' With the support of another shareholder bloc, Postern was appointed in early January this year and three Prestwick directors left the board. As always when Postern goes into a company, its first almost obsessional interest is with cash. 'We sit with the internal cash manager and produce a schedule that says line by line what the facility position is,' says Coulson. The focus is the cash book and how much 'headroom' there is between this and the banks' facility limits. Very soon after he got his feet under the table Coulson had his first shock. Understandably, one of Coulson's first calls was on the regional manager of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Prestwick's main lenders. Coulson says this manager was 'pleased to see the cavalry coming over the hill' and welcomed Postern on board. It was therefore a surprise to Coulson in early February when at a routine meeting with the Royal Bank he was met by three executives from the special lending service - a euphemism for the loan recovery unit. Concerned with the security on its Pounds 3.8m facility, the Royal Bank dropped the bombshell that it would be appointing investigating accountants, Ernst &amp; Young, at Prestwick. Coulson was aware these reports often lead to accountants recommending receivership. 'We went in thinking they (the Royal Bank) would be happy to support this restructuring,' says Coulson. Suddenly that support was in doubt. It reinforces one of Coulson's rules of restructuring: 'The trick is not to allow yourself, or more importantly the banks, to have any nasty surprises.' In the event, Ernst &amp; Young produced a report that said the operational management could build a future for Prestwick and that Postern was addressing the issues. One of the next significant problems was the rights issue. It was clear the company needed to be recapitalised and that Prestwick had a poor track record. To make matters worse, Coulson was bereft of advisers. Prestwick's brokers, Glasgow-based Speirs and Jeffrey, decided it could not back the rights issue; Prestwick was in arrears on dividend payments for a preference share issue the broker supported. At the same time, and quite coincidentally, Prestwick's lawyer moved from his firm, McGrigor Donald, leaving the company deciding whether to follow him or bring a new partner quickly up to speed at the old firm. Finally, Noble Grossart, the investment bank which as Prestwick's long-time adviser had been associated with the old management and failed strategy, was still evaluating the Postern management. 'How was I to do a rights issue?' asked Coulson. 'In terms of advisers I was a bit thin on the ground.' Meanwhile, Prestwick was facing ordinary operational problems. In particular, one large customer had started questioning the quality of PCBs it was receiving. What seemed like a 'king-size' problem at a critical juncture of the restructuring, however, turned out to be a financial issue. After checking on the quality, Coulson realised the customer was as concerned about Prestwick's finances as its ability to deliver quality products. 'The important thing in a recovery is you have to make sure you fire fight those issues on time before the customer says 'we don't know what these people are doing, we will get another supplier',' Coulson says. Postern finally persuaded brokers Allied Provincial Services to support the rights issue. But in a chaotic eight weeks Prestwick first had to sell a subsidiary, appoint Paul Woodley as new finance director, develop a new business plan, produce acceptable interim figures and appoint a new board. By the time Prestwick produced preliminary figures in the year to August 1, which showed the company had returned to operating profits in the second half, Postern had won the time to consider its future. Coulson believes there are a number of options, including vertical integration through the forging of links with a raw material supplier or equipment manufacturer. With the renewed shareholder support, merger with or acquisition of another PCB manufacturer is also likely to be carefully studied. Routine operational problems nevertheless persist. The latest, alluded to in the interim results statement, concerns a shortfall in capacity utilisation in the multi-layer PCB plant. 'The underlying problem is the operational gearing ratio of these big plants,' Coulson says. 'It does not take a big swing in orders to go from profits to losses.' Postern meets similar problems at each of the companies it works with - about half of which are private. The lessons learned in such situations are discussed extensively at regular meetings of Postern's six-member executive committee. This committee not only includes Coulson and Sir Lewis, but Ken Scobie, former chief executive of Brent Walker, Stan Carslake, former head of Barclays Bank Intensive Care Unit, and Trevor Swete, former head of corporate finance at Hill Samuel. These meetings will rake over issues ranging from capacity utilisation problems, such as those at Prestwick, to pricing and brand strategy and how to deal with banks. 'We have gathered together a load of information on how we crack issues in the field,' says Coulson. 'A lot is to do with good basic management. But by making Postern a company, we systematically put together the cumulative experience of all these guys. That is our real value.'</p>

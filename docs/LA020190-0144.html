			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: CHARLOTTE HORNETS FIRE HARTER AS COACH  </P> <P> The Charlotte Hornets fired Coach Dick Harter Wednesday and named assistant  Gene Littles as interim coach, team officials said.  </P> <P> "A skill that a coach must have is communication and it came to the point where  I couldn't, as the owner, communicate with Dick and I know that he had lost his  communication link with the players," owner George Shinn said.  </P> <P> Harter, 58, was 8-32 this season and 28-92 in 1 1/2 seasons.  </P> <P> "We know that the building process is a long one, and that was not a factor,"  said Carl Scheer, team president. "But the development of our younger players  and the team is our priority, and with that in jeopardy, a change was  necessary."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bonn Secrets"] </F>   [Text] The FRG Government refuses to report the number of  German missiles to the arms register of the United Nations. The  latest report contains information on the purchase of 30 "Mars"  rocket launchers and the 6,180 missiles belonging to them (with  a range of 38 km) that were procured by the Bundeswehr last  year. But the total number of systems and missiles of this  series and other types is missing. However, the United States  and Great Britain do not shrink from listing their considerable  arsenals (120,331 and 32,853 units respectively). The Mars  systems, which are jointly produced with Germany, are also  contained. In contrast to 1992, Bonn also did not report 40  guided AA-10 missiles from GDR [German Democratic Republic]  arsenals this time. The Defense Ministry supports the  mystery-mongering with the statement that "this data must not be  conveyed to the United Nations because a relevant secrecy  agreement does not exist." The arms register, for whose  establishment the FRG also pressed in 1991, is to provide a  survey of international arms arsenals and arms exports.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Renault plans to make cars in Vietnam Renault, the French state-owned carmaker, has signed a letter of intent to begin car assembly in Vietnam. The cars will be produced by Vietnam Motors (VMC) with kits supplied by Renault from France. Vietnam Motors is a joint venture between Columbian Motors of the Philippines, which holds a 55 per cent stake, Nichimen of Japan with a 15 per cent stake and a Vietnamese state company. The group plans to produce the Renault 19 small family car with assembly of Renault's CKD (completely knocked down) kits likely to begin in early 1995. It already assembles the Mazda 626 and 323 from kits along with some products from Kia, the South Korean carmaker. It also plans to start assembly of the BMW 525 at its plant near Hanoi in September. As an emerging market Vietnam is being viewed with great interest by several of the world's leading vehicle makers. Last month Mitsubishi Motors became the first Japanese carmaker to enter a joint venture in Vietnam. It has received approval by the Vietnamese government to form a joint vehicle manufacturing and sales venture in Vietnam along with Proton, the Malaysian carmaker in which it holds a minority stake and Vietranscimex, a Vietnamese national company. They are forming a joint venture, Vina Star Motors, in which Mitsubishi Motors, Mitsubishi Corporation and Proton will each hold stakes of 25 per cent, to assemble the Mitsubishi Delica minibus. Production is scheduled to start next March. Mekong, a Japanese-South Korean joint venture with Vietnamese companies, assembles four-wheel-drive vehicles at a plant in Ho Chi Minh City and has a plant near Hanoi that produces light buses and trucks in co-operation with Iveco, the commercial vehicle subsidiary of Fiat of Italy. Reuter, the news agency, reported yesterday that a senior official of Vietnam Motors in Hanoi had confirmed that the Vietnamese government had decided to raise taxes on imported cars to 200 per cent from the present level of 150 per cent from July 1. Most imported cars come from Japan. 'We hope it will be very good news for us because imported cars will be very expensive,' said Mr Joaquin Roa, VMC general manager. The impact of the higher tax would depend, however, on effective policing of the borders to prevent smuggling, which increased when governments raised car import taxes.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CORPORATE CONSCIENTIOUSNESS IS CHANGING THE WAY U.S. CONSUMERS SHOP  </P> <P> Pauline Quan doesn't chew Wrigley's gum anymore.  </P> <P> A bookkeeper in Arlington Heights, Ill., Quan switched to Warner-Lambert Co.'s  Sticklets after the company that makes Wrigley's gum was accused by a nonprofit  group of being socially irresponsible.  </P> <P> "No more Wrigley products for me," she wrote in a letter to the Wm. Wrigley Jr.  Co. in Chicago.  </P> <P> Quan is among a growing number of American consumers who browse the aisles of  supermarkets searching for products made by companies that they believe have a  conscience and a sense of social responsibility. Many consult tools such as  "Shopping for a Better World," a pocket guide to "socially responsible  supermarket shopping" that gave Wrigley the bad rap.  </P> <P> The guide, compiled by the Council on Economic Priorities, looks at 138  companies and 1,300 products, evaluating them on such issues as the advancement  of women and minorities, protection of the environment, community outreach and  charitable giving.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dinner Raises Awareness  </P> <P> "Clearly, there is a segment -- a growing one in the consumer base -- which is  increasingly concerned with the corporate consciences of the companies they do  business with," said James E. Preston, chairman and CEO of Avon Products Inc.,  which has been cited by the council for having a "corporate conscience."  </P> <P> Consequently, many companies have become more concerned about their social  images. "Any corporation that doesn't project itself as concerned about the  welfare of its consumers is basically stuck in time with a very primitive  marketing program," said Herbert Chao Gunther, executive director of the Public  Media Center, a public interest advertising firm in San Francisco.  </P> <P> According to a council survey, 80% of the consumers it polled said they had  changed their shopping habits after reading the guide. Two-thirds said they  were in the habit of looking something up when they shop, and about the same  number actually remembered company ratings.  </P> <P> Consumer awareness also is raised by an annual awards dinner the council  sponsors to recognize companies with exemplary performance in areas such as  equal opportunity, charitable giving, employee responsiveness, environmental  responsibility and community action.  </P> <P> Companies that made the grade this year included:  </P> <P> Arlington, Va.-based Applied Energy Services, an independent power generator  and consultant, made the list for a tree-planting program in Guatemala designed  to combat the greenhouse effect; Dayton Hudson, a Minneapolis-based chain of  retail stores, for its 43-year-old charitable giving program; Federal Express  for "employer responsiveness," particularly its no layoff policy and Eastman  Kodak for its support of small businesses owned by women, minorities and the  handicapped.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Difficult to Gauge  </P> <P> H .B. Fuller, the paint and adhesive company, and Newman's Own, a company  founded by actor Paul Newman, received honorable mentions.  </P> <P> At the bottom of the list, at least according to the council's criteria, were  Du Pont -- for its role in managing the Savannah River nuclear power plant --  and meatpacker John Morrell &amp; Co. The company was fined $4.3 million for  having dangerous conditions in the work place. Both were to receive  dishonorable mentions.  </P> <P> Du Pont has attributed its difficulties at the plant to outside technical  inspectors and insists that it never tried to cover up any problems.  </P> <P> Morrell has accused both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and  congressional Democrats of mounting a vendetta against the company. Morrell  officials said that the company has cleaned up most of the safety violations it  was fined for allowing.  </P> <P> Despite the interest and activism of some consumers, it is difficult to gauge  how corporate social behavior translates into sales -- or lost sales -- the  cash register.  </P> <P> Wrigley, for example, did not respond to a survey from the council, and said  its first obligation is to its shareholders.  </P> <P> "Our social responsibility is as strong as any corporation's, but why should we  support some group making a business out of sending these things out," said  William Piet, Wrigley's vice president of corporate affairs. The company does  its giving through a special foundation, he said, which was not included in the  guide's ratings.  </P> <P> Many corporations in the past 20 years have improved their track record in  areas such as charitable giving, the promotion of women, and their role South  Africa, according to Alice Tepper Marlin, executive director of the council.  </P> <P> Marlin points out, however, that gains have been offset by what she views as  negative developments -- the rise of corporate giving to political action  committees and the effect of mergers, acquisitions and leveraged buyouts on  corporate volunteerism, charitable giving and employee benefits.  </P> <P> "Their consciences vary as much as they do for any individual," she said.  </P></p>

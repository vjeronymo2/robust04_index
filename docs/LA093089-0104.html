			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARKANSAS GOVERNOR SCHOOLED ON SOUTH L.A. LIFE  </P> <P> For Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, crouched astride a tiny blue plastic chair amid  the sixth-graders at 92nd Street School in South Los Angeles on Friday, it was  a political education unlike that offered in the back-slapping salons of the  Westside, the area that normally defines this city for the nation's political  elite.  </P> <P> "One of my friends, he got shot about two weeks ago," said an 11-year-old boy,  fidgeting nervously across a wood-grained table from Clinton. "He got shot in  the leg. They had to take some of the meat out of one leg and put it in the  other, and they had to put one of those long things, those . . . "  </P> <P> "Rods?" Clinton asked, a stunned look crossing his face.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Shot Three Times'  </P> <P> "Rods, yeah, they had to put it in his leg," answered the boy. "He got shot  three times. He didn't do nothing. All he was doing was standing in the  street."  </P> <P> As if playing a macabre game of can-you-top-this, an emboldened 11-year-old  girl offered the story of her cousin, killed as she watched.  </P> <P> "He was minding his own business. All of a sudden -- bam-bam-bam," she said,  mimicking the shots, "he was gone."  </P> <P> With their harrowing tales, dispensed matter-of-factly with the stammers and  blushes of childhood, the children of 92nd Street School entered the national  debate over improving the nation's schools and the corollary urban problems of  gangs and drugs.  </P> <P> Clinton's visit was meant as an information-gathering jaunt for the governor.  He was co-chairman of the two-day education summit called in Charlottesville,  Va., this week by President Bush and the nation's governors and is the  designated drafter of national education goals to be drawn by next February.  </P> <P> Of course, the trip did have a partially political motivation. For years,  prominent Democrats have loudly decried the fact that national candidates slide  into town just long enough to line their campaign treasuries with Los Angeles  money before rushing back home.  </P> <P> Clinton's visit, arranged last week, came after he heeded the complaints of  friend and Democratic fund raiser, Stanley Sheinbaum.  </P> <P> "I have for a long time been complaining that so many of these Democratic  candidates come into town and are so focused on fund-raising that they never  get past the Regency Club or Chasen's or those elegant places where the major  donors are found," Sheinbaum said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Stranger  </P> <P> Clinton, 43, is no stranger to Los Angeles and its monied political circles,  traveling here from his home in Little Rock yearly for speeches. He is  frequently mentioned as a future presidential candidate.  </P> <P> Some politicians have wandered through the city's needy neighborhoods, usually  in an election year and usually trailing cameras to film their expressions of  compassion. But Friday's tour was a political rarity -- intentionally  under-publicized, it drew no television cameras. It showcased a world away from  the plush environs of the stereotyped Los Angeles.  </P> <P> After meeting with community activists in the basement of a church on 43rd  Street, Clinton and his wife, Hillary, boarded a van for a tour of South Los  Angeles. A guide, pointing to and fro, provided the voice-over for a travelogue  of despair.  </P> <P> "MSB -- Mad Swan Bloods," said Tony Massengale, an organizer for the Southern  California Organizing Committee, a community group. He pointed with his right  arm toward gang graffiti on Avalon Boulevard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Hold Sway'  </P> <P> "They (MSB) hold sway up to the stoplight," Massengale said.  </P> <P> "Avalon Gardens Housing Project," he said, gesturing to the left. "That's where  the Avalon Gardens Crips started."  </P> <P> The van turned a corner and glided past Will Rogers Memorial Park.  </P> <P> "Looks green," he said. "But it's one of the dead parks. Winos have it by day,  gangs at night. They burned down the gym two years ago. Families by and large  don't use it anymore."  </P> <P> At the 92nd Street School, the children espoused harsh punishments for gang  members and drug users, their voices rising in frustration.  </P> <P> "The first thing they got to do is take the gang-bangers out," said one little  boy, asked by Clinton what he would do if he could run Los Angeles. Officials  requested that the childrens' names not be used for fear that gang members  would retaliate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Good People'  </P> <P> "Put 'em all in jail for life," the boy continued. "Just put 'em somewhere.  Give them their own city, so all the good people could live . . . "  </P> <P> Do you resent the gangs? Clinton asked.  </P> <P> The boy nodded soberly: "They affect my life. A lot."  </P> <P> "I don't think it's fair," added one little girl, "that even the babies have to  die."  </P></p>

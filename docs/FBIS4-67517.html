			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with ``minister of environmental protection Yuriy </F> Spizhenko'' by Oleh Nesterenko: ``Crime Due to Ignorance''--name  and title of minister as published; bureau records show Yuriy  Kostenko as minister of environmental protection and Yuriy  Spizhenko as Ukraine's minister of health]    [Text] Every passing year slightly lowers the acuteness  with which we perceive the Chernobyl disaster. We buried those  who were among the first victims of the radiation freed by the  accident and we reconciled ourselves to their death, but we fail  to see that people continue to perish near us and that children  are born handicapped. We just attribute this to fate. We even  seem to begin to get used to the phrase that our nation is dying  out. For three years already the death-rate has prevailed over  the birth-rate--the population of whole towns is disappearing,  and we do not want to see this and even reproach those who are  telling the truth--do not add salt to the wound, do not let it  fester or it will never heal. However, I am sure that people  must get information and know the truth, no matter how bitter it  might be. In this, Ukraine's minister of environmental  protection Yuriy Spizhenko [as published] agrees with me:    Minister: Once, when the USSR was still alive,  these secrets were faithfully guarded by the State Committee for  Atomic Supervision. People did not know anything about the  terrible accident in Chelyabinsk-40 [in Russia], about the  explosions and discharges of huge amounts of radioactive  elements into the environment at other atomic plants, which, on  our territory, have no protective shells. However, we in  Ukraine built a similar structure and allowed those who are only  interested in the thoughtless exploitation of natural resources,  to exercise control over nuclear safety. As soon as our  ministry declared its right to tackle this problem and created a  special administration, director of the Chernobyl AES Mr. Soroka  started writing letters to all power structures openly demanding  that the administration be abolished. Do you think that he will  not get support? The powerful nuclear lobby is capable of  anything in maintaining its positions. It may remove the  Ministry of Environmental Protection from control over the  nuclear monster, although our ministry is the only objective  body in Ukraine that is free from known limitations and stands  up for the interests of the majority of the people.    Nesterenko: Incidentally, rumors have spread in  Kiev about barges and ships that took part in the clearup after  the Chernobyl accident and that are now in navigation and about  containers in which radioactive sand was transported.    Minister: I do not know where they are now, in  whose yards they stand, or who is using them. Do you know why?  This is due to this legal chaos, organizational confusion, and  because we have too many controlling organizations that remove  this right from the Ministry of Environmental Protection.    Nesterenko: What other Ukrainian regions have also  been ecologically contaminated?    Minister: According to the results of objective  studies, the greater part of our country has been contaminated  to one degree or another. These are chemical pollutants due to  the incompetent use of means of protection of green plants and,  of course, radioactive contamination. The territories of the  Donets-Dniester [as published; possibly Donets-Dnieper] Region,  where heavy industry prevails and areas affected by the  Chernobyl accident are in a particularly bad situation. Of  course, a gradual decrease in the levels of radioactivity is  taking place, but, at the same time, increasingly larger  territories are subjected to contamination. These are physical  processes and there is no escaping them.    Nesterenko: I heard that you are advocating the  idea of closing down atomic electric power plants?    Minister: This is not quite so, I am in favor of  closing down the Chernobyl AES, or, more specifically, of  closing down reactors of the Chernobyl type not only in Ukraine,  but throughout the world.    Nesterenko: Where else do they operate?    Minister: Eleven in Russia, incidentally, not far  from the border with Ukraine, and one in Lithuania....    Nesterenko: Those without protective shells?    Minister: Yes, but the point is that, in civilized  countries, such reactors have many different protection systems,  and the last of these is the hermetic shell. In our country,  you see for yourself.    In view of this situation, it is necessary to raise the  question at an international level and resolve it by joint  efforts. A single state will not be able to do this.    It is an entirely different problem--whether Ukraine can do  without nuclear power engineering. I answer--it can't! First,  natural resources are being exhausted at a fast rate, primarily  such energy sources as coal, oil, and gas. They are becoming  more expensive, and the price of electricity grows. In the  future, thermal plants will gradually become less numerous, and  nuclear energy must go through its second birth. However, it  will be based upon safe types of reactors after the problem of  utilizing radioactive waste is resolved. Besides, there must be  uranium. If all of this does not prove to be economically  profitable, society will look for other sources of energy  provision.    Nesterenko: How would you use our nuclear weapons  for peaceful purposes?    Minister: Nuclear warheads contain highly enriched  uranium and plutonium, and it might be good to use them for the  needs of our power engineering. For this, according to the  State Committee for Atomic Energy, it is necessary to proceed to  a different type of reactor, and then the raw materials will be  sufficient for us for the next 150-200 years. This is better  than to receive heat-generating cassettes from Russia over two  or three years and then again to be confronted with today's  problem: Either to develop our own production or to depend upon  our northern neighbor. That is why I am saying that it is  better to use the nuclear warheads for our own purposes: To  repair them and stockpile. We have facilities for storing them  for a long time.    Another variant is to sell these materials at their true  price, rather than to barter--warheads in exchange for fuel for  atomic plants. If we had formulated the issue in such a way,  the United States might have supported us, but now....    ... Now we present our losses as an achievement by saying:  It is good that Russia will provide us with fuel for our AES's.    Nesterenko: Excuse me, but this is a game of  hide-and-seek with our own people.    Minister: That is why we should not be afraid of  hurting people by telling them the truth.    We must speak more frequently on these matters, at least in  order to make our people ecologically conscious. When one looks  at the people, the impression is as though there are only  ignoramuses, both at the top and at the bottom. From this  situation there is just one step to crime.</p>

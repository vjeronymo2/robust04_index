			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COINS: DOLLAR'S SIZE HURTS CHANCE FOR REVIVAL  </P> <P> Question: I realize your column is mostly devoted to rare coins, real or  imagined, so although my question is a bit out of the mainstream I hope you  will consider answering it. What I would like to see is Susan B. Anthony's  birthday, Feb. 15, 1820, become a national celebration, not as a paid holiday  but as a day when the dollar coin, minted in her memory, is used to purchase  goods and services.  </P> <P> It would not only be a wonderful way to honor the woman who was instrumental in  getting the vote for so many, it might even help promote circulation of  millions of Anthony dollars now sitting in the mint. Previously, I contacted  advice columnists and a former Treasury secretary but received no specific  assistance from them.  </P> <P> Will you please advise me how to go about accomplishing my goal? -- M.A.  </P> <P> Answer: The Anthony dollar is one of the colossal failures of modern coinage.  Millions and millions of these dollars were minted between 1979 and 1981.  Unfortunately, as you suggest, millions and millions still reside in government  vaults, unloved and unwanted.  </P> <P> The reason is a basic flaw in the design. The Anthony dollar is so similar in  size to the quarter that it is easily confused for a coin worth only one-fourth  as much. It didn't take consumers long to decide the confusion was not worth  the monetary risk, and Anthony dollars fell from disfavor to disuse.  </P> <P> It's a pity too, because the Anthony dollar represented the first time that a  woman, besides Miss Liberty, was honored on a circulating United States coin.  But the coin didn't circulate, and I'm not sure that any organized effort on  your part or others will ever be successful.  </P> <P> The problem lies with the basic concept of the coin's size. It's likely that  the Anthony dollars still in the vaults will eventually be melted down.  Feminists would probably be better served by petitioning Congress to approve a  new Anthony dollar -- or some other denomination -- that the public would  accept.  </P> <P> Q: Could you give me some information as to the relative value of a 1-cent coin  that I have. It is dated 1964, but is not the same size as the regular one now  in use. It is so small you can hardly pick it up. It has a picture of Abe  Lincoln on one side. -- J.S.  </P> <P> A: Your coin is a novelty, produced perhaps by someone attempting to make a  comment about how our spending power has shrunk. But it is not a coin in the  true meaning of the word and it has no numismatic value.  </P> <P> Q: I have what I'm guessing is an Olympic gold medal from 1932, a commemorative  medal, that is. It is quite heavy and has been in the family a long time. Where  can I go to learn its worth? -- B.G.  </P> <P> A: To determine its worth you'll have to identify the medal. There are books on  the subject; perhaps your local library can help you. There are also dealers  who specialize in medals. You'll have to make the rounds but you might get  lucky and find an Olympics specialist. It's hard to tell with commemoratives,  but Olympic gold medals themselves (they're not really gold, I understand) sell  for about $475 to $1,500, depending on the condition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coin News  </P> <P> Two sales are being conducted by Pacific Coast Auction Galleries in conjunction  with the 11th annual Long Beach Numismatic and Philatelic Exposition. Certsale  VII leads things off Wednesday at 7 p.m. with more than 600 lots of certified  coins, including the 1827 $5 gold piece (pictured) graded MS-63 by the  Numismatic Guaranty Corp. A three-session general auction will be held  Wednesday at 9 p.m.; next Thursday and June 1 at 7 p.m. at the Long Beach  Convention Center. Certsale catalogues are $5, general catalogues $10 from  Pacific Coast Auction Galleries, 1013 State St., Santa Barbara, Calif. 93101;  telephone collect (805) 962-3197.  </P> <P> New issues are the lifeblood of numismatics, so collectors should be pleased to  learn that beginning June 1 they can begin ordering commemoratives marking the  bicentennial of Congress. Orders received before July 17 will be discounted  with the 50-cent proof selling for $7, the $1 proof is $25 and the $5 gold  proof is $195. Half-dollar and dollar sets are $31.50; sets of all three are  $220. Uncirculated pieces are $5 for the half dollar; $23 for the $1 and $185  for the $5. Order after June 1 from the U.S. Mint's Customer Affairs Staff,  10001 Aerospace Road, Lanham, Md. 20706.  </P> <P> Canada, which for the last several years has issued some beautiful coins, has  come up with two more winners: a 1989 silver dollar commemorating the  exploration of the Mackenzie River, and a $100 gold proof commemorating the  350th anniversary of the first European settlement in Ontario. The gold piece  is $210. The silver proof dollar is $18.80; uncirculated it's $13.90. Order  from the Royal Canadian Mint, P.O. Box 457, Station A, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada,  K1N 8V5; telephone (800) 267-1871.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Alpert cannot answer mail personally but will respond to numismatic questions  of general interest in this column.

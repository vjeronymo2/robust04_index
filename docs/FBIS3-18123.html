			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "df": "FDP Now Has the Right of Sole </F> Representation for `Social Market Economy'"]    [Text] Duesseldorf -- The Free Democratic Party of Germany  [FDP] has taken note of the decisions of the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU] congress in Hamburg with interest, but  without enthusiasm, Otto Count Lambsdorff, the economic policy  spokesman of the FDP Bundestag group, said in an interview with  HANDELSBLATT. "However, we are satisfied with the chancellor's  clear statement that, if the voters so wish, he wants to  continue the coalition with the FDP, and with his graphically  formulated rejection of a grand coalition." If the CDU relies  exclusively on Chancellor Kohl "and nothing else," this is  exclusively its own business.    Lambsdorff notes with surprise that the CDU is willing to  give up the internationally tested trademark of "social market  economy." Ludwig Erhard would also be surprised, he says. "For  me this results in a call on the FDP not to miss this  opportunity. If the CDU speaks only of social and ecological  market economy in the future, then the FDP should stick  emphatically to the term `social market economy.'"    Its ecological commitment has always been undisputed; there  has never been any doubt that "social" means consideration for  man and also for the environment where man lives. The keyword  of social market economy has such a positive connotation that  one can only wonder which public relations agency or which party  body recommended the CDU to give up this term. Even the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] already speaks of the social  market economy, "but fortunately one believes them even less.  I, personally, will do everything to pursue the 1994 election  campaign with this term."    The fact that the chancellor's relationship with social  market economy is a bit strange is nothing new, Lambsdorff  noted. His repeated claim that he does not want to win the  Ludwig-Erhard prize but the Bundestag elections makes it clear  how incorrectly he assesses matters. Kohl does not know what  Walter Eucken [economist, 1891-1950] called the interdependence  of order: One cannot preach market economy in a party congress  speech and, at the same time, say that agriculture, mining, and  shipyards are excluded.    And one cannot, like Kohl, call for the restructuring of the  social state and a change of thinking among the Germans and, at  the same time, recommend raising the basic wages in the public  sector and then present such an agreement as a pilot agreement  for all other wage areas. "Raising basic wages always leads to  basic unemployment." Kohl had better talk about the exemplary  nature of the agreement for the chemical industry.  <H5>  Incorrect Wage Recommendations for the Public Sector </H5>   "Anything else I hear from the party congress and its  economic policy decisions makes me wonder. When Mr. Goehner  speaks of new values and an epochal change, I have no idea what  that means if I do not get any further explanation. However,  this is only a basic program, and, as is known, one can make  exceptions from basic principles."    One must wait and see what is now going to happen in  practice: Will privatizations really be carried out, in  particular at the laender level, and will the federal post, for  instance, really be changed in such a way that one can speak of  privatization and deregulation in the sense of the opportunities  for development of an industrial sector?    In tax policy it sounds good when one can hear in Hamburg  that, on principle, indirect taxes -- "I ask, which ones?" --  are to be raised and direct taxes are to be lowered. However,  when one looks at the insufficiently thought-out ideas that were  presented at the coalition partner's election congress under the  catch word of "family policy," one wonders whether, e.g. the  additional burden of 17 to 30 billion German marks [DM] for the  introduction of the "family splitting" should be financed from  the increase in petroleum tax or in value-added tax?    Lambsdorff: "The question is already the answer: Of course,  this is completely impossible." And the abolition or limitation  of spouses' splitting to finance family splitting would require  a restructuring of civilian and social law.    The CDU also wants to restructure the social state.  "Everybody knows that the institutions of our social state,  which are financed by contributions, are at least not  unendangered. At the same time, the same CDU wants to introduce  a nursing-care insurance that is financed by contributions from  employers and employees. This is not a restructuring of the  social state, but a further move forward into the social policy  dead end."    All this is not convincing. However, it is not decisive for  the election campaign, either. The election campaign is decided  by the answers to the problem of unemployment. Saxon  Minister-President Biedenkopf made an analytically remarkable  contribution without, however, presenting any solutions. Jobs  do not develop in the large companies, but in small and  medium-sized companies. "In view of the development of labor  costs in Germany, we cannot rely on the expectation that,  investments will lead to more and new jobs to the usual extent.  Everywhere investments are capital-intensive and are made in  such a way that as little human labor as possible is used."  <H5>  FDP Strictly Rejects a Technology Council </H5>   Thus, jobs develop in the sphere of medium-sized companies,  many social institutions, and in the service sector. Germany  cannot become a country with just a tertiary sector, it must  remain a production site. However, this production site will be  operated by far fewer people than in the past.    One can compare the current structural development with the  mechanization of agriculture 25 or 30 years ago, when labor was  reduced there radically and was taken up by industry. A farm,  which was worked by 20 people in the past, can now do with the  labor of one family and one helper. Similar things are  currently happening in the producing industry. "We cannot avoid  this trend if we want to remain a high-wage country. And we  must remain a high-wage country, if we want to more or less  maintain our high social level."    Some comments made in Hamburg regarding industrial policy  give reason for distrust. Thus, a technology council was  recommended, for instance, which is strictly rejected by the FDP  as a step toward a republic governed by commissars. The FDP  does not want mixing responsibilities. No one in such a  technology council -- no chancellor, no economics minister, no  expert who gives advice there -- subsequently accepts  responsibility if following this advice leads to bankruptcies  and unemployment. Responsibility remains with the companies. A  mere exchange of opinion and information between industry and  companies is, of course, harmless [sentence as published].    The fact that Heiner Geissler harshly attacked the SPD was  very satisfying in Hamburg. The SPD is the actual opponent in  this election campaign. The SPD's irresponsibility in foreign  policy must be laid open. What Scharping sold as his party's  attitude at the security conference, the former military defense  conference, was as far away from the truth as the sky is from  the earth.    And what the SPD is spreading in terms of economic policy  ideas makes one thing quite clearly: "Voting for the SPD in  1994 means voting for something extremely expensive." The  citizens would suffer if the SPD implemented its tax policy  slogans.    Scharping speaks of unjustified income and assets that could  be removed by taxes. Lambsdorff: "Unjustified incomes are  probably the interests from the state bonds of  Rhineland-Palatinate; and unjustified assets are probably what  children inherit from their parents." Whoever wants to put  higher taxes on that, obviously has absolutely no idea of the  connection between saving, capital formation, investments, and  the resulting jobs.  <H3>  Compared With the SPD, the CDU Is the Better Coalition  Partner </H3>   The SPD wants a higher inheritance tax, higher standard  values of real estate property, and a higher property tax. In  this case, the SPD's ironic election poster of the past "German  worker, the SPD wants to take away your villa in Ticino!" might  indeed become true. "If the SPD wins, the issue is not the villa  in Ticino but the one-family house in Meckenheim. If higher  standard values, higher land taxes, higher property tax, and  higher inheritance tax coincide, then many of the little people  will not be able to maintain their small house, which they built  with great effort by means of saving for building purposes. The  children will then have to sell their house so as to be able to  pay inheritance tax. And this is precisely the opposite of what  we need in Germany."    Thus, in Lambsdorff's view it is more important to deal with  the SPD than to quarrel among each other. "The election  campaign was officially opened in Hamburg. It will be decided  in economic policy. Here the CDU is not necessarily our ideal  as a coalition partner, but if I have the choice between a cold  and pneumonia, I prefer the cold."</p>

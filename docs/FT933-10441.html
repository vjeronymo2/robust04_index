			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / No time to relax On the face of it, there could hardly be a more comfortable time to be a banking supervisor. The attempt by banks to reduce their levels of risk from the reckless late 1980s should simplify the task of the Bank of England. Rather than having to rein in the banks, it could theoretically enjoy a spell of peace and quiet as they start to amass capital and spurn the poor lending of the past, writes John Gapper. The task under the 1987 Banking Act of Mr Brian Quinn, executive director of banking supervision, is to protect depositors' money. He can thus afford not to interfere, even if a bank has grown too cautious and is building up excess capital. 'We are here to protect the depositor. If a bank chooses to become overcapitalised then so be it. That is a commercial decision.' Mr Quinn's job is becoming more complex, for several reasons: Derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, may help reduce the obvious balance sheet risks faced by banks, but they raise other, less quantifiable risks, such as credit exposures to the other parties involved. This means that the chance of a catastrophic loss that could affect the financial system could be increased by the banks' efforts to avoid smaller losses, about which the Bank is sanguine. As banks review past risks, they could all shift capital into promising businesses, such as private banking, at the same time. This could reduce their profitability: margins would fall as they competed with each other. The central bank is the only body that can see where they are all heading at once. 'One of our strengths is that we know when everyone is coming in here at the same time talking about the latest fad,' Mr Quinn says. The Bank now faces demands to judge complex models of risk intended to help allocate capital. This could mean that it would be approving an approach to banking, rather than just checking banks' safety. However, Mr Quinn regards the approval of models as different from deciding on loans. 'Judging models involves assessing a methodology; judging credits involves assessing individual transactions. The latter is the banks' job, not ours,' he says. Capital may be taken away from types of lending that have proved riskier than expected. This difficulty has been highlighted by the Bank's own work on risk, following the excesses of 1980s lending. Its analysis of risk over cycles found that some industrial sectors, such as property, not only responded with more volatility to economic conditions, but followed the cycles more closely. Barclays is one bank that has said it intends to rebalance its portfolio to reduce the exposure to property lending. Other banks could make similar decisions that would affect credit in the economy for which the Bank has responsibility as a monetary authority. Yet there is no logical reason for a bank supervisor to interfere in a process that is likely to strengthen banks. Indeed, Mr Quinn insists that the Bank's monetary role is irrelevant. 'That does not come into (my task). If I see from examining banks' books that asset growth will be slower, I do not bring any pressure to bear to alter that,' he says. He has views, however, on the inadvisability of banks cutting off lending to particular sectors just because they have previously priced such lending inadequately. 'The lesson is not that you should stay away from property, but that you should analyse it, and price loans properly,' he says. Nonetheless, the severe swings in profitability in some forms of lending do carry a higher risk of sudden catastrophic loss, which would affect depositors. The Bank has its own reasons to encourage banks to turn away from riskier lending with higher cyclical losses.</p>

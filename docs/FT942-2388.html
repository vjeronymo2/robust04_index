			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Nissan's personnel chief at Sunderland to quit Mr Peter Wickens, personnel director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK), is to leave the company. Mr Wickens, who is also a board member, is credited with being the man who moulded the shape of industrial relations and practices at Nissan's Pounds 900m UK plant at Sunderland, Tyne and Wear. He joined the Japanese carmaker in October 1984 as the first British employee of its Sunderland plant. A former industrial-relations manager at the Dagenham body-plant of Ford, he jettisoned most industrial relations practices at Nissan, substituting a philosophy of team-working, flexibility and quality. He instituted a controversial single-union agreement with the AEEU engineering union, as well as 'flat' management structures and single status for all employees. He will leave the company early next year. Mr Wickens masterminded the recruitment needed for the swift expansion of the Nissan plant, which now employs 4,250. It was the UK's biggest car exporter in 1993, with nearly Pounds 1bn in export earnings, and is Europe's most productive car plant. Last autumn he implemented an 'agreed separation' policy - shedding jobs without redundancies in the face of the European car sales downturn. He said he was not leaving under this programme. 'Unfortunately it's closed,' he remarked. The AEEU has not found recruitment easy given its lack of a collective-bargaining role at the plant: just 40 per cent of employees are members. But Mr Wickens said he is 'a friend of trade unions' and believes they have a role to play in the new style of industrial relations. He said: 'The vast majority of British trades unions haven't really addressed these issues. It's up to trades unions to find their relevance.' He said at the weekend that this was an 'opportune time' to move on, having been at Nissan 10 years. However, he is not moving to another job in industry - his plans include lecturing. His second book, The Ascendant Organisation, is to be published next year.</p>

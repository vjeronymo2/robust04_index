			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Lilley spells out reform of benefit system Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, yesterday outlined the government's plans to rein in the growing cost of welfare spending by reforming the structure of the benefit system. In one of the most wide-ranging reforms of welfare policy for many years, Mr Lilley told the Commons how he plans to reform the distribution of a range of state subsidies including invalidity benefit, housing benefit and support for the unemployed. He also announced plans to combat benefit fraud, and gave details of how the state pension scheme will be equalised for men and women at age 65. The reforms were intended to 'strengthen our welfare state, to adapt it to modern needs, and to make it affordable into the next century'. The social security system must not outstrip the nation's ability to pay for it, he said. Mr Lilley revealed that the total cost of compensation for the imposition of value added tax on fuel - one of the most contentious issues for the government - would amount to Pounds 1.25bn a year by the time the measures fed through. Over three years, the total additional help for VAT on fuel would be Pounds 2.5bn. One of the key reforms is a change in invalidity benefit, claims for which have doubled over the past 10 years. The government yesterday published a consultation document on a tougher medical test to accompany a new incapacity benefit to replace invalidity benefit. This will focus only on medical issues - the current test takes into account such factors as an applicant's age and skills. The new tests mean the end to the system by which family doctors decide whether a prospective claimant is fit for work. They set out 16 categories of disability and claimants gain severity scores for various tests. For example, on walking, the severity scores range from 25 points for 'cannot walk at all' to 3 points for 'can walk 400 yards without stopping'. On manual handling, severity scores include 25 points for being 'unable to handle a book so as to read it'; 9.5 points for 'cannot pick up and carry a 5lb bag of potatoes in either hand separately'; 4.5 points for 'cannot lift and push an unladen wheelbarrow'. Incapacity benefit, unlike invalidity benefit, will be taxed. This change will not apply to existing claimants when the new scheme is introduced, but they will be subject to the new medical test when their cases are reviewed. Mr Lilley said that plans to combine unemployment benefit and income support into a new jobseeker's allowance would also reduce the bureaucracy and anomalies affecting the present scheme. Applicants will receive the allowance for six months, rather than 12 months under existing unemployment benefit. Long-term unemployed people will become eligible for a jobfinder's grant of Pounds 200 to help cover the costs of resuming employment. The government also announced that it would create a Fraud Board to step up prevention and detection of fraud.</p>

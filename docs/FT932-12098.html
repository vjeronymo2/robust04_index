			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: MTM sale Speculation that MTM would announce the denouement of its long-running crisis proved well founded. The troubled chemicals group declared yesterday that it was selling most of its assets to rival BTP. Nevertheless, the shadow of Serious Fraud Office investigation still hangs over MTM and the shares were off 2 1/2 after the news. They rallied to close a penny down at 10 1/2 p on balance. On the other hand, the fire sale was seen as a good deal for the buyer and BTP added 11 at 250p. Mr Martin Evans of Hoare Govett called it: 'The best deal in the chemicals sector for donkeys' years.' Textile group Coats Viyella was steady in a nervous market as it featured as the principal recommendation in an extensive sector review by Smith New Court. The house maintains its top of the range 1993 profits forecast of Pounds 147m. It argues that in spite of recent strong performance, the shares should see further upside because of less serious losses than anticipated from Brazil, recovery in the UK and US, and the benefits of the recent share dividend option. Coats shares were 4 higher in early trading and closed a net penny easier at 237p. Food retailing was the worst performing sector in the market as a combination of profit-taking and the well publicised worries over the industry came to the fore. Asda dipped 3 to 69 1/2 p, Argyll Group, over which a large line of stock hung all day, fell 12 to 326p and J. Sainsbury declined 10 to 456p. TSB was the second most heavily traded stock in the market amid continued speculation that a substantial disposal could be imminent, and following persistent talk of a takeover bid for the group. The bid stories were largely dismissed by banking specialists, although dealers pointed to the exceptionally heavy turnover in the stock. Some 16m shares changed hands, the highest activity in a single day since the preliminary figures were announced in January. At the close TSB shares were 2 easier at 185p. TI Group was firmer in an overall weaker market, with sentiment buoyed after several recent presentations by the company. The stock closed 6 up at 306p. International news and information organisation Reuters Holdings was firmer in early trading after the chairman said that at current exchange rates he expected a double-digit revenue increase. However, the shares were unable to hold out against the weaker market and closed 10 lower at 1256p. Buying ahead of today's first-quarter results helped ICI shares to end the session a net 13 higher at 1247p. Leading pharmaceuticals shares continued their US-prompted rise yesterday, although Glaxo suffered from competition worries in spite of some late good news. Glaxo shares were lifted 6 at best but reports that Merck, the world's biggest pharmaceuticals group, is working on a new asthma drug and a migraine treatment dented sentiment. Later news that the pill version of Glaxo's Zofran treatment was now available in the US failed to help the recovery as it merely confirmed an announcement made in the new year. The shares closed 7 down at 587p. However, Wellcome appreciated 12 to 735p and SmithKline Beecham 'A' ended the day 7 1/2 higher at 468p. Epwin Group, the replacement windows and doors manufacturer, raced up to 238p before settling a net 14 ahead at 225p, as the market continued to rerate the shares. The company announced good figures two weeks ago and spiced the results with news that turnover during the first quarter of the current year was up around 10 per cent. Jupiter Tyndall, the financial services group, held at 158p as Smith New Court, the integrated securities house, placed a 24 per cent stake in the company - some 8.3m shares - with a number of institutions at 156p. The stake was sold by Mercury Asset Management, which inherited the shares as a result of the merger of Jupiter and Tyndall in October 1991. Mercury was prevented from selling the shares in a single block because of Bank of England regulations. Jupiter Tyndall was among the market's most active stocks, with turnover, boosted by double counting of the Mercury placing, reaching 17m shares. A bearish note on the power generators issued by Credit Lyonnais Laing, plus a number of switch stories, notably from James Capel, who was said to have told clients to shift from PowerGen to National Power, put substantial pressure on the sector. The latter declined 6 to 327p on 4.1m traded and PowerGen lost 9 to 335p on 1.7m. Credit Lyonnais's utilities team said the prospect of two to three years of fast dividend growth after a good outcome to the deal with British Coal had pushed the shares up too sharply. 'The yield is now demanding in relation to the market and the electricity stocks and we think the good news is now all in the price,' said the CLL team. Textile spinner Shiloh rose 9 to 103p on higher full year profits and an improved dividend. Share buying by directors was said to be behind a 10 per cent rise for Hopkinsons, the industrial valve and hydraulic equipment maker, which was 4 ahead at 44p.</p>

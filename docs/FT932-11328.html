			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / American boost helps lift Jaguar output 56% JAGUAR, the UK luxury carmaker, has increased production by 56 per cent in the first four months of the year, helped by a recovery in demand in the US, its single biggest market. Jaguar sales in the US rose by 22 per cent last month to 1,011. Its US sales in the first four months of the year at 3,572 were 27 per cent higher than a year ago. The company said yesterday that its sales in the US had been boosted by the offer to buyers to return cars within 30 days if they were not satisfied. The recovery in sales in the US and in some other markets such as the UK and Germany has allowed Jaguar to increase production to 9,953 in the first four months from 6,391 in the same period a year ago. The higher production has been achieved by a much smaller workforce with the number of hourly paid manufacturing employees cut by nearly a quarter in the last year to 3,119 by the end of last month from 4,078 a year ago. However, Jaguar, a subsidiary of Ford of the US, is still struggling to overcome heavy losses. In the first quarter of this year it cut its pre-tax loss - under UK accounting rules - by 27 per cent to Pounds 28.6m from a loss of Pounds 39.4m in the same period a year ago. Jaguar's wholesale deliveries worldwide in the first three months rose to 6,284 from 5,164 a year earlier. Its sales to customers in the first quarter rose by 16 per cent year-on-year to 6,374, helped by a 29 per cent rise in the US to 2,561 and increases in Germany, Switzerland, the UK and Belgium.</p>

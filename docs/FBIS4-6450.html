			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sandra S. Aguinaldo] </F>   [Text] The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa-Soldiers  of the Filipino People-Young Officers Union (RAM-SFP-YOU)  yesterday voiced support for newly appointed Armed Forces Chief  of Staff Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile, saying he is "better than most"  officials.    Cashiered Army Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan, Capt. Danilo Lim,  Lt. Col. Jake Malajacan, and Navy Capt. Proceso Maligalig said  Mr. Enrile was a good replacement for Gen. Lisandro Abadia.    The former army chief assumed the post the other day in a  turnover ceremony attended by President Ramos, Vice President  Joseph Estrada, and former President Corazon Aquino. At the  command conference held immediately after the formal turnover of  duties, Mr. Enrile said he gave orders on how to enhance  "professionalism and unity" in the military ranks.    With a new batch of promoted officers set to assume roles in  the armed forces following the retirement of 19 generals this  year and the attrition of at least 42 younger officers, the  RAM-SFP-YOU urged soldiers to "reinvent themselves by going to  the lower rank and file and make unpopular decisions that could  make a difference in the future."    "If Mr. Enrile can make unpopular decisions, then we will be  very happy," Mr. Honasan said.    The reform group also said it was "beyond Mr. Abadia" to  determine if factionalism still exists in the military  organization.    Last Tuesday, Mr. Abadia included the unification of the  Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) as one of his achievements  as chief of staff for the last three years.    The president also said the military is now more unified and  professional because of Mr. Abadia's efforts.    Mr. Lim, spokesperson of the RAM-SFP-YOU, said Mr. Ramos  might be referring to other groups when he said the age of  "adventurism" is over. "We are not mere adventurists, that is  why we are still here. Maybe the president was not referring to  us." he said.    At the same time, Mr. Maligalig said the government panel  headed by Prof. Alfredo Tadiar is "in constant touch with the  group (RAM)." He added, both panels are now in the process of  exchanging position papers. The committees on electoral  reforms, military reforms, economic reforms, social justice, and  good government maintain open communication, he said.    In another development, Jose Maria Sison, head of the  central  committee of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), has  expressed support to the decision of the Melito Glor Command  headed by Gregorio "Ka [Comrade] Roger" Rosal to execute  Leopoldo Mabilangan, as the former leader of the Banahaw Command  was "afforded due process under the justice system of the  people's revolutionary government."    Mr. Rosal recently said a "people's court" found Mr.  Mabilangan guilty of crimes punishable by death and that he was  invited to attend proceedings several times last year.    In a faxed statement, Mr. Sison also said the Melito Glor  Command has the authority to "take the necessary action when  confronted with any hostile subject who is armed and dangerous."    "Mabilangan was clearly an armed agent of the Ramos regime  and the reactionary armed forces," Mr. Sison said, in an attempt  to justify the killing of the former NPA [New People's Army]  leader who openly voiced out support to the government's amnesty  program.    Mr. Mabilangan was killed noon of Easter Sunday in front of  Sto. Tomas Church in Batangas. He was buried yesterday by  thousands of followers. No untoward incident occurred even as  police investigators have yet to make concrete progress in  arresting his assailants.</p>

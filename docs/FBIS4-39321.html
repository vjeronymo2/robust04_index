			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vitaliy Denisov and Aleksandr Pelts report: "Deputies </F> Refused To Send Peacemakers Immediately. However, Vice Premier  Sergey Shakhray Believes This Is Essential"]    [Text] The Federation Council debate over the immediate  introduction of Russian peacemaking forces into the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone was pretty stormy. Even after  deputies had been addressed by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister  Boris Pastukhov, they were unable to adopt a decision and  continued the discussion "behind closed doors." Ultimately the  parliamentarians backed the viewpoint put forward by Petr  Shirshov, chairman of the Federation Council Committee for  Security and Defense Issues, who believes that the president's  appeal for the immediate introduction of peacemakers into the  conflict zone lacks an adequate legal base. Petr Shirshov said  that the Federation Council does not have the requisite  documents to enable it to approve the introduction of Russian  peacemakers there.    Despite this, Russian servicemen's participation in settling  the conflict is rather the question of the day. Russia has to  send peacemakers into the conflict zone. That was the opinion  voiced by Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray. He believes that lack  of information, notably about the sources of funding for these  forces, was the reason why the Federation Council deputies were  unable to adopt a decision regarding the introduction of troops.  "The executive and the legislature must work on this question  together," Shakhray stressed during a conversation with a RIA  correspondent.    The Georgian Defense Ministry press service reported that  during the night of 2 June Abkhazian formations breached the  cease-fire agreement by firing artillery shells at Georgian  positions in the Dalskoye Gorge for 40 minutes. The Georgians  refrained from retaliating.    Meanwhile, the Abkhazian Defense Ministry reported that for  two days now Georgian formations have been methodically  bombarding Abkhazian positions in the Kodor Gorge with all  manner of automatic weapons.    It is worthy of note that mutual accusations are being  exchanged ahead of the adoption of a definitive decision  regarding the introduction of CIS peacemaking forces into the  conflict zone. Experts and observers think that each side is  thus trying to create a certain image that will enable it in the  future to actively influence the essence and substance of the  peacemaking mission in Abkhazia.</p>

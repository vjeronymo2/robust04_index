			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Books: Gospel according to Fra Angelico FRA ANGELICO AT SAN MARCO by Wiliam Hood Yale Pounds 45, 338 pages THIS exceptionally beautiful book describes the corporate mentality in early 15th-century Florence. It reminds us that Fra Angelico was not simply a Florentine painter who applied a fresh and highly expressive pictorial language to traditional religious scenes. Fra Angelico was a member of the Observant Dominicans, which meant that from his mid-twenties he was a wholly committed, corporate man. The take-over of San Marco in Florence represented a signal triumph for the 30-year-old Observant or reformed Dominicans. The Observant programme was to recapture the original fervour of St Dominic's mendicant preachers, established in 1216 to save fellow-Christians from heresy. However, begging in the streets was hard to square with a life of study and contemplation. Finally, the Observants followed the unreformed Conventuals in opting for a more genteel form of begging: fund-raising. It was Cosimo de' Medici, patron of San Marco, who paid for Fra Angelico's paintings. One theme explored in this rich book is the tension between Medici patronage and the vow of poverty. Cosimo's clout was irresistible. At San Marco he had his own room and even, it would appear, his own chapel. Saints Cosmos and Damian, his patron saints, had to occupy a dramatic position in the great altarpiece. But that was the limit of Medici propaganda. Away from the church were paintings intended mainly, and in the dormitory exclusively, for the friars' eyes. Here the Observant message rang out uncompromised. But who decided what Fra Angelico painted, and who approved the sometimes radical departure from traditional subject-matter? Hood argues that Fra Angelico was not merely illustrating texts by the famous Prior Antonine (later canonized) and other Dominicans. His suggestion is that here at San Marco, the artist-friar was able to make his own choices and decisions. Fra Angelico at San Marco is a superbly evocative picture of the lives of its inmates and the role played by images seen a thousand times. Our understanding of these paintings is lastingly deepened by descriptions which relate the image to the liturgy and to meditational literature. The friar in his icy cell on a February morning, preparing a sermon for the feast of the Purification of the Virgin, would have known the gospel passage by heart. Learned commentaries were on hand in the library (given by Cosimo). Just along the corridor was the 'angelic' painter's own interpretation of the traditional image for the feastday, the 'Presentation in the Temple'. St Peter Martyr is there, kneeling in meditation, showing that this is not a narrative scene but a reminder of the Dominican mission. Looking at the priest Simeon, with the swaddled Christ child in his arms, the friar's lips would have murmured Simeon's grateful words, the Nunc Dimittis, 'Lord, now lettest then thy servant depart in peace'. These were the words which friars recited every night of their lives at compline. We will probably never know whether it was indeed Fra Angelico who chose what to paint for San Marco. It seems likely that it was Prior Antonine who ruled that, away from Cosimo's eyes, the artist should avoid expensive pigments. If Fra Angelico was an artist before he was a friar, then perhaps he resented being deprived free use of lapis lazuli and other expensive pigments. But if, as this book suggests, he was first and foremost a corporate man, then he would have willingly acquiesced. His talent, itself a gift from God, could more than compensate.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 11 Mar -- Russian and the G-7 countries plan  to adopt a common political declaration at the Naples meeting in  July of the leaders of the seven leading industrial countries of  the world, in which Russian President Boris Yeltsin is again to  take part. This was stated by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister  Sergey Lavrov, who is here in Tokyo, in an interview to an  ITAR-TASS correspondent. "The adoption of a joint declaration  by the G-7 countries and Russia marks in effect the  transformation of the Group of Seven into a "political eight,"  he said.    The deputy minister said that even before the previous  meeting of the G-7 leaders in Tokyo last summer, Moscow proposed  that Russia participate fully in the political part of the  discussions at the meeting and that a common "declaration of the  eight leaders" be adopted on its results. However, because  there was not enough time to prepare a new formula for Russian  participation in the G-7 conference, it was decided to turn down  this plan.    "This time, however, prior to the Naples meeting, Russia  submitted this proposal in good time, and it has has been  supported on the whole by the G-7 countries; we hope that the  Naples conference will be a step forward compared with the  previous meetings of President Boris Yeltsin and the G-7 leaders  and will demonstrate the readiness of the G-7 and Russia to  cooperate in resolving international political problems as a  Group of Eight," Sergey Lavrov said. He stressed: "We believe  that Russia, as one of the world's leading powers, without whose  participation it is difficult to resolve many international  problems, should be more actively drawn into the activity of the  G-7 than it is at present."    The deputy head of the Russian Foreign Ministry pointed out  that it was a question of closer cooperation between Russia and  the G-7 exclusively in the sphere of politics. In the sphere of  economics, Russia, which is now implementing economic reforms,  is hardly ready to become a full participant in the work of the  Group of Seven. "But in the political sphere, closer cooperation  between us is quite possible," Sergey Lavrov said. "The  political declaration adopted at the meeting of the G-7 leaders  in Tokyo, for example, does not contain a single question that  would not be of direct interest to Russia and in whose tackling  our country in one way or another would not be involved."</p>

Strasser. Presenting  the envoys to the head of state, the secretary of state,  finance, Dr. John Karimu, recalled that the joint World Bank and  IMF team arrived in the country two weeks ago to assess and  review the country's economic performance.    Responding, the IMF representative, Mr. Mike Novak,  expressed  satisfaction and informed the chairman that the economic  performance and development targets of the country are right on  track. He observed that within 18 months the NPRC government  had reduced the inflation rate from 118 percent to less than 20  percent -- a performance that has not been achieved by any  developed economy. While noting that there is now an abundant  supply of essential commodities and an absence of black  marketeering, the envoy said the release of political detainees  and the transition to democratic governing were vivid  manifestation of government's tough and courageous measure to  make sure that the targets of the structural adjustment program  were on track.    Mr. Mike Novak expressed the hope that the rebel war would  come to a steady conclusion so that military expenditure would  be redirected to the purchase of civilian goods and other  economic development programs. He assured Chairman Strasser  that at the next conference of donors in Paris, France, Sierra  Leone will be given positive consideration because of the  country's present economic performance.</p>

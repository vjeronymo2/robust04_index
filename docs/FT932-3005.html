			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Manweb staying close to basics MANWEB, the electricity company which distributes in Liverpool and North Wales, yesterday re-affirmed its strategy of concentrating on its basic businesses as it announced a 15 per cent increase in dividends. Acknowledging pressure from some City sources to use its low gearing to diversify, Mr John Roberts, chief executive, said: 'We want to stay close to the core. We will resist the temptation to take on businesses we cannot manage sensibly.' Manweb is the only one of the 12 regional electricity companies which is not involved in building combined cycle gas stations. The total dividend increase from 18.25p to 21p for the year ended March 31 1993 was the latest in a series of double figure percentage rises among electricity companies. It was achieved on profits before tax of Pounds 111.2m, up 17 per cent on the previous Pounds 94.7m. Turnover was Pounds 919.9m (Pounds 834.6m). Earnings per share rose 18 per cent to 69.3p (58.7p). The final dividend is 14.9p. Although distribution, the main earner, saw profits fall from Pounds 106.3m to Pounds 101.4m, supply turned a Pounds 5.3m loss into a Pounds 6.9m profit and retailing converted a Pounds 2.1m loss into a Pounds 500,000 profit. On the supply side, Manweb won back the custom of 38 local large consumers who chose in previous years to contract with other regional electricity companies after the liberalisation of the market for users of more than 1MW. It also won the custom of 18 new customers outside the region. Mr John Astall, finance director, indicated the company had less to lose than other regional electricity companies from the further liberalisation of the market next year. He said only 9.5 per cent of its customers were in the section of the market where competition is being introduced (between 100kW and 1MW), whereas the regional electricity companies average was 15.5 per cent. The company's drive to cut staff has slowed, with only 100 jobs shed in the last year. However, it said profit per employee had improved by 15 per cent to Pounds 24,000 during the year. Manweb already claims to have reduced staff by more than other regional electricity companies, with the total in the business now 4,350. Of these 3,465 are in the core business, a 25 per cent reduction on when the company was privatised. The company plans to invest Pounds 12.5m on a network management system which will monitor transmission equipment and switchgear automatically. It expects to save Pounds 3m to Pounds 3.5m a year when the system is fully running. Mr Bryan Weston, chairman, said the annual report would show that executive salaries rose by about the cost of living for the year just ended. The pay bill for all staff will rise by about 3.5 per cent as result of a deal being considered by union members. The basic increase is 2.85 per cent, but the pay and reward system is also being restructured.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): A role-play revolution - A Japanese businessman has found that a western approach to motivation has helped deliver spectacular results Tetsuo Mizuno has some advice for fellow businessmen struggling to find ways to make their companies more competitive. Don't follow conventional Japanese ways. Mizuno heads Square, a small video game software house in Tokyo that, in spite of the recession, has seen phenomenal sales of its role-playing games for Nintendo's electronic game hardware. Three out of four games it released last year were hits, selling more than 1m per game. The unprecedented craze for Square's games prompted children and parents to line up outside toy shops, hours before the sixth in its best-selling series reached the shelves last April. The game sold out within hours, and Square posted sales of Y25bn (Pounds 160.7m) in a month - almost equal to what it achieved during the whole of last year. The company's break from traditional Japanese management of its employees appears to have been a factor in its ability to develop popular computer games. Its unconventional hiring policy is one of the underlying factors in its creative strength. While most leading companies may be losing out on talent by limiting themselves to hiring university graduates, especially from top class schools, Square hires anyone as long as they are inventive and are competent. Some 80 per cent of Square's staff have held other jobs, including teaching, playing in rock bands and acting. Other striking differences are the flexible working hours and the extensive holiday allocation. 'Our business is entertainment. How can people have fun playing games made by workers who commute on a crowded train, wear blue suits and are constantly told what to do by their superiors,' asks Mizuno. Employees must touch base once a day, but as long as they are productive, do not need to keep set office hours. Long holidays are rare in Japanese companies, which usually only allow employees to take one week off in the summer. Workers may be given a certain amount of paid annual holiday, but they are not really expected to take them. Employees at Square, however, get one month's summer holiday, and an additional 20 days of paid holiday a year. The company encourages employees to travel, especially abroad, and from the second year in the company they can apply for special overseas trips. Mizuno says he wants his employees to enjoy life and to experience different cultures in other countries. 'Our games are based on adventures in castles, forests and caves. We want our staff to go and see what these places are really like with their own eyes,' he says. Square evaluates its employees by mixing the western merit approach and the Japanese life-time employment system. While those who help to create a popular game will be compensated, those that have not contributed see a pay rise equal to the cost of inflation. The salary difference between employees who entered the company in the same year can amount to Y4m-Y5m. By providing incentives, the company attempts to increase productivity and morale. Says Mizuno: 'You need to ask what people want to be doing in five years. How much they want to be earning, where they want to be living. If workers calculate backwards from such goals, it's clear what they need to do.' The company, which employs 250 staff, started as a software division of Denyusha, an electrical engineering company based in Tokushima in western Japan. However, the acute differences in management styles between the traditional Japanese engineering company and its almost radical computer game division prompted the company to split in two, forming a separate company based in Tokyo. It is uncertain whether Square can preserve such a flexible management style once it grows into a bigger organisation. Mizuno doubts that it will become too big, because of the cost of games software. A computer game costs about Y10,000 and consumers seem willing to spend about Y40,000 to Y50,000 a year on games. He says the chances of the company growing larger than 400 people is slim. One problem that the company's management has yet to solve is that its role-playing games have failed to cross the cultural barriers, and have not seen good sales in Europe or the US. 'I think we need more people who are multilingual, who know what's interesting for everyone all over the world. We need to start making games like Steven Spielberg films,' says Mizuno.</p>

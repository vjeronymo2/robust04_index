			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TRIBUTE TO LEONE  </P> <P> In 1969, when I was 17, I saw "Once Upon a Time in the West" during a vacation  in Las Vegas. Sergio Leone was my favorite director, and I was pleased to have  an opportunity to see his latest film before it opened in Los Angeles.  </P> <P>  The movie, 165 minutes long, was a masterpiece.  </P> <P> Later I saw the motion picture in Los Angeles. I was shocked to find that it  had been cut to 140 minutes.  </P> <P> Lionel Stander's role was gone even though he still appeared in the credits,  and Jason Robards' death scene was removed even though Charles Bronson was  shown carrying someone's body on the horse behind him in the end credits.  </P> <P> When the film arrived on television the edited scenes were restored. Only  recently has the film played uncut theatrically.  </P> <P> The death of Sergio Leone recently brought back this memory. I am pleased that  this film and "Once Upon a Time in America," which had suffered a similar fate,  were restored and fully appreciated during his lifetime.  </P> <P> As the years go by I have no doubt that Leone will be listed among the great  directors, even though he made only six films in 20 years. Art and appreciation  both take time.  </P> <P> ED HASELWOOD  </P> <P> Alhambra  </P></p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Unions give more workplace briefings The number of large companies which use unions to communicate with their employees appears to be rising after a sharp fall in the late 1980s, says a survey, David Goodhart writes. About 60 per cent of 375 of Britain's biggest companies questioned last month by Vista, an employee communications consultancy, said they used unions to brief staff. The latest percentage compares with 53 per cent in a 1989 survey based on a broadly similar sample, which was itself sharply down from 62 per cent in 1985. Most employee communications experts are highly critical of managers who rely on unions or noticeboards to talk to employees. Mr Peter Walker, head of Vista Communications, is a critic. 'This shows the failure of British managers to take full responsibility for briefing their own staff direct,' he said. 'In our view, union representatives are there to represent their members and are not good at passing on management messages.' Vista Communications, 48 Harbut Road, London SW11 2RB. 071-924 7389.</p>

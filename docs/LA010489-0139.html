			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> SWEDISH DAVIS CUP LEADER QUITS AFTER DEFEAT BY GERMANS  </P> <P> Swedish Davis Cup captain Hans Olsson announced today he was quitting after  Sweden, boasting two of the world's top-ranked players, lost to West Germany in  the cup final last month.  </P> <P> Olsson, the nonplaying captain who led Sweden to three Davis Cup titles since  1984, was replaced by John-Anders (Jonte) Sjogren.  </P> <P> Olsson cited time pressures and his unwillingness to travel with the team as  his reason for stepping down.  </P> <P> Sjogren coaches Mats Wilander, winner of last year's Australian, French and  U.S. Opens.  </P> <P> Olsson came under fierce criticism after the Davis Cup team, led by Wilander  and 1988 Wimbledon winner Stefan Edberg, lost 4-1 on indoor clay at home in  Goteborg to a powerful German squad headed by Boris Becker.  </P></p>

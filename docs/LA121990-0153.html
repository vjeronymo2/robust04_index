			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SALE OF MCCARTNEY BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS INVESTIGATED  </P> <P> State and local officials confirmed they are investigating whether the $18,000  auction sale of ex-Beatle Paul McCartney's birth certificate was faked to  inflate the document's value.  </P> <P> Officials of the state Licensing and Regulation Department and the Harris  County district attorney's office said Tuesday that the allegations made by the  auction's promoter, Cheryl Bean, could lead to charges of deceptive business  practices.  </P> <P> The birth certificate -- the legitimacy of which has not been questioned -- was  put up for sale last month by Marshall Terrell, who bought it from McCartney's  stepmother, Angela Williams, according to a bill of sale provided by Bean.  McCartney was not involved in the sale.  </P> <P> Bean accused Terrell, buyer Brian Taylor, auctioneer Ray Simpson and Phoebe  Moody, who took the certificate to Simpson on Terrell's behalf, of faking the  sale.  </P> <P> "Now when Marshall and them want to sell it, they can say, 'Well, gee, it sold  for $18,000 in Houston,' and get a lot more for it later," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: ERM pressures increase PRESSURE on the European exchange rate mechanism built up yesterday as financial markets scented blood and hit the French and Belgian francs, writes Peter John. Anger by speculators at the refusal by the former core currencies of the ERM to cut their interest rates was intensified by a half-point easing from the Bank of Spain. There was also an easier tone in Denmark where some rates were brought down to the 8.5 per cent level of the seven-day CD which was set on Monday. The Belgian National Bank had elicited the help of the US Federal Reserve during overnight dealing and dealers said the Fed bought between DM10m and DM15m before Europe opened. Nevertheless the Belgian currency slipped below BFr22 against the German currency soon after European markets opened and the Belgian National Bank was forced to intervene sporadically throughout the day. The market remains convinced that short-term rates of around 10 per cent are unsustainably high for a country that has inflation of only 2.8 per cent. Mr Adrian Cunningham, an economist at UBS said: 'The view in the market seems to be that the Belgians are not going to be able to sustain the BFr22 level through intervening without also using the weapon of higher interest rates.' The sell-off spilled over into the French franc which reached lows unseen since shortly after the August ERM crisis which forced a widening of currency fluctuation bands to 15 per cent. The French currency tumbled to FFr3.5425 against the D-Mark in intraday trading. That was just down from its lowest point for more than 12 months - FFr3.5422 - which was reached on August 16. It recovered in late trading to close at FFr3.5300, down from FFr3.5290 previously. However, there was little sense of relief. One trader said: 'Today's moves are consistent with the gradual weakening of the former ERM core members.' The Bank of Spain's decision to reduce its key money rate by half a percentage point to 9.5 per cent helped the Spanish peseta even though a rate cut would normally tend to weaken a currency. The Spanish currency closed at Pta80.96 against the D-Mark, stronger than Pta81.29 previously. The US dollar picked up smartly on the knock-on effect of a big trade in Australian dollars and Japanese Yen. One investor sold Yen very heavily to buy Australian dollars. This was followed by active dealing in the cross and the subsequent weakness of the yen saw it fall to Y107.45 against the US currency, down from Y106 previously. That boost for the dollar helped it to pick up against the D-Mark and pound. It closed up at DM1.6140 against DM1.6035 and at Dollars 1.5130 to the pound against Dollars 1.5225. Sterling was dull in spite of relatively encouraging news on employment.</p>

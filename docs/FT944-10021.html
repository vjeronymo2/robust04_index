			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Bond futures decline pulls Dow lower Wall Street US share prices dropped in moderate trading yesterday following declines in bond futures prices, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 20.52 at 3801.47. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 declined 2.00 at 462.35, while the American Stock Exchange composite shed 1.55 to 448.04 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 2.27 to 762.11. Volume on the NYSE came to 218m shares. Volume was light, partly because the bond market was closed for the Veterans Day holiday, but a decline in the December bond future contract pulled down share prices. Also holding down volume was skittishness in advance of next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee at which the Fed is expected to boost its target interest rate by at least 50 basis points. Shares in major cyclical stocks declined with the market. Caterpillar fell Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 57 1/2 , and Dow Chemical lost Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 67 3/4 . Biotech stocks surged on news that a major pharmaceutical company was in discussions to purchase a 'substantial minority equity investment' in the biotech group, Chiron. Chiron, which is traded on the Nasdaq, rocketed more than Dollars 19 before falling back to end with a gain of Dollars 11 3/4 at Dollars 71 1/2 , Genentech was up Dollars 1 at Dollars 47 1/2 , Amgen Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 58, Cellpro Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 15 1/2 and Biogen Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 39 7/8 . Some major US technology stocks were stronger: IBM by Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 72 1/2 and Digital Equipment Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 30 7/8 . Hewlett-Packard ended down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 97 5/8 . PepsiCo gained Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 36 7/8 after several analysts upgraded the shares, based on a management change in the company's restaurant division. Shares of Telefonos de Mexico, which lost Dollars 4 3/4 on Thursday following news that it would face direct competition from AT&amp;T, regained some lost territory after a James Capel analyst rated the shares a 'buy' and said it could handle the competition. By the close Telmex ADRs were up Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 53 1/2 . Canada Investors remained nervous over interest rates taking Canadian stocks lower in a listless session. The TSE 300 composite index dropped 8.51 to 4170.68, a fall of 28 points on the week. Volume of shares at 26.78m were down sharply from yesterday's 51.47m. Newbridge Networks gained more ground, adding CDollars 1 3/4 to CDollars 44 1/8 . The stock made big gains earlier in the week following news of its strategic alliance with Hewlett Packard. Transportation, metal, paper and pipeline stocks made small gains. Mexico Mexican equities were slightly higher at the close as Telmex, the telecommunications group, recovered from its two-day fall of more than 9 per cent, writes Ted Bardacke in Mexico City. The IPC index ended 34.67 or 1.39 per cent, at 2,526.99, about 5 points off its session high. Telmex L shares were up 2.25 per cent and the A shares gained 0.67 per cent. Analysts said that some investors saw the fall in Telmex as having been overdone. The sell-off occurred following warnings from most major New York brokers who downgraded the stock on news that the group had lost out on its bid to reach an agreement with AT &amp; T to offer long distance telephone services. Brokers commented that there was strong buying of Telmex by domestic investors who were more bullish about its short-term earnings, as well as the company's prospects when Mexico's telecommunications market is opened to competition in 1997.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Beijing swift to show its displeasure China's reaction to the passage of the partial electoral reform bill through Hong Kong's Legislative Council was fast and furious. Accusing Britain of slamming the door on further negotiations over Hong Kong, Beijing said it would sack representative bodies elected in the last days of British rule, giving the clearest indication of actions planned when it resumes control of Hong Kong at midnight on 30 June, 1997. Britain had 'completely' closed the door on further meetings; 'The British side should be held fully responsible for ruining the talks,' the official statement said. Previously, China had said it was willing to resume discussions if Governor Chris Patten withdrew his reform bill, but repeatedly warned passage of the bill would lead to a complete breakdown of negotiations. 'As component parts of the British political body administering Hong Kong', elected bodies including the Legislative Council would 'definitely be terminated' in 1997. It complained about Mr Patten's plans to introduce a more substantial bill to LegCo today, including remaining elements of his reform package. Beijing was further angered by Britain's decision to make public the contents of its 17 rounds of secret talks on the Hong Kong issue. Mr Patten's second and more radical bill, due to be published today, aims further to extend democracy in Hong Kong by broadening the franchise for representative institutions such as Legco. Beijing claims these measures contradict prior Sino-British agreements on Hong Kong's transition to Chinese rule enshrined in the Joint Declaration of 1984 and the 1990 Basic Law, or colony's post-1997 constitution. China's critics say it fears the development of independent-spirited democratic institutions in Hong Kong because they might serve as a model for mainland democracy activists after 1997. China is now likely to step up its own preparations for assuming control of Hong Kong, and in the process seek to undermine Mr Patten's authority in the last years of British rule. UK-China talks on practical issues such as the financing of a much-needed new airport have bogged down because of deteriorating Sino-British political relations. In its statement, China referred to a new 'political body of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region' that would replace LegCo. Exactly when this would occur was not clear. Beijing has been exerting pressure on Hong Kong Chinese involved in the debate over the colony's future. It has repeatedly accused Mr Patten of seeking to perpetuate UK colonial interests.</p>

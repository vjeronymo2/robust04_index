			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Focus remains on the short end with issues worth Dollars 800m The short end of the eurodollar sector remained in focus yesterday with the launch of four issues worth a total of Dollars 800m. They followed the successful short-dated offering last week by AT&amp;T. Dealers said yesterday's deals provided the issuers with good opportunities to swap into other currencies and appealed in particular to Swiss retail investors who were overweight in the US currency. 'It's an arbitrage play and as long as swap spreads remain at these levels this part of the yield curve will remain attractive,' said one dealer. The best reception was given to the Dollars 250m offering of three-year paper by Australia's Export Finance and Insurance Corp (Efic). Traders said the yield spread of 20 basis points above the equivalent Treasuries was a reasonable reflection of the group's double-A rating, although some suggested that the name was not sufficiently well-known to attract substantial demand. ABB Finance raised Dollars 200m of debt with a similar maturity and coupon as Efic and book-runner Goldman Sachs priced it to yield 16 basis points above Treasuries. It was also targeted at Swiss investors but rivals claimed it was priced too aggressively and the electrical engineering group did not have the appeal of big US and Japanese corporate names such as Toyota, GECC and AT&amp;T. The Dollars 200m three-year issue from Landesbank Schleswig Holstein, priced to yield 20 basis points over Treasuries, was also treated with some scepticism. But BZW, which lead-managed the issue, said the pricing was sufficiently generous, considering that the yield on AT&amp;T's deal was now five basis points below Treasuries. It added that although the spread had widened to 23 basis points, LB Schleswig Holstein was the most highly-rated of the day's three biggest dollar issuers. Finally, the Council of Europe offered Dollars 150m of two-year bonds and Rabobank Nederland offered CDollars 100m of three-year debt. There was also a flurry of yen-denominated issues yesterday with Mitsubishi Estate, the property arm of the Japanese trading group, topping the list with an offering of Y35m of six-year debt and Y20bn of eight-year paper. Both issues were targeted at Japanese institutions. In Japan, Mitsubishi Corporation, the country's biggest trading house, raised Y200bn in five-year bonds, the largest domestic bond issue of its kind, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. The issue topped the previous record, a Y150bn issue by Tokyo Electric Power, and will give a boost to Japan's fledgling corporate bond market which has been struggling to free itself from regulation. Over the past year, the market has been opened to a wider range of issuers and restrictions on floating-rate notes have been lifted.</p>

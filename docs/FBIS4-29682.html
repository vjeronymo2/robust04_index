			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First in three-part series entitled: "Moves Are Afoot To </F> Streamline and Integrate U.S. Military Bases on Okinawa": "Naha  Military Port"]    [Text] Naha Military Port, Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, and  live-firing exercises across the prefectural highway are three  major issues involving U.S. Forces on Okinawa and they symbolize  the problems arising from having U.S. military bases here. The  U.S. side, which calls the three major issues the Big Three, has  asked the Japanese Government to come up with ways to relocate,  streamline, and integrate U.S. military bases on Okinawa. The  Japanese Government, which has so far entrusted the U.S. side  with the power to handle the relocation, streamlining, and  integration of the U.S. bases, is being pressed to coordinate  the views of Okinawan residents in areas where some U.S.  military bases are relocated; and to study ways to secure the  cost of relocating U.S. artillery units on Okinawa. The  Japanese Government has yet to give the United States a clear  answer. Burdened with the U.S. military bases, Okinawa is about  to greet the 50th anniversary of the end of the Pacific War.  When pleading directly to the U.S. Government, Prefectural  Governor Ota has asked them to resolve the three major issues,  among other things. The OKINAWA TIMES has filed urgent reports  on the intentions of both Japan and the United States, who have  begun moving toward settling the three major issues as a  priority matter, and the Okinawa Prefectural Government's  response to such moves.    In U.S.-Japan security talks in 1974 -- two years after  Okinawa's reversal to Japanese rule -- the two sides agreed that  Naha Military Port would be returned on condition that an  alternative site was provided by Japan. The temporary use of  the military port by U.S. Forces on Okinawa has continued for 20  years after the agreement was reached between Japan and the  United States; 75 percent of U.S. military installations in  Japan are concentrated on Okinawa. It has been said that the  "agreement is irrational" because it conditions the return of  the military port on its relocation in Okinawa, one- fifth of  which is occupied by U.S. military bases.    A relocation proposal put forth by the U.S. Forces on  Okinawa  to the Japanese Government is that an area inside Makiminato  Supply Depot be used as the site for a new military port and the  supply depot be located to a coastal area. The coastal area of  Makiminato, Urasoe City is now under development and the  relocation proposal is that a berth be established along the  coastal area and linked to the supply depot by road.    If Naha Military Port is relocated to the area inside  Makiminato Supply Depot, the current military port located at  the gate to Okinawa will disappear and the new military port  will be half the size of Naha Military Port. The merits of Naha  Military Port's relocation are great. The new military port  will be located near the capital of Okinawa and in a western  coastal development area which will become a key area for future  industrial development on Okinawa. It still remains uncertain  whether Urasoe City will accept the proposal to relocate Naha  Military Port to an area under its jurisdiction. The relocation  of Naha Military Port is expected to go through many twists and  turns.    The relocation and scaling back of Naha Military Port is  taken as an indication of certain headway in Okinawa's  interests. A high- level political judgment is required,  however, to have Naha Military Port completely withdrawn from  Okinawa. Prefectural Governor Ota has asserted: "The U.S.  military bases on Okinawa should be streamlined or integrated by  relocating them across Japan, and the Japanese should bear the  burden of their country's security equitably." The prevailing  view is that his assertion will be hard to realize.    Kosuke Uehara, former director general of the Okinawa  Development Agency, has persisted in his view: "It is necessary  to take a realistic approach; no headway can be made without  such an approach in resolving problems arising from U.S.  military bases on Okinawa." Some Okinawans take the view that it  is necessary to study ways to break the status quo by relocating  and integrating U.S. military bases within Okinawa.    If some U.S. military bases are relocated on condition that  alternative sites are provided on Okinawa, like Naha Military  Port, this will pressure the Okinawans to make decisions that  may entail some pain.</p>

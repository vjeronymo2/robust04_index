			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. HOSPITALS TREAT SOVIET QUAKE CASES;  </P> <P> 14 CHILDREN ARE FLOWN HERE FOR ADVANCED CARE  </P> <P> The two teen-agers spend their days glued to a video game screen in their room  at Centinela Hospital Medical Center. Having arrived in the United States for  medical treatment only last week from Soviet Armenia, they have just become  acquainted with the game. And like teen-agers everywhere, they find it  irresistible.  </P> <P> The boys are among 14 youngsters flown to Los Angeles to receive medical  treatment for injuries suffered in the devastating December earthquake that  leveled towns in their native land, killing at least 55,000 and leaving 500,000  homeless.  </P> <P> Los Angeles is a long way from home, especially for the boys who have never  heard of Disneyland or Hollywood. Only Michael Jackson's name brought a smile  of recognition to their faces.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Main Concern  </P> <P> Tigran Chobanian, 14, who is scheduled for leg surgery this week, said he would  like to see a bit of the city before returning home. But like the other  youngsters, Tigran added that his main concern was getting well and returning  to his family. He and his immediate family were among the lucky 10% to survive  the quake that destroyed their hometown of Spitak.  </P> <P> "Many of my relatives were killed," he said through a translator.  </P> <P> The magnitude of the loss among others in the group was even greater. A  3-year-old girl, whose legs have been amputated, traveled to the United States  accompanied by her grandmother -- one of her few surviving family members. They  lost 76 relatives in the quake, according to a doctor who had spoken with them.  </P> <P> According to hospital staff members, most of the children, ranging in ages from  2 to 16, have adjusted well to their new surroundings.  </P> <P> "When they first arrived last week, they were very scared," said Julius Mason,  a spokesman for Centinela Hospital. "But they've since opened up, are  communicative and lively."  </P> <P> About half of the children are undergoing surgery this week at Centinela to fix  broken bones that have not healed correctly. Most of the others, receiving care  at Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children, have had limbs amputated and need  to be fitted with artificial ones.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Donating Services  </P> <P> One 2-year-old and her father are guests at the home of a Los Angeles plastic  surgeon, who is also donating his professional services to the youngster who  suffered extensive facial injuries in the quake.  </P> <P> The children are the first group of earthquake victims from Soviet Armenia to  come to the West Coast for treatment. About 50 other victims have been treated  in the United States, most of them at East Coast hospitals. Still others have  received medical assistance in several Western European countries, reported an  Armenian doctor traveling with the group.  </P> <P> Shriners hospitals, which offer services to children at no cost, provided  treatment earlier to other young Armenian victims at several of their East  Coast facilities. At Centinela, the Children's Charity Fund will foot the bill.  Hospital officials there estimate that the total cost of medical services for  the 14 children will run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles trip was arranged by Medical Outreach for Soviet Armenians, a  nonprofit organization that has been supplying Armenian hospitals with  equipment even before the earthquake. Its founder, Glendale-based orthopedic  surgeon Vartkes Najarian, was on the first U.S. medical assistance plane to  reach Armenia after the Dec. 7 quake.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Waiting List  </P> <P> Members of the group have volunteered as interpreters and have prepared  home-cooked meals for the youngsters unfamiliar with American food. Najarian  said that the waiting list of Armenian community members hoping to visit the  children is long.  </P> <P> "Many have been turned away," he said.  </P> <P> Although the children received some treatment back home for their injuries, it  was limited, explained Dr. Robert W. Chandler, an orthopedic surgeon at  Centinela.  </P> <P> "They're doing the best they can with limited resources," he said of the Soviet  medical system that was overwhelmed by the earthquake's human toll. Most of the  affected region's medical facilities were lost in the quake.  </P> <P> "In the midst of a disaster, the first priority is saving life and limb,"  Chandler explained. "Then you deal with the reconstructions, which is what we  are now helping them with."  </P></p>

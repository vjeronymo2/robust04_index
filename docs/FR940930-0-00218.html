			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The LIRR objected to the requirement that there be a flagger or law enforcement officer flagging both directions of traffic before a train could proceed through the crossing at normal speed. LIRR presently uses uniformed railroad police to flag crossings during malfunctions. Under present LIRR policy, one uniformed police officer controls both directions of highway traffic at crossings with malfunctioning warning systems. Based on its experience and the effect it would have on its police operations, the LIRR strenuously objects to requiring a flagger for each direction of highway traffic. LIRR claims that it would result in unnecessary delays to LIRR's commuter trains, which operate at up to 2-minute headways, each carrying up to 1300 passengers. The railroad also stated that requiring two police officers to flag a crossing would have a significant impact on LIRR police operations by effectively requiring two-officer patrols instead of the present patrols using one officer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA made no distinction in the NPRM between flaggers and law enforcement officers and their ability to safely control and direct vehicular traffic. Thus, under the NPRM, a train could proceed through a crossing with a malfunctioning warning system only if an appropriately equipped flagger or law enforcement officer provides warning for each direction of highway traffic. Based on the comments received, FRA has reconsidered and determined that due to a police officer's traffic control training, the officer's ability to call for assistance if needed, and the motoring public's higher level of responsiveness to a uniformed officer, the presence of one uniformed law enforcement officer at a crossing will enable trains to pass through the crossing at normal speed. This section is being revised accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maine DOT recommended that speeds be limited in all cases of activation failure. It recommended a 20 mile per hour limit in those cases where a flagger is present for each direction of highway traffic. Such a limit would, according to Maine DOT ``allow more stopping time for highway users, thereby simplifying the flaggers job and enhancing overall safety at the crossing.'' We continue to believe that the presence of a uniformed law enforcement officer or the appropriate number of flaggers can effectively warn highway traffic of oncoming trains. We are therefore not revising section 105(c)(2) (final rule_105(c)(1)) regarding train speed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 234.105(c)(3)&blank;(Final Rule_234.105(c)(2)) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph 105(c)(3) as proposed, provides that trains may proceed with caution through the crossing at a speed not exceeding 10 miles per hour if an appropriately equipped flagger or law enforcement officer provides warning for highway traffic, but there is not at least one flagger of law enforcement officer providing warning for each direction of highway traffic. After the locomotive has passed through the crossing, normal speed may be resumed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This paragraph is being revised to omit references to law enforcement officers, inasmuch as paragraph 105(c)(1) of the final rule now provides that the presence of one law enforcement officer will permit normal speeds through the crossing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LIRR expressed concern regarding the maximum speed at which a train would be permitted to proceed through a crossing under this paragraph. The representative of the LIRR testified that LIRR's ``operating speed under restricted speed, *&blank;*&blank;* is a speed not exceeding 15 miles an hour, at which a train can be stopped within one half division of range short of the next signal, an obstruction, switch properly aligned, looking out for broken rail or crossing protection not functioning. We think that the restricted speed meets the criteria safely for moving trains over grade crossings.'' The LIRR emphasized the increased disruption to commuter traffic resulting from the 10 miles per hour limit compared to a limit of 15 miles per hour. APTA also opposed the 10 miles per hour limit, as did the labor/management group and the Southern Pacific. Other views included those of New Jersey Transit which was in favor of requiring movement at ``restricted speed'' rather than 10 miles per hour. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA rejected the use of ``restricted speed'' in the NPRM because it does not have the same meaning throughout the industry. ``Restricted speed'' has different meanings on different railroads, different speed limits ranging from 10 mph to 20 mph and its meaning can be changed unilaterally by a railroad. Reliance on the requirement that the train be able to ``stop within one-half the range of vision'' (a common element of the definition of ``restricted speed'') may be appropriate in a wholly railroad context in which the concern is to avoid other trains and equipment and personnel on the tracks in front of the locomotive. The requirement that a locomotive be able to stop within one-half the range of vision is virtually useless when an object can instantaneously move from off the right-of-way onto the tracks well within that range of vision limitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MGM/UA PLANS MAJOR MARCH RELEASE OF DAVIS MOVIES  </P> <P> Most of the best films of Bette Davis, who died last Friday, already are on  home video, but there are still a few quality ones that haven't been released.  </P> <P> MGM/UA, which has a large Davis library, had planned a major release for April,  but now is moving the date up to March, according to programming director  George Feltenstein.  </P> <P> The titles, which will retail at $19.98, include "Dangerous" -- the 1935 drama  featuring her Oscar-winning performance -- "The Man Who Came to Dinner' (1941),  "The Great Lie" (1941), "In This Our Life" (1942), "A Stolen Life" (1946) and  "Deception" (1946).  </P> <P> Also part of that release will be two movies previously out on CBS-Fox -- "The  Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex" (1939) and "The Petrified Forest" (1936).  The rights to these movies have reverted to MGM/UA. Feltenstein said "Elizabeth  and Essex" will be duplicated from an improved print.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, if you're looking to savor Davis' finest work now, focus on movies  made between the mid-'30s and early '50s. By the late '50s, she was doing  character roles. Only a handful of her films from then on are worth your time.  </P> <P> Here are some of the most prominent Davis films that are available on home  video -- all for $24.95 or less:  </P> <P> "Of Human Bondage" (Congress, 1934). The tragic tale of a doctor's (Leslie  Howard) obsession with a trashy waitress (Davis). Though impressive back then,  her performance now seems like overacting. Still, it's the role that made her a  star.  </P> <P> "Jezebel" (MGM/UA, 1938). Davis won an Oscar for her role as a sassy, spiteful,  Scarlett O'Hara-like character in this absorbing pre-Civil War drama. She's  delightfully tempestuous until she turns noble at the end. Henry Fonda co-stars  as her fiance. The Oscar notwithstanding, this is good but not great Davis.  </P> <P> "Dark Victory" (MGM/UA, 1939). In possibly her most famous tear-jerker, Davis  plays a selfish, carefree socialite who finds out she's dying of a brain tumor.  While doing some re-evaluating, she's consoled by husband-surgeon (George  Brent). Sure, it's excessively manipulative and riddled with cliches, but just  try to sit through it with dry eyes.  </P> <P> "The Little Foxes" (Nelson/Orion, 1941). To veteran Davis fans, her scheming,  callous Regina -- one of the screen's great evil leading characters -- is  Davis' crowning glory. Based on Lillian Hellman's play, this meaty melodrama  chronicles how greed destroys a Southern family. For those unfamiliar with  Davis in her prime, this is the movie to see.  </P> <P> "The Letter" (MGM/UA, 1940). Set is Malaya, it features Davis in one of her  finest villain roles, this time playing a murderer who's hiding behind a  self-defense plea. Directed by William Wyler and co-starring Herbert Marshall.  </P> <P> "Now Voyager" (MGM/UA, 1942). Davis's best soap opera, though not her best  performance in a soap opera. She plays a sheltered spinster who flowers into a  sophisticate under the guidance of a psychiatrist (Paul Henried). Henried's  dual cigarette-lighting scene was long considered one of the screen's great  romantic moments. But, in this anti-smoking era, it's just a curiosity.  </P> <P> "Mr. Skeffington" (MGM/UA, 1944). Possibly Davis' most overlooked, underrated  drama, this sprawling soap, covering several decades, is about a selfish woman  (Davis) who marries a stockbroker (Claude Rains) out of greed. Later on, the  relationship ripens into love. Davis' intense, all-out performance belongs in  her Top Five.  </P> <P> "All About Eve" (CBS-Fox, 1950). To many critics, this is Davis' best  performance -- as tough, cynical Broadway actress Margo Channing, who's the  target of the trickery of deceptive Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter). Possibly  Davis' most famous movie, it's a good introduction to those who know little  about her.  </P> <P> "A Pocketful of Miracles" (1961, MGM/UA, $19.98). The best of Davis' old-lady  character roles. In this adaptation of a Damon Runyon story, she plays Apple  Annie, a derelict who, to cover up a well-meaning lie, has to be transformed  into a society matron.  </P> <P> "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" (Warner, 1962). Fun, campy, horror tale, with  Davis, as a sadistic ex-child star, grandly caricaturing some of her old roles.  This one, co-starring Joan Crawford, resurrected Davis' career and earned her a  best-actress nomination.  </P> <P> "The Whales of August" (Nelson/Orion, 1987). Talky character study consisting  of two elderly sisters fussing at each other in a Maine summer cottage. More of  interest as a bit of film history, watching Davis work with another cinema  grand dame, silent-star Lillian Gish.  </P> <P> Few of Davis' movies from the early 1930s are available on home video,  including her first, "Bad Sister," a bad 1930 film notable because it was one  of Humphrey Bogart's earliest movies.  </P> <P> Of the Davis films not yet on video, the ones to watch for are 'Kid Galahad"  (1937), "Old Acquaintance" (1943), "The Star" (1952), "A Catered Affair" (1956)  and "Storm Center" (1956).  </P> <P> "Beyond the Forest," a 1949 murder mystery, isn't on home video either.  Co-starring Joseph Cotten, the film isn't particularly suspenseful, but it's  noteworthy because it features Davis delivering her signature line, "What a  dump."  </P> <P> Davis' last film, "The Wicked Stepmother" -- which received only limited  theatrical release and was controversial because of the star's well-publicized  battles with director Larry Cohen -- is due out on MGM/UA on Nov. 14 at $79.95.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMBER GROUP SEEKS SOFTER LOGGING RULES  </P> <P> A timber industry group Tuesday proposed several new regulations that would  make it easier for loggers to fell trees and harder for conservationists to  challenge controversial logging practices.  </P> <P> The proposals, which the Timber Assn. of California said would simply make  clear what is and is not required by the state to approve timber harvesting,  were introduced before the state Board of Forestry in Sacramento.  </P> <P> The eight-member board is authorized under state law to adopt the specific  logging regulations needed to implement general guidelines outlined in the  state Forest Practice Act. The board, which critics say is sympathetic to the  logging industry, Tuesday acknowledged the industry suggestions but did not say  when it would decide what to do with them.  </P> <P> Environmentalists were swift to criticize the industry's proposals, arguing the  recommended rules would kill the last remnants of environmental protection left  in the state's logging laws.  </P> <P> "Timber harvest plans as they read now are virtually worthless," said one  Sierra Club lawyer, Joseph J. Brecher of Oakland. "They give (regulators) so  much discretion . . . almost any kind of horrible logging practice is  approved."  </P> <P> "There are, however, a few rules that we were able to use to stop some of the  worst plans, especially where old-growth was concerned," he added. "The  industry has been collecting all of those decisions in our favor, and now they  want to do away with the (regulatory) provisions we used."  </P> <P> The timber association said in introducing its proposals that it simply sought  to clean up "some vagueness in the forest practice rules" and "some confusion  and capriciousness in legal interpretations of them."  </P> <P> The industry group denied that a string of legal setbacks suffered recently by  its members were the result of loggers breaking the law.  </P> <P> "We feel the adverse court decisions are based primarily on the failure to  respond adequately to significant environmental points raised during the THP  (timber harvest plan) review process," it said.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the timber association acknowledged that changes in forest  practice rules are needed to offset the string of legal victories by  environmentalists, who have blocked a significant amount of logging that could  threaten the rare spotted owl or sensitive fish-spawning streams.  </P> <P> As discussed in its 48-page report to the board, the timber association  proposals would:  </P> <P> * Officially elevate logging to be "paramount among all competing uses" in  timber-production zones, and forbid regulatory agencies to presume that logging  has "significant adverse impact on the environment."  </P> <P> * Automatically reject any effort to mitigate environmental damage caused by  logging if the environmental protection measures would "significantly detract  from growing and harvesting timber."  </P> <P> * Redefine the analysis of cumulative logging impacts to exclude areas which  will be logged more than five years in the future and timber operations planned  by other companies. Studies of cumulative impacts would be "guided" by  undefined standards of "practicality and reasonableness."  </P> <P> * Restrict requests for additional information beyond what is submitted by a  timber company in its original timber-harvest plan. Information requests would  have to be made through the state Department of Forestry and would be answered  only if found to be reasonable and not too costly to answer. The timber harvest  plan could be approved before the additional information is provided.  </P> <P> * Modify protection of threatened and endangered species by limiting logging  restrictions only to those habitats where endangered species are known to live  now, not to habitats that might be suitable for such species in the future.  </P> <P> "The new rules will still sound like they have protection," said Brecher, "but  because of the wiggly language they contain -- and because the Department of  Forestry is solidly behind this industry -- they can and will be interpreted to  support any kind of logging."  </P> <P> Brecher added that industry proposals were so radical that environmentalists  could revive the controversial notion of requiring lengthy, costly  environmental impact reports for timber harvests.  </P> <P> An agreement hammered out in the 1970s found California's timber laws to be  "functionally equivalent" to the tough California Environmental Quality Act.  Since then, timber harvests have been exempt from the law's more arduous  analysis requirements.  </P></p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / BZW looks to strengthen presence in US BZW, the investment banking arm of Barclays, has started a strategic review of its business in the US that could lead to the bank entering a partnership with, or acquiring, a US investment bank. BZW executives believe that it needs to strengthen its presence in the US in order to compete with other global investment banks. At the moment, BZW has limited US bond operations and it does not sell US equities. The bank's review is being led by Mr Donald Brydon, the newly-appointed deputy chief executive of BZW. Barclays may appoint outside advisers to help in the review, which is expected to be completed by the middle of next year. The move follows efforts by Barclays to run down its US retail banking businesses, and refocus its activities for large companies. It has reduced the number of companies it deals with over the past 18 months from 900 to 200. Sir Peter Middleton, chairman of BZW, said that BZW 'had a shortage, which we are determined to rectify, of dollar products'. He said that it was likely to examine both its presence in US equities and fixed income. Sir Peter emphasised that BZW was keeping an open mind about strategies for US expansion. 'We shall do something. Either we shall grow something organically, or look for a partner, or something of that sort.' BZW has a range of businesses in the US including treasury and derivatives. It has a government bond trading licence, and a small mortgage-backed bonds desk, but its equities presence is limited to selling European and Asian shares. BZW executives believe that it could not compete head on with the large US 'bulge bracket' firms such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. However, they think BZW needs a strong US operation in order to operate globally. One possibility would be to form a partnership with a small US investment bank in order for both partners to gain access to each other's markets. Several smaller US securities firms have faced difficulties penetrating London markets. Barclays previously had a small operation researching and selling US equities, which it acquired from the former Drexel Burnham Lambert. These operations were closed three years ago because they were seen as too expensive. Barclays has been accumulating capital in the past year because of retained earnings and shrinking assets, which would allow it to expand through acquisition. Last week it announced a buy-back of Dollars 500m (Pounds 305m) in preference shares.</p>

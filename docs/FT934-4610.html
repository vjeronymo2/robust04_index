			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Row over packaging waste divides EU European Union environment ministers were last night struggling to find a compromise on Europe-wide rules for dealing with packaging waste, after the Belgian presidency of the EU signalled it was prepared to see German-led insistence on ambitious recycling targets voted down. Belgium has made it a priority to get through a directive on waste packaging, after complaints from eight member states that Germany's ambitious national waste recycling legislation has led to dumping of waste in neighbouring countries. Germany does not have the capacity to meet its own targets, and its subsidised exports of waste are stifling efforts elsewhere to build up recycling industries. France in June threatened a ban on German waste imports and other member states are warning of legal action. Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the EU environment commissioner, warned of a 'a real legal war' if the 12 could not agree common rules. The stakes are high because if no decision is reached by today, the controversy is likely to drift through the Greek presidency in the first half of next year, and be returned to only when Germany itself is in the EU chair during the second half of 1994. The interim could be punctuated by acrimonious legal disputes. Moreover, unless the 12 reach a plausible consensus, the European Parliament, which under the Maastricht treaty could veto this directive, could further complicate the controversy. According to Mr Tim Yeo, junior UK environment minister, and French and European Commission officials, Denmark - which along with the Netherlands sides with Germany on higher targets - was spearheading a filibuster likely to take negotiations throughout the night. The German-led trio can, however, be outvoted under the EU's weighted majority voting system. The original Commission proposal had been for 60 per cent recovery of waste over five years, with 40 per cent recycling, and 90 per cent after 10 years, with 60 per cent recycling. The Belgian presidency compromise abandons the 10-year aim and suggests a 50-60 per cent recovery target, with a 30 to 40 per cent recycling obligation. The latter would be an overall target for all waste, allowing, say, higher targets for paper and board if there were insufficient capacity to deal with plastic. But no waste material would be exempt from the recycling effort, with a minimum 15 per cent target. The Germans, Dutch and Danes denounced the compromise as unacceptably 'low and unambitious.' Negotiations were proceeding last night on French and British suggestions which would allow the 'greener' member states to set higher targets if there were no resulting trade and single market distortions of the type already caused by Germany. Those who wanted higher targets would also have to demonstrate they had enough reprocessing capacity.</p>

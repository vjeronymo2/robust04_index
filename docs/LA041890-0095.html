			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LOVE FEAST FOR NELSON MANDELA IN LONDON  </P> <P> In the chilly night air at Wembley Stadium, tens of thousands of pop music fans  gave their loudest and longest ovation to a man who's never had a song on the  charts.  </P> <P> In fact they sang to him, belting out the Broadway show tune turned British  soccer standard "You'll Never Walk Alone" for anti-apartheid leader Nelson  Mandela.  </P> <P> The exuberant but extremely well-behaved crowd of more than 70,000 had no  problem adjusting to the nearly seamless blend of politics and music at the  five-hour Mandela tribute concert Monday night.  </P> <P> The same fans who went crazy over Simple Minds and formed a 150-person conga  line during Natalie Cole's "Wild Women Do" paid rapt attention to all the  political speeches, especially Mandela's. During his low-key, half-hour  appearance, the African National Congress leader gave his thanks for the  international efforts which helped win his release after nearly three decades  of imprisonment and pleaded for continued sanctions against the South African  government.  </P> <P> The crowd cheered, hissed and kept quiet at all the right times.  </P> <P> With this concert, it appeared that the use of grandiose rock shows for  consciousness-raising purposes had evolved another notch. This was no  fund-raising charity event. Though the artists were performing for free, other  productions costs were high, according to the organizers, and they expect to  see little, if any profit. Instead it was designed to provide a worldwide forum  for a political cult hero to deliver his message. This new dimension in pop  music events brought occasional moments of culture clash. Hundreds of fans held  up matches and lighters in the darkened stadium just before Mandela came on  stage, as if they were coaxing him out to play "Born to Run."  </P> <P> Tracy Chapman solved the problem of finding an act to follow Mandela, coming on  stage alone to play her haunting "Talkin' Bout a Revolution."  </P> <P> But the song was turned into an instant commercial. As Chapman sang, the giant  monitors flanking the stage replayed a slow motion version of Mandela's earlier  arrival on stage, with the ANC leader waving to the adoring crowd. With Chapman  singing the line, "Finally the tables are starting to turn," it produced a  powerful image reminiscent of a 30-second presidential campaign spot.  </P> <P> But while the music was there because of the politics, the fans were there  because of the music. And they did not appear to be disappointed.  </P> <P> Early in the show, Patti LaBelle performed with backing from Daniel Lanois'  band. Chapman, who seemed more confident than at previous "event" concerts,  made the first of several appearances singing "Freedom Now" and "Born to  Fight." The Neville Brothers kept the audience moving with "My Blood" and  "Yellow Moon."  </P> <P> As the Nevilles played, performers in a green carpeted room backstage clustered  around TV sets and watched the BBC's broadcast of the show. Lou Reed and  Jackson Browne stood outside their trailers watching with a group of South  African musicians, while Anita Baker, Bonnie Raitt and others clustered around  the television at the other end of the room.  </P> <P> There was widespread disappointment and resentment among the performers that  the show was not being broadcast in the United States.  </P> <P> "It's a scandal," said Little Steven Van Zandt, who spearheaded the all-star  anti-apartheid single "Sun City" in 1985. Suggesting that the show was not  broadcast in the United States because of its political content, he said, "It's  becoming more and more obvious that the media is becoming an organ of the  government in the United States. I think it's shameful and embarrassing."  </P> <P> Following appearances by Neil Young, Terence Trent D'Arby and Reed, the  appreciative, almost entirely white audience bounced to the two sets of South  African music. Conspicuously absent from the show was Hugh Masekela, who was  scheduled to appear then dropped out after complaining in the British press  that the event was being used as a forum for white artists to boost their  record sales.  </P> <P> New York rappers the Jungle Brothers quickly took control of the crowd,  prompting an incredible roar when they asked the audience to make as much noise  as possible for Mandela. But the drum sound was inexplicably turned down when  Neneh Cherry joined the group, and despite her best efforts, there was no  regaining the crowd momentum.  </P> <P> The rap segment led to the first of a series of introductions that resulted in  Mandela's reaching the stage to prolonged cheering.  </P> <P> After Chapman's "Revolution," Simple Minds sent the crowd into a frenzy that  made it clear how much bigger the band is in Great Britain than in the U.S.  Lead singer Jim Kerr introduced Van Zandt, who in turn brought out all the  other stars plus Chrissie Hynde and Peter Gabriel for a rousing version of "Sun  City."  </P> <P> Gabriel ended the show strongly, performing "In Your Eyes" with Senegalese  singer Youssou N'Dour, and the moving ballad "Biko."  </P> <P> As the crowd filed out, few seemed disappointed, although many noted there was  never that magic musical moment they had hoped for.  </P> <P> "It wasn't really the top bands, was it?" asked Colin Francis of London. "But  the main thing for me was to catch a glimpse of Nelson Mandela in real life."  </P> <P> "Something to tell the children about," added his friend, Neil Chatum.  </P> <P> "I came for the music and the cause," said a man who didn't want to give his  name. "It was good. But they could have given Simple Minds a larger slot."  </P> <P> "I was disappointed," said Philip Harrison, who traveled from York for the  show. "I came mainly in hopes U2 were here."  </P></p>

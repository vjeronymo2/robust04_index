			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / International Company News: Weaker won boosts Korean electronics SOUTH Korea's three main electronics companies have reported sharply higher sales and profits for the first half of 1993, writes John Burton in Seoul. The buoyant results reflect increased exports as the companies benefited from the depreciation of the Korean won against the Japanese yen. Total export sales for the three companies rose 52 per cent, while domestic sales rose 7 per cent. Samsung Electronics reported a 81 per cent jump in net earnings to Won56.2bn (Dollars 70.6m). Sales climbed 32 per cent to 2,850bn. Goldstar's net profits rose 441 per cent to Won30bn, on sales of Won2,040bn. Its leading exports were televisions, VCRs and air conditioners. Daewoo Electronics had net profits of Won13.6bn, up 21 per cent, on sales of Won805bn.</p>

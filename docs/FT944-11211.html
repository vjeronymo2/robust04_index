			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (21): Focus on the short-term - Shanghai stock market When stockbrokers start blaming their clients, it is a clear sign that it is not going to be a good year. So, if the complaints to be heard in Shanghai these days are an indication, 1994 is shaping up as a very poor year indeed, writes Simon Holberton. 'Investment strategy is very short term,' says Mr Huang Jun, head of institutional sales, at Shanghai International Securities (SIS). 'There is a lack of knowledge about fundamental analysis. Investors look at financial statements but lack the expertise to interpret them.' 'The investment situation is not ideal,' agrees Mr Huang Guexian, a senior director of Shenyin Securities, a large Shanghai brokerage. 'There are many individual investors and few institutions. The individuals are mostly investors who lack long-term intentions.' The cry of short-termism is often heard in Shanghai. Only recently the Liberation Daily, the Communist party's mouthpiece in the city, upbraided investors for being far too prepared to trade on rumour. 'Some illegal institutions and big shots are coining rumours to force investors to sell at a loss. At other times they conjure up non-existent news to attract followers,' the paper said last month. The Shanghai market has performed like a yo-yo so far this year. Share prices in Shanghai had been on a steady decline until the end of July, when the A-share index hit an all-time low of 328.9. A-shares can be owned only by Chinese nationals, while foreigners have a limited access to Chinese stocks through B-shares. To cries of 'Do something]' from brokers and investors alike, the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) announced a series of measures to support the market. These measures included a re-iteration of the ban on new A-share issues for 1994; a promise to control more rigorously A-share issues in 1995; an undertaking to permit Sino-foreign joint venture investment funds to invest in A-shares; and the extension of selective credit lines to securities companies to help fund their trading. The announcement of these measures had the immediate effect of boosting prices. By the end of August the A-share index was about to break through the 1,000 point barrier - more than three times its level of not quite two months before. Since then, however, the market has been buffeted, mainly by rumours concerning the health of Deng Xiaoping, China's 90-year-old senior leader. By the middle of last month the index was hovering around 650 - 35 per cent off its peak for the year. In addition to complaints about rumours, the failure to follow through the July measures has disappointed brokers. Mr Huang dismissed the moratorium on new A-share listings as 'nothing new.' For foreign investment bankers the gyrations of the Shanghai market are those expected of a market in the early years of development. They are more intent on building their offices for the day - not too far off - when foreigners will be able to trade A-shares. They are also looking forward to the time when the Chinese corporate sector becomes more attuned to western corporate finance techniques of capital-raising, and mergers and acquisitions. For Mr Richard Graham, chief representative of Baring, the UK investment bank, in Shanghai, corporate research, carried out by properly-trained local staff is the place to start. 'You have to create your research team on the ground. China is no different,' he says. 'Hong Kong and Taiwanese analysts are not well-suited to looking at Chinese companies. They don't understand the culture. They come in wearing flashy clothes, speaking bad and aggressive Mandarin - it doesn't go down very well with hassled local executives.' The prospect of a unified stock market, where the distinction between A and B shares is removed, will be good for the foreign investor, Mr John Crossman, general manager of Jardine Fleming in Shanghai believes. Capitalisation of the A-share market in Shanghai is more than four times that of the B-share market. In corporate finance Mr Crossman notes that China's preference for equity rather than debt means there are opportunities for bringing together foreign equity and technology in strategic alliances. 'We're seeing where we can expand,' he says. Baring's Mr Graham also sees this as fertile ground. 'The real question for investment banks here is the future of mergers and acquisition work,' he notes. 'You won't get Chinese companies to pay for that sort of advice at the moment, but foreign companies might.'</p>

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Arts: Weber's 'Der Freischutz' - Opera in Zurich The Ruth Berghaus fan club is growing - if you judge by the number of continental opera house managements playing along with her theatrical riddles. The east German director's footprints are now so commonplace that the novelty value of her pioneering west European productions has given way to predictability, in the way she approaches each work and the extreme reactions she provokes. But the new staging of Der Freischutz at the Zurich Opera House was different, if only because she was working for the first time with Nikolaus Harnoncourt. Harnoncourt has been searching for a compatible operatic partner ever since the death of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, with whom he worked so profitably on Zurich's Monteverdi and Mozart cycles. On the surface, Berghaus and Harnoncourt have something in common. They approach the work in hand without preconceptions based on tradition or received opinion. Both are a fund of stimulating ideas and insights, and both challenge you to think: there is never a dull moment. Nor can you ignore the exactness of observation and execution they bring to everything they do. There the similarities end. Where Berghaus uses each opera as a floor for her own theatrical fantasy, Harnoncourt's priority is reading the composer's mind - based on textual fidelity. Rarely can Weber's early Romantic score have sounded less folksy-sentimental or so expressionist. The music emerged full of unvarnished timbres, unexpected instrumental voices, sudden impulses and unsettling harmonies. You hear what Wagner heard in Weber, the Wolf's Glen scene providing a clear pre-echo of Alberich's 'Horst du, Hagen, mein Sohn?'. None of the tempo extremes were gratuitous: even the beautifully still opening to 'Leise, leise' seemed to heighten the music's inner tension. Above all, Harnoncourt reminds us that the Freischutz of Weber and Kind lies somewhere between heaven and hell. Berghaus's Freischutz, by contrast, is all hell - a nightmare vision of humanity. The devil-figure of Samiel is ever-present, dancing across stage at the start of each scene in the same black hat and cape as the rest of the cast. The Hermit and Ottokar have no identity other than as spokesmen for church and state within a drab Brechtian society. There is no forest, the action unfolding instead against a background of abstract panels (designed by Hartmut Meyer). Nor is there a glint of hope: in the final scene, the people brush themselves clean from the preceding unpleasantness, as history prepares to repeat itself. All this tells us more about Berghaus, her political beliefs and theatrical influences, than it does about Freischutz. As usual, she has nothing to say about individual characters, and the Wolf's Glen - Weber's masterstroke as a musical dramatist - is flattened into a series of pretentious choreographic routines. After Achim Freyer's landmark Stuttgart production of the early 1980s, it would be a poor soul who wanted to return to Freischutz with stage extras dressed up as wild boars. But with Berghaus, the drive to demythologise Freischutz as one of the great German cultural emblems goes too far. Matti Salminen's Kaspar dominated the Zurich cast with his giant figure and bear-hug of a voice, probably too generous in timbre for the role. Reiner Goldberg's Max, playing a bookish Faust to Salminen's grandiose Mephisto, sounded like someone who has sung a part too often. Inga Nielsen was a cool Agathe, Malin Hartelius a pretty, unsoubrettish Aennchen. In repertory until March 27</p>

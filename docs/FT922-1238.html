			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (16): Lessons from deregulation - Interview Dr Radius Prawiro, Co-ordinating Minister for the Economy, Finance, Industry and Development Supervision, talks to William Keeling and Victor Mallet: FT: What future economic deregulation is planned and what lessons have you learnt from deregulation to date? Radius: The deregulation programme for the coming weeks will be in the field of trade and industry. It is possible that we will reduce our tariffs for a number of products. But deregulation is an on-going process and you cannot do everything at once. FT: Will tariff reduction apply across the board or only to Asean (the Association of South East Asian Nations)? Radius: We would like to be more competitive. Not only are we aiming at intra-Asean trade but also in general we have to reduce tariffs. Last year we lowered tariffs from an average 40 per cent to 30 per cent. FT: Could you have a further cut of 5 per cent or 10 per cent? Radius: To be frank, we have to bargain with so many people, with so many producers, with so many manufacturers. Of course, we would like to go as far as possible but those people say 'Well, I am ready to go right now, but other companies aren't ready yet'. FT: Critics say deregulation has been limited, such as when a state monopoly is transferred to a private monopoly. What are your concerns on private monopolies, in particular on cloves? Radius: It is being reduced gradually. FT: It still retains the sole right to sell cloves. Radius: Because they have huge stocks and they have to repay the debts of the banks. So they have to sell. The government cannot take over because then who would repay the debts? They are responsible for repaying the debts. FT: Are you worried by the growth of imports? Radius: Yes, we are very worried by the growth of imports. That's why last year when we had an overheated economy we had to cut imports by having a tight monetary policy. Interest rates increased, so finally instead of having an Dollars 8bn current account deficit we had only a Dollars 4.3bn deficit. FT: Isn't a danger of a tight monetary policy that it hurts companies which provide export revenue? Radius: Let me tell you, in 1990 the export increase in non-oil and gas goods was 6 per cent; when we introduced a tight money policy in 1991, exports of the non-oil and gas goods increased 25 per cent. FT: How will the new banking law affect the banking sector? Radius: The new banking law will allow foreign equity participation up to 49 per cent in both state and private banks and will give the state banks greater flexibilty of management and operation to compete with private banks. In the case of private sector banks they may want to have a joint venture with foreign banks to improve their management and banking practices. In the case of the state banks we are still studying what will be the most effective and efficient way. FT: How does the government plan to restructure the state banks? Radius: The government has decided to follow the same capital adequacy ratio (CAR) principles as the Bank for International Settlements, which is around 8 per cent of total assets. But it would be very difficult for developing countries right now to jump to that figure, so we have to go step by step. However, nobody is going to buy shares from the state banks if their capital structure hasn't been improved. The shareholder is responsible for that, which means the government has to come up with equity funding. We have in our budget certain surpluses and these can be used for equity. FT: What is the strategy for containing international debt? Radius: It is the setting of limits. We try to curb foreign borrowing. In particular, we are not going to finance big projects, except those within the ceilings. FT: Are you concerned that by allowing large projects to proceed under foreign ownership the strain on the balance of payments will increase? Radius: It depends on the quality of the borrowing. If you borrow short and use the money here for long-term financing, you get stuck. Since we have a more active private sector, this means that the borrowing by the private sector increases. This we have to be careful of. FT: Wouldn't you be content for market forces to dictate what banks can borrow abroad? Radius: Not this time. We still have to control the borrowing. The appetite to borrow is quite big. FT: Yet you still have to fund enormous infrastructural projects. Radius: We are borrowing for this from donors and these are soft loans. It is really big, but it is concessionary with an interest rate below 3.5 per cent. Part is being financed by the World Bank, which is less concessionary, but the terms are long compared to commercial borrowing. FT: How concerned are you about Indonesia's reliance on foreign donors? Radius: We actually have a negative outflow of capital with regard to borrowing from the so-called donor countries. We are repaying our debts, around Dollars 7bn a year principal and interest. But if we can't borrow from outside it will be very difficult for us to repay the debts. FT: If donor countries link aid to conditions which you regard as unacceptable, such as human rights or a particular view of democracy, might you be unwilling to pay past debt? Radius: No, no, no. Even to the Dutch, we thank them for supporting us for 24 years, we thank them for chairing donor meetings for 24 years, and for their efforts to convince other donors to support Indonesia's development programme. What we do not like is when development assistance has been used to intimidate us. This is not good. Human rights is a topic that can be discussed. We are a member of the UN human rights commission, and we are keen to respect human rights.</p>

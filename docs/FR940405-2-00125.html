Request for a waiver of the requirement that before a Participating Jurisdiction disburses HOME funds to any entity it must enter into a detailed written agreement with the entity ensuring that HOME funds are used in accordance with all program requirements. Alaska believes designation of its housing finance agency to administer its HOME program should not require a detailed written agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nature of Requirement:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The written agreement required by &sect;92.504(b) and described in &sect;92.504(c) contains detailed requirements concerning the use of HOME funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Granted By:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Don I. Patch, Acting Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date Granted:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> March 23, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reasons Waived:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under many State laws, State housing finance agencies (HFAs), are not part of the State government. Under the HOME statute, if a HFA is not a State agency it cannot be designated as the participating jurisdiction. In such cases where the State wants the HFA to administer the HOME Program, an agency of the State must be the participating jurisdiction and the HFA must be designated as a subrecipient. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees that the written agreement between a State and an instrumentality of the State that is a subrecipient need not contain the same detailed information as is required of other entities receiving HOME funds. Further, the Department amended &sect;92.504(b) by the publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on June 23, 1993, of an interim rule which established much simpler requirements for State subrecipients. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore there was good cause to grant the requested waiver of 24 CFR 92.504(b) and to allow the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation to enter into a written agreement with the State of Alaska using the much simpler requirements for State subrecipients. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 110.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Regulation:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 24 CFR 570.200(a)(5) and 24 CFR 570.200(h). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Project/Activity:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> County of Macomb, Michigan (City of Fraser) Request for an amendment to a waiver of preagreement costs approved June 26, 1992, for the City of Fraser, Michigan, a subrecipient of the Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) of the County of Macomb, Michigan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nature of Requirement:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 24 CFR 570.200(h) permits reimbursement of certain eligible costs incurred prior to the date of the grant agreement. 24 CFR 570.200(a)(5) limits pre-agreement costs to those described in subparagraph 570.200(h). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Granted By:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> David M. Cohen, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Grant Programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date Granted:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> May 28, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reasons Waived:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A previous waiver of pre-agreement costs, which was approved June 26, 1992, permitted the City to proceed with the construction of a senior center and reimburse the costs of constructing the facility with CDBG funds from 1992&hyph;1998. Although the site preparation and foundation work had begun, unforeseen soil conditions had necessitated change orders that would have resulted in an increase in the cost. The City needed to request an amendment to the period covered by the waiver. Failure to approve this request may impose a greater hardship on the City since it has already incurred contractual obligations for construction of the project and would cause undue hardship and adversely affect the purposes of the Act. For good cause the limitations on pre-agreement costs at 24 CFR 570.200(a)(5) and 570.200(h) were waived to permit the reimbursement of the costs of constructing this facility with CDBG funds from 1992 through the year 2000. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 111.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Regulation:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 24 CFR 574.4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Project/Activity:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Seattle, Washington. The Seattle Department of Housing and Human Services requested an extension of the deadline to allow ample time to prepare a proposal that adequately addresses the needs of persons with AIDS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nature of Requirement:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 24 CFR 574.4 establishes a deadline for the submission of applications for the entitlement component of the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) Program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Granted By:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Don I. Patch, Acting Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date Granted:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> March 8, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reason Waived:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to provide time to adequately involve the community organizations serving persons with AIDs in the application, a waiver of the March 15, 1993 deadline was granted, and the date for submission of the HOPWA application was extended to April 30, 1993. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

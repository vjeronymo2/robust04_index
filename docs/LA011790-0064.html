			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> AS OKERT SITS OUT CASTLE PARK STANDS OVER MONTGOMERY  </P> <P> Even 19 minutes after she was ejected, Castle Park's Erica Okert still felt  like a woman scorned.  </P> <P> "I lost my balance," Okert protested Tuesday night after being forced to watch  Castle Park defeat host Montgomery, 71-58, almost entirely from the bench.  </P> <P> With 3:14 left in the second quarter and the Trojans leading, 28-25, referee  Dave Dendy called Okert, the conferences' second leading rebounder, for  intentionally elbowing Montgomery's Monica Vargas.  </P> <P> "She elbowed the girl," Dendy said. He said it was not only intentional, "it  was flagrant," he said.  </P> <P> It was an important call for both sides. Montgomery either gets a break because  a wrench is thrown in Castle Park's big rebounding game, or the Trojans get  angry and inspired.  </P> <P> Well, wouldn't you know it. Castle Park goes ahead, 40-31, at the half and  extends it by more each quarter. Montgomery never lead after the first quarter.  </P> <P> "When we lost Erica, they responded well," first-year Coach Chuck Mills said.  "The rest of the girls had to pick up quite a load. Christina (Murguia) picked  up her game quite a bit and Debbie Davis had a phenomenal game."  </P> <P> Oh yes, Christina. All the county's second leading scorer (30.1 average going  into this game) did was score 36 points and pull down 18 rebounds.  </P> <P> "I knew it could go either way," said Murguia. "By the end of the second  quarter we started playing our game."  </P> <P> That's when the Trojans had adjusted to the Aztecs' tough press.  </P> <P> "We practiced breaking their press all week, but at first we didn't because  they're so quick."  </P> <P> But Montgomery (12-5, 6-1) was having its own problems, pertaining mostly to  its shooting.  </P> <P> "We missed everything," Montgomery Coach Lori Morris said. "We never do that.  But (Castle Park) looked great."  </P> <P> Brooke Scarborough and Claudia Medina each had 16 points for the Aztecs.  </P> <P> Said Mills of his defending league champion Trojans: "We're building a program  here, and we don't want to lose. We're building for the future."  </P> <P> The victory put more flavor in an already scrumptious league race, as the  Trojans (12-3, 6-1) moved into a tie for the conference lead after the first  round.

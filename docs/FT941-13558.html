			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Fermec gains access to US Fermec Holdings, the Manchester-based construction equipment company, is to start selling its new range of backhoe loaders in North America through a supply agreement with Kobelco America, the Japanese-owned distribution company. The deal is an important move for Fermec, which is best known by its MF Industrial brand name and was formed in late 1992 in a management buy-out from Varity Corporation's Massey Ferguson Group. Fermec launched its new TLK range of backhoe loaders last March in a bid for second place in a European market led by JC Bamford Excavators. The latest deal fulfils a promise to develop coverage elsewhere through strategic alliances, said Mr Richard Robson, managing director. Kobelco America has about 100 dealers in the US and Canada which will start selling Fermec backhoe loaders immediately under the TLK brand. Kobelco had long been looking for a backhoe loader to complement its range of excavators and other equipment. Mr Keith Jones, Fermec's marketing and aftercare director, said Kobelco had placed an order for 100 machines and was confident of selling 200 in the first year of the agreement. Fermec expects to produce 2,500 backhoes this year. In the first nine months of trading, to September last year, Fermec had annualised sales of Pounds 60m. It had already expected sales of Pounds 75m in the current year, which ends in September, but the Kobelco America deal is expected to add another Pounds 5m.</p>

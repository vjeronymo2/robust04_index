Merimskiy; </F> continued; see VOYENNO-ISTORICHESKIY ZHURNAL, No 10, 1993:  "Kabul-Moscow: War to Order"]    [Text]  <H5>  Introduction or Invasion? </H5>   After undergoing treatment at the Kislovodsk sanatorium I  returned to Moscow with my wife. The train arrived at Kursk  Station near midnight. As we stepped out of the car we were met  by an officer I didn't know, who told me that Army General S. F.  Akhromeyev was expecting me.    Just a few minutes later I was at the General Staff. After  inquiring after my health and apologizing for my "kidnapping" at  the station, S. F. Akhromeyev went on the business part of our  conversation.    It essentially boiled down to this. The Afghan government  had  approached our country's leadership several times with an  insistent request to introduce Soviet troops into Afghanistan.  The motives were as before--to place state facilities under  protection, thus freeing the Afghan Army to fight the rebels.  This matter was resolved positively. Agreement was reached that  the Afghan side would make a radio announcement to all the world  about its request. A mobilizational exercise had started in the  Turkestan Military District, in the course of which the field  administration of the 40th Army, the 5th and 108th motorized  rifle divisions, and an army contingent of combat and rear  support units were being deployed at wartime strength.    In general, a force grouping was being created for  introduction to Afghanistan. A small operational group headed by  S. F. Akhromeyev was go there to provide assistance in resolving  mobilizational matters. I was appointed his deputy. Colonels A.  K. Kotlyar, M. M. Mordas and B. Ya. Rogontsev were assigned to  the group from the Main Directorate of Combat Training.    I was surprised by this turn of events. Had the situation in  Kabul really grown worse? The mass media, after all, had been  reporting steady development of the April revolution, its  support by the people, and a successful struggle against the  counterrevolution. So what happened there?    I reminded S. F. Akhromeyev that after our military  delegation returned from Afghanistan we had submitted a report  to the Minister of Defense in which we clearly stated that it  would be unsuitable to introduce our forces into this country.  In addition, we emphasized that the freedom-loving Afghan people  would not condone intervention from outside, and cited a number  of facts confirming this conclusion. As an example when our  Military Advisor made a casual remark to the Commander of an  Afghan Army regiment, the reply was this: "We didn't ask you to  come here. Go back to your own country, and we'll sort things  out ourselves."    "The situation in the country took a dramatic turn for the  worst after Amin assumed unshared power," S. F. Akhromeyev  explained. "Repressions assumed mass proportions, by which the  existing regime compromised itself, and conditions under which  Amin might be overthrown by the counterrevolution had been  created."    "But isn't it true that Amin isn't the first, and probably  not the last ruler to be deposed in Afghanistan?" I noted.    "That's all so," S. F. Akhromeyev agreed, "but the Americans  could come in together with the counterrevolution, and that  would be extremely undesirable. In addition our relations with  China, which supports Pakistan, are strained. And the situation  in Iran isn't clear. It was in this situation that the question  as to what we were going to do arose.    "The position of the General Staff was unequivocal--don't  introduce any forces. When we were given the question of troop  introduction for preplanning, we prepared a report to the  Ministry of Defense. It indicated that extremely weighty  arguments would have to support such a critical decision as  introducing troops into a foreign country, and all the more so  an Eastern country, and that we didn't have such arguments.    "Of course the leadership feels that our forces would stay  in  their garrisons and defend the existing regime against attempts  to overthrow it from without, while inside the country the  Afghan Army would deal with the rebels, and we would soon leave.  Of course, it was more likely that our prestige and  international position would be undermined. Moreover, grounds  would appear for accusing the Soviet Union of aggression. But an  order is an order. Although let me say once again that the  General Staff is opposed to introduction."    "So what are we preparing the division for--introduction or  invasion?" I asked.    "For both the former and the latter," was the reply.    In the morning of 14 December 1979 our group took off by air  to its base in the city of Termez. S. F. Akhromeyev was delayed  in Moscow until evening. We were met at the airfield by 40th  Army commander Lieutenant-General Yu. V. Tukharinov and Army  Military Council Member Major-General A. V. Taskayev.  Immediately upon our arrival at headquarters the commander  informed us of the progress in mobilizing. Deployment of the  army field administration, and of the combined units and units,  was proceeding uneventfully. Rear Service units and subunits  were mobilizing somewhat more slowly. A large quantity of motor  vehicles had to be replaced. The fact is that during annual  mobilization training, enterprise directors held back new  high-capacity vehicles for themselves, sending small and even  unserviceable vehicles to the forces in their stead.  Understanding the difficulties of civilian organizations, the  unit commanders shut their eyes to this. But the same situation  was recurring even now, when the mobilization was for real.    The district's air force units had already upgraded to full  combat readiness, and had regrouped to frontier airfields. S. F.  Akhromeyev flew in to Termez by evening and reported that Amin  had been deposed, and that Yaqubi was unruffled by this. No  changes had occurred in the situation in Afghanistan. This  communication didn't relieve the tension completely. Knowing a  little about Afghanistan, I didn't exclude the possibility that  events could develop unpredictably. When I asked who was taking  Amin's place, Sergey Fedorovich replied that he know nothing  about that.    Our group's work plan was updated on the basis of the  information we received. I was ordered to supervise preparation  of the 5th Motorized-rifle Division in Kushka, which was under  the command of Major-General Yu. V. Shatalin. A group of  officers under S. F. Akhromeyev remained in Termez, where it  prepared the army's field administration and the 108th Motorized  Rifle Division.    It should be said that by the time of our arrival the  administration of the 40th Army, which was under Major-General  L. N. Lobanov, was basically manned by district staff officers  and generals, and it was already a fully competent and  sufficiently coordinated organism.    Our work basically consisted of providing assistance to  commanders in developing teamwork and coordination in the  subunits, units and combined units after their mobilization, and  hammering staffs together as administrative bodies. Our task was  made easier by the fact that district officers were already  working in both garrisons, and we were able to unite our efforts  immediately upon arriving in the division.    Let me emphasize that the deployment and preparation of the  forces proceeded almost overtly.    Official directives were received soon after. Their essence  was that in accordance with a treaty of friendship with  Afghanistan, and at the request of its government, Soviet forces  were being introduced into the country to render assistance in  combatting external aggression. No other goals were being  pursued. As soon as the external interference ceased, Soviet  Forces would be withdrawn from the country immediately.    These explanations were perceived with understanding by the  personnel.    On 19 December 1979 S. F. Akhromeyev telephoned me to say  that he had taken ill, and was flying to Moscow. He also  reported that as it turned out, no action was taken against  Amin, but Afghan Army units had been raised to higher combat  readiness, and troops had occupied all key positions in Kabul.  The idea flashed through my mind right away that if this were  true, then introduction of our troops into Afghanistan would  mean war. This is probably why the command opted to deploy one  more motorized rifle division. But these forces were still not  enough to wage war. When I asked whether this information was  dependable, Sergey Fedorovich replied that it needed  confirmation. I gained the impression that he wasn't receiving  sufficient information from Moscow either. I was ordered to  temporarily take charge of the work of the operational group. I  took off for Termez, leaving Colonel L. K. Kotlyar as the senior  officer in the garrison.    There was one question I couldn't get an answer to in  preparing the troops for introduction into Afghanistan: What is  this going to be -- introduction or invasion?    At first glance there may appear to be no difference in the  meaning of these two concepts. But actually the difference  between them is enormous. An invasion is the entry of the armed  forces of one state into the territory of another without the  consent of its leadership. Naturally the invading forces  encounter not only the armed resistance of the other side, but  also the enmity of the people. Usually such actions end in major  military conflicts or war. Introduction is entry of the forces  of one country into the territory of another with the consent or  at the request of its government. The conditions under which the  introduced forces remain in the country are totally different in  this case.    The situation was unclear because a conclusive agreement had  never been reached between the governments of the two states at  the official level. Nonetheless, I thought that this would be a  troop introduction, or that our forces out remain where they  were. After all, conducting an invasion by the forces of two or  three divisions would be absurd. Of course there was also a  third variant--they could announce an introduction, but actually  carry out an invasion. This variant would have been the most  undesirable, and I would say that it would have been  adventuristic and knowingly calamitous.    During our work we became persuaded that the timetable  indicated in most mobilization plans for making the units ready  was unrealistic--the time allowed was extremely short. Moreover  the absence of a program for developing teamwork and  coordination disconcerted many reserve officers, especially  platoon commanders.    We were compelled to develop the needed program right during  mobilization, but we had too little time at our disposal.    I communicated all of my remarks and proposals based on the  mobilization personally to Chief of General Staff Marshal of the  Soviet Union N. V. Ogarkov. He listened to me attentively, and  asked my to put everything I said in writing. Later on most of  our proposals were updated as the mobilization plans were  revised.    In the evening of 23 December I reported the readiness of  the  divisions to march to Chief of General Staff N. V. Ogarkov once  again.    The Marshal informed me that introduction of our forces was  tentatively planned to begin in the second half of 25 December.  The 108th Motorized Rifle division and only the reconnaissance  group of the 5th Motorized Rifle Division were to be committed.  The army staff would remain where it was. For the moment the  40th Army would consist of the 5th and 108th motorized rifle  divisions and the 860th Separate Regiment of the Central Asian  Military District, which was to begin moving out the next day.  The 56th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade was to remain for the  moment at the disposal of the district. The mission would be  announced tentatively tomorrow in the second half of the day.    In the course of the following day we once again checked the  readiness of the 108th Motorized Rifle Division to march. An  order to replace the division commander came in at a totally  inopportune moment. I suggested to General Yu. P. Maksimov that  General K. A. Kuzmin should lead the division into the area  assigned to it, and then transfer it to the new  commander--Colonel V. I. Mironov--after that. Yuriy Pavlovich  agreed with me.    In the second half of 24 December General of the Army V. I.  Varennikov (who was the Chief of the Main Operational  Directorate of the General Staff at that time) telephoned to say  that the Chief of the Operational Administration of the Afghan  Army would arrive in Termez today with a group of officers. The  purpose of his trip was to carry out joint reconnaissance in  order to determine the stationing areas of the Soviet forces in  Afghanistan more precisely. The Commander of the 40th Army was  ordered to meet the delegation and conduct negotiations with it.  There was no recommendation for me to meet with it. Why all of  this secrecy, I didn't know.    The arrival of the Afghan military delegation inspired the  confidence that agreement had been reached on introduction of  our forces into Afghanistan. I knew Lieutenant-General  Babadzhan, chief of the Operational Administration of the Afghan  Army's General Staff, from previous meetings. He assumed this  post upon going over to the side of the revolution. He had  difficulty in handling his duties, and he displayed no business  qualities. He behaved very cautiously. He agreed unquestioningly  with all recommendations of our advisors, but he took no steps  to carry them out, finding excuses one out over every ten times.    Consequently Babadzhan's visit was certainly not on his own  initiative. He would have come only with the permission of Chief  of General Staff Major Yaqubi, who was wholly devoted to Amin.    This was the situation that persuaded me that agreement on  introducing--let me emphasize introducing--our force into  Afghanistan had been reached between the governments of both  countries.    At 0200 on 25 December I reported to Marshal of the Soviet  Union N. V. Ogarkov by high-frequency telephone:    "The 108th Motorized Rifle Division is ready to march. We  are  awaiting receipt of the mission and the time to move out. Please  consider that we will require 6-7 hours to deploy a bridge. We  have worked out all of the details with the Afghan Army  delegation."    "A directive is now being drafted, and after it is signed by  Defense Minister D. F. Ustinov it will be sent to the district,"  reported N. V. Ogarkov. "To set you in the right direction, let  me give you a brief synopsis of it. The internal political  situation in Afghanistan is complex, and it is getting worse. At  the request of the country's government our forces are being  introduced into Afghanistan in order to stabilize the situation,  to free the Afghan Army from protective functions, and to switch  it over to fighting the counterrevolution.    "The force grouping to be introduced includes the 40th Army  (the 108th and 5th motorized rifle divisions, the 860th Separate  Motorized Rifle Regiment, the 56th Separate Airborne Assault  Brigade, the 353d army artillery and 2d surface-to-air missile  brigades; the 103d Airborne Division and the 345th Separate  Airborne Regiment; the 34th Combined Air Corps). In addition the  201st Motorized-rifle Division from the Central Asian Military  District will be advanced to the Kabul sector, and the 68th  Motorized-rifle Division from the Turkestan Military District  will be advanced as reserved to the Kushka sector after  mobilization. (Soon after introduction, the army artillery and  surface-to-air missile brigades and the separate missile  battalions of the two motorized rifle divisions were withdrawn  from Afghanistan.)    "Concurrently with the start of the advance of the 108th  Motorized Rifle Division, the following will land at these  airfields: Bagrame--the 3d Battalion of the 345th Airborne  Regiment; Kabul--the 103d Airborne Division under the command of  Major-General I. Ryabchenko. Aviation will remain in place for  the moment."    The Army Commander and the Division Commander were  immediately informed of this, which made it possible to finish  loading all of the gear into motor transport without haste, to  once again clarify the march computations and the route of  travel, to assign the missions to all the personnel, to clarify  the goals of our introduction, and to form up the columns of  march ahead of time.    On the morning of 25 December I telephoned N. V. Ogarkov to  report that we were set to cross the state border at 1500 Moscow  time (1700 local).    Army Commander Yu. V. Tukharinov was conducting  reconnaissance together with the Afghan delegation at this time.  I was at the District Commander's office when he turned to me  and reported.    "As soon as we landed in Kunduz we went to see Abdullah  Amin,  the older brother of the Head of State, who was responsible for  the northern provinces of Afghanistan. He was sitting as it his  desk when we entered. He didn't rise to his feet, and he didn't  even greet us. He gestured for us to sit down on the couch. The  discussion concerned the disposition of our forces. He had been  informed of their proposed introduction into Afghanistan and  their stationing in the country's north. Abdullah named several  places which I had found to be unsuitable during my inspection.  I would like you, Comrade Commander, to allow us to set up our  camp after first coordinating this matter with local  authorities."    After some thought, Yu. P. Maksimov gave such permission.    At the scheduled time the forward detachment of the 108th  Motorized Rifle Division and the forward echelon of the 103d  Airborne Division crossed the state border into Afghanistan on  land and in the air.    Throughout the entire night of 25-26 December 1979 we  monitored the advance of the division. In the morning of 26  December Colonel B. Ya. Rogontsev, who was traveling together  with the division staff, reported that two regiments had reached  their designated areas 1.5-2 hours ahead of schedule. The march  was proceeding normally. Many of the inhabitants came out to  greet our columns. When they halted, men and boys came up to the  vehicles, displaying a certain amount of interest and  friendship. Yes, that's the way it was. The fact that the  situation changed later on is another matter. But at the time of  introduction of our forces a certain faction of the people  displayed goodwill and cordiality. Colonel Rogontsev then  reported that the highway shown on the map was nonexistent in  the Tash Kurghan-Kunduz section. Its construction had not yet  begun, and in its place was a continuous stretch of dunes.  Consequently, the units that were to be located in the city of  Kunduz took a detour 120-150 kilometers long.    After reporting the situation to Moscow I left for the  airfield, where I met S. L. Sokolov, who had flown in from the  capital. He said that the introduction of our forces was the  subject of much debate in the leadership of the Ministry of  Defense. There were opinions both pro and con. When the final  decision was made, leadership of this operation was assigned to  Sokolov.    On the following day the situation in Kabul changed  dramatically. The so-called "second phase" of the April  revolution began, marked by assassination of the former Chief of  State Amin, Babrak Karmal became the Head of State, the Prime  Minister, the General Secretary of the PDPA [People's Democratic  Party of Afghanistan] and the Supreme Commander-in-Chief.    In order to stabilize the situation in the capital the 108th  Motorized-rifle Division entered it at 1930, while the 5th  Motorized-rifle Division was given the mission of crossing the  state border at 0100 on 28 December 1978 and moving in the  direction of Kushka, Herat and Shindand.    The second day's march was much more difficult than the  first. This was explained not only by the presence of Salang  mountain pass on the route, but also by the absence of maps  among platoon commanders. A road section of around 100 km over  the pass was especially dangerous. The road iced over at night.  Wheeled equipment skidded on the upgrade, while tracked vehicles  slid on the downgrade.    Ventilation in the tunnel was designed to accommodate one  vehicle at a time, but these were continuous columns of armored  equipment with diesel engines. Because of the high density of  fumes the drivers had to put on gas masks; even so, the division  was able to enter Kabul on schedule.    The operational group of the staff of the 40th Army assumed  full control over the two divisions and the two units that  entered Afghanistan. As for what the "second phase" of the  revolution was, and what its content and direction were, no one  could give an answer. The mass media quickly seized upon this  terminology and blared it out without revealing its essence.  Then they soon stopped talking and writing about the "second  phase" of the April revolution as suddenly as they started.    After the 108th and 5th motorized-rifle divisions were  dispatched and control over them and other units that had  entered Afghanistan was transferred to the operational group of  the 40th Army, our group concentrated its efforts on combat  coordination of the 201st and 68th motorized-rifle divisions,  which finished mobilizing and drew up to the state border.    On 4 January 1980 our group, which consisted of 18 persons  headed by Marshal S. L. Sokolov, flew into Kabul. We were met by  a real Russian winter--bright sun, a great deal of snow, and  15-20 degrees of frost.    We were met at the airfield by the new ambassador F. A.  Tabeyev, Afghan Defense Minister Lieutenant Colonel Mohammad  Rafi, Member of the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council Abdul  Kadyr, the new Chief Military Advisor Lieutenant-General S. K.  Magometov and other officials.    We drove straight from the airfield to the embassy. F. A.  Tabeyev, formerly the First Secretary of an oblast committee in  the Tatar ASSR, had just recently arrived in Afghanistan, and  therefore he was not fully informed on the situation, but he  estimated it to be complex and acute. The Ambassador noted that  the country's new leadership was in a developmental stage, and  that it required aid, although attempts were already being made  to infringe upon the rights of PDPA members of the Khalk  faction. This announcement caught our attention. Could it be  that the reverse process was about to begin, in which the  Parcham faction, which was now in power, would enjoy a  privileged position while persecution of the Khalk faction would  begin.    All statements by the ambassador, and especially his  conclusions, were categorical in nature. It felt as if a person  who had become accustomed to ruling was talking. Prior to his  appointment as ambassador, Tabeyev enjoyed the reputation of a  highly placed career party worker, possessing enormous power in  the republic and having grown accustomed to unquestioning  fulfillment of his directives. He was internally convinced that  he would handle his new duties successfully.    In short, in Afghanistan Tabeyev continued to feel himself  to  be more an oblast committee secretary that an ambassador.    On that same day S. L. Sokolov, the Ambassador and I were  received by B. Karmal. He met us very warmly.    Approaching S. L. Sokolov, he inquired after his health,  expressed pleasure in our arrival, and invited all to sit down.  He was extremely gracious in his manners, but a certain  cautiousness could be sensed. The discussion was general--I  would even say introductory.    B. Karmal talked basically about the difficulties he  encountered upon assuming the post of head of state, and about  the kind of aid that would be desirable from our country. It was  evident from everything that the new head of state had not yet  acquired confidence, and was only starting to familiarize  himself with the numerous duties imposed upon him.    Sergey Leonidovich--a heaven-sent diplomat--steered the  discussion very competently, directing it into the needed  channel. He emphasized several times that our forces had been  introduced into Afghanistan to provide moral support to the  country's leadership and to exert a psychological influence upon  antigovernment forces. The troops could take the most important  state facilities under their protection, and free the Afghan  Army to fight the rebels and to strengthen national rule. If  necessary they were ready to provide assistance to Afghan  subunits and units in personnel training and in preparation for  combat activities. As far as concerned supplying arms, combat  equipment and military property to the Afghan Army, this issue  had to be resolved at the government level.    In the evening we talked with generals and officers from the  Administration of the Chief Military Advisor. Information  received from them indicated that the new leadership of the  Democratic Republic of Afghanistan had in principle been  recognized by the officer corps of the Afghan Army, even though  it wasn't in control of the situation in the country yet. After  introduction of our troops, counterrevolutionary forces became  more active in a number of regions, and especially in the  country's northeast. Cases of attacks upon lone vehicles of ours  had already occurred, and the first injuries and deaths  appeared. Antigovernment demonstrations were conducted in  Qandahar. Many corps, division, brigade and regiment commanders  who were members of the Khalk faction of the PDPA were replaced  by officers from the Parcham faction. This act evoked discontent  among officers from the Khalk faction, because it made them  uncertain about the future; hence their inertia and indifference  toward their official duties.    Various panicky rumors began spreading widely through the  army, and many believed them, because no official denials  followed in the forces. The morale of the personnel declined  significantly, and educational work was put on hold.    The information was not reassuring. S. L. Sokolov emphasized  that advisors with the troops were essentially working under  combat conditions. This required great courage on their part. It  is a great credit to them that they prevented conflicts between  Afghan and Soviet forces upon introduction of the latter into  the country.    At the end of his statement Sergey Leonidovich noted:    "I would like to turn special attention to the  impermissibility of drawing Soviet forces into the armed  conflict with the rebels, and that their functions are to be  entirely different, as I already said."    In the morning of the following day we met with the Defense  Minister of Afghanistan. Lieutenant Colonel Mohammad Rafi had  about him the look of independence and, at the same time,  modesty.    S. L. Sokolov informed him of the work we had done, and of  the plans for this next two days; he also offered an estimate of  the state of affairs in the army, and expressed his hope that it  would improve.    It must be said that in terms of the experience of his  previous work and his level of military knowledge, M. Rafi was  not ready for his position as defense minister. Moreover, his  personality didn't stand out in the officer milieu. He was  unknown, and it was difficult for him to count on the support of  the officer corps. But to be fair, Rafi did not overestimate his  strengths, and he did not build any illusions. Even so, he was  unable to master his new responsibilities, and at the end of the  year he was relieved from his position under the pretense of  sending him to a Soviet military academy for training.    During our meeting the minister said little--he did more  listening than talking--and in conclusion he said:    "The Soviet Army's experience is a model for us of how we  need to defend our motherland. Without your assistance it would  be difficult for us to accomplish this task in short order. I am  laying high hopes on Soviet military advisors. They are very  conscientious, and we value their work highly. Please give me  whatever help you can in mastering these new responsibilities of  mine as quickly as possible. We will accept all of your  recommendations gratefully."    Immediately after this meeting we flew to Qandahar, and on  the following day to Bagram, Herat and Shindand, where we spent  some time with three Afghan infantry divisions and with units of  the 5th Motorized-rifle Division under the command of General  Yu. V. Shatalin.    What we saw was not pleasant. For practical purposes the  Afghan divisions did not exist as a single whole.    Subunits were significant distances apart from one another,  and they lacked communication not only among themselves but also  with the staffs of their units.    The local government authorities didn't look any better.  Having no contact with the provincial centers and the capital,  they were left to their own devices. Telephone communication was  disrupted by rebels throughout almost the entire country. The  population received information on the situation in the republic  from the mouths of the clergy, who were mostly opposed to the  revolutionary transformations.    A visit to the Afghan 20th Infantry Division in Bagram left  an especially depressing impression. The 4th Artillery Regiment,  an infantry battalion of the 10th Infantry Regiment, and two  battalions of the 31st Infantry Regiment had gone over to the  rebels as a sign of protest against introduction of our forces.  Only 60 officers out of 130 and around 100 of 1,300 enlisted men  were left in the 31st Infantry Regiment. Only the 24th Infantry  Regiment, located in Faizabad 200-250 km away from the division  headquarters, was still combat worthy.    It was our conclusion that the division had ceased to exist  as a fighting unit.    I had occasion to visit these garrisons during my first  visit  to Afghanistan. Comparing the situation of 2-3 months ago with  the present, I noted a dramatic worsening. The officers were in  confusion. One of the causes of low morale was universal  replacement of senior commanders by oft-unprepared personnel who  were loyal to B. Karmal. The apathy and inertia that spread  among the personnel were intensified even more by all kinds of  panicky rumors. It was obvious that action had to be taken not  only against the rebels but also chiefly against the army's  demoralization.    Of course the situation could not but cause concern in S. L.  Sokolov, and he felt it necessary to share his ideas once again  with Defense Minister M. Rafi. The meeting was held immediately  upon our group's return to Kabul. Sergey Leonidovich acquainted  the minister with his estimate of army affairs, after which he  said:    "The current situation in the army needn't be considered to  be hopeless. The state has sufficient strength to oppose the  rebels. In my opinion the main task of the ministry today is to  reinforce order and organization in the army, and ensure  unquestioning support of the country's new leadership by it.    "We feel that the time has come to activate the armed  struggle of the army against the rebels. After all, they won't  be able to put down the counterrevolution by sitting in their  garrisons."    "Comrade Marshal," M. Rafi turned to S. L. Sokolov, "I would  like to take advantage of your graciousness and ask you to  allocate a few forces from the Soviet troops to fight off rebels  from the 20th Infantry Divisions's artillery depots together  with Afghan subunits. They are located in the population center  of Narin, where an artillery regiment that had gone over to the  enemy's side is deployed."    "We'll help you," replied S. L. Sokolov, "we'll assign one  or  two Soviet subunits to joint actions. But I feel that the return  of the artillery depots is only part of the mission. After all,  not all subunits of the artillery regiment went over to the  rebels. We need to restore its combat worthiness by relying upon  subunits that have remained faithful to the revolution. In  addition, you will probably need to provide assistance in  restoring local bodies of government. By the way, the subsequent  situation in the country may require joint actions of us in a  number of cases. We need to prepare for this. It would be right  for us to take joint steps right now to establish friendly  relations between the personnel of our armies."    We subsequently met on several occasions with the Afghan  Minister of Defense to resolve the most diverse issues, and in  each instance there was full understanding of the existing  problems on his part.

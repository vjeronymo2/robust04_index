			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Boral announces rights issue after 19% advance Boral, the Australian building materials group which last year paid ADollars 830m (USDollars 593m) to acquire the Sagasco energy business, yesterday combined news of a 19.5 per cent increase in first-half profits, before tax and abnormals, with the announcement of a one-for-10 rights issue to raise ADollars 353.7m. Both elements reflected a significant restructuring. The company saw a fairly strong operating performance in the six months to end-December, with sales revenues increasing by 10.9 per cent to ADollars 2.32bn, and operating profits rising to ADollars 213.3m from ADollars 178.5m. Sagasco was included for two months, adding ADollars 10.1m at the operating level, while Azon - Boral's former manufacturing division which was floated off in November - made a five-month contribution of ADollars 17.4m. Geographically, the improvement came from the core Australian business, with North American operating profits dipping to ADollars 1.64m from ADollars 8.09m, and Europe's to ADollars 6.06m from ADollars 8.44m. However, Boral also took a ADollars 265.6m abnormal charge in the first half to cover a range of write-offs, rationalisation and restructuring moves. The largest goodwill write-off applied to the US operations, where Boral says it is looking to become 'more focused'. Goodwill was written off in the resource and clay roof tile operations in Southern California, and a large portion of the resource and clay brick assets will be sold. Smaller amounts of goodwill were written off in Australia, and there were also some large rationalisation provisions there - including one to cover the expected loss on the sale of Boral's collieries business, acquired in 1987 with Blue Circle Southern Cement. The group's total abnormal charge was then offset by the ADollars 121.2m surplus on the Azon sale, leaving a net charge against profits of ADollars 162.2m. This meant that profit after tax and abnormals fell to ADollars 4.61m in the first half, compared with ADollars 102.8m. The rights issue, pitched at ADollars 3.60 a share, is designed to return Boral's gearing to 'normal' levels. In the wake of the Sagasco deal, it rose to 72.5 per cent at end-1993, but will reduce to about 50 per cent after the rights issue money is received. The company said a more normal gearing level would give it flexibility to pursue any opportunities.</p>

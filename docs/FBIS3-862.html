Mr. Dhlakama has been  shunned by many regional leaders since the peace pact in 1992  ended the 16-year-old civil war between Renamo and the  Mozambican government. A report from Harare quotes a Mozambican  official as saying that President Robert Mugabe and President  Joaquim Chissano have appealed to African leaders to put aside  their hostility towards Mr. Dhlakama to promote peace in  southern Africa.</p>

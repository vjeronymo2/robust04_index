			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Only Death Will Be Given to </F> Provokers"]    [Text] The war hysteria of the South Korean puppets for  the new war provocation has reached an extreme point. As was  already reported, the so-called puppet prime minister -- who  visited the puppet Joint Chiefs of Staff on 25 March and openly  agitated for national reunification through a northward invasion  by ordering it to be in thorough readiness -- visited the puppet  frontline Army units on 26 March and the police stations in  Seoul on 27 March and ordered them to assume a thorough  readiness, to thoroughly maintain public peace and order, and to  be alert. This shows how the puppets are unsteady in their mind  for their Northward invasion.    As everyone knows, the present situation on the Korean  peninsula is rushing to the dangerous phase of a touch-and-go  situation [ilchokchugbalui wihomhan kungmyon]. The puppets, who  intentionally blocked North-South dialogue, held successive  meetings -- such as the so-called meeting of security-related  ministers and the meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- to  formulate war plots as if they are waiting for an opportunity  and have babbled about a so-called retaliation or the security  posture. Also, they have decided on the deployment of Patriot  missiles to South Korea and on the resumption of the Team Spirit  nuclear war exercise and ordered all puppet armed forces to be  put on alert.    In this situation, the Kim Yong-sam clique visited the  Japanese reactionaries and plotted to crush [apsal] our republic  in collusion with outside forces, thus talking about the  cooperative system or sanctions.    Also, the United States has largely mobilized its aggressive  arms, including nuclear aircraft carriers, to South Korea and  the sea areas surrounding South Korea. By so doing, the United  States conducts nuclear war exercises -- in the sky, land, and  sea of South Korea -- aimed at us every day. These serious  situations created by the South Korean puppets, with the U.S.  imperialists, will never be a thing that can be overlooked.    According to the recent remarks by the puppet national  defense minister, the puppets formulated a northward invasion  war plan, the so-called New Operational Plan 5027, made up of a  five-stage operational concept, with the United States in  September 1993. The bustling military movement that has been  shown recently in South Korea is a part of its schemes to put  the adventurous Northward invasion war plan into practice.    After artificially creating an obstacle to the working-level  delegate's contacts for the exchange of special envoys appointed  by the North-South highest authorities, the puppets have finally  broken them up. Needless to say, it is clear that their purpose  is a deliberate plot based on their criminal intention to do  harm to the fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces  under the so-called nuclear issue.    The Kim Yong-sam ring is the servant of the U.S.  imperialists' nuclear war, as well as the vicious national  betrayers who want to maintain their dirty lives in return for  their act of making the nation become the victim of a nuclear  war, thus only being a shock brigade for the imperialists' war  of aggression regardless of the destiny of their country and  nation. It is natural that trouble causes trouble.    As shown by all these facts, the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique  has actually plotted to provoke the northward invasion war and  to ignite a fire on the point of a war. Under these conditions,  there is no guarantee that a war will not be waged in any place  on the Korean peninsula [chosonbandoeso chonjaengi tojiji  anhuriranun tambonun odiedo opsupnida].    In collusion with outside forces, the Kim Yong-sam ring has  plotted to irritate [kondurida] our republic by eagerly seeking  an opportunity for the northward invasion. These are foolish  and indiscriminate remarks and acts.    Our people want peace, but will not beg for it. Also, they  do not want war, but will never be afraid of it. If the puppets  force us to carry out war, our people and our People's Army will  rise up as one to retaliate the aggressors in tens thousandfold  and safeguard socialism of our own style to the end. Only a  bitter defeat and tragic death will be given to provokers. This  is a lesson learned from the Korean war waged in the early  1950's.    The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique must clearly know that their  war provocation is just the way to their shameful destruction,  and they must not act recklessly.</p>

The memorandum asked about the  significance of that statement which ran contrary to a number of  basic principles in the peace negotiations, in particular  denoting a clear change in the U.S. line regarding the basis on  which the Madrid peace conference was held, and which also ran  contrary to the clear provisions of the UN Security Council  resolutions, especially Resolutions 242 and 338 which stipulate  that Israel should fully withdraw from all the Arab territories  occupied in 1967 including Jerusalem.    Informed Arab and Palestinian sources in Cairo have stated  that Washington's position on occupied Jerusalem requires a  reconsideration of the Arab positions on the peace negotiations  with a need for clear guarantees in this connection.    The sources said that the current intensive consultations  with the PLO are not expected to yield clear results regarding  resumption of the negotiations with Israel unless the issue of  Jerusalem is resolved and guarantees are given that the issue of  Jerusalem will still be on the agenda of the negotiations. The  sources added that, in these consultations, the PLO declared its  rejection of any change in the status of Jerusalem, emphasizing  that the issue should be included in the provisions of the new  [draft] agreement before the resumption of negotiations with  Israel.</p>

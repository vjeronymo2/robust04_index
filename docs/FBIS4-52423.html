			<p>BFN     [Text] Our country's ambassador O Song-hwan paid a farewell  call to Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro on 29 April. At  the meeting the ambassador conveyed the greetings of the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il to President Violeta Chamorro.    The president expressed deep thanks for the greetings and  asked the ambassador to deliver his warm greetings to the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il.    The president said that Korea's reality shows that the road  of socialism chosen by the Workers' Party of Korea and the  Korean people under President Kim Il-song's wise leadership is  very just. He continued: The world admires the changes taking  place in Korea today. Korea has become a most powerful country  by embodying the principles of independence in politics,  self-reliance in economics, and self-defense in national  defense. The Korean people's potential is inexhaustible and no  one can match the Korean people's strength. The development of  friendly relations between Nicaragua and Korea will be eternal  in the future. We will actively support in the future the  Korean people's struggle for the realization of the country's  reunification.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Battle for RWE set to intensify A struggle for effective control of RWE, Germany's largest utility group, could intensify after the appointment today of a new chairman. Mr Dietmar Kuhnt, chairman of RWE Energie, a subsidiary of the group, will succeed Mr Friedhelm Gieske, who will formally retire next January. Mr Kuhnt will inherit an anachronistic voting system which gives Germany's 64 municipalities voting powers disproportionate to the size of their holdings. The municipalities account for 58.9 per cent of the total votes, but hold 29.3 per cent of the share capital. Mr Gieske had already indirectly supported a group of private investors who in 1992 had attempted, but failed, to abolish the majority voting powers of the municipalities. 'If we want to become a truly international company, then we must have a share holding and voting system which complements our international activities,' one RWE shareholder said. Nearly 84 per cent of RWE's capital stock is German-held, and less than 10 per cent is held by foreign investors. The municipalities have since resisted change and are reported to have opposed Mr Gieske's initial support of Mr Hans-Peter Keitel, the 46-year-old chairman of Hochtief, the construction division of RWE, on the grounds that Mr Keitel might try to reform the voting system, while Mr Kuhnt would prefer consensus. Even though Mr Gieske will no longer be board chairman after next January, the municipalities are aiming to end his influence over RWE by trying to block his nomination to the supervisory board. , The municipalities hold five of the 19 seats on the supervisory board. The board will meet next October to decide if it will recommend Mr Gieske's appointment to RWE's annual general meeting in December. Even if it does, the municipalities' majority vote could prevail, which would postpone any fundamental change in RWE's voting structure.</p>

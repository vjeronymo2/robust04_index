			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / 'Tulip' failed to bloom for Stasi dirt diggers IT had to happen: somebody somewhere has found Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's erstwhile all-but-immortal foreign minister, in the files of East Germany's former Ministry of State Security, the feared Stasi. However, there is a nice twist to this particular story of the perfidy of the East German secret police. According to Der Spiegel, Germany's fearlessly investigative and occasionally muck-raking weekly magazine, former Stasi officers have passed to the (west) German secret service the devastating information that Mr Genscher was known in the Stasi files as 'Tulip'. Or rather. . . that was the code-name for a purported 'collaborator' of the all-powerful East German spy network, deliberately made to look like the long-time leader of the Free Democrats in West Germany. The magazine does not suggest for a moment that Mr Genscher, whose name has been frequently mentioned as a possible successor to Mr Richard von Weizsacker as the next state president, was actually a collaborator. The whole purpose, according to Der Spiegel, was to prepare the ground for a potential campaign to discredit Mr Genscher when the time was ripe. The file was fleshed out with details from the genuine career of an East German citizen, which were then simply applied to Mr Genscher. The former foreign minister, who retired without real explanation in April after 18 years in office, was always seen as a potential and indeed ideal target for the East German security services. He comes from the east, having been born in Halle, which he left for the west in 1952. Thereafter he always remained a frequent visitor to friends and relations there. The 'Tulip' file was finally destroyed by the East Germans at the beginning of the 1980s, it says. The reason was that Mr Genscher, a lifelong proponent of detente, 'was not pursuing any policy contrary to the goals of the GDR'.</p>

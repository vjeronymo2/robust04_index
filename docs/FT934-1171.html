			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Wanamaker's dream lives on 'It's business as usual. The Globe will open in April 1995, just as Sam would have wished.' That was the predictably defiant stance from the Shakespeare Globe Trust yesterday as it came to terms with the death over the weekend of Sam Wanamaker, the US actor who devoted the last 24 years of his life to building a new Globe Theatre on London's Bankside. The replica is within yards of the location of the Elizabethan Globe, the theatre which Shakespeare part-owned and which first staged many of his plays. Mr Wanamaker, who had been suffering from cancer for many years, died aged 74 just as the Pounds 20m project, the source of many disappointments and setbacks, was starting to rise on the south bank of the Thames. The first eight bays of the 20-bay theatre, with wooden walls, a thatched roof, and open to the sky, were unveiled last January. Mr Wanamaker was winning over his opponents. The original hostility of Southwark Council to the scheme has turned to support. Business was backing him. The Globe Trust has raised Pounds 10m, and only another Pounds 2m is needed to complete the 1,500-place theatre. But a further Pounds 8m is needed to finish the one-acre site and make the project's financial future more certain. The planned pub and restaurant, 300-seat studio theatre, Shakespeare museum and library, and offices should ensure its viability. The recent discovery of the remains of the original Globe and Rose theatres has increased interest in the area. An Underground station at Southwark on the new line to Canary Wharf will bring an audience close to the Globe, and there is a good chance that the Tate Gallery of Modern Art will be built alongside it at Bankside. Mr Wanamaker must have died with his faith in his life's work intact.</p>

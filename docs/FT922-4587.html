			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Observer: Travelling strife A cause of many strained if not broken romances may soon be explained, thanks to experiments at the US University of Rochester. The trouble arises on unfamiliar car journeys when either a woman or a man is driving to instructions given by the other, and misses the specified turning. 'I said fork right, not left,' explodes the male - or 'I said go to the town hall and turn along the front of it, not up by the art gallery,' protests the female - each concluding that the other is an idiot. Not so, suggests Rochester researcher Thomas Bever. It seems likely that the two sexes have essentially different navigating systems. His tests over four years with students as well as rats indicate that males typically find their way by 'mapping out' space in their heads, thinking of journeys as consisting of so much distance in one direction, then so much more in another, and so on. By contrast, females tend to navigate by visible landmarks. Either way, the two sexes seem equally good at getting to the right destination, says Bever. It's just that, in this as so much else, they are incompatible.</p>

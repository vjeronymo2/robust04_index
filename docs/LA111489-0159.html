			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STOCKMAN SAYS MEDIA IS JAPAN BASHING  </P> <P> Backlash against Japanese direct investment in the United States is a "media  preoccupation of the week" and will have no lasting political effects, former  White House budget director David Stockman said today.  </P> <P> Stockman is now a partner in a private investment bank, The Blackstone Group,  which helped engineer the recent Sony Corp. takeover of Columbia Pictures  Entertainment Inc.  </P> <P> In a speech to a reporters' group here he predicted that a decline in U.S.  reliance on foreign capital and a lack of grass-roots political concern over  Japanese merger and acquisition moves will gradually take the issue off the  public agenda.  </P> <P> Stockman said most Japanese direct investment does not have enough impact on  voter sentiment to have any real effect on Congress, and that as Japanese  spending is diffused through the economy, reaction will become increasingly  favorable.  </P> <P> "The negatives of direct investment are not as obvious as they are in trade,"  he said.  </P> <P> "No one is going to throw out a senator because he didn't take a forthright  stand against Japanese direct investment."  </P> <P> Stockman also predicted that the dramatic easing of East-West tensions will  result in U.S. defense spending being cut from about 7% of gross national  product now to no more than 4% in 1993.  </P> <P> That could relieve the current account deficit and cut the U.S. need for  foreign capital by about $150 billion a year, he said. "The defense cuts will  gather enormous momentum and will make the budget deficit manageable," he said.  </P> <P> He said the current concern over Japanese direct investment was almost entirely  "headline-activated" during a period when there was a vacuum of other things  for the media to be preoccupied with.  </P> <P> "Eastern Europe will now displace other issues on the front burner of  attention," he said.  </P> <P> He said the level of Japanese direct investment in the United States is too  minimal to be considered an invasion, and is not likely to grow significantly.  </P></p>

Vietnam's  forests cover 8.4 million hectares, and have a timber reserve of  657.3 million cubic metres and about 5.5 billion bamboo trees.  Of the reserve, timber [word indistinct] bamboo in production  [words indistinct] 62 percent and 70 percent respectively. Half  of the timber is found in the central highlands and more than  20 percent is in the central coast areas. The [words  indistinct] the size of protected forests increases every year,  while production forests decline. This is because the rate of  destruction is quicker than the growth rate of the trees.    Forests in Vietnam have suffered serious devastation over  the  past several decades, partly to bombardments and U.S. chemicals  spraying during the Vietnam war, but mostly by indiscriminate  tree felling for fuel, cultivation and construction, about  [words indistinct]. This has led to a higher frequency of  droughts and floods due to soil erosion, particularly areas on  the coast.    Defoliant used by the U.S. have deprived Vietnam's forests  of  around 75 million cubic metres of timber worth billion of  dollars.    To curb this alarming rate of deforestation, the best  approach is to rely on the force of the population. The number  living in the forest land is now estimated at 22 million persons.    Efforts have been made in recent years to allocate areas of  forest for the long-term use of each farmer household. However,  the results have been limited. Only 13,800 hectares with a  timber reserve of 338,000 cubic metres have been allotted to  families</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> THOSE ARE NO FISH TALES IN MANILA'S TABLOIDS, JUST ASK THE VIRGIN MARY NEXT  TIME  </P> <P> Extra, extra, read all about it: Woman gives birth to fish!  </P> <P> If that's too tame, how about randy spooks impregnating maidens? Or perhaps a  "routine" appearance by the Virgin Mary?  </P> <P> Such reports are a staple of Manila's lively tabloids, among the most widely  read of the city's more than 20 dailies.  </P> <P> In a country where the truth is often bizarre enough, English- and  Tagalog-language tabloids dish out fantasy and flamboyance for those who find  the broadsheet dailies too tame.  </P> <P> The latest titillation was the saga of "Goldfish Flores Pascua," a 6-inch-long  mudfish supposedly "born" to Lilian Pascua, 22, of Paniqui in Tarlac province.  </P> <P> Several Manila tabloids reported that Pascua gave birth to the fish on March 31  and named it "Goldfish." Tabloids splashed pictures of "Goldfish," swimming in  a water basin, and its "parents" on their front pages.  </P> <P> For several days, tabloids regaled their readers with details of the couple's  plans to baptize the fish on Palm Sunday, despite healthy skepticism by local  officials.  </P> <P> "I think a fish should not be baptized and registered because it doesn't even  have the resemblance of a man," said Paniqui Mayor Cesar Cuchapin.  </P> <P> The baptism controversy was resolved when tabloids reported last week that  "Goldfish's" short but celebrated life had come to an end. It was eaten by the  family dog.  </P> <P> With "Goldfish" now history, the tabloid Ang Pilipino Ngayon, or Filipino  Today, reported that an 8-year-old boy had given birth by Cesarean section in a  hospital in Pampanga province. The baby, a boy, was stillborn, the tabloid  reported.  </P> <P> Not to be scooped, Manila radio station DZXL telephoned the hospital and spoke  with an official, who confirmed that something resembling a fetus had been  extracted from the boy.  </P> <P> "How could he give birth when he is only 8 years old," the reporter asked,  apparently more curious over age than the sex peculiarity. The official was at  a loss for a response.  </P> <P> Many of the far-fetched reports play on traditions of mysticism and  superstition which run deep in this predominantly Roman Catholic country.  </P> <P> "Goldfish" attracted almost as much attention as a teen-aged girl in Laguna  province, who the tabloids reported two years ago became pregnant by the spirit  of a 19th-Century cleric.  </P> <P> Apparitions by the Virgin Mary are frequently reported, although the church  hierarchy tends to give them little credence. The most recent was reported last  year, when the Virgin supposedly appeared in a coconut grove southeast of  Manila.  </P></p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Running a risk is the point: Jonathan Young on the horsey set THERE IS little to match the English beauty of polished chestnuts, led by equally polished brunettes, at Newmarket's July meeting. Unfortunately this is Rembrandt beauty: we all appreciate it, but few can possess it. Wealth beyond the dreams of Ferraris is needed to own even a moderately fast thoroughbred. Yet it is possible to enter the owners' enclosure for as little as Pounds 5,000 - if the enclosure exists. Such a sum will buy you a whole horse for point-to-pointing rather than a share of a hoof in a dodgy flat-racing syndicate. There is, of course, a drawback. Pop four bottles of fizz when your horse wins by a nod, and that will be the end of the winnings. Top prize, in bookie parlance, is just four 'ponies': Pounds 100. That does not deter point-to-pointers. Quite the opposite. The sport's poverty restricts the appeal to those who appreciate the sport. The fashion nuances of the cocktail-clad at Ascot's Ladies' Day do not trouble those swaddled in puffas, paddling around in milking-parlour gumboots. It is cold and very horsey: the two essential ingredients of English country life. Throughout the spring, thousands of horse-owners, admirers, riders and gamblers will be attending the 202 meetings at 117 courses countrywide. The better horses travel the circuit with their owners, and these are carefully marked down as likely candidates for Pounds 5 on the head. The race-card gives form: 'error-prone'; 'moody'; 'moderate at best' are the customary, unforgiving descriptions of the outsiders. (Their jockeys' faults, sadly, are not documented.) With such sketchy details, most betting is as scientific as laying money on a fly's climb up a window. The one secure guideline, as disclosed by a book-maker last Saturday, is: 'do your maffs'. With rare exceptions, bookies know the form, such as it is, and their assessment of the odds is usually spot on. Most of the money, though, goes on competing friends and family rather than on the horses. As the Irish have it, the jockeys are riding 'for the crack'. (Often, literally.) Most so-called dangerous sports, such as mountain-climbing, car-racing or parachuting, have a degree of injury potential. It does not compare with the risks run by the average point-to-point rider. The danger is proportional to the fitness of horse and jockey. To qualify, the rules demand that pointers spend six days' hunting - developing both stamina and jumping experience. But although hunting demands the utmost in courage and stamina, the sport is following hounds, and hounds seldom gallop flat out over jumpable country. The Tweseldown point-to-point course stretches just over three miles, with 19 steeplechase fences, each 4ft 3in, between start and finish. It is a hard test of horse and rider. Few fail to complete the first circuit; the second mile is the test, as exhaustion forces mistakes and inexperience pushes riders on when they should pull up. Tragedies can occur. All entries were going well at the fourth race at an Army point-to-point at Tweseldown in February. They cleared the ninth fence, and were 15 yards clear before the chestnut in the centre inexplicably stumbled, cartwheeled and fell, legs twitching, on top of its rider. Both lay still, the horse with a broken spine, the jockey concussed. The rest of the field swung round, oblivious, cleared the eighth and galloped down to clear the ninth, beyond which lay the prone bodies. An attempt by the stewards to divert the field was unsuccessful, and in the melee a second horse and rider lay still on the ground. This time it was the horse that had the wind knocked out of it and the jockey who was damaged: Simon Cobden, an undergraduate about to take his finals, had his cheekbone fractured and a broken arm. Both riders were taken away by ambulance. So was another rider in the following race. Simon Cobden's hospital ward was half-filled with Tweseldown casualties. It was a ghastly moment, and it underlined the risks. Nothing can compete with the silky elegance of the Classic flat-races or the professional jump jockeys assaulting the Grand National. But for old-fashioned guts and esprit, there is nothing to beat a point-to-point. INFORMATION: The next point-to-points at Tweseldown, Aldershot, are on April 18 (1.30pm). Local hunts hold point-to-points throughout the spring and advertise in the local press. Entrance about Pounds 10 a car. Vacuum flasks, sweaters and gumboots essential.

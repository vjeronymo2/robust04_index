			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Polish Elections: Suchocka spells out successes to voters POLAND'S outgoing government is passing on to its as yet unknown successor a better managed, more prosperous and more secure country than it inherited only 14 months ago, Ms Hanna Suchocka, the acting prime minister, declared yesterday. But, in her valedictory message three days before Sunday's general elections, she warned that any deviation from strict controls on government spending or slowing down of privatisation would jeopardise post-communist Poland's gains. It would lead to higher inflation, slower growth and affect Poland's prospects for full entry into the EC and Nato, she added. Speaking the day before the last Russian soldier was due to leave Polish soil, Ms Suchocka reminded Poles that four years ago the country was still occupied by thousands of Soviet troops and on the edge of hyper-inflation. Since then the framework of a market economy had been put in place. She cited, among the achievements, the creation of an internally convertible currency. With polls showing strong gains for left-wing parties catering to those who have gained least from a market democracy, Ms Suchocka singled out high unemployment as the main problem.</p>

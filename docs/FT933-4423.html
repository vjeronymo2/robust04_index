			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / World Trade News: European Car Industry THE agreement between the European Commission and Japan on the level of Japanese car sales in Europe, and Japanese carmakers' interpretation of the deal, was 'unacceptable and suicidal for the European car industry,' Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of Peugeot Citroen, said yesterday at the Frankfurt motor show, writes Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent. Mr Calvet called for a 'comprehensive renegotiation' of the agreement, reached in 1991 and put into force at the beginning of this year, or for a freeze on Japanese market share in the EC.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>   [Excerpt] Amman--The nearly 800 Palestinian policemen  camped near the King Husayn Bridge will begin their entry to the  occupied West Bank town of Jericho on Thursday [12 May], four  days after the first units arrived there, Palestine Liberation  Organnisation (PLO) officials said Wednesday.    They said negotiations between PLO and Israeli officials in  the occupied territories as well as contacts between the Israeli  government and the PLO leadership in Tunis had led to an  understanding that the deployment could begin Thursday.    One of the key preconditions, according to reports from  occupied Jerusalem and Tunis, is that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat  announce his autonomy cabinet which will run the occupied Gaza  Strip and Jericho in the initial phase of the Sept. 13  Israel-PLO agreement signed in Washington.    As the first concrete step towards the deployment, several  senior officials from the police force, drawn from units of the  Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) based in Jordan and Iraq,  entered Jericho on Wednesday to inspect areas designated for the  police force to take up positions, the PLO officials said. They  returned to the East Bank later in the day.    "We expect the deployment to begin in earnest on Friday,"  said a PLO official. "An advance unit of a few officers and men  will enter on Thursday, but the actual entry will formally begin  24 hours later."    Brigadier Haj Isma'il Jabr, commander-designate of Jericho,  said "a platoon of my forces will be allowed into Jericho at an  early hour Thursday morning." A platoon consists of 50 men.    "A second batch of approximately 300 men will be allowed  into  Jericho Thursday afternoon to be followed by nearly 400 men on  Friday," Brig. Jabr told the Associated Press.    Brig. Isma'il blamed the four-day delay in the entry into  Jericho on technical problems--primarily that some of the men  did not possess travel documents.    "The main problem was because some of the policemen do not  have any travel documents, such as passports or identification  cards," he said.    He refused to disclose their number or how the problem was  solved.    But a security source,quoted by the AP, estimated the number  at 100 and said the Kingdom had agreed to provide them with  Jordanian passports.    Highly-placed PLO sources described the delay as a tactic by  the Israelis. "They want to tell us that nothing has changed by  the peace agreement and they are still in control," said one  source.    "Keeping the force camped out near the bridge under  international media limelight is their way of telling us that  they still call the shots," said the source. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> FOOT PATROL OFFERS NEW PERSPECTIVE  </P> <P> Police Officer Harald Martin says a cop needs more than a sharp eye to function  in the city's crime- and poverty-plagued Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood.  </P> <P> A cop also needs empathy and patience, Martin says, to work in this urban  ghetto nestled behind Disneyland.  </P> <P> "The Police Department can band-aid any problem," Martin said on a recent  afternoon walk through the neighborhood. "Whereas if you change the  neighborhood from the inside, you can correct it."  </P> <P> Martin is something of a one-man show, patrolling on foot through the tiny,  overcrowded neighborhood where just over 100 large apartment buildings are  crammed onto four small streets and up to a dozen people can be found living in  nearly any one-room apartment.  </P> <P> Under a two-year state grant totaling $225,000, plus $32,500 from the city,  Martin and code enforcement officer Roger Bennion have been hired to patrol the  neighborhood full time.  </P> <P> It is a neighborhood in which the aroma of home-style Latin cooking fills the  air, bringing a cozy calm to the poor, dirty streets.  </P> <P> Martin is a little bit of everything that it takes to work in this  neighborhood: He's part social worker, part counselor, part code enforcer, part  officer. In his book, a good cop isn't one who arrests every lawbreaker he  sees, but one who can teach the minor offenders how to act lawfully.  </P> <P> "This is a different approach," he said. "It isn't police work, because police  work, in the long run, doesn't cut the mustard."  </P> <P> Last October, a pilot six-month program combined the efforts of daily police  foot patrols, code enforcement officers and community services personnel and  succeeded in greatly reducing crime and improving the area.  </P> <P> A community center was established in one of the apartment buildings, offering  social services ranging from low-income cooking classes to recreation for the  hundreds of children who have no yard to play in after school.  </P> <P> But when the funding was gone and police patrols ended last April, many of the  problems they had chased away returned. Gang graffiti again covered walls,  bottle shards littered streets, and drug dealing resumed, as did fights and  gunshots.  </P> <P> But the six-month experiment had been so successful, while it lasted, that it  became the model for the Community Action Policing Team, a similar citywide  task force now in operation. It also won new funding to continue the officers'  work in Jeffrey-Lynne.  </P> <P> When Martin took a recent tour of about 20 of the apartment buildings, he found  that just a few of the landlords had finished correcting such problems as  corroded bathrooms, faulty plumbing and cockroach infestation.  </P> <P> Residents like Angie Raudales, 17, a mother of two who has seen the  neighborhood's transitions, are doubtful that Martin and Bennion can overcome  the problems.  </P> <P> Still, the idea of an officer on full-time patrol is reassuring, she said.  </P> <P> "He'll know the faces. He'll know what's going on. It worked in the beginning;  maybe it will work again," she said.  </P> <P> One recent afternoon, Martin came across a typical sight on the neighborhood  streets: a group of men sitting outside in the shade enjoying a beer after  work.  </P> <P> "No cerveza aqui," Martin told them. They didn't budge much, but when he said  that there would be about a $100 fine if they were cited, they scooped up their  drinks and headed into an apartment.  </P> <P> Martin said he realizes that men like these are hot and tired after a day's  work and that they would rather drink beer outside than in a dingy, stuffy  apartment cramped with other people who live there. So he doesn't cite them but  warns them, remembering their faces in case there is a next time.  </P> <P> That same afternoon, he found two young men drinking beer in an alley behind a  shed known as a former drug hangout. Tiny papers that once held heroin and  cut-off soda cans used for heating the drug still littered the ground.  </P> <P> Martin asked the men if they were residents of the nearby apartment complex,  and both said they were, even though their driver's licenses said otherwise.  Although he didn't cite them for drinking beer in the alley, Martin took their  names for his own record.  </P> <P> "It's going to be the people who are going to have to do all the work," he  said. "Once they see there are changes being made, I think I can get them to  buy into the idea that they can make a difference too."LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

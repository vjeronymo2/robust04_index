			<p>BFN     [Text] After an infernal day yesterday, in the evening the  aggressor continued barbarously shelling civilian populated  places in the free Zvornik territory until late last night.  Kovacevici and Vitinica were shelled with T-55 tanks from  Androvici, Sapna was shelled with 120-mm mortars from Kiseljak,  and houses were destroyed in Godus with a 205-mm howitzer from  the direction of Celopek. A multiple rocket launcher operated  at the Medjedja region from the direction of Kiseljak launching  projectiles of huge destructive power. Five civilians,  including three children less than 10 years old, were wounded as  a result of this special chetnik shelling.    Our defense positions were also exposed to constant fire  from  all kinds of weapons and artillery pieces. In the morning, the  shelling with the most destructive long-range artillery pieces  continued, but despite this, defense lines have remained firm  and unchanged.    This was a report by the Information Service of the 206th  Chivalrous Brigade of Zvornik for the Radio and Television of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

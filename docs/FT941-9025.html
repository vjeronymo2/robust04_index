			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Craxi pursues communist vendetta: Former Italian premier tries to tarnish the left Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader facing an array of corruption charges, has celebrated the second anniversary of the Milan magistrates' anti-corruption crusade by handing the authorities a dossier on the illicit financing of his political enemies on the left. The vendetta is aimed at Italy's former Communist party and its heir, the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) in an attempt to tarnish the PDS with the same corrupt image as the other traditional parties in the run-up to the March elections. The dossier may lead to investigation of several senior PDS politicians. Mr Massimo D'Alema, the PDS number two, yesterday called on Rome magistrates at his own initiative to clarify the matter. Later Mr D'Alema said Mr Craxi was being sued for libel, adding: 'It is unheard of in any civilised country for a politician to go and denounce his adversaries with baseless accusations.' Throughout the corruption scandals, the PDS has sought to distance itself from the behaviour of the post-war ruling parties. Party officials have insisted those members charged with corruption were marginal players. Party members accused of corruption or illicit party financing have always claimed they were acting in a personal capacity. This was the case this week when Mr Renato Morandina, a councillor in the Veneto region, admitted receiving L200m (Pounds 81,030) from a Fiat subsidiary. Mr Craxi and some of his colleagues claim the magistrates have been soft on the left. This is also the view of media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's election propaganda. Mr Berlusconi recently secured for his Forza Italia movement the candidature of Ms Tiziana Parenti, who was forced out of the Milan magistrates' investigative team. She says this was because she investigated too aggressively the affairs of the PDS. Mr Craxi is determined to prove the Communists (PCI) received substantial funds from Moscow and enjoyed illicit financial support through deals with party-controlled co-operatives in northern Italy. In turn he has justified the taking of bribes by Socialists by the need to raise funds to fight communism. Since the scandals broke two years ago, 2,993 have been arrested, and 338 deputies are under investigation. Yesterday parliament agreed to waive immunity on Mr Gianni De Michelis, the former Socialist foreign minister, and Mr Gianni Prandini, the Christian Democrat former transport minister, to face corruption charges.</p>

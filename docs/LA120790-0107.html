			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> CATHEDRAL'S 'GLORY' STILL DAZZLES  </P> <P> The Crystal Cathedral's annual Christmas pageant, "The Glory of Christmas," is  celebrating its 10th anniversary, and the drawing power of this living creche  extravaganza seems undiminished.  </P> <P> Sparing no gilt, the $2-million retelling of the birth of Christ is an  eye-popping curio maximus -- a clumsy script dressed in spectacular finery  (costumes, sets and lights are by Richard Bostard, Charles Lisanby, Perry  Halford and Terry Larson, respectively) and musical anachronisms (by  arranger/musical director Johnnie Carl) that come soaring through  state-of-the-art equipment.  </P> <P> It is attended by dozens of supernumeraries, a live menagerie (lambs, goats,  sheep, horses, donkeys, dromedaries, an ox and a cow), eight trumpeting heralds  and an aerie of angels made to fly through the cathedral's expanse, like so  many Peter Pans ("Hark, the herald angels swing. . . .")  </P> <P> Paul Dunn's direction may be too reverential, the choreography (Dorie Lee  Mattson) may have nothing to do with events on stage, Buddy Adler may be more  crazed Quasimodo than Herod in his overreaction, and the Christmas hymns and  carols (including "Greensleeves") may be AD variations played in BC time, but  spectacle, not historical detail, is the bottom line. And the singers can  really sing, especially Joseph (Robin Buck), Mary (Debbie Smith), shepherdess  Henrietta Davis and the children (Christopher Parker, Lyndie Nitkin, Tara  Sinclair).  </P> <P> Cecil B. De Mille, who was surely the model, might well be envious.  </P> <P> "The Glory of Christmas," Crystal Cathedral, 12141 Lewis St., Garden Grove,  Tuesdays to Sundays, 4:30, 6:30, 8:30 p.m. No performances Dec. 24 and 25. Ends  Dec. 30. $12 to $25; (714) 54-GLORY. Running time: 1 hour, 10 minutes.  </P> <P> </P></p>

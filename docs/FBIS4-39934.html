			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Federation Council Speaker Vladimir </F> Shumeyko by INTERFAX observer Dmitriy Voskoboynikov; place and  date not given; from the "Novosti-Plyus" program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Voskoboynikov] [Passage omitted: Dmitriy  Voskoboynikov recaps recent developments related to Russia's  regional policy: Yeltsin's visit to Tatarstan; Yuriy Skokov's  meeting with presidents of Chuvashia, Tatarstan, and  Bashkortostan in Cheboksary; election of another State Duma  deputy speaker]    In the final analysis, even the conflict between the State  Duma and the Federation Council over the budget arose, I  believe, from differing attitudes to the interests of the  regions. Little wonder, really, since there is no unity at the  top in attitudes to the provinces. An increasing number of  analysts note that the role of a man capable of defining a  common denominator could be played by Federation Council  Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko. This week he held a major  conference with leaders of representative bodies of authority  from numerous regions of Russia.    [Shumeyko] There are classic features of a federation.  First, it is a state made up of independent regions. Second,  each independent part of a federal state has its own  legislation. Finally, following the adoption on 12 December 1993  of the Constitution, we have the last classic feature: A federal  state has a bicameral parliament, with one chamber directly  protecting the interests of the regions. Therefore, what I have  read in the papers of late, claims that Shumeyko is preoccupied  with something, with some sort of presidential elections, and so  he has become involved and has organized a party of the  regions--this is all completely groundless.    [Voskoboynikov] If we were to single out the most serious  problem in relations between the center and the regions, what  would you say it was?    [Shumeyko] The most important one is probably the budget. A  budget is necessarily political. It manifests the policy of the  state. This is the purpose of a budget. It is not a sum of  arithmetical operations. The arguments we often hear about the  budget nowadays concentrate on figures. But the important thing  is not the figures. For instance, everyone says that the  Federation Council and Shumeyko want to ingratiate themselves  with the military, and that is why they insist on these figures.  But that is not the point. The point is that for 33 regions,  the defense sector forms the basis of their industry. The same  defense industry into which all the potential of the former  Soviet Union used to be directed.    Whatever we say, the State Duma reflects the political  structure of the state. Half of its deputies were elected on  party tickets. They adopted the budget on the basis of  consensus. The faction leaders got together and reached  political consensus. But thank God, or maybe unfortunately,  parties nowadays in no way reflect the interests of the  population of Russia. We have a population of 150 millions,  while the largest party, the Communist Party, has about 300,000  members. Regions, on the other hand, reflect the real state of  affairs in Russia.

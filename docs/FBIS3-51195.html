He made this statement after it was reported that these  organizations are pressuring our country to increase taxes and  utility rates, as well as to eliminate urban public  transportation subsidies. "I have talked to members of the IMF  and other financial institutions, and all aid programs seek to  settle the social debt," he said.  <H5>  Congressional Presidency </H5>   Reina announced that those who aspire to be president of the  Legislative Branch ended their proselytizing activities on 8  January. He added that "all personal attacks, propaganda, and  pressure to occupy that post are suspended."  <H5>  Missing Persons Report </H5>   He labeled the report submitted by Leo Valladares, national  human rights ombudsman, on missing persons as a "white book."  Carlos Reina believes that "this report indeed favors Honduras  because it has plenty of information on this very delicate  subject." He pointed out that the only thing left to do is to  establish the procedure for implementing this report and  complement it with another final report that will let the people  know the truth about these cases.  <H5>  Government Cabinet </H5>   Reina emphasized that his cabinet will be announced in due  time because he dislikes making hasty decisions. Instead, he  prefers to give careful thought to the appointments. He also  said that he is concerned that the media may report that he  failed to appoint a specific person to some public post because  he is not "fond of making offers." He added that some San Pedro  Sula business leaders were offered posts in the Economy  Ministry, but such offers did not materialize for reasons that  he did not disclose.    Carlos Reina pointed out that Olvin Rodriguez has not been  removed from the list of possible candidates for public office  because he is not finished yet with appointing his cabinet. "I  hold him in esteem; he has worked hard. He meets the  requirements, and I will offer him a high position in the  Executive Branch," added Reina.    He also added that members of the National Party of Honduras  [PNH] will join his administration "in two ministries, as was  the case during the PNH administration." These reportedly will  be the Ministries of Labor and Social Welfare, and Culture and  Tourism.</p>

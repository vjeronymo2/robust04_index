			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Coats remains cautious on its main markets Mr Neville Bain, chief executive of Coats Viyella, the UK's largest clothing and textiles company, warned yesterday that 'there are no immediate signs of significant improvement in external conditions in our major markets'. The alert came as the company posted a fall in underlying operating profits of 3.6 per cent to Pounds 187.6m. With Pounds 21.2m (Pounds 9.7m) of exceptional gains, mostly on property sales, pre-tax profits for 1993 rose to Pounds 150.3m, against Pounds 134.7m. This represents an 11.6 per cent improvement when adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. Earnings per share rose to 14.6p, from 10p, and a final dividend of 4.75p makes a total of 8p, up from 7.25p. The company again intends to offer an enhanced scrip dividend to recover some of its advanced corporation tax (ACT). Mr Bain conceded that some shareholders did not like enhanced scrip dividends because they increased the number of shares in issue. He said the tactic was not a permanent feature. Coats would keep about Pounds 35m in cash as a result of the enhanced scrip, of which Pounds 23m would be earmarked for investment in China, eastern Europe and north America. Gearing fell sharply from 64.6 to 31 per cent, the lowest level since before the Pounds 252m acquisition of Tootal three years ago. Mr Russell Walls, finance director, said: 'We have digested Tootal.' The reduction followed the conversion of Pounds 122.4m of redeemable preference shares to equity. Net year-end borrowings fell from Pounds 404.8m to Pounds 266.3m. By geographical area, Coats recorded lower sales in north and south America and in Europe, outside the UK. The slowdown was partly the result of a trend in men's fashions away from knitwear, said Mr Bain. Operating profits in continental Europe fell 32.3 per cent to Pounds 31.2m. Cost-cutting led to operating profit improvements in the Americas. Brazil, which has been a persistent loss-maker for the company, recorded a loss of Pounds 5m, compared with Pounds 15m in 1992. Acquisitions contributed sales of Pounds 200m and earnings after taxes and minority payments of Pounds 8.2m, adding 1p to the earnings per share figure. Lex, Page 22</p>

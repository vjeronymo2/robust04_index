			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / French Bonds: A signal from Germany more vital than poll THE PROSPECT of a general election should in theory cast a cloud of uncertainty over the bond market, but, in practice, France's forthcoming parliamentary elections have done nothing of the sort. There are less than two weeks to go before the final round of voting in the French elections. The conservative opposition has such a strong lead over the ruling socialists in the opinion polls that a change of government seems inevitable. But the right's economic policy is so similar to the left's that the Paris bond market has been spared the usual spate of pre-election nerves. 'The election isn't really a factor for the bond market,' said Mr Francois-Xavier Chauchaud, economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. 'The big issue for French bonds is the same as always - interest rates.' French bonds have been waxing and waning for months on speculation about whether - or, more recently, when - the Bundesbank will signal a serious reduction in German rates, thereby paving the way for the Bank of France to cut French rates. For the past two weeks the Paris market has been buoyed by a surge of interest from international investors, particularly from the US, in the expectation of action from the Bundesbank. The market rallied again on Thursday, on the news of rate reductions in Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands, only to waver on Friday when the foreign exchange markets renewed their pressure on the franc. The yield on the benchmark 10-year OAT government bonds stood at 7.36 per cent by the end of trading last week, against 7.28 per cent at the end of the previous week and 7.78 per cent a month before. However the spread between French and German bonds, which rose as high as 100 basis points earlier this year when the markets mounted another assault on the franc, is still relatively steep at around 80 basis points. Economists expect the spread to fall steadily after the elections, providing interest rates come down. 'The medium term outlook for French bonds is fairly promising,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, French economist at Salomon Brothers. 'The Germans really must make significant cuts in interest rates soon, not only because of their commitment to the European Monetary System but also because of the growing pressures on their own economy.' Mr Chauchaud of Banque Indosuez suspects the spread could fall as low as 50 basis points by mid-summer, by when he reckons the yield on 10-year OATs should be 7 per cent. He expects a further fall in the spread from autumn onwards as the effects of lower interest rates alleviate the strains on the French economy. However a lingering cause for concern is whether the next French government will really be as stalwart as the socialists in its commitment to a strong French currency. The joint manifesto of the RPR and the UDF says they will be. Leading figures in both parties have dutifully pledged their support to the franc fort policy. The UDF is seen as much more solid on the currency front than the RPR, which includes a number of outspoken right wingers, notably Mr Charles Pasqua and Mr Philippe Seguin, who led the anti-Maastricht campaign in last autumn's referendum and have since called for the devaluation of the franc. The RPR has edged ahead of the UDF in the latest polls, thereby raising fears that an RPR prime minister, such as Mr Edouard Balladur, finance minister in the last conservative government, could come under pressure to devalue from the Pasqua/Seguin faction. 'The bond market is waiting for firm proof that the right's campaign promises will really become policy,' said Salomon's Mr Mercier. 'The new government will have to act quickly to reassure the market or French bonds could become very jittery.'</p>

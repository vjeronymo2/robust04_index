Shanghai, China's largest city, lacks safe water supply and  its main source of water, the tidal Huangpu river, is at  high-risk, World Bank officials said.    This is China's fourth freestanding environmental project  supported by the bank. The bank is also involved in eight  projects in water supply and sanitation in China.    Of the loans to China last year, which totaled 2.5 billion  dollars, nine percent is on environmental protection, the bank  said.    The bank's task manager for the project, Geoffrey Read  called  Shanghai "an economic engine of growth for China", which could  help fuel the highest increase in gross domestic product in the  world.</p>

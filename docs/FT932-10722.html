			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Arts: Romeo and Juliet - Brighton Festival The Footsbarn Theatre company, formed in 1971 in the West Country and now based in France, rarely tours the UK. Its production of Romeo and Juliet at Seaford and Brighton opens the Brighton Arts festival. So here is an opportunity to see this remarkable multi-cultural itinerant theatre collective. Footsbarn has no director, so the production evolves through individual contribution and unified effort. The resulting Shakespeare, Footsbarn's sixth, emerges as an ensemble piece. The heavily-cut text abjures the intimacies and psychological consistencies of the play, but finds something grander at the close, where there is no speech in the entire scene at the Capulet tomb. The play opens with a heap of corpses from the families, masked and spattered in mud. They rise and stay in the action throughout as spirits like the Furies or Eumenides. They become garden statues when Romeo first climbs the balcony, and they are waifs in purgatory welcoming Mercutio the grave man. Action and reaction happen physically, viscerally. The news of Juliet's death sends Romeo scudding over the stage assaulted by the emotion. Mercutio's 'Queen Mab' speech concentrates on what can be represented visually, so there are no lawyers' fees or courtiers' favours in the verse, since they are too abstract. And Romeo and Juliet first meet in a backlit puppet show, no dialogue, just gesture. Eerie stringed accompaniment and fierce bursts of percussion punctuate the action. The energy keeps the plot moving, with plenty of low comedy from the Nurse and Friar Lawrence. Romeo and Juliet themselves are young enough to be innocent, and the bellicose Tybalt and elegant Paris are never more themselves than this. If Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet seems unrecognisable, then the company aims at and achieves an archetype, pared of personality and purged of psychology. There are no leads, no stars, just the production. The effect works collectively on the spectators, too. The theatre is a large black-lined tent, the seats bleachers, and the lights powered by a distantly-humming generator. One feels party to as well as part of the show. And the atmosphere negotiated between actors and audience is what makes the evening worth seeing. At Seaford and Brighton until May 20 (Brighton Festival 0273 674357)</p>

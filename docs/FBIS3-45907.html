This  reporter has compiled his discussion as follows.  <H5>  Hong Kong's Economy Is Full of Vitality </H5>   Lu Ping said: Hong Kong's economic situation is not bad of  late. The stock market fell two days ago but went up again  yesterday. How the market will perform today remains unknown.  Naturally, the stock market cannot fully reflect Hong Kong's  economic situation, but it certainly can to a certain extent.  So it indicates that Hong Kong people are confident of Hong  Kong's future and are optimistic about the mainland's opening  policy. This is one of the reasons for foreign funds flooding  into Hong Kong's stock market. The fact that a large amount of  U.S. and Japanese funds flooded into Hong Kong shows American  and Japanese investors are upbeat about Hong Kong and China.  Some people say that the 21st century belongs to Asia, and I  believe this assessment is entirely correct. Many people are  upbeat about various countries in Asia, especially Hong Kong,  which enjoys unique conditions. Hong Kong has been regarded as  a stepping stone or a window because foreign countries which  plan to open up markets on the mainland must do so through Hong  Kong, while the mainland must also expand market accessibility  for its products in Western countries through Hong Kong. So  Hong Kong plays a special role in this respect, a role which is  not shared by other Asian countries such as Singapore, Thailand,  and Malaysia. I am of the opinion that Hong Kong's economy will  always be full of vitality despite political disputes. Hong  Kong has experienced several setbacks in the past. When the  West was bogged down in an economic recession, Hong Kong was  inevitably affected. But it was Hong Kong that first recovered  from the effect of economic crises. Hong Kong has survived  every setback this way in the past.    Lu Ping continued: Now that there is a China factor, China's  economic development is having greater and greater impact on  Hong Kong. The mainland is a huge potential market and has a  strong appeal to foreign countries. German Chancellor Kohl  signed quite a number of contracts with China when he visited  China with many German entrepreneurs not long ago. China and  France recently published a joint declaration in which France  promised not to sell weapons to Taiwan in the future. When  attending a meeting in Seattle, President Jiang Zemin met with  U.S. President Clinton. All this indicates that foreign  countries take great interest in China's market. Nevertheless,  Britain is now falling far behind other foreign countries in  this regard, but other people can do nothing about it. Our  policy is that we hope British consortia will remain and develop  themselves in Hong Kong. We recently reiterated this position  to a visiting delegation from the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank.  I told them: You British consortia have done business in Hong  Kong for over 100 years. You have contributed to Hong Kong's  economic development in the past, so we hope that you will stay  and expand your business in Hong Kong and continue to make  contributions to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. This is  only our desire, but cooperation calls for mutual agreement.  <H5>  Without Mutual Desire There Would Be No Cooperation </H5>   Cooperation concerns two parties. If the British side  refused to cooperate with us, we could do nothing about it.  Cooperation calls for enthusiasm from both parties. I have  often cited the following example: We used to see in Beijing  streets barbers carrying a shoulder pole with a burning stove at  one end, which was used to heat up water for giving the customer  a shampoo, and at the other end a barrel of cold water. There  would be no cooperation if only one party was enthusiastic about  it, like the barber's shoulder pole, which only had a burning  stove at one end instead of both. We feel it is really a pity  that the Sino-British talks over Hong Kong's 1994/95 electoral  arrangements broke down due to a lack of sincerity on the  British side. As far as we are concerned, the door to the talks  is open at all times. We have formally told, through the  foreign ministry, the British side our willingness to resume the  talks on the condition that the partial electoral bill which had  been tabled in Legco (Legislative Council) be withdrawn, because  the bill has not been agreed by both sides. As everyone knows,  the British side has always acted this way: It presented a  certain bill to Legco for discussion while bringing pressure to  bear on the Chinese side. After Legco has made a decision on  the bill, it would say: You see, Legco has passed the bill, so  it cannot be amended. If this was allowed, is there any point in  holding talks? If what Legco decided on counted, was there any  need for negotiations? So their tactics as mentioned before are  absolutely not allowed. It is known to all that Legco is  entirely controlled by the British side.    We could follow their example by presenting a certain bill  to  the NPC Standing Committee for deliberation while the bill is  being discussed by both sides. If the NPC adopted the bill, we  could also say the bill cannot be amended because the NPC is the  organ of supreme power. If both sides acted this way, would it  be of any use to open negotiations? Such is the conduct of mean  people rather than of gentlemen. We feel it beneath our dignity  to do so, although we can if we choose to. In April last year  we set the following precondition before the talks began: No  Legco deliberation of the problem under bilateral discussion is  allowed; should this principle be violated, the talks would be  suspended. Now that they have knowingly violated this  principle, the talks naturally could go nowhere. If the British  side wanted to resume talks, they must withdraw the partial  electoral bill. We cherish no illusions about the British side  mending their way now, though we still have good faith in talks.  <H5>  The British Side Has Lacked Sincerity From the Beginning </H5>   During the 17 rounds of talks, we repeatedly reminded the  British side of the principle. We tried in every possible way  and made concessions to reach an agreement. In the latter  stages, we suggested first discussing the 1994 electoral  arrangements, which are simpler and more pressing, for district  boards and the two municipal councils so that there would be  more time to deal with Legco elections. They agreed to our  proposal but advanced three preconditions: The first concerns  the voting age, the second the voting method, and the third the  abolishment of appointed seats. During the talks, we in fact  made concessions on the three preconditions. We agreed on  lowering the voting age to 18, which we also proposed long ago.  We also agreed that the voting method be changed into a  single-vote-single-seat system. We did not agree with the third  precondition in principle because we must respect public  opinion. After a total of 18 district boards had voiced their  objection to the abolishment of appointed seats, it was the  British side's business if they chose to abolish appointed seats  in the 1994 elections, but we told them we will restore  appointed seats after 1997. This problem was in fact solved  later because the British side agreed with the Chinese side's  approach, believing agreeing to disagree provided a good way  out. But they raised new issues at this point by proposing that  the single-vote-single-seat system apply in 1995. We did not  say yes or no to this proposal but suggested that this problem  should be discussed together with the 1995 elections. Our  position was reasonable because this was a problem concerning  the 1995 elections. Since they had agreed to first address the  problems concerning the 1994 elections, the problem concerning  the 1995 elections should be discussed later. But they insisted  on solving the two problems together, saying it will waste time  to discuss the voting methods for the 1994 and the 1995  elections separately in Legco. We replied that this does not  mean wasting time and that it matters little to spend a little  more time if this will facilitate smooth transfer of government.  Legco had wasted much more time on discussions! How should  this be regarded as wasting time? For the British Hong Kong  government, this was a problem of technicalities, but for the  Chinese side this was a matter of principle. We did not agree  with nor objected to the single-vote-single-seat system, but  after the 1995 electoral bill was tabled in Legco and a Legco  decision made, the bill could not be amended. We adhered to our  principle and made our position clear on 17 April of last year.  Finally the British side firmly rejected our position and  decided to unilaterally present the partial electoral bill to  Legco for examination and approval. All this shows that British  side lacked sincerity from the beginning. Therefore we will have  to organize three-tier councils in 1997 in accordance with the  Basic Law. We have no other alternatives. We did not  anticipate this.    While drafting the Basic Law, we decided to provide a  through- train for legislators elected in 1995 so that they  would be allowed to ride the train to the post-1997  administration. Our overall design aimed at smooth transition,  which was our wish. Unfortunately our wish will not come true  due to noncooperation of the British side. Despite this, we  will still firmly implement the Sino-British Joint Declaration  and the Basic Law. We will make determined efforts to make  smooth transfer possible so that Hong Kong will still be a  prosperous and stable city after 1997.  <H3>  Think About the Interests of Hong Kong People Administering  Hong Kong </H3>   Despite political problems, we will still help Hong Kong  people effect a smooth transition. For Britain, Chris Patten  must go home in three years and it does not matter whether he  goes by plane, ship, or bicycle. However, Hong Kong people will  remain in Hong Kong for several decades and several centuries.  After several decades and several centuries, Hong Kong will  remain China's special administrative region (SAR) and everyone  should contribute to Hong Kong's long-term stability. In this  sense we hope to develop economic cooperation with Britons.  Specifically speaking, the airport issue is in fact a very  simple issue. We held eight-month- long talks on the issue and  our premier signed the Memorandum of Understanding on the  airport. One, the Chinese Government formally expressed support  for the building of a new airport; two, the new airport must be  cost effective so as not to leave a heavy financial burden to  the future SAR government; and three, specifically speaking, the  Hong Kong British Government should leave the SAR government a  financial reserve of HK$25 billion (Hong Kong dollars), which is  not a big amount. This is not an excessive demand. I should  like to tell you: We contended for the 25 billion bit by bit.  At first, they promised to give HK$5 billion. We asked them  how the Hong Kong people can get along with HK$5 billion. That  was why I said that they only gave the change. I have made an  unpleasant analogy: Like an old lady doing shopping in the  vegetable market, they haggled about the price. They finally  agreed to give HK$25 billion and said not a cent will be added.  In our view, the HK$25 billion was absolutely not sufficient,  but there would be a land fund in the future. We are taking  care of the fund now and will give it back to Hong Kong people  after 1997. According to the earlier estimation, the land fund  would increase to over HK$70 billion by 1997. This amount plus  the 25 billion would make 100 billion. Experience shows that  the land fund alone will probably increase to HK$100 billion by  1997. We must hold ourselves responsible to the SAR government  and lay a sound financial foundation for it. In short, we hope  Hong Kong people will have more money at their disposal when  they are entrusted with the task of administering Hong Kong.  <H5>  A Guarantee of HK$25 Billion Is Demanded </H5>   The future Hong Kong Special Administration Region [SAR]  will  be independent financially. Honestly, the central government  will not ask for a single dollar from Hong Kong. They do not  need to turn over a cent, and our value-added tax does not  concern them either. The central government will not levy taxes  in Hong Kong. But if Hong Kong has a fiscal deficit and asks for  financial help from the center, it will also be difficult, I am  afraid, to get it. Many localities and departments do not  understand why we will are not going to levy taxes in the Hong  Kong SAR in the future. They feel we treat Hong Kong too well  and ask why we should treat it so well. The center is doing  something for Guangdong and Shanghai in the hope that they will  make a greater contribution to the state. The state is currently  having financial difficulties, but some places are better-off.  Hong Kong is, of course, much better-off. Nevertheless, our  policy is that we will not ask for a single dollar from Hong  Kong. Therefore, we now have to explain to every province and  department why we cannot levy taxes in Hong Kong and why we need  to maintain Hong Kong's financial independence. We should not  view Hong Kong from the perspective of a little tax, but from a  broad perspective and from Hong Kong's overall contribution.    In order for Hong Kong to have a comparatively good  financial  foundation in the future, we demanded that the British Hong Kong  Government offer a guarantee of HK$25 billion. Later, after the  Memorandum of Understanding was signed, Financial Secretary  Hamish Macleod said that the financial reserves by 1997 were  estimated to stand at HK$78 billion. As we heard this, we asked  him: "You said on the conference table that it was difficult to  retain HK$25 billion, how then will the reserves come to HK$78  billion? It is just as well to retain the HK$78 billion." But  he said no, claiming that the HK$78 billion was only an  estimated figure and was unreliable. I said: "As financial  secretary, you have to be responsible for whatever you say. It  shows you are being irresponsible if you say something when you  are not so sure of it. Although you said there would be HK$78  billion, for our part, we do not demand that you retain all the  HK$78 billion for the SAR government. In any case, we only  demand that HK$25 billion be retained strictly in accordance  with the Basic Law. That was the first specific question.  <H5>  The Debt To Be Left to the SAR Government Must Not Be Added </H5>   The second specific question was about the debt to be left  to  the SAR government. It is provided that the debt to be left to  the SAR government must not exceed HK$5 billion. If the debt  exceeds this amount, they must negotiate with us because they  will only leave a total of HK$25 billion to the SAR government.  If the debt increases, then the SAR government will be  penniless. Therefore, the principle is very simple, that is,  leaving no financial burden to the SAR government in keeping  with the basic principle of cost- effectiveness. We thought  that the matter was already settled when the Memorandum of  Understanding was signed and that the airport could be  constructed in accordance with the memorandum. If the British  Hong Kong Government needs to borrow money, it can do so as long  as the borrowings do not exceed HK$5 billion and as long as they  notify us of the borrowings. The question has already been  settled, but why are they now saying that they need to negotiate  with us? This only serves to complicate the matter. Now the  amount of debt they have agreed to will greatly exceed HK$5  billion. It will even be greater than the financial reserves to  be left to the SAR government. Although the debt does not  necessarily remain unsettled by that time and, in fact, it will  probably have been repaid by that time, if any problems crop up  there is the possibility of insolvency.    Some projects in particular are loss-making deals. They  entail high costs and bring low returns, not the other way  round. As far as the airport railway is concerned, judging from  the data they have given us, we see that until the year 2036,  the annual profit rate only stands at 2 percent. Now they will  put the railway under the management of the Mass Transit Railway  Company [MTR]. Moreover, the data they have given us says the  MTR also maintains that it is impossible to run the railway with  a profit rate of 2 percent and that the profit rate must reach  at least 10 percent. It is obviously a loss-making deal. If  this question is improperly settled, it can be a very big burden  on the future SAR government. The British Hong Kong Government  is demolishing the eastern wall in order to build the western  wall, that is, it is subsidizing the losses on the airport  railway with the MTR's surpluses. For this reason the MTR has  requested not to distribute dividends after 1997 which should  otherwise be distributed. Moreover, the MTR also needs  development and needs to construct new routes in the future. If  it uses up the surpluses now, how can it construct new routes in  the future? If so, it will inevitably ask for money from the  SAR government. But where will it find the money then?  Therefore, I say it is possible that the debt cannot be cleared  in the future. We can see from this that they have no sincerity  with regard to cooperation with the Chinese side and with Hong  Kong people.    They simply lack sincerity for cooperation with Hong Kong  people and simply do not consider the interests of Hong Kong  people. We also know that many contracts have already been won  by British companies. Some are even on very unreasonable terms.  There is no fair treatment for some public tenders. After all,  we cannot use up the money that is to be left to the SAR  government in 1997. We say that they cannot use all the money on  constructing an airport because we need a very substantial  amount for contingency uses. Honestly speaking, affected by the  price factor, the current HK$100 billion or more of reserves  will surely be worth far less three years from now. Therefore,  considering the interests of Hong Kong people, we cannot make  any further concessions on this question.  <H5>  The British Side Does Not Separate Politics From Economics </H5>   The reason why I say this here today is simple. I hope the  British side will return to the Memorandum of Understanding and  construct a new airport as soon as possible in accordance with  the memorandum.    The British side keeps on saying that they have separated  economics from politics. In fact, it is precisely the British  side that has mixed economics and politics. Their words are  high- sounding, but in fact they have lumped them together. It  is not only on political matters but also on economic matters  that they do not cooperate with us and Hong Kong people. To put  it in irritating terms, they consider their own interests or  proceed in everything from their own interests. Therefore, we  regret the British attitude very much.    Out of good intentions and in order to promote the soonest-  possible settlement of the airport issue, our Preliminary Work  Committee discussed some regulations regarding the airport  management organization. I have read several times the data  given by the British Hong Kong Government. There are many  things there that I really do not understand. I had hoped the  British side would send a person to give an explanation of some  of the questions to the Preliminary Work Committee. The  Preliminary Work Committee is our advisory body, and we need to  solicit their views so that they help us in the talks with the  British Hong Kong authorities on the airport issue. But, as you  have also seen, they simply will not come. We did not intend to  put them in a difficult position, and we did not specifically  invite Gordon Siu Kwing-chue to give an explanation in Beijing.  Earlier on, he had decided to attend a ceremony in Beijing on  the 26th of this month for the signing of an agreement on  cooperation in training between the Civil Aviation  Administration of China and the Civil Aviation Department of  Hong Kong. Precisely because of his coming, our Economic Group  decided to hold a meeting on the 26th so that he could give an  explanation to the Preliminary Work Committee. When we made  this request, the British Hong Kong Government not only totally  rejected it but also canceled Siu Kwing-chue's Beijing trip.  What attitude was this? Was this the separation of politics and  economics? Although we have failed to reach agreement on  political matters, we should cooperate well on constructing an  airport, which is an economic matter. But they are not willing  to cooperate anyhow and we regret this very much.    Finally, Lu Ping said: After all, Hong Kong is the Hong Kong  of Hong Kong people. We are only helping them. The concerted  efforts of everyone are still needed in the future.</p>

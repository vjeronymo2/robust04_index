			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marat Salimov: "The Ministry of Defense Is </F> Exempted From Export Duties"]    [Text] The Russian Government continues the practice of  granting key ministries substantial economic  preferences--yesterday the government decree "On Exempting the  Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation from Paying  Customs Duty on Sales of Surplus Military Property in Foreign  Markets" went into official distribution.    The substance of the new decree is quite simple. It  formalizes the monopoly status of the Ministry of Defense in the  foreign economic sphere, and it is made exempt (on top of that,  retroactively to 1 June 1993) from paying customs duty of  exported military property. In the past, the military had  already been granted a number of preferences. In the president's  edict "On the Procedures of Sale and Utilization of Surplus  Military Property" dated 30 November 1992, the Ministry of  Defense was given the status of the only middleman in selling  military property outside of Russia and made exempt from paying  tax on this income.    Despite the fact that the government decree undoubtedly will  help to raise the level of social benefits of military  servicemen (the proceeds from the sales of property are to be  used for construction and acquisition of housing), the ministry  itself also will get the opportunity to improve its material  situation. As a result of the central administration of material  resources and foreign economic relations of the Ministry of  Defense, whose responsibility it is to sell military property in  foreign markets, being exempted from paying taxes and export  duties, the administration will be able to dictate to military  units wishing to sell such surplus goods its own terms and  prices. Besides, like any foreign trade monopoly, the  administration takes a commission which, even within a  "reasonable" range, makes a substantial addition to budget  financing. On the whole, monopolization of foreign trade in the  military sphere shows the increasing trend toward pushing  commercial structures and private individuals out of foreign  economic activities.    [Box, p 2]  <H5>  Privileges Granted to the Russian Ministry of Defense </H5>   --Sales and utilization of surplus military property (except  arms and munitions) may be performed only by Ministry of Defense  structures.    --The Ministry of Defense is exempted from paying all  categories of taxes on the proceeds from sales of military  property if these proceeds are directed at improving  socioeconomic and housing conditions of servicemen.    --The Ministry of Defense is exempted from paying customs  duty on export of surplus military property.

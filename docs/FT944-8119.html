			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Angola rebels warn on fighting Angolan rebels pledged yesterday to stick to the country's day-old peace accord but said any new government offensive would torpedo the pact. No reports of fighting had been received in Luanda in the 24 hours since the pact was signed in the Zambian capital Lusaka by government and Unita rebel representatives on Sunday. The pact, intended to end 19 years of ruinous civil war, was weakened by the failure of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Unita leader Jonas Savimbi to sign it personally. In Lusaka, delegations from the two sides worked feverishly yesterday to stitch together agreements on how to translate words into peace on the ground. A formal ceasefire is due to come into force around 1200 GMT today. Editorial Comment, Page 23</p>

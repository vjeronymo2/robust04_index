			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Anca Florea report from Chisinau] </F>   [Text] This evening Radio Chisinau broadcast the decree  issued by President Mircea Snegur regarding the sociological  poll titled "Consulting With the Nation" [La Sfat Cu Poporul].    Taking note of the Central Electoral Commission's decision  of  2 February, which practically rejects President Snegur's  proposal that according to the decision of the presidium of the  Parliament of the Republic of Moldova the aforementioned poll  should be organized simultaneously with the 27 February general  elections, but, on the other hand, considering the stringent  need to stabilize the social, political, and economic situation  in the country, to create favorable circumstances for the  strengthening of the independence of the Republic of Moldova and  the ensuring of its territorial integrity, and on the basis of  Article 113 of the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova, the  president of the republic decrees, I quote the first article:    On 6 March 1994 the sociological poll "Consulting With the  Nation" is to be held on the whole territory of the Republic of  Moldova. The poll is intended for all citizens of the republic  with the right to vote to answer the following question: Do you  favor the Republic of Moldova to develop as an independent,  unitary, and indivisible state, within its frontiers established  on the day of the proclamation of its sovereignty, 23 June 1990,  to promote a neutral policy, to maintain mutually advantageous  cooperation relations with all the countries of the world, and  to guarantee equal rights to all its citizens, according to the  norms of the international right? unquote.    The five articles that follow the first one regulate the way  in which the poll is to be prepared.    Also today the Central Electoral Commission held a news  conference, during which the journalists were told that 1,024  candidates representing 16 political groupings and 19  independent candidates have registered for the 27 February  ballot. The commission members also said that 44 technical  groups [for ballot counting] have been set up and the voting  bulletins have also been confirmed.    The commission members also emphasized that although they  had  done everything they could to organize elections also on the  left bank of the Dniester River [in the self-proclaimed Dniester  Republic], as well as in the southern part of the republic  [inhabited by the Gagauz ethnic minority], for the time being it  is still unclear whether the elections will also take place in  those regions.</p>

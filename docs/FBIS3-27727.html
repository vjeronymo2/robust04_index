The  extraordinary Diet session ends today and a package of political  reform bills has been enacted in the Diet. Ruling and  opposition parties have agreed to amend the enacted bills at the  next ordinary Diet session. I think there will be various  questions about the settlement of the political reform bills,  but as dean of the press corps, I would like to ask what the  Hosokawa cabinet will do from now on. The Hosokawa cabinet has  continued to delay mapping out a new package of stimulus  measures and compiling a budget for fiscal 1994. Mr. Prime  Minister, how are you going to deal with these policy tasks? In  particular, income tax reduction has become a focal point. Mr.  Prime Minister, how much do you plan to cut income tax? How are  you going to make up for a fiscal shortfall incurred from cuts  in the income tax? I hope you will answer my questions  specifically.    [Hosokawa] Among other things, I would like to mention the  political reform bills. The bills were passed a while ago in  the House of Councillors but it cannot be said that they have  been enacted completely. First, I would like to say that the  government has hurdled a big obstacle, which is the passage of  the political reform bills. Now, I feel relieved. The passage  of the political reform bills in the Diet has been the most  important policy task for my cabinet. Looking ahead, there are  many mountains I will have to scale, and I believe I will scale  these mountains one by one. I feel anew that my cabinet is  saddled with a lot of difficult policy tasks. It is really good  that both the ruling and opposition parties have managed to pass  the bills in the Diet in response to the people's hopes, and I  would like to express my gratitude anew to the people for their  support. This is what I am now feeling.    I was asked about stimulus measures. Now that the bills have  been passed in the Diet, it goes without saying that the  immediate task for me is to map out a package of stimulus  measures. Currently, relevant offices, with the Economic  Planning Agency at the center, are preparing economic measures.  However, I am hoping to complete them by the end of next week,  if possible. We are still not ready to disclose their scale or  contents. But we want to have a pump-priming package that can  generate the immediate effect of spurring Japan's economy.  There was a question about income tax reduction. At 1730  today, the Economic Reform Council held a meeting and I have  asked the council to discuss ways to cut the income tax. There  was a question about compilation of the budget for the fiscal  1994. As for the third supplementary budget, I would like to  submit it to the Diet after completing the economic measures, or  after coming back from the United States. We will submit it as  soon as we can. Also, as for the fiscal 1994 budget, we will  tentatively announce it by 10 February if possible -- although  we are still not at a stage to announce something definite --  and approve the government's proposal after I return from the  United States.    [Unidentified reporter] Now that the bills have been passed  in the Diet, political parties are expected to quickly move  toward realignment. Mr. Prime Minister, do you have any  blueprint for forming a ruling coalition party?    [Hosokawa] I do not know how the political parties will be  realigned in the future. It seems to me that the realignment of  political parties will not take concrete shape so soon.    [Dean of press corps] Prime Minister. You are scheduled  to visit the United States on 11 February to hold Japan-U.S.  summit talks. You are going to hold the talks while you are  faced with many tasks, including the Japan-U.S. comprehensive  trade talks. Can you explain your fundamental stance regarding  the upcoming meeting with President Clinton?    [Hosokawa] This is going to be our third meeting. I think  it will be a venue for confirming what we have been doing  through our series of meetings. We are having the final  discussions on both macro and micro issues. These are very  difficult issues. We are doing our best to produce an outcome  satisfactory to both sides before the Japan-U.S. summit talks.  As for the macroissues, the United States is insisting, more  than anything else, on the need for Japan to introduce measures  designed to reduce our trade surplus -- including economic  stimulus measures, increase of domestic demand, and the tax  system issue. The United States is strongly demanding we take  daring measures as much as possible. Well, I should rather say  this is the largest concern of the United States. We are  planning to do our best to come up with a package before the  summit talks. As for the microissues -- such as government  procurement, insurance services, and autos -- the opinions of  Japan and the United States are divided over fundamental issues,  including the two-way dialogue system [sohoko seido], target  figures, and the extent of the government's influence on private  companies. However, I am of the opinion that we have to clearly  insist on our stance. We are now having the final discussions on  these issues. I have instructed the government officials to  somehow find a point of compromise and thereby conclude the  comprehensive trade talks.    [Dean of press corps] Will the issue of tax reduction be  included in the economic measures which will be announced next  week?    [Hosokawa] Well, I still do not know about that. As I have  said earlier, we are still not at a stage to clearly explain  their scale or contents. We will complete drawing up the  measures as soon as we can.    [Unidentified reporter] I think the people are worried about  the new electoral system. Can you explain how much public  opinion will be reflected under this system?    [Hosokawa] We had long discussions at the Diet as well on  the issue of reflecting the people's will. This issue was  talked about at council meetings too. As we all know, a  compromise was reached between the ruling parties and the  Liberal Democratic Party, which is the largest opposition party.  I do not think this combination of the single-seat and  proportional representation systems will only help political  parties merge into a fewer number of groups. My fundamental  understanding is that this system was formed after giving  thorough consideration to the people's will.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister. At the joint  news conference held last night, you said you will hold a summit  meeting again with the LDP president to discuss issues regarding  the economic situation and the Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks. I am wondering if such talks will lead to the LDP's  support of the government from outside the cabinet in the future  in a broad sense. This is my first question. The next question  is about the pending issue concerning a merger of your party,  Japan New Party [JNP] and Sakigake -- which would mean the  establishment of a new-New Party. How is this issue  progressing? I would like to ask you these two questions.    [Hosokawa] I said to LDP President Kono I would like to  frankly discuss the issues concerning the economy or Japan-U.S.  relations -- there may be other issues -- with him as early as  the beginning of next week. I think it is very important to  occasionally hold such meetings, particularly with President  Kono of the LDP, which is the largest party in the Diet. I do  want to have such meetings when opportunities arise, and I hope  we can cooperate with each other as much as possible over what  we can do. But I do not think -- I think your question is about  the possibility of forming a powerful coalition that includes  the LDP -- such cooperative moves will lead to forming such a  coalition. As for the issue of JNP's merger with Sakigake, I  think it is necessary to see how the political situation and  moves toward regrouping political parties develop after the  political reform bills are passed. Forming a collaborative group  in the Diet, the JNP and Sakigake are actually already  cooperating with each other, and at present there is no big  obstacle to the two parties' activities. I would like to study  this issue while seeing how moves toward the realignment of  political circles develop.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister. With the  passage of the political reform bills, government subsidies will  be provided for political parties. However, originally, the  ruling coalition's proposal was that the government subsidy  system should be introduced on the assumption that donations by  corporations and organizations to individual politicians would  be banned. But I think the people must be considering the  agreement on that point as running counter to the original  proposal. What do you think?    [Hosokawa] This question was also raised at the news  conference yesterday. I am fully aware of the fact that there  are doubts about that point. However, the LDP asserted that as  a matter of fact, it is impossible for the party to accept the  government's original proposal in a single stroke. With the  LDP's position in mind, therefore, I have reached a compromise  on abolishing donations by corporations and organizations after  five years, as an interim measure. However, I believe the  agreement proposes various measures: namely, politicians will be  required to report their acceptance of donations if a donation  exceeds 50,000 yen -- currently the amount of donations subject  to reporting is over 1 million yen -- and the penal regulations  will be beefed up. In this way, I think drastic measures will  be taken to make political donations more transparent, and to  strengthen penal regulations. I believe the people will  certainly understand that point.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 15 (XINHUA) -- What do Chinese farmers  do in their spare time?    In the suburban areas of Shanghai, China's largest city,  farmers engage in collecting stamps and newspapers, taking  photographs, dancing, organizing musical bands, and so on. A  kind of existence that specialists call "suburban culture" is  emerging there.    "Suburban culture" in Shanghai is characterized by the  combination of modern city culture and traditional Chinese rural  culture. Economic development in the rural areas provides it  with good support.    Two brothers named Du collected various kinds of newspapers  years ago. Now, they have collected 15,000 kinds of newspapers,  to rank among China's top four newspaper collectors. They have  published 5,000 digest stories. They have also finished the  first editions of "a collection of masthead calligraphy in  national evening newspapers" and "a collection of mastheads  dedicated by Mao Zedong".    A group of farmer photographers has emerged in Shanghai.  Some of their photographs have been sent overseas for  exhibition.    A village named Maqiao on the outskirts of Shanghai has a  long history of lion dancing. After being revised by the new  generation of farmer artists, the lion dance has become a new  type of folk dance combining gymnastics, dance and movie tricks  together.    Musical bands are active in the countryside of Shanghai.  Some of the folk orchestral music they have adapted or created  has been welcomed not only by Shanghainese but also by people in  other parts of China attending the Shanghai international art  festival.    Entertainment equipment like video recorders, pianos,  household computers and compact discs, which could only be seen  in the houses of rich city dwellers in the past, have made their  way into the households of ordinary farmers.    Rural farmers now frequently take part in singing and  karaoke  contests, piano grading concerts and instrumental concerts held  in the city.    Modern cultural activities initiated in the big cities are  spreading from the city districts to the suburbs, to outlying  areas, and then to the surrounding country villages.    Fifteen "cultural hot points" currently popular in Shanghai  districts can all be found in its outlying villages.    Experts have pointed out that the "suburban culture"  characterized by its combination of traditional Chinese culture  and modern urban culture, is a necessary result of China's  economic and social development. And it will help to reduce the  cultural gap between cities and the countryside.</p>

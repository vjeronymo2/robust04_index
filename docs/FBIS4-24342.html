			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Abel Abraao in Kuito] </F>   [Text] The barricades that divided the city of Kuito,  similarly to what happened with the FRG's Berlin wall, are no  longer in place. Following countless provocations launched by  the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola against  government-held positions, and the indiscriminate shelling of  defenseless residents, the Angolan Armed Forces, the National  Police, and the Civil Defense had no option but to flush out the  men in the service of Jonas Savimbi [words indistinct].  Government forces have been in control of the city of Kuito  since yesterday. Jonas Savimbi's organization abandoned more  than 200 men killed and large quantities of weapons.</p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / International Company News: Repola holds deficit to FM810m REPOLA, the Finnish forestry and engineering group, improved its performance in 1992 but high financing costs and difficult industry conditions meant it still made a loss of FM810m (Dollars 136m). The result, which compares with a FM1.43bn loss in 1991, was hit by FM709m of exchange rate losses connected to the impact of the weaker markka on foreign loans. The dividend was held at FM0.65 per share. The group noted that its operating profit more than doubled to FM1.72bn from FM656m, with half of the total arising in the final four months. It said it benefited from cost-saving measures, divestment of unprofitable businesses and the devaluation of the markka. However, this profit was more than wiped out by the exchange rates losses and other financial losses of FM1.82bn. The group blamed low capacity utilisation, falling newsprint prices, the divestment of the group's marine technology activities and poor profitability within forest machine manufacture. Repola is more positive about prospects in 1993 although it has not made a specific forecast. Sales expanded 7 per cent to FM23.7bn from FM22.3bn, thanks to a better performance from all three of the group's industrial units. Rauma, the metals and engineering unit, saw sales rise 11 per cent to FM8.2bn, and the unit's pre-tax loss dropped to FM167m from FM609m.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> KO MAY KEEP TYSON OUT OF RING  </P> <P> The state athletic commissioner says Mike Tyson may have to wait until May if  he wants to return to the Catskill Mountains to train.  </P> <P> Because Tyson was knocked out by James (Buster) Douglas in their fight in Tokyo  on Saturday, he could be barred from fighting or sparring anywhere in New York  for up to 90 days, Athletic Commissioner Randy Gordon said in an interview  published in today's Albany Times Union.  </P> <P> "Under the rules, Mike Tyson could still come back to the state to run, climb  the mountains up north, jump rope, shadow box . . . whatever. But he couldn't  take and receive punches," Gordon said.  </P> <P> Gordon said he would watch the fight again today with the commission's medical  expert, Dr. Barry Jordan, and that no ruling has yet been made.  </P> <P> Even if a fighter is knocked out outside the ring, he can't fight for 90 days,  Gordon said. That, Gordon said, is the "Mike Tyson Rule" -- an expansion of the  regulations created after Tyson was knocked out in an automobile accident in  the Catskills in September, 1988.  </P></p>

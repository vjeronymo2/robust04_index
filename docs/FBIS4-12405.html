			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has again  declared that Pakistan will never agree to roll back its nuclear  program. It is our commitment to the people and the government  will not compromise on the country's nuclear program. The prime  minister was replying to questions by newsmen in the Parliament  House today. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said it has been the stand of  Pakistan that the nuclear issue will not be solved by cornering  it. The United States should have an even-handed policy toward  both Pakistan and India and the Pressler Amendment, she added,  is a veto in the hands of India. About the forthcoming visit of  the American assistant secretary of state [title as heard], Mr.  Strobe Talbott, the prime minister said Pakistan wants nuclear  nonproliferation and has put forward many proposals for nuclear  nonproliferation in South Asia, but India has rejected all  these. If any other nation puts forward its own proposals on  the subject, we are ready to consider them too. We will not  agree to unilateral capping of nuclear installations, but if the  Indians do so, Islamabad would also agree to it. Ms. Benazir  Bhutto said the United States should realize that Pakistanis are  a proud and honorable nation very conscious of their self  respect and the government's policy on the nuclear program  enjoys a national consensus.    Replying to a question on the opposition's role on national  issues, the prime minister urged that the opposition should give  up its attitude of confrontation and join hands with the  government on sensitive issues of national importance like  Kashmir and the nuclear program. She said we should take the  interest of the country above our personal interest and should  work for the economic well being of the people. Mr. Benazir  Bhutto said her government has taken revolutionary measures  since assumption of power. Recounting these measures, she said  hers is the first government in the history of Pakistan which  imposed income tax on agriculture. Load shedding [power cuts]  has been a problem since many years and her government soon  after coming into power sanctioned two power projects -- one in  Hab and other at Ghazi Barotha. We curtailed the deficit  financing in the country and did not resort to mini budget which  was very difficult. The results of our policies, the prime  minister said, will become clear 18 months after our assumption  of office.    Talking about the increase in the base price of wheat, the  prime minister said 70 percent of the country's population lives  in rural areas and are farmers. They were not sowing wheat as  its price was very low resulting in a decline in the country's  wheat production. The government, therefore, had to import  wheat. It was a difficult decision and those who have lust for  power would not have taken this decision. But we take power as  a noble trust by the people and as a responsibility. These are  difficult decisions which will benefit the country in the long  run.</p>

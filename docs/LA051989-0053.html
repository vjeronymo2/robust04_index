			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: A REVAMPED VIC'S LIMITS CHOICES BUT WHAT REMAINS  MERITS PRAISE  </P> <P> Vic's opened in late 1986 as one of the most ambitious restaurants in La Jolla.  </P> <P> It was difficult to dislike Vic's style, which took a grand point of view and  encompassed a formal decor, first-class service and a cuisine that emphasized  large portions of carefully cooked, top-quality foods.  </P> <P> All this came at a price, however, one so steep that Vic's deep booths were  empty more often than not. Changes were made, including the departure of chef  Jim Hill and a scaling back of the menu that allowed the restaurant to decrease  prices considerably.  </P> <P> Because these changes failed to generate sufficient business, Vic's recently  underwent yet another metamorphosis and emerged with Jim Hill again in command  of the kitchen and a new, even more-abbreviated menu that offers something for  everyone -- as long as everyone has relatively circumscribed desires. The  present, somewhat Spartan list limits itself to prime rib and  rotisserie-broiled chicken, augmented by the four or five offerings mentioned  on the daily specials sheet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Steakhouse Mood  </P> <P> The new menu keeps Vic's more or less in the original all-American steakhouse  mood -- except that steak, when it is offered, appears only on the specials  list. Appetizers are hearty and simple; the choice includes oysters on the half  shell, the redoubtable shrimp cocktail and, in a more conscious bow to San  Diego sensibilities, shrimp in garlic butter. If two guests have an inclination  to share, they should not be disappointed by the rack of baby back ribs, which  cooks slowly to a nice tenderness under a glaze of sweet but sharp barbecue  sauce.  </P> <P> All meals include a "spinning bowl" salad, a Gargantuan assortment of greens  that the server whirls at the table in a salad bowl set in a larger bowl of  crushed ice (this gesture is vaguely hokey, although it does ensure crisp  greenery, and is in any case not done in the same spirit of phony elegance as  the ridiculous chilled salad forks offered by some establishments). Musky  Italian balsamic vinegar flavors the simple vinaigrette dressing -- even in a  steakhouse, Chef Hill can not resist his attraction to nouvelle niceties -- and  it suits quite well, although the salad could be moistened more generously. The  option of an alternative soup would be welcome, though (in its early days,  Vic's served a marvelous sweet potato soup).  </P> <P> The centerpiece of the new Vic's is an elaborate French rotisserie, and it is  used for the preparation of virtually all the entrees. Lest the standing entree  list of prime rib and chicken seem too austere, there is the option of a  sampler plate that offers hefty servings of both.  </P> <P> The chicken is the more interesting of the two because it soaks in olive oil  spiced with cilantro and chipotle chilies before taking its place on the  rotisserie. These flavoring agents add subtle notes to the chicken and give it  more interest than the garden-variety bird. The cooking process is carried out  with some care, and the flesh takes on that moist, toothsome quality peculiar  to spit-roasted fowl.  </P> <P> The prime rib, wheeled to the table on a closed cart and carved to order, also  benefits from its sojourn on the rotisserie, and is appropriately tender. This  cut of beef enjoys immense popularity, although it really seems much less  interesting than steak. But Vic's spurs it along a bit with well-chosen  seasonings, a splash of roasting juices and a spoonful of a particularly sharp  and likable horseradish sauce.  </P> <P> Both the chicken and the prime rib are automatically accompanied by mashed  potatoes and gravy, another example of absence of choice that makes this menu  seem too limited. A baked potato is available at an extra charge; the one  sampled was notably undercooked. Other optional side dishes are creamed corn  and creamed spinach, both traditional steakhouse fare. The creamed spinach,  served in a portion that could have fed four, was nicely done and featured an  unusual, sweet flavor accent that tasted as if it were derived from caramelized  pearl onions.  </P> <P> Hill is an accomplished chef, and he blossoms on his specials list, which  recently included two fish and three meats. Where the standing menu seems  almost self-consciously old-fashioned and plain, the specials tend a little  toward modern fantasy and international contemporary cuisine -- broiled ahi,  for example, was bedded on angel hair pasta and finished with a Thai-inspired  sauce spiked with sesame, red pepper and ginger. Among the meats, Hill offered  filet mignon in a sauce of Stilton cheese and Port wine, a dish that has gained  much currency in San Diego in recent years, and broiled wild boar, always a  rarity, in Sherry vinegar sauce.  </P> <P> Another special, a rack of lamb in a thoroughly clever sauce of white wine,  cream, sorrel and mint, showed the kitchen at the top of its form. Mint  commonly seasons lamb, but to make the combination tart with sorrel and smooth  with cream is a novel idea, and it made for an almost explosive taste. At  $23.95, this dish, like most specials, was costly contrasted with the standing  menu, which begins at $8.95 for the basic half chicken and at $14.95 for the  smallest cut of prime rib.  </P> <P> The dessert selection practices the same restraint as the rest of the menu, but  an extravagant chocolate mousse concoction renders the preceding austerity  moot. Surrounded by a chocolate cookie crust, the filling is so buttery as to  be phenomenally, even fantastically, rich. A certain sort of chocolate melody  seems to run through this dessert that is, in performance, quite seductive.  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS  </P> <P> * VIC'S  </P> <P> 7825 Fay Ave., La Jolla  </P> <P> 456-3789  </P> <P> Lunch weekdays, dinner nightly except Sundays.  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted.  </P> <P> Dinner for two, including one glass of wine each, tax and tip, $30 to $90.  </P></p>

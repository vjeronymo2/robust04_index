			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Observer: British reserve The Chartered Institute of Bankers deserves a prize. After 116 years it has elected a non-Brit as president - Andreas Prindl, a fiercely well-educated American who works for a Japanese bank. Not before time, since a quarter of the institute's members are non-Brits. Let's hope the open-door policy catches on. The London Investment Banking Association, the grandchild of the old Accepting Houses Committee, has already picked a Brit as its next president - Flemings' John Manser. But next time round it might pluck up courage and choose a foreigner, such as Union Bank of Switzerland's Rudi Mueller. At least it has dropped the British from its title - unlike the British Bankers Association. It has never had a non-Brit as president in its 75-year history. Given that the BBA represents over 300 banks from more than 60 countries which happen to operate in Britain it could make a start by renaming itself.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Russian Vice President Aleksandr </F> Rutskoy by Aleksandr Gerasimov, date and place not given -- from  the "Itogi" program]    [Excerpts] [Gerasimov] Boris Yeltsin described the  procedure for signing the Treaty on Public Accord as an assembly  of civic accord. [passage omitted]    [Rutskoy] You see, everything that is taking place in our  country today is the search for an enemy: Yet another  [?document] is thought up, which should be signed and then an  enemy should be found yet again, and so on and so forth. This  is an agreement between President Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin, Head of Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko, Head  of State Duma Ivan Rybkin and the Patriarch. They will move to  meet one another half way. All the other people who have signed  are simply hostages to this system.    [Gerasimov] Currently the former vice-president is holding  talks with different parties and public movements in order to  set up a political organization which would (?make it possible  to) start an election campaign for seats in the parliament and  the post of president.    [Rutskoy] I intend to set up an all-Russian public and  political movement. We have already found a formula for this  movement by giving it the name of social-patriotic movement. We  plan to have registered membership in the movement. The  movement will have iron discipline and firm order. We do not  need any dissent [inakomysliye] at all in the movement because  we have already had relevant experience. Ultimately, the  movement's goal is to come to power because without power it is  simply impossible to implement the ideas and tasks which we have  set to ourselves. [passage omitted]</p>

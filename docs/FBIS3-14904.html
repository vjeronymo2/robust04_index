			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Feb 28, BNS -- Vaino Reinart, head of the  Estonian delegation for negotiations with Russia, expressed the  opinion that the next round of talks between the two countries,  scheduled to begin tomorrow, will not break the deadlock.    "We hope Russia will abandon its unconstructive approach of  tying the troop withdrawal timetable to an agreement on military  pensioners," Reinart told BNS.    He emphasized that, in Estonia's view, an agreement on  social  guarantees for retired military should not determine the circle  of military pensioners entitled to remain in Estonia. "The  aliens law and the government decree explicitly state the  categories of those persons, while the agreement deals only with  technicalities: how they are to be paid, how they receive  medical aid, who and how pays for their medical treatment,  etc.," the diplomat explained.    Reinart voiced the hope, however, that the general agreement  on troop withdrawal, which the delegations have almost  completely finalized, will be initialed during the upcoming  round of talks. He underscored that the withdrawal timetable,  which Russia still hasn't presented, is part of the agreement  and that the agreement cannot be initialed without the schedule.    When Estonia learned about Moscow's plans to protect the  Russian- speaking population of the Baltic states and the CIS  countries, it became "perfectly clear" why talks on economic  issues are making no progress, Reinart said. "(The Russian  program) plainly states that Russia should not promote economic  ties with countries which, in its opinion, treat Russians badly,  so we can't expect a breakthrough in economic talks," he  maintained.    The solving of humanitarian issues, including the problem of  citizenship, is blocked by diametrically opposite interpretation  of the 1940 events and the states' succession, the Estonian  diplomat claimed.    Reinart said the border issues working group plans to tackle  demarcation of the sea border. The issue of adjoining areas  will not come up during this round of talks, since Russia hasn't  replied to Estonia's proposals.    The next round of Estonian-Russian talks is scheduled for  March 1-2. Reinart and Russia's top negotiator, Vasiliy Svirin,  will give a press conference on March 2.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Croatian Prime Minister Nikita Valentic on the </F> Slovene-Croatian talks in Ljubljana on 25 January -- recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] We have just received a report from  Ljubljana. The Slovene and Croatian delegations had talks this  afternoon and discussed open questions on their bilateral  relations. The borders, the Ljubljana bank, and the Krsko  nuclear power station are significant problems, and no  sensational results should be expected, it was said before the  talks. Were any results or progress achieved during the talks?    [Unidentified correspondent] Although, judging by the  statements [before the talks] by the Croatian and Slovene side,  no concrete results were expected at the talks today in  Ljubljana -- the general opinion is that the talks, which ended  just before the news broadcast, were still an important,  qualitative step forward in resolving existing problems in the  relations of the two countries.    [Valentic] I think that I can agree with Mr. Drnovsek  [Slovene premier] that a significant step forward was achieved  today in resolving objective existing problems.    In my opinion it is primarily important that both  governments  desire as good and as friendly relations between our two  countries as possible. I can say now that I think that the  problems are of an objective nature [as heard], they are normal  occurrences in processes of disassociation, such as was in the  case of our countries. Our states and our economies are  complementary to such an extent that there is virtually no  reason why we should not resolve all issues in the interest of  both states and peoples.    We are talking here about 10 or so agreements that we have  agreed on to a considerable extent, where we achieved  significant steps forward, but with some nuances still  unresolved, but I believe that we shall agree on them as well by  7 February in Zagreb.    It is important to sign all significant agreements, those in  connection with property belonging to Slovene citizens and  Slovene companies in Croatia, which we have never called into  question, and those referring to the settlement of our debt,  which is not a contentious issue. What is contentious are our  overall relations when it comes to the Krsko [nuclear power  plant], because our interests are absolutely mutual, from the  technological point of view to the security of the plant.    We have to a considerable extent, almost completely,  resolved  the issue of a trade treaty, because we have to increase our  trade cooperation because it is in the interest of both states.  Regardless of the situation in which Croatia has found itself,  we have been taking significant steps to revive our economy,  hoping that we shall very soon be able to take a step further --  to completely open our borders for trade, as these are  principles of an open market.    Finally, we have agreed that our state commissions should  begin examining borders at once, because we believe that this is  something that cannot be postponed. Once again, I would like to  express my personal conviction, and that of the Croatian  Government, that we wish normalization when it comes not only to  these open issues, but we also wish better relations as this is  what I really deem as being very important for both states.</p>

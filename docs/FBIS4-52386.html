			<p>BFN     [Text] The Foreign Ministry ordered the partial withdrawal  of Embassy staff family members and Korean residents from Yemen  on Monday.    Yi Yang, director-general for Middle East and African  affairs  said 25 out of 39 Koreans, including family members of the  mission staff and residents, will leave Sanaa on Monday while  Ambassador Cho Kyu-tae and 14 others will stay behind.    If the armed conflict gripping the country intensifies, the  ministry plans to pull out all embassy staff, he said.    "The withdrawal right now is for those who wished to leave.  It's in case the situation there suddenly worsens," Yi said.</p>

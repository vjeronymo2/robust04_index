			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Ticket to ride or highway robbery: The UK government's idea of making drivers pay to use motorways poses problems It was in 1839 that the peasants of south-west Wales, incensed by the cost of getting their goods to market, disguised themselves in their wives' nighties and started tearing down the detested toll gates on the roads. The violence became known as the Rebecca riots after the nom de guerre of the peasants' leader. British governments have been sensitive on the issue of road charges ever since. Undaunted by the lessons of history, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, wants to bring back tolls. Later this month, or early in the next one, he is planning to bring out a consultation paper suggesting ways of charging motorists for using Britain's motorways. He hopes to sell the idea to motorists by persuading them that they will benefit by higher investment in new roads. But will motorists be prepared to accept the charges? Or, perhaps more realistically, will Mr MacGregor's cabinet colleagues? As the Rebecca riots indicate, toll roads are no new thing in Britain. The first act for a turnpike road was passed in 1663, based on the principle that users should pay for the benefits the road brought. By 1830, more than 1,100 turnpike trusts controlled 22,000 miles of toll roads - some 20 per cent of the national road system. Certainly the turnpikes were unpopular, but that was not the reason for their demise. It was the rise of the railways in the 19th century that put them out of business. One by one, the trusts were wound up, and responsibility for the road network passed to the state. As things turned out, the triumph of the railways was to prove short-lived: cheap and flexible motor transport soon brought traffic back to the roads. Even so, it was not until the 1980s that the government started looking for ways of getting private capital interested in building highways again. Now, pressures on public spending have led to a redoubling of efforts to heave at least some of the responsibility for the road building programme onto the shoulders of the private sector. The seemingly obvious course would be to decide what roads are needed and then dole out concessions to build and operate them to the private sector, allowing companies to recoup their investment through tolls. This seems to work satisfactorily in France, Italy and Spain, where toll roads have existed for decades. Why not in the UK? One answer is that companies would stand little or no chance of making a profit in Britain because their toll roads would face competition from an existing motorway network that is free at the point of use. Elsewhere in Europe, toll roads typically provide the only motorway link between one city and another. Even given this favourable position, few are financially successful: the overwhelming majority have passed partly or wholly into public sector ownership over the years, or started out that way in the first place. From that disappointing beginning, the next step in the argument is to suggest eradicating the free competition by putting tolls on the public sector motorway network, too. This is a highly tempting proposition for any government, since it not only provides a climate in which the private sector can take over a chunk of the road building programme, but produces a very large stream of revenue for the exchequer. Unfortunately, the proposition founders on the practicality of collecting the tolls. Private motorways require multi-lane toll plazas, usually at junctions, to issue motorists with entry tickets and collect money from them at exits. While it is possible to incorporate these toll plazas into new motorways, it is impractical to build them into existing ones: the land take would be vast, particularly in a country like Britain where motorway junctions are frequent. And while it is sometimes argued that electronic toll-collecting technology will one day overcome this obstacle, that day is still many years away. There is another important issue. The effects of building a new toll road are quite different from imposing tolls on an existing motorway. In the first case, the effects are benign to the extent that the new road provides relief for the existing road network. In the second case, the imposition of tolls has the reverse effect: it tends to divert cars and lorries off the existing motorway and onto the free, secondary roads, where they are likely to do the most damage. For all these reasons, Mr MacGregor's green paper will almost certainly have to conclude that pay-as-you-go charges are a non-starter, at least until the necessary technology is available. Instead, it will end up suggesting a much simpler solution: the introduction of an annual fee for a permit to drive on the motorways, with drivers displaying the the permit, or vignette, on their windscreens. Such a system is already operating in Switzerland, where anyone wanting to drive on the motorways has to buy a SFr30 (Pounds 13.50) annual permit, available at post offices and border crossings. Introduced in 1985, the scheme is ostensibly aimed at raising funds for the completion of the motorway network, but it has also had the effect of clobbering the highly unpopular transit traffic that had previously been getting a free ride on Switzerland's roads. This was undoubtedly a factor in winning approval for the scheme in a referendum. One clear drawback with the vignette system is the unfairness of charging people the same amount whether they use the motorway once a year or twice a day. On the other hand, it is easy to introduce and simple to understand; it is much cheaper to operate than tolls - the Swiss government says only 10 per cent of fees paid are spent on administration; and the Swiss experience suggests that if the cost of the permit is not too great, most people will buy one, resulting in a low diversion of traffic from motorways to secondary roads. (The Swiss say 90 per cent of cars carry vignettes.) But this still leaves one question unanswered. How are vignettes compatible with the idea of encouraging the private sector to build toll roads? Few people would be prepared to pay extra to drive on a private road if they had already paid a fee for using the state-owned motorway running next to it. The answer could lie in shadow tolls - a system under which road tolls are paid not by motorists but by the government, according to the amount of traffic a private road carries. The effect would be that all roads, public or private, would remain free at the point of use: but the government would have a pot of money derived from the vignette and other motoring taxes, and could allocate it to roads according to the traffic they carried. Significantly, this would not only provide a means of remunerating the private sector for building new roads, but open the door to the privatisation of existing ones. Attractive though this idea may be to Mr MacGregor, his course is strewn with obstacles. One of the biggest is the Treasury, for at least two reasons. The first is that the vignette scheme would blow a hole in firmly established principles forbidding the hypothecation of revenues - that is, the notion that any specific tax should be linked to any specific expenditure. The second is that the Treasury is opposed to shadow tolls because, by failing to levy the costs of a service directly on the people who use it, they fail to regulate demand - a point hammered home by financial secretary Mr Stephen Dorrell at a British Public Works Association seminar last month. Other members of the government may have their own reasons for opposing Mr MacGregor's plans. Some, for example, may like to think they will still be members of parliament after the next general election. They are likely to have noted with horror the political furore, and subsequent rethink, that accompanied Germany's plans to introduce a vignette scheme for the autobahns next year. In Britain, even before the green paper has come out, the motoring organisations have mounted a campaign against what they fear is to come. A poll for the Royal Automobile Club published yesterday showed that 86 per cent of British motorists were hostile to the idea of charges. Already you can hear the rustle of nighties in the valleys.</p>

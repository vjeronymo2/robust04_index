			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Gucci chief moves to end deadlock MR MAURIZIO Gucci, chairman and joint shareholder of Italy's Gucci luxury goods group, yesterday offered to sell his 50 per cent stake or buy out the Investcorp banking group, the joint owner, in an attempt to break the deadlock facing the company. 'Let's put our bids in two sealed envelopes. Whoever offers the larger amount can have the other partner's shares', he suggested. Last week, Investcorp initiated legal proceedings in the US in an effort to raise the pressure on Mr Gucci, whom it accuses of mismanaging the company. The Bahrain-based bank also won a temporary freeze on Mr Gucci's shares. Mr Gucci, who announced unspecified legal actions against Investcorp in Italian and other courts, accused Investcorp of deliberately damaging the company in an attempt to force him to sell his holding. He said that relations between the two partners, which share control of the group founded by his grandfather 70 years ago, had virtually broken down over the past seven months. Mr Gucci declined to speculate on why Investcorp had blocked decision-making at the group, which is facing serious difficulties. Mr Gucci said Investcorp had gone so far as to obstruct attempts to secure repayment of L104bn (Dollars 64.8m) due to Gucci's Italian holding company from its US subsidiary. As a result, the holding company's balance sheet had deteriorated from being L19.1bn in credit with banks to a L85bn deficit at the end of last April. A spokesman for the bank refused to comment on what he called Mr Gucci's 'inaccurate statement'. The issue would now be decided by the courts in the US, he said. 'The facts will speak for themselves and the case will be decided on its merits.' Mr Gucci denied that he had been forced to pledge his shares to obtain bank loans. According to Investcorp, such actions would have invalidated the shareholders' agreement between the two parties. It gives either side the right of first refusal in the event that the shares change hands.</p>

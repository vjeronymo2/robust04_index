			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 9 Feb (TANJUG) -- Major General Manoljo  Milovanovic, chief of the general staff of the army of the  Srpska republic, stated this evening that a cease-fire coming  into effect at noon tomorrow [10 February] was agreed at a  meeting between Serb and Muslim military representatives this  afternoon, with the mediation of General Michael Rose, UN  Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina.    General Milovanovic said that an agreement was reached to  place both Serb and Muslim artillery under UNPROFOR control for  the duration of the cease-fire.    He explained that UNPROFOR has conveyed to the Muslim side  the Serb side's proposal regarding the cease-fire and the  setting up of a mixed military commission which will find ways  to maintain the cease-fire. He added that the Muslim side has  agreed to this.    The cease-fire will be guaranteed by UNPROFOR. Commissions  will tour the entire front around Sarajevo in order to establish  where these sensitive spots are and deploy UNPROFOR observers  there to determine who is violating the truce, General  Milovanovic stressed.    The chief of staff said he was surprised by General Rose's  claim that some kind of an agreement was signed at today's  meeting. He specified that nothing was signed and that all that  was accomplished was a verbal agreement, whose details he cited.  He emphasized that this is a truce and that the Muslim  artillery is in no way exempt from it.    General Milovanovic added that UNPROFOR and the Serb and  Muslim sides have assumed responsibility for inspecting all  positions through mixed military commissions and devising ways  to maintain the truce. These ways will be discussed tomorrow.</p>

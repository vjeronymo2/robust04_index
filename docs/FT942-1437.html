			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Clarke heads off calls to cut taxes Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday put tax cuts on the back burner by warning the cabinet that reductions in public spending would be 'extremely tough'. Facing renewed rightwing calls for early tax cuts to restore Tory popularity, Mr Clarke told ministers not to underestimate the difficulty of achieving existing fore-casts. Backed by Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Mr Clarke said all the obvious targets for cuts had been tackled in last year's public spending round. The chancellor's warnings, delivered at the beginning of a one-hour debate on public spending, forestalled any discussion of tax cuts by the cabinet's rightwing minority. The cabinet did not discuss undershooting the Treasury's 'control totals' for non-cyclical spending of Pounds 263bn for the coming financial year and Pounds 272.3bn for 1996-97. Downing Street said spending would be kept 'within' the control totals, renamed ceilings to emphasise the Treasury's view of them as limits rather than targets. Mr Clarke told the cabinet his strategy would keep growth of public spending during the period to 1997 below growth in the economy as a whole. He said the government remained committed to reducing the proportion of national output taken by the state, which would, in turn, reduce the public sector deficit. Mr Clarke has said that he will not cut taxes until a looser fiscal stance is justified by reductions in the public sector borrowing requirement. But his remarks keep open the option of tax cuts in 1995 or 1996, which would satisfy many backbenchers who believe tax will be the main issue in the next general election. In the City, analysts remained worried that ministers might be tempted into tax cuts in an attempt to restore the government's declining popularity. 'If they can deliver spending cuts in 1994, they may be able to cut taxes in 1995,' said Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at James Capel. 'But we do need to see actual cuts in spending rather than vague trimming of the contingency reserve.' Ms Harriet Harman, the shadow chief secretary, accused the government of endangering Britain's long-term economic prospects by planning further cuts in public investment. 'Cuts in public investment will simply exacerbate Britain's chronic economic problems of under-investment and under-capacity,' she said. Detailed analysis of the prospects for public spending cuts will be carried out by the EDX committee, chaired by the chancellor, which will report to the cabinet in the autumn. The committee is expected to look hard at the scope for cuts in the Pounds 85bn social security budget, the criminal justice system and the running costs of government departments.</p>

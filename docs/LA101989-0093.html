			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINNERS OF SPELLING BEE ARE LETTER-PERFECT  </P> <P> Nina Throngwongsa and Thomas Majich, both 7, stood together on a raised stage  in the middle of the crowded mall. The moment of truth had arrived.  </P> <P> The two youngsters had defeated 35 other first- and second-grade students from  13 San Gabriel Valley elementary schools and now faced each other as finalists  in the sixth annual Plaza Pasadena Spelling Bee.  </P> <P> It was the first night of the three-day competition sponsored by Encyclopedia  Britannica USA and Plaza Pasadena.  </P> <P> Tonight marks the last evening of the spelling bee, with fifth- and sixth-grade  students competing for first- and second-place awards. Third- and  fourth-graders competed Wednesday.  </P> <P> The word that brought Nina, a second-year spelling bee veteran, to the brink of  victory was nightgown. After Thomas stumbled on the word, Nina gave the correct  spelling and moved on to another trial.  </P> <P> And then, Nina, a second-grader at Saint Felicitas and Perpetua School in San  Marino, spelled snowflakes in a steady voice despite her outwardly nervous  appearance.  </P> <P> Dressed in a plaid dress, white blouse and blue tennis shoes, Nina smiled shyly  as she received her trophy, certificate and encyclopedia book set worth about  $124.  </P> <P> "She's the best speller in our class," said Stacy Randolph, one of the many  schoolmates who encircled Nina as she walked off the stage.  </P> <P> Last year, Nina placed third in the event. "It's fun. I'll be in it again next  year," she said.  </P> <P> Thomas, who participated for the first time, wasn't quite so nonchalant.  </P> <P> "The words kept getting harder," said Thomas, a student at Assumption of the  Blessed Virgin Mary School in Pasadena. Coming so close to victory the first  time out ensured one thing, though. "I know I'll be back," he said.  </P> <P> The competition "is real family oriented and very competitive," said Teresa  McGowen, Plaza Pasadena marketing director. It is one of many sponsored  throughout the year by by the encyclopedia company.  </P> <P> "I thought it was fantastic," said Thomas' grandmother, Eva Majich. "I'm very  proud. His mom was in school tonight. She'll be proud, too."  </P> <P> For 7-year-old Stacy, the bee was a family affair. She and her younger brother  participated on Tuesday evening and her older brother competed with the third-  and fourth-grade students.  </P> <P> Stacy, who participated last year, made sure she prepared for Tuesday's event  by studying with her first-grade brother, Scotty.  </P> <P> "It's fun," she said. "People are here from my school trying it out."  </P> <P> After being eliminated in her sixth round, Stacy smiled, put her hand to her  chest and said, "I'm still nervous. My heart is beating fast.  </P> <P> "I'm just trying to do my best," she said. "I'll be back next year."  </P> <P> Sarah Randolph, Stacy's mother, called the bee good exposure for the children.  </P> <P> "It gives them confidence to at least try and make an effort," she said.  </P> <P> Another competitor, Stephanie Choy of Pasadena, said: "It's kind of scary. I've  never been on stage before.  </P> <P> "It's fun going on stage but not coming down. I don't like spelling words in  front of everybody," said the second-grade Cambridge School student.  </P> <P> Robert Subia Sr., father of Robert Subia Jr., said the spelling bee will keep  his boy from becoming shy.  </P> <P> "We encouraged him to participate," he said. "This will give him confidence in  his learning ability and in speaking out in front of an audience."  </P> <P> Almost 40 students participated Tuesday and more than 80 people attended the  competition. McGowen said she expects over 200 students, from schools  throughout the San Gabriel Valley, to participate in this year's event.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 'LOST VILLAGE' ISN'T A LANDMARK, PANEL SAYS;  </P> <P> HERITAGE: THE CITY SAYS THERE'S NO PROOF THAT THE SITE WHERE TWO OFFICE  BUILDINGS ARE PLANNED CONTAINS EXTENSIVE ARTIFACTS.  </P> <P> The city Cultural Heritage Commission refused Wednesday to consider two  redevelopment sites near the "Lost Village of Encino" for designation as  historical monuments, citing lack of proof that they contain archeological  artifacts.  </P> <P> But the commissioners said they would reconsider the application if a coalition  of suburban homeowners and American Indians can substantiate claims that the  vacant lots are among "the most sensitive archeological sites in the entire San  Fernando Valley."  </P> <P> During the 90-minute hearing in City Hall, the commission's staff architect and  attorney both said that despite the significance of the 1984 "Lost Village"  excavation, the presence of more Indian remains in the area near Ventura and  Balboa boulevards has yet to be confirmed.  </P> <P> Benjamin M. Reznik, a prominent attorney who represents Valley developers,  agreed, and argued that state laws would protect any artifacts found during  construction.  </P> <P> "Does the city go around designating properties based on speculation and  hearsay?" Reznik asked.  </P> <P> The commission also urged developers, who are poised to begin construction of  two office buildings, to first allow neighborhood activists to conduct  archeological surveys on the property. But Gerald Silver, president of  Homeowners of Encino, countered that such studies were the developers'  responsibility. Reznik said he would advise his client, Katell/Capretta  Partners of Gardena, against doing anything not legally required.  </P> <P> "This whole thing is a hoax," Reznik said after the hearing, charging that  Silver was but the latest activist to exploit the commission for a slow-growth  campaign. Silver has also appealed the two projects' construction permits to  the city Building and Safety Commission.  </P> <P> Reznik and others have accused the commission in recent months of caving in to  anti-development activists and awarding the monument designation too liberally.  In a recent controversial case, the commission declared a portion of bucolic  Fryman Canyon in the Hollywood Hills a cultural monument in response to a  request from Valley residents who opposed a luxury residential development.  </P> <P> The cultural commission's decision Wednesday came after some tense testimony,  including the pleas of a father on behalf of his sons, who are developing one  of the office buildings.  </P> <P> "Please, if this deal for my children goes bad, I'm afraid they may have a  heart attack," said an emotional Ned Cohen, who described finding his sons  Maurice and Albert with their heads in their hands this week because of  Silver's efforts.  </P> <P> The Cohen brothers of Studio City, both in their late 20s, want to build a  47,800-square-foot office building at Ventura Boulevard and La Maida Street,  east of Los Encinos State Historic Park and across the street from the "Lost  Village" site. Ned Cohen said his sons would go bankrupt if the project  encounters more delays.  </P> <P> Had the cultural commission agreed to consider Silver's application,  construction would have been automatically delayed for 60 days while the panel  visited the sites and made their recommendation to the City Council.  </P> <P> More than 1 million artifacts and the remains of about two dozen Indians were  excavated from the "Lost Village" site six years ago at a cost of $1.7 million.  Experts contend that it is the site of a major Indian city that was documented  by 18th-Century Spanish explorers and long sought by modern archeologists.  </P> <P> Today, the site -- at the southeast corner of Ventura and Balboa boulevards --  is covered by a large office building. The human remains found during the  building's 1984 construction have been reburied in Los Encinos State Historic  Park, and the artifacts remain in storage.  </P> <P> Reznik, whose client plans a $25 million, 132,000-square-foot office building  near the northeast corner of Ventura and Balboa boulevards, questioned why no  one applied for the historic-cultural designation when the "Lost Village" was  unearthed.  </P> <P> Anticipating arguments that he is more interested in Ventura Boulevard's  density than he is in American Indian heritage, Silver told the commission:  </P> <P> "I have to say candidly that yes, Homeowners of Encino is very distressed by  the developments that have taken place. But I ask that you make your  determination solely on the facts, on the merits of this case."  </P> <P> Another Encino resident, Kathy Lewis of Property Owners of Encino, asked that  the commission use its power to freeze the developers' building permits and  give her 60 days to attempt to negotiate with the developers for archeological  surveys.  </P> <P> Maurice Cohen told the commission that he would be willing to pay for such a  survey. But later, after consulting with builder Jerry Katell in the hallway,  Cohen said he was undecided.  </P></p>

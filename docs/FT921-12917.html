			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Enterprise zones win tax-break extension AN INLAND Revenue ruling has enabled 100 per cent capital allowances in Britain's enterprise zones to be extended, in special circumstances, by 10 years beyond the life of the zone. The allowances are disliked by the government and the European Commission because they distort markets and encourage tax avoidance, but the difficulty was supposed to be limited to the zones' 10-year lifespan. The first use of the extended tax break will be in Trafford Park, Greater Manchester, where it is hoped to salvage part of a flagship project of the park's development corporation. The project was halted by the effect of the sharp decline of London commercial property values on its developer, Rosehaugh. The corporation, which is a government agency, yesterday relaunched its Wharfside project along the mainly derelict south bank of Manchester Ship Canal, opposite the successful Salford Quays. Now a less ambitious scheme is going ahead with Amec, the Cheshire-based civil engineering, contracting and property development group. The Revenue ruling states that if a building contract is awarded on enterprise-zone land before the zone's life expires, the 100 per cent capital allowances can be applied to any building started within 10 years of the contract date. In the Trafford Park case, the development corporation contracted to sell the land involved to Amec Properties, which in turn signed a building contract with Fairclough, another member of the Amec group. The contracts were signed last August, just before expiry of the enterprise zone. The Revenue confirmed on December 17 that anything Amec now builds on the land will enjoy 100 per cent capital allowances. That means that a company with a tax obligation can buy a building there and pay 35 per cent of the costs out of its taxes. The Manchester Ship Canal company, which owns land in the former zone, is also understood to have agreed a building contract on it before the zone expired to protect future capital allowances. Other developers in expiring and extant enterprise zones around the country are believed to have followed suit.</p>

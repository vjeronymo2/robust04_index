			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Statoil gas supply fears STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, has been forced to consider drastic measures to prevent threatening interruption of gas supply to the European continent, its main market. The group is looking at alternatives to allow domestic gas production to bypass the ageing Norwegian North Sea Ekofisk field centre, the hub of the world's largest transportation system. Concern over the 20-year-old Ekofisk facilities has increased since the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the oil industry watchdog, warned Phillips Petroleum Norway, operator, that the tank on the main processing and transportation facilities might have to be closed for safety reasons in the winter of 1995-1996. Approximately 18bn cu m of gas annually is transported to a consortium of European buyers via Ekofisk and approximately 40 per cent of Norway's petroleum production is processed there. The directorate is expected to respond on Monday to interim measures presented yesterday by Phillips for modifications at Ekofisk until a final plan to meet stringent demands for the field's rehabilitation and safety enhancement can be presented late next year. Phillips said yesterday it would relocate process facilities elsewhere in the field. With Norway's gas supply to Europe increasing, Statoil sees it as a priority to reduce dependence on Ekofisk. It said operational reliability of the Statpipe gas transportation system, which is connected to Ekofisk, had been reduced by problems this year at the field. Statoil intends to unveil a proposal for an alternative solution next year. Production from the Ula and Gyda fields, operated by British Petroleum Norway, is also affected by Ekofisk irregularities.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Antonello Caporale report: "Signatures Betray Segni"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- Disqualified before the start. Excluded  from the last round in this very tough election campaign without  even having been able to size up their adversary. [Pact for  Italy leader] Mariotto Segni is paying a higher price than some.  His list, the Pact for Italy, is absent from several electoral  constituencies. There are a few problems (fewer than before)  for [Radical leader] Marco Pannella, and a few difficulties  (more than expected) for the Democratic Alliance, the Greens,  and Rete.    It is the fault, so to speak, of the new electoral law, of  its least well-known rule, which requires for the presentation  of each list the signatures of no less than 4,000 citizens (and  no more than 4,500) for each of the 26 proportional  constituencies into which Italy is divided. And of 500  signatures to support the candidates in the single-candidate  constituencies. In this election, however, these figures have  been reduced by decree to half, since it is taking place early.    This was not the case before. All the parties represented in  parliament by at least one deputy were exempted from having to  gather signatures. Now no such allowances apply to anyone. As  expected, this penalizes most the less well-structured groups  with the least well-established support throughout Italy. There  have been no problems for the PDS [Democratic Party of the  Left], the League, or the National Alliance. Forza Italia  (which was able to count on the League in the North and on the  organized strength of many faction leaders of the former  four-party alliance in the South) found things harder than  expected. Be that as it may, there has been no confirmation (or  denial) of any difficulties from its headquarters at Arcore.    However, there was confirmation from Segni's headquarters on  largo del Nazareno: The Pact's list -- which is separate from  that of Martinazzoli's Popular Party -- will definitely not be  presented in Basilicata, Abruzzi, Trentino, and Lombardy 3.  There are also fears for the future of the Pact in the Lazio 2,  Piedmont, and Veneto constituencies. So Segni, who holds the  record for gathering signatures (he made his involvement  conditional on gathering a million signatures in support of his  policy line) is suffering the shame of seeing his group excluded  from many cities in both the North and the South of the country,  as a result of his movement's still weak organization.    The Democratic Alliance has also emerged battered from the  chase for signatures. The numbers achieved mean that Adornato  and Bordon are being forced to relinquish their candidacies in  Abruzzo, Basilicata, and in Lombardy 2 and Veneto 2. There are  major anxieties about the findings of the local courts of appeal  in Friuli and Marches.    Lucania has treated the Greens badly, too. They are bowing  out of Lombardy 3 and Lazio 2. Rete is having to leave Friuli  and Veneto 2. However, Marco Pannella's list was again able to  benefit from his long experience of organizing referendums. The  Radicals managed to limit the damage, though Pannella's list was  not successful in Basilicata and Marches. The figures for  Trentino and Umbria have still to be confirmed.    It was Pannella who sounded the warning. Beware, he said:  we need thousands of signatures to back our lists on the  electoral registers. People do not realize this, he shouted;  the press and television stations are saying nothing about it.  Suddenly all the minor groupings -- which have been busy for  weeks recruiting, shifting, or turning down candidates --  realized that he was right. Only last Thursday [17 February]  (the Pact finalized its lists late Friday morning) did they turn  their attention to signatures. The law requires that the  gathering of signatures follow the choice of candidates; that  the signatories all be residents of the constituencies in which  the candidates are standing; and, moreover, that each signature  be accompanied by an electoral certificate. In some cases, that  really proved too much.</p>

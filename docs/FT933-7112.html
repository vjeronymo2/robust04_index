			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / People: Peter Allen retires early Peter Allen, the deputy chairman of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, has announced his intention to retire from the firm in April next year when he will be 56. His departure follows the decision by Brandon Gough, chairman of Coopers for the past ten years, to step down when his current term finishes in April 1994. These moves clear the way for elections from among the partners for a new chairman, who will be able to select a fresh management team. The vote takes place in November. Coopers says that Allen had told his partners earlier this year that he would be retiring and that he intends to take on a number of non-executive appointments. He joined the firm in 1963 from university, became a partner in 1973 and partner in charge of the London office in 1983 before becoming managing partner in 1984. He led a team that nego-tiated the merger with Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells in 1990 and after that became deputy chairman with responsibility for overseeing UK activities and acting as chairman of the management consultancy practice across Europe.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Fei Weiwei (6316 0251 0251) and </F> XINHUA reporter Li Anan (2621 1344 1344)]    [Text] Beijing, 31 May (XINHUA) -- The National Commodity  Price Inspection Work Conference opened today in Beijing. Chen  Jinhua, head of the National Commodity Price Inspection Leading  Group and minister in charge of the State Planning Commission,  spoke at the meeting. He said: With the implementation of  various macroeconomic and price control measures and with the  carrying out of national commodity price inspection, the  excessive rises in the general levels of commodity prices have  begun to slow down.    Vice Premier of the State Council Zou Jiahua attended  today's  meeting. During the meeting, Chen Jinhua reviewed the national  commodity price inspection work in the previous period. He  pointed out that the work on national commodity price inspection  has achieved initial results, thanks to the transmission of the  circular calling for implementing price inspection, to the  spreading of the news on carrying out price inspection, and to  the arrangement made jointly since March by commodity price  departments and other relevant departments on price inspection.  He listed the following as the major accomplishments of price  inspection work.    -- Price inspection has helped raise the people's awareness  of the necessity of regulating and controlling prices under a  market economy. Since the beginning of this year, leading  comrades of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have  repeatedly stressed the need for enhancing macroeconomic  regulation and control, bringing down inflation, and maintaining  social order. During national commodity price inspection, the  State Planning Commission and propaganda department launched a  propaganda drive aimed at deepening reform, enhancing  macroeconomic regulation and control, and promoting healthy  market growth. This drive has helped bring about a favorable  climate to stress the need for exercising regulation, control,  and management over prices under a commodity market economy and  marked the beginning of a change in the laissez-faire attitude  over the decontrolled prices.    -- Price inspection has promoted the implementation of price  regulation, control, and management measures formulated by the  state. Some provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities)  have begun establishing a grain risk fund system. The system of  showing clear price-markings on commodities and of a clear  listing of service charges has been promoted at state and  collective-owned retail stores and at fee-charging  administrative units. Private enterprises and individual  vendors have also begun to show more responsiveness to the call  for clear price markings and to the call for clear indications  of service charges. A considerable number of provinces  (autonomous regions and municipalities) have worked out specific  rules for supervising and reviewing the prices of daily  necessities and service charges.    -- Price inspection has helped investigate and deal with a  number of cases involving pricing irregularities. Various  localities have conducted checks on the prices of consumer  goods, on monopolistic means of production prices, and service  charges. According to incomplete statistics, between the period  of 10 March and 10 May, over 190,000 cases of pricing  irregularities were uncovered throughout the nation involving  illicit gains of about 400 million yuan. So far, 100,000 cases  of pricing irregularities have been dealt with and fines of over  88 million yuan have been imposed. As a result of investigating  and handling cases of pricing irregularities, the practices of  price gouging and of arbitrary fee collection have been checked.  Localities have paid particular attention to disclosing the  handling of a number of serious cases which have created a great  social impact. So far, various localities have publicly handled  some 1,200 cases of price irregularities.    -- Price inspection has helped manufacturers and business  operators to strengthen in-house price management. During the  national commodity price inspection, many enterprises conducted  in-house price-checks, reported voluntarily on pricing,  corrected their pricing mistakes, and standardized price-setting  practices of their own accord.    Chen Jinhua stressed that the CPC Central Committee, the  State Council, and the masses had attached great importance to  and placed great expectations on national commodity price  inspection. Price inspection tasks had been arduous and were  conducted in very short time. The next task for various levels  of governments, he said, is to conscientiously review previous  work, sort out problems, analyze causes of the problems,  formulate countermeasures, and carry out price inspection work  in a down-to-earth and in-depth manner. Chen Jinhua said it is  necessary to enhance leadership and to exert efforts by placing  priority on checking key product prices whose sharp rises affect  the general level of commodity prices and to checking prices of  other products and service charges whose rises cause the masses'  great dissatisfaction. The first priority, he said, should go  to checking the prices of grain, cotton, and other daily  necessities. The second priority should be to check rural  areas' electricity rates and the prices of such means of  production as steel and refined oil. The third priority is to  check basic service charges. The purpose of checking key  product prices, Chen Jinhua noted, is to put to a stop to the  practices of pricing irregularities and to help bring stability  into the masses' basic life. The guiding and supervisory roles  of public opinion should be brought into full play. Deeds of  advanced models should be publicized. Efforts must be made to  strictly investigate into and deal with a number of typically  bad cases; those who are found to have been involved in the  practices of price-gouging and of making arbitrary collections  of fees must be exposed to the public. This will encourage the  people, help enterprises adopt proper price-setting behavior,  and deter would-be price-gouging units and individuals. It is  necessary to treat a disease by looking into both its root cause  and symptoms. Therefore, efforts should be made to improve and  perfect existing laws and regulations and accelerate the pace of  pricing legislation. There is a need to persist in carrying out  price inspections together with conducting an investigation and  study of pricing problems; to sum up experiences; to plug  loopholes; and to study measures to enhance price regulation,  control, and management. He expressed the hope that departments  concerned will continue close coordination, bring into play  their respective advantages, and continue to help the masses  supervise prices. He also said that it is necessary to  strengthen leadership over pricing work, to help maintain  stability at price-related organs, to increase price inspection  work force, and to improve the price inspection method. In  conclusion, Chen Jinhua called on all levels of governments to  show greater concern and support for price inspection work.</p>

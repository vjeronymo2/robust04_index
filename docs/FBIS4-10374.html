			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 7 Apr (EFE) -- President Cesar  Gaviria Trujillo met in his office today with Cuban Castro  opponent Jorge Mas Canosa, sources at the Colombian presidential  palace confirmed to EFE.    Gaviria had an hour-long talk with Mas Canosa, and,  according  to the delegation of Cuban exiles, they discussed the sale of  Colombian oil to Cuba, which anti-Castro groups have strongly  criticized.    According to Mas Canosa's retinue, they also analyzed the  future of relations between Cuba and the United States in the  wake of Gaviria's election to the post of OAS secretary general  on 27 March.    Two weeks ago, Huber Matos, head of the Independent and  Democratic Cuba [Independent and Democratic Cuba--CID] movement  visited Colombia to request suspension of the oil sale to  Castro's government, but he did not meet with Gaviria, because,  he said, he was not expecting to be received by "Castro's pals."    Matos, one of the commanders of the triumphant 1959  revolution, which Castro now heads, said the oil sale means the  rupture of the economic embargo the United States imposed on  Cuba 30 years ago.    Colombia announced it will supply approximately 20,000  barrels of crude a day to Cuba starting in July, under the  condition Cuba guarantees the operation with the corresponding  letters of credit. Castro opponents oppose the transaction,  however, and threaten to boycott Colombian products in the  United States.</p>

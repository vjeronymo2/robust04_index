			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Agip to develop Nigerian concessions AGIP OIL Company of Nigeria has signed a production-sharing contract to develop two deep water concessions south of Benin. Under terms revised by the Nigerian government early this year, Agip is the latest of several major oil companies to sign a production-sharing contract for deep water concessions off the Niger delta. The company will fund all the development in return for lower tax and royalties to the government once it is producing oil. Those terms replace the joint ventures with Nigeria's state oil company, NNPC, in which the multinationals were only allowed 40 per cent. Agip paid a signing fee of Dollars 35m and is committed to spend at least Dollars 100m developing blocks 211 and 316 south of Benin city. It expects to start work in the last quarter of 1993. The company has three other interests in Nigeria. It is the operator of  - and 20 per cent shareholder in - a joint venture with NNPC and Philips of the US, and has a 5 per cent stake in a venture with NNPC, Shell and Elf that produces about half of Nigeria's oil. In addition, Agip Energy and Natural Resources has a service contract with NNPC at Nigeria's deepest offshore production field, Agbara.</p>

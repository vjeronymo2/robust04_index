			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (21): Disciplined but flexible approach pays off - The installation of an integrated personnel and payroll system at Hotpoint, the domestic appliance supplier, is enabling the company to give line managers control over their own staff information / User View; Payroll and personnel functions at Hotpoint MIKE KEALEY, personnel manager at Hotpoint, the domestic appliance supplier, has firm views on how to introduce human resources computer systems successfully . 'Keep it simple, by concentrating on getting the basic information right first,' he says. 'Bear in mind that it's a long process to build up all the data you want in the system. You can give line managers ownership of information on their staff, but personnel must keep control of data input.' These simple tenets have stood Hotpoint in good stead as it has moved to an integrated personnel and payroll package covering 6,500 employees at three factories, a design department, a service operation and an administrative headquarters split between Peterborough and North Wales. Hotpoint used to run separate payroll and personnel packages on an IBM mainframe computer. The company then moved to DEC Vax computers and started looking for a new system. In particular, it wanted a single, integrated system with one common database. This would avoid duplication and ensure that the payroll and personnel functions were always working from the same data. 'One of my hobby-horses is that you can duplicate information on computer systems if you're not careful,' says Mike Kealey. 'You end up with different systems holding the same data.' He adds: 'Payroll data is the most accurate data you have. If someone working for you is not recorded on the system, you'll soon know about is as soon as his first pay day comes. 'With an integrated system personnel it is using the same data, which means for example that line managers and financial people doing budgeting are working from accurate information.' Hotpoint chose the Sequel package from Imago - 'we started looking a year ago and although there were lots of mainframe and personal computer packages there was relatively little for mid-range computers,' says Mr Kealey. 'Imago was established and 100 per cent reliable, whereas some other products were new or still under development,' he adds. Imago also offered the right level of flexibility. 'Other suppliers offered their package and woe betide you if you wanted to change it,' Mike Kealey says. 'For example, with one product we couldn't change a label shown against a particular data field, although the supplier offered to do it at a price. Our computing department has given us a lot of support, but we didn't want to have to start relying on them to write special programs: we didn't want to lose the ability to drive the system ourselves. 'In addition, we had developed our own screens in line with our own needs on our previous system over a long period and we wanted the new system to mirror these: why re-invent the wheel? 'Some suppliers provided masses of screens - but still didn't meet our needs. They went overboard on the amount of employee information which could be included, which meant basic information might go over several screens. Imago offered us instead the flexibility to recreate our existing screens and to improve on them using facilities such as pop-up windows.' Mike Kealey stresses that the right procedures surrounding a computer system are vital. 'People change address and get married and so on, so you have to have manual procedures behind the system to keep the information up-to-date,' he says. 'We have set up update screens and designed a paper form which reflects the screen layout. The form is filled in by the employee and then becomes a data entry document. We have done a lot of internal publicity about the availability and importance of these disciplined procedures.' He adds: 'It's fine to have a wonderful system offering all sorts of analyses, but you must get the basics right: you lose credibility if one of these reports has got someone's name wrong.' The personnel department is now starting to give line managers direct access to information on their staff, generally using enquiry or report facilities set up by personnel. A side benefit of this is that it is enforcing the procedures. 'We recently gave the design director access, which meant ownership passed to department level,' says Mike Kealey. 'This had the effect of quickly bringing the information up to date: when the director started coming across missing data he very quickly gathered it. Line managers want full and accurate information.' Even so, the personnel department has kept central responsibility for updating records: a line manager might spot a gap but he then gets the appropriate form completed, which goes to personnel for entry to the system. The one area where line managers can enter data is that of training. The factories and the design, service and headquarters operations all manage their own training. In the past, they kept their own records on paper. In future, the system will hold these records and the line managers are now starting to enter information themselves directly. 'Training is decentralised and previously the records were too, but our aim now is to centralise the records without centralising the workload,' says Mike Kealey. 'This means we get corporate information on the amount of training going on, while at individual level if someone moves from service into design, for example, information about his previous training is not lost, because it is recorded about him in the system.'</p>

The province's two-way trade volume in that year hit 46.9  billion U.S. dollars-worth, which breaks down to 19.9 billion  U.S. dollars-worth of import and 27 billion U.S. dollars-worth  of exports, up 71 percent and 46 percent, respectively, over  1992.    The export volume ranked first for the eighth consecutive  year among China's mainland provinces, municipalities and  regions, and the figure raised the province's percentage of the  national total export volume from 24.3 percent in 1992 to 29.4  percent last year.    Last year Guangdong signed 19,012 cooperation contracts with  overseas investors, involving contractual foreign investment  exceeding 34.89 billion U.S. dollars, rises of 47.2 percent and  75.7 percent over 1992, respectively.    The province actually used more than 9.65 billion U.S.  dollars in foreign investment in 1993, up 98.6 percent over a  year earlier. The figure is about 26.25 percent of the year's  actually utilized foreign investment in China.    Provincial officials said that the growth rates were all  unprecedented.    Various foreign trade enterprises now number more than 1,000  in this prosperous southern Chinese province. Moreover, many  large foreign trade enterprises have joined hands to form  foreign trade groups, and 56 foreign trade enterprises have been  singled out to experiment with reform policies for transforming  their operating mechanism.    In recent years Guangdong has been engaged in rationalizing  its import and export pattern. As a result, exports of primary  products have dropped, while exports of machinery, and  electrical and textile products have increased. The province  has also increased its imports of infrastructural products, raw  materials and high-tech items.    The officials said that, so far, Guangdong has established  close trade and economic relations with more than 50 countries  and regions all over the world and the province's exports have  become more diversified than ever.    Following the expansion of the reform and opening-up  efforts,  Guangdong has for more than a decade remained a favored area for  foreign investment, which now pours in from over 70 countries  and regions worldwide.    While investment from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan keeps  increasing, some developed countries like Japan, Sweden, Canada,  Australia and Britain have also increased their investments by  large margins.    Overseas investors are showing more interest in the  province's telecommunications, energy, transportation, real  estate, commerce, trade and tourism sectors. The number of  large and technology-intensive investment projects has increased.    Some transnational corporations and financial groups have  invested heavily in Guangdong's power projects as well as bridge  and road building.    Sources said that the mountainous areas of Guangdong have  also accelerated the pace of attracting and utilizing foreign  investment. The amount that they used in 1993 was 115 percent  more than in 1992.    Overall, Guangdong had licensed a total of 44,705  foreign-invested enterprises by the end of last year.    According to incomplete statistics, some 12,000 of the  foreign- invested ventures generated a total of 160 billion yuan  (about 18.4 billion U.S. dollars) in output value in 1993,  earning more than 10.3 billion U.S. dollars from exports.</p>

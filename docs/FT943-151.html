			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Watchdog fails to join Yorshire Water board City institutions yesterday overturned a victory by small shareholders of Yorkshire Water, who had overwhelmingly supported a proposal that Mrs Diana Scott, a former consumer watchdog, should join the board of directors. Mrs Scott, former chairman of the Ofwat Yorkshire Region Customer Service Committee, contended that she had relevant experience to deal with the strident environmental and customer complaints expressed at yesterday's annual meeting. She won support from a big majority of individual shareholders on a show of hands at a raucous meeting in Pudsey, West Yorkshire, attended by about 600 people. However Sir Gordon Jones, Yorkshire Water's chairman, called for a poll, and institutions swung the vote, supporting the management decision to block Mrs Scott by a ratio of nearly 4:1. The votes cast against her election represented 62.3m shares versus 16.5m in favour. Pensions and Investment Research Consultants, a pension fund consultancy, had backed the appointment of Mrs Scott because of concerns over Yorkshire's environmental record and the number of customer complaints. The local authority pension funds of North, South and West Yorkshire, as well as Humberside, are all understood to have voted in favour of Mrs Scott. Mr Stuart Bell, research director at PIRC, said: 'It represents a clear moral victory. Given the overlap between shareholders and customers, this can also be taken as a reflection of customers' views.' Sir Gordon defended his company's record, saying: 'Yorkshire's rivers have not been cleaner since the industrial revolution,' claiming that half of the company's substantial investment programme was being spent on reversing decades of government neglect. The number of complaints had fallen by 30 per cent in period between March and July, compared with a year earlier, although for 1993 as a whole complaints had bucked the downward national trend by rising 12 per cent. He also stated that a Pounds 75,000 fine, over a burst sewage pipe, had been reduced to Pounds 15,000, which meant that Yorkshire was in the middle ranks for fines on polluting water companies instead of at the top, as stated by PIRC. All the proxy cards sent to shareholders had 'not recommended by the directors' stamped against Mrs Scott. Sir Gordon claimed that 'if we were looking for another non-executive director, we would want someone with international and big company experience.' Mrs Scott's riposte was that the show of discontent had 'demonstrated how important it is to have someone on the board with my expierience'.</p>

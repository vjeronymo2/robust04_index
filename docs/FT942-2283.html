			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: New York After last week's troubling late sell-off, which pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond up to 7.44 per cent, traders and investors are likely to be grateful that the absence of any important economic releases this week should allow them to catch their breath. The only two sets of data likely to have much of an impact upon prices are the April trade report and the May durable goods orders. The trade numbers are out tomorrow and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the Wall Street brokers, predicts that the trade deficit of goods and services will have widened from Dollars 7.5bn in March to Dollars 8.5bn in April. The firm expects the deficit to have widened because it believes the recent slowdown in economic growth will have led to a larger fall in exports than in imports. Normally, this would not prompt much of a reaction in Treasury prices, because the bond market does not pay a great deal of attention to the trade figures. Yet, given the fact that the weakness of the dollar helped to undermine Treasury prices last week as investors are always wary of imported inflation, any larger than expected widening in the trade deficit could unsettle the US currency, and with it Treasury prices. As for the durable goods orders, DLJ forecasts a modest increase in orders of 0.2 per cent in May, compared with growth of 0.1 per cent in April.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the purposes of these standards, the current scheme of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classifying vehicles as either Otto-cycle or diesel is being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extended to gaseous-fueled vehicles, with some modifications as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described below. This classification scheme was promulgated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the methanol standards to group engines regardless of fuel type in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a manner that would provide equivalent control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although there are other factors to consider, in general an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Otto-cycle engine is considered to be one that is throttled during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normal operation whereas a diesel is not. The Agency recognizes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, that in some cases this criterion may not be adequate or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to determine a vehicle's classification. For example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a gaseous-fueled engine which is derived from a particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Otto-cycle or diesel base engine, and is expected to be used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar applications as the base engine, would most appropriately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be classified the same as the base engine from which it was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derived. In such cases the Administrator will take into account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other relevant factors, such as compression ratio, combustion and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thermodynamic characteristics, or intended in-use duty cycle when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classifying the vehicle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's rule establishes the same evaporative emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for gaseous-fueled vehicles which were recently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted for other vehicles. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  The Agency recognizes that due to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sealed nature of gaseous-fueled vehicle fuel systems, emissions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unburned fuel from the fuel system are expected to be near-zero.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the evaporative requirements are being adopted to assure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leak-free fuel systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR 16002, March 24, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's rule establishes refueling requirements for gaseous-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refueling stations. Natural gas-fueled vehicles must be equipped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a refueling receptacle which meets the requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recently adopted ANSI/AGA NGV1 standard for refueling couplings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Natural gas refueling stations will not be allowed to vent more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 1.2 grams natural gas due to refueling nozzle disconnect. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable dates for these standards are discussed in the timing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section of today's rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For LPG vehicles there are two requirements. First, all LPG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle refueling stations will be required to use nozzles which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have very low dead volume (2.0 cm3) from which fuel would be vented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon nozzle disconnect. This requirement was derived from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recently promulgated onboard refueling vapor recovery standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For a complete description of the derivation please consult the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summary and analysis of comments document. Second, LPG-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks will be subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> onboard refueling emission standards, adjusted for the difference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in LPG energy density as compared to gasoline. This adjusted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard is 0.15 grams per gallon of LPG dispensed. The applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dates for these standards are discussed in the timing section of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's rule. Additionally, for any LPG vehicle that contains a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fixed liquid level valve (i.e., ``outage valve''), the refueling test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be performed with the liquid level valve in the open position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless the manufacturer can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator, that the fixed liquid level gauge would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opened during refueling in ordinary use due to inaccessibility or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other reasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA recognizes that, although it did propose the control of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refueling emissions from gaseous-fueled vehicles, the proposal did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not include specific numerical standards as contained in today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. However, EPA believes that this action will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncontroversial, and the Agency anticipates no significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments regarding it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nonetheless, the public is advised that these elements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's action dealing with refueling emissions will be effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 60 days from the date of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice, unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice is received within 30 days that interested parties wish to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit adverse or critical comments on that element of this action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn and two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequent notices will be published. One notice, which would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published before the effective date, will withdraw the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action. Another notice will begin a new rulemaking by announcing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is reason to believe that, in the case of some of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above-mentioned pollutants and vehicle classes, the levels of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions will normally be substantially below the levels of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable standards. In such cases today's rule includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions for a waiver of certification testing requirements which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow a manufacturer to certify the vehicle or engine without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing the actual certification testing for which a waiver has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been granted, similar to the waivers available for heavy-duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diesel engine CO, methanol vehicle and engine smoke and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particulate, and Otto-cycle light-duty vehicle and light-duty truck  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particulate standards. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  A certification testing waiver can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained by demonstrating that, by virtue of a vehicle's design, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will always meet the standard for which the waiver was granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This demonstration can be in the form of development testing data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or other engineering data. It should be noted that these waivers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only apply to certification testing requirements and do not relieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the manufacturer of liability for meeting the standard. Vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which have been certified using these waiver provisions also remain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to selective enforcement audit (SEA) and in-use testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The waivers provided in today's rule are available for all gaseous-fueled vehicle evaporative and refueling standards, gaseous-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heavy-duty diesel CO (including idle CO), particulate and smoke  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards, and particulate standards for light-duty vehicles and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> light-duty trucks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 FR 49811, November 2, 1982; 54 FR 14426, April 11, 1989; and 56 FR 25724, June 5, 1991. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

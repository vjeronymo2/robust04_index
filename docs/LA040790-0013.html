			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> GROUP GETS GRANT TO AID WOMEN'S SHELTER  </P> <P> The Ventura County Coalition Against Household Violence has received a $2,000  grant, which will be used to provide tricycles, a new sandbox and a number of  quality toys for a shelter for battered women and their children.  </P> <P> The shelter is licensed to provide temporary housing for up to 17 women and  children at any one time.  </P> <P> Last year, the shelter served the needs of 80 women and 120 children, said  Jamie Leigh, director of the coalition, which is based in Ventura and serves  the entire county.  </P> <P> Children of battered women are often much rougher on toys due to the high  levels of anxiety and frustration that accompany domestic violence, Leigh said,  making extra-sturdy, high-quality toys a necessity.  </P> <P> The coalition, which was founded in 1976, is a nonprofit organization  associated with the United Way Foundation. A thrift shop in Ventura, run by the  coalition, provides about 40% of its $200,000 annual budget. In addition, the  thrift shop also donates basic household goods to battered women seeking to  establish new homes for themselves. The grant was provided by Target Stores.  </P> <P> Other programs sponsored by the coalition include a 24-hour hot line,  counseling services for victims of violence and an educational outreach to the  general public.

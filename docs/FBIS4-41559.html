			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Rudenko] </F>   [Text] Tula June 25 TASS -- The Russian Defence Ministry is  doing all it can for keeping alive unique arms-manufacturing  enterprises and to ensure their development in the future,  Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said today at a  graduation ceremony, held at the Tula Higher Artillery School,  named after the Tula proletariat.    He stressed he wanted the Russian Armed Forces to be  powerful  and mobile, fitted with modern weapon systems and capable of  ensuring Russia's security. According to Grachev, Russia's  military doctrine does not regard any country as an enemy, but  Russia has its own vital interests, which a strong and highly  efficient army should protect.    Grachev praised the performance of the artillery school in  training skilled military personnel. Today graduation diplomas  were given to another 300 young lieutenants, who will put into  effect the army reform.    The Russian defence minister had a meeting today with senior  officials of Tula and the Tula region, as well as  representatives of the regional union of industrialists and  entrepreneurs, of which directors of arms-manufacturing  enterprises make the backbone. He visited as well the arms  museum and attended a ceremony of opening the day of the city.</p>

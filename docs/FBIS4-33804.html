			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jacques Maurice] </F>   [Text] A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Port-au-Prince told AFP  on 9 June that the U.S. Embassy might ask U.S. citizens living  in Haiti and families of diplomatic personnel to leave the  country. The spokesman pointed out that if the Clinton  administration decides to ban commercial flights between the  United States and Haiti, the families of diplomatic personnel  would have to leave this country and other U.S. nationals would  have to be put on alert.    President Bill Clinton is expected to announce new sanctions  against the Caribbean republic on 10 June. The same source  explained that the sanctions could include banning commercial  flights and bank transfers with the United States. By the  evening of 9 June, the White House had not confirmed that the  U.S. President would make such a statement on 10 June. The U.S.  spokesman added that the United States is in touch with  diplomats in other countries on the sanctions.    Less than 100 people continue to work at the U.S. Embassy in  Port-au-Prince. Their dependents, including women and children,  total 70. Fewer than 6,000 U.S. citizens live in Haiti,  including those of Haitian origin and 600 U.S. tourists who,  among other things, are visiting their families, the U.S.  Embassy told AFP.    American Airlines, which serves Miami and New York from  Port-au-Prince daily, has advised Haitian travel agencies that  it will add a daily flight to Miami 16-22 June. Miami is also  served by Haiti Trans Air and ALM, of the Dutch West Indies.  Both have four weekly flights. ALM also links Haiti to Curacao  four times a week. Copa serves Panama City from Port-au-Prince  twice a week. Air Canada links Montreal to Port-au-Prince. Air  France serves Paris via Pointe-a-Pitres three times a week and  links the Haitian capital to Santo Domingo, in neighboring  Dominican Republic.</p>

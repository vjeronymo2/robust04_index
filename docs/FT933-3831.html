			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Disposal puts Vinten in red THE DISPOSAL of a lossmaking defence business pushed Vinten, the camera mountings and systems, surveillance and electro-optics group, into the red for the first half of 1993. A pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.71m was notched up after an exceptional charge of Pounds 7.27m, made under FRS 3, for the sale of Exotic Materials, a California-based manufacturer of parts for infra-red systems used by the defence industry. The group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.29m last time. At the trading level profits were up nearly 24 per cent to Pounds 6m (Pounds 4.85m). The latest figure included a loss of Pounds 623,000 from the discontinued division, and gains of Pounds 388,000 from acquisitions. Turnover increased from Pounds 36.4m to Pounds 43.7m. Mr Malcolm Baggott, chief executive, said the disposal would eliminate Vinten's exposure to the uncertain US defence markets. At the same time the group had lifted both trading profit and revenues 'despite difficult conditions'. Three acquisitions were made during the half year that would strengthen the group's position in the broadcast and photographic section of the business which now accounted for the majority of turnover. Further benefits would flow from the acquisitions in the second half, with the full benefit coming through next year. Net borrowings had increased by only Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 16.5m, however, because of the group's strong operating cash flow, said Mr Baggott. Losses per share were 7.2p (earnings 8.8p); taking out the exceptional items gave earnings of 11.4p. The interim dividend is stepped up to 2.1p (1.9p).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- In the view of Bundesbank  President Hans Tietmeyer, inflation will continue to slow down  during the course of the year. Nevertheless, the annual rate of  3.4 percent worked out in February is still too high. "The  basic trend suggests that price increases, which are influenced  by domestic policy, will continue to slow down in the next few  months" Tietmeyer said in Frankfurt on Friday [25 March].  Nevertheless, he was rather cautious as far as the Bundesbank's  room for further interest cuts is concerned. At a time of  nervous markets, new expectations of inflation might flare up  quickly. "This is why we will stick to our policy of a quiet  hand in the future, too."    According to preliminary figures from three laender, price  increases are expected to slow down again in March. On Friday,  the Statistical Land Office in Wiesbaden noted that in Hesse,  consumer prices were 3.2 percent (previous month: 3.4) higher  than one year ago. Yesterday, North Rhine-Westphalia reported  an annual rate of 3.1 percent (3.2), and thus the lowest  increase in almost three years. The figure for  Baden-Wuerttemberg was also 3.1 (3.4) percent.    Tietmeyer said that the wage policy of the trade unions and  the employers has been favorable for price stability this year.  "Decisions in connection with wage policy have so far done  justice to both the requirements in terms of stability and  growth and employment to a greater degree than last year." Even  the public sector has displayed growing awareness of the  problems regarding the revision of financial policy. Yet,  according to Tietmeyer, the strong expansion in the money supply  advises to be very careful. The projected annual rate of 17.6  percent, which was announced the previous day, must "not simply  be taken as the yardstick for the development in the further  course of the year," the Bundesbank head said. "On the other  hand we cannot and must not simply ignore these results."  Continual high growth rates might mean the development of a new  potential for inflation.</p>

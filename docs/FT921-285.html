			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Pounds 500m EC funds plea for aircraft industry THE EUROPEAN Community should inject Ecu700m (Pounds 500m) of research funds into the European aircraft industry, and help EC aerospace companies protect themselves from exchange rate fluctuations, according to a controversial report being prepared by the Commission's industry department. The draft paper on the industry, which comes at a sensitive point in EC-US talks on aircraft subsidies, has already run into internal opposition from Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner. The latest draft will be discussed with aerospace experts from EC member states tomorrow. Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, was hoping to win his colleagues' approval for the paper next week in Strasbourg, and publish it on April 8 with a similar report on the EC automotive industry. But competition officials in Brussels are already pressing for substantial changes to both papers and even senior industry officials admit that alterations may be necessary. For example, the explicit reference to the need for Ecu700m of aerospace research funding between 1994 and 1998 is likely to be withdrawn, because the Commission has yet to decide how to allocate research funds for those years. The paper examines how to preserve the European aircraft industry's industrial and technological competitiveness, faced with a weak world economy and waning defence budgets. It suggests action in a number of areas, including harmonisation of standards, improved vocational training and the establishment of a coherent European air traffic control system. But the draft is likely to revive the argument about mergers in the sector, which reached its peak last year when the Commission voted to follow Sir Leon's recommendation and block the Franco-Italian bid for De Havilland, the Canadian aircraft maker. Mr Bangemann opposed the decision and competition officials believe the draft paper is too heavily weighted towards his interpretation of the EC's merger rules. It also tackles sensitive trade issues, such as how to reduce the European aircraft sector's vulnerability to dollar exchange movements. The document says a working group should be set up to examine the feasibility of an 'exchange risk insurance system', which, it adds, would be self-financed and conform with Gatt subsidy rules. The EC aircraft industry is itself unhappy about some aspects of the Commission paper. European aircraft makers are concerned that it gives ground to the US at a crucial point in subsidy negotiations, by suggesting that it should be possible to reduce the EC's direct state aids for financing new EC aircraft programmes. EC and US negotiators met in Washington last week for final talks about aircraft subsidies. If they do not reach agreement by tomorrow, the issue may have to be resolved through Gatt disputes procedures.</p>

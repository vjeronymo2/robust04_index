			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A HORSYMORON  </P> <P> About the picture of the Pony Express stamp (see photo) in the Book Review of  Oct. 21:  </P> <P> As a ranch-born horseman, I am dismayed that our government would commission an  artist with so little knowledge of the modus operandi of a running horse to  design this stamp.  </P> <P> The horse portrayed on the stamp is running rapidly with its hind legs (note  position of the tail), while trotting sedately with the forelegs! I have  concluded that the picture constitutes a photographic oxymoron.  </P> <P> FRED T. KING  </P> <P> SEAL BEACH  </P></p>

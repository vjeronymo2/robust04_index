			<p>BFN     [Text] Cienfuegos Province sugar mills have attained,  during the current phase [of the harvest], 83.2 percent of the  plan for self-sufficiency in electrical energy. This is some 2.6  percent more than in the same period in 1993. Scheduled repairs  to the sugar installations are designed to restore the areas  that generate steam and to relocate four turbogenerators to  provide an emergency reserve of 3.6 megawatts.</p>

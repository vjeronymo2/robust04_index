			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Gianfranco Fini is optimistic that a new government  will be formed quickly. He has not put himself forward for the  office of prime minister but is backing Silvio Berlusconi, and  has ruled out Northern League politicians. He has pointed out  that the League is only present in some areas of Italy.    After stressing that he has not spoken to Umberto Bossi on  the telephone, either yesterday or today, Fini asked the  Northern League leader to be completely frank about the value of  national unity and solidarity between the north and the south,  which is fundamental to the National Alliance. He also pointed  out that Berlusconi's bid to be prime minister is in keeping  with the results of the election.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 11 TASS -- The Federation Council's  Credentials Committee, which was elected today at the first  meeting of the new Russian parliament's upper chamber,  recognized the powers of all 171 deputies elected to the  Federation Council of the first convocation. Under the  Constitution, the Federation Council is to consist of 178  lawmakers, however the ballot in Tatarstan and the Chelyabinsk  region was declared invalid and new elections are to be called  there, Chechnya did not hold parliamentary elections at all, and  one deputy only has been elected in the Yamal-Nenets autonomous  district so far.    After their rights were confirmed, the lawmakers elected  working bodies of the first meeting -- a secretariat, a  vote-counting commission which is to count the votes until the  conference hall is computerized, and an editing commission.    Then the deputies passed on to discuss a procedure for the  Federation Council's first meeting. The discussion was quite  calm and short. Even the item on a procedure for electing the  upper house speaker did not provoke heated debates, although the  vote itself is likely to become the most acute and difficult  event at the meeting. The gathering agreed that candidatures  for the post of chairman are to be nominated by deputies by  secret ballot. Only one name can be written on the ballot. To  become the Federation Council chairman, a deputy must poll over  half the total votes. A special reservation stipulates that the  speaker and his deputies cannot represent one and the same  subject of the Federation.    When discussing the issue of "notorious quorum" and keeping  in mind the constant lack of it at sessions of the former  Supreme Soviet legislature, the lawmakers ruled that "a meeting  is regarded as having legal powers if the attendance is no less  than two thirds of the elected deputies".</p>

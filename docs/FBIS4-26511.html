			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 23 (CNS) -- The security business has  become one of the new rising professions in China following  nearly ten years' exploitation. It can help to some extent  alleviate the tense state involving long term inadequacy of the  police force.    The profession dated back to 1985 when Shenzhen took the  lead  in setting up a security service company, the first of its kind  in China, according to sources from the public security  department. Other places followed suit since then and there were  more than 1,000 security companies across the country with  employment of 200,000 as of late last year.    The security profession is regarded as an auxiliary force to  help the police prevent crime and safeguard social order,  according to relevant regulations. Security workers comprise  demobilized military men, unemployed young persons from urban  areas and young persons from rural areas.    The security business, which offers service at certain  charges, has developed into new groups to defend social order.  The Beijing Security Service Company, for example, is now  providing service for 2,278 entities, including foreign  diplomatic missions stationed in China, apartment buildings for  diplomats, foreign-funded enterprises and domestic industrial  enterprises.    Most security companies just offer gate-keeping service at  present. The level of service available as well as the quality  of service and employees urgently need to be improved. A  security association is said to be established in the near  future in a bid to boost professional guidance and  administration of the security business.</p>

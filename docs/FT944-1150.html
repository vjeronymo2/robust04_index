			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Grozny's citizens man barricades as toll reaches 140 President Boris Yeltsin yesterday appealed to the Chechen people - whom he said were 'hostages' to the regime of President Dzhokar Dudayev  - to hand over their weapons. The fighting continued in the suburbs of Grozny while planes bombed selected targets in the capital, as estimates of the civilian death toll reached 140 yesterday. Independent accounts do not back up Russian statements that the population is being forced to support General Dudayev and that his forces have left the city. Reports from Reuters correspondents who remain in or near Grozny point to a general and voluntary mobilisation of a sizeable proportion of the adult population, now preparing defences at various points in and around the capital. President Yeltsin's statement stressed that the rumours spread by General Dudayev's officials that the government had a plan to deport the Chechens - recalling the murderous deportations of 1944 under Stalin - were baseless. Mr Yeltsin also promised economic aid to Chechnya once the fighting stopped  -a promise causing concern among financial officials in Moscow. Mr Vladimir Panskov, the finance minister, said yesterday that the war had so far cost Rbs400bn and that at least Rbs1,000bn would be spent on reconstruction next year - a sum which he said may rise. France became the first major western state to voice concern over the Chechen intervention - breaking the consensus which has held the matter to be purely internal to Russia. Ms Lucette Michaux-Chevry, the deputy minister for human rights, said she shares worries expressed by the Red Cross 'on the fate of the Chechen population.</p>

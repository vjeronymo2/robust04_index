			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Markets: A new way to put Pep in a mortgage - Serious Money EVER SINCE personal equity plans were first sold in 1987, there has been scope for investors to use them as a mortgage repayment vehicle. They would appear to have many advantages: tax-free income and growth; a return based on equities (which have been shown repeatedly to be the best long-term investment); and flexibility. But the Pep mortgage has failed singularly to break through into the territory of the endowment policy. The initial problem was lender reluctance to accept a Pep as security. More recently, it seems to have been the low rates of commission paid relative to endowment policies; this reduces the incentive for brokers to sell Pep mortgages. A new product on offer from Capital House, part of the Royal Bank of Scotland, aims to challenge the endowment's domination. The Synergy mortgage plan combines a unit trust Pep with life assurance. The idea is that the combined premium will be lower than for an endowment designed to repay the same sum. There are some ingenious features. The amount of life insurance varies each month, so that the Pep's value, plus the life insurance, is always equal to the loan. Therefore as the Pep increases in value, less needs to be spent on life insurance and more can be invested. In order to sell the idea, Capital House has put together a packaged product, thereby giving it scope for paying greater commission. The snag for the borrower is some endowment-style charges. For a 25-year loan, half the first two years' premiums will disappear in fees. In addition, a flat administration fee of Pounds 2.35 is deducted from each monthly payment. The underlying unit trusts have a 6 per cent initial charge and an annual fee of 1.25 or 1.5 per cent. Given all these charges, how is it that the plan is 'cheaper' than an endowment? In part, this reflects the costs involved in an endowment policy. But it also relates to growth assumptions of the policy. In order to repay a mortgage, you must assume that the money invested grows at a set rate per year. The higher the growth rate you assume, the smaller the premiums you need to repay a given sum. In the case of the Synergy mortgage, Capital House is assuming a 10.5 per cent growth rate, the middle of the range permitted by regulators for Peps. When quoting rates for endowment policies, the assumed growth rate is normally around 7.5 or 8 per cent. Of course, returns within a Pep are free of both income and capital gains tax. Although the eventual payout from an endowment policy is tax-free, the life fund in which the money is invested is subject to tax. So, it is legitimate to assume that a Pep will grow at a faster rate. There is nothing guaranteed about it, though; indeed, the regulatory growth assumptions will shortly be reduced so that, from September, Capital House will probably have to quote on the basis of 9 per cent returns. There are other factors which might upset the assumptions; tax rates on dividends may change (as they did in the Budget); Peps could be abolished (in which case, the unit trust element would continue but the tax breaks would diminish); and a very good life fund manager might outperform a Pep fund manager. The investment assumptions are very important. Take the example of a male, aged 40, wanting to borrow Pounds 50,000. The Capital House sum requires a premium of Pounds 66.85 a month compared with Pounds 72-Pounds 80 for endowment policies. But if you assume the Pep grows at only 8.5 per cent a year, the plan would fall short of repaying the mortgage by some Pounds 13,600. In practice, this would not happen. Premiums would be increased when it became clear investment performance was worse than expected. But suppose that endowment providers, instead of assuming 7.5 per cent returns, went nearer the top of the permitted range allowed by regulators. Take the premium needed to repay a Pounds 30,000 loan for a male aged 29. Capital House quotes Pounds 37.45 a month. Standard Life, quoting on the same basis, came up with Pounds 42.84 a month on its normal assumed growth rate of 7.5 per cent. Had it assumed 9 per cent a year, its quote would have been Pounds 35.07; and at 10.5 per cent a year, the premium dropped to Pounds 28.74. A Pep is more flexible than an endowment. Investors should not suffer unduly if they want to cash in their plan - and repay the mortgage - after, say, 18 years. The value of their plan is easy to ascertain. But the surrender value of a with-profits endowment after 18 years is at the discretion of the life company. Even the more transparent unitised with-profits policies allow for a 'market adjustment factor' on early surrender. The cautious might argue that there is no equivalent to the with-profits endowment policy's 'guaranteed sum' on the Synergy plan. But the guaranteed sum is not sufficient to repay the mortgage; it is simply the base sum to which bonuses are added. What about the investment credentials of Capital House? The Pep is based on two unit trusts; Managed, and Income &amp; Growth. The former, previously known as Global Opportunities, was 81st out of 116 funds in its sector over five years; the latter was 13th out of 97 over the same period. One hopes that the example of Capital House will spur other investment groups to push the Pep mortgage, giving investors the prospect of competition on charges and a choice of funds for investment.</p>

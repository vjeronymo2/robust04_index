			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAILORS' RUSH IS TOO MUCH FOR UNIVERSITY  </P> <P> With eight different players rushing for a total of 218 yards and quarterback  Steve Walker passing for two touchdowns, Newport Harbor defeated University,  21-7, in a Sea View League game Friday night at Davidson Field.  </P> <P> The Sailors (5-2, 1-1) took the opening kickoff and drove 63 yards in 11 plays  to take a 6-0 lead on a seven-yard touchdown pass from Walker to Branon  Coluccio.  </P> <P> Walker threw only eight passes, completing six for 72 yards.  </P> <P> Walker didn't have to throw much considering the damage the Sailors did on the  ground. Newport Harbor averaged more than five yards per rush, led by Russell  Olshefski's 84 yards on 16 carries, and Marc Tagliaeferri's 77 yards in 10  carries.  </P> <P> "This season, teams haven't been able to run much against us," University Coach  Mark Cunningham said, "but for some reason, we couldn't stop Newport Harbor  tonight."  </P> <P> University's lone offensive highlight came in the third quarter when the  Trojans (2-5, 0-2) marched 80 yards in 13 plays to score on a Marc Walker  one-yard run.  </P> <P> "We were fortunate to get a win tonight," Newport Harbor Coach Jeff Brinkley  said. "We got sloppy in the second half and we can't make mistakes and still  expect to win because we face Tustin next week." MICHAEL ITAGAKI  </P></p>

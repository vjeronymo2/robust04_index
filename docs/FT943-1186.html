			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (25): Raft of EC regulations - Michael Dempsey reports on health and safety issues The closest most people come to practical ergonomics is a disembodied voice telling airline passengers to adjust their seat back to the upright position. But adapting office equipment to suit employees' health is fast becoming an urgent issue. The proliferation of computer workstations, demanding visual contact with a flickering screen and myriad keystrokes, has provoked a raft of EC health and safety regulations. Roger Wesson is a partner in City of London law firm Allison &amp; Humphreys. Wesson, specialising in employment law, forsees serious problems arising from the complacency of UK companies about ergonomics. 'Health and safety is no longer an issue you can leave to the office administrator. It requires consideration at the board level. The EC display screen equipment regulations are just as important as the hard hat rules on a building site. The consequences of non-compliance can be very serious.' The EC regulations recommend that employers fill out a detailed questionnaire addressing such areas as screen glare, keyboard height, adjustable seating and availability of footrests. The form even extends to the suitability of software in attempting to assess screen displays. While EC recommendations may seem remote, they are tied to very real problems. Wesson reels off the successful actions against employers involving computer-related ailments. Work-related upper limb disorders, more commonly known as Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI), harm both sufferer and employer. The Inland Revenue has paid Pounds 79,000 in an out-of-court settlement to a female employee. It accepted that she was under pressure to input data at an hourly rate with insufficient breaks while her desk and chair were incorrectly positioned. The resulting injury to her arms forced her to retire. EC Directive 90/270 sets out minimum safety requirements for display screen work. For example, screens should be flicker-free and easily adjustable. These standards must apply to equipment installed after January 1993. For workstations in use before that date employers have until December 1996 to implement changes. Sanctions against non-compliance include fines of up to Pounds 20,000 or imprisonment. Successful prosecution can mean an individual disqualified from being a director. One such case in the UK has already seen a director disqualified for two years and fined Pounds 5,000. There are 6.5m workstations in the UK. Surely bringing them all up to scratch will be an enormous undertaking? The Health and Safety Executive claims that meeting these standards will cost about Pounds 42 per workstation. This price should be offset against a reduction in sick leave provoked by poor ergonomics. Mike Lloyd, managing director of Sit Smart, a Guildford-based ergonomics consultancy, points out that back pain, occasioned by poor seating, is eating away at productivity. The number of man days lost through back pain leapt from 62m in 1992 to 83m in 1993. 'The microcomputer is causing massive back problems', says Lloyd. 'If I can stop a guy being off sick for two weeks, that will cover the price of new seating.'</p>

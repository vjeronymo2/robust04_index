			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: THE DOG DAYS OF VACATION REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> In the past the vacation conversation around the guacamole dip bowl had to do  with the killing everyone could make selling their second home. Prices have  skyrocketed in the last few years, and houses we had bought 15 years ago for  $30,000 were now selling for $2 million. Most of us credited the surge in our  paper profits to our ability to know when to buy and how long to hold on. It  was a talent that only a few of us, like Donald Trump and Harry Helmsley,  seemed to have. As Donald Rappaport, our local tycoon, used to say, "The secret  of investing is to buy low and sell high." Wisdom like this made us all listen  when Rappaport spoke.  </P> <P> But this year it's different. The real estate market is not only flat, it has  tumbled and is now in the basement. Homes that originally were built for  $64,000 are now selling for a measly $350,000. There are horror stories  everywhere. Guggenheim built a lean-to on the pond in 1970 for $14,000, and  when he put it on the market this year all he was offered was $150,000. This  took place at the very moment that President Bush denied there was a recession.  </P> <P> You can imagine the nervousness around the guacamole dip bowl about how much  our homes are now worth.  </P> <P> Payette said, "I can't believe that while I'm standing here the price of my  $75,000 New Bedford ranch house has sunk from $750,000 to a half-million. What  did I do wrong?"  </P> <P> Hawk the lawyer said: "You didn't do anything wrong. Your real estate is still  worth as much as it was last year. The only trouble is nobody wants to buy it  anymore. People are just sitting on their hands waiting for you to get  desperate."  </P> <P> Rappaport was ready to speak, and we, of course, deferred to him. "We are in a  period of nervousness and doubt. The reason the prices on our homes have slid  so badly is that Tokyo still hasn't made up its mind about the dollar, while  Gorbachev has. I'm convinced as soon as the Swiss dwarfs do something, we will  see a boom in vacation houses that will blow the Bank of England's mind. Of  course, it will depend on whether Gov. Dukakis ever figures out what's up and  what's down in his budget."  </P> <P> As usual Rappaport was making a lot of sense.  </P> <P> "Are you suggesting we hold on to our homes until we see how the Common Market  is going to work?"  </P> <P> "That goes without saying. We must look fore and aft to interpret the violent  swings of the real estate fluctuation -- west to South Korea and east to  Hungary. By watching their real estate prices we can get some idea of what to  expect with our homes on Cape Cod."  </P> <P> The group around the guacamole dip bowl had to admit that we had never dreamed  that someday we would all lose our shirts in the market. "What happened to the  American dream?" Wallace wanted to know as he stuffed his mouth full of potato  chips.  </P> <P> Durr said: "It's the crooks in Washington helping the savings and loan crooks  that put us in this position. We homeowners are nothing more than pawns of  bankers who live in overpriced homes in Southampton."  </P> <P> Then Hawk raised a very interesting question. "If the price went up tomorrow on  your homes, would any of you sell?"  </P> <P> "Are you crazy?" Durr replied. "Where would we live?"  </P> <P> "If the price went down even further, would anyone sell?"  </P> <P> It was so quiet you could hear Rappaport's whale pants flapping in the breeze.  </P> <P> "So why do we care if our houses go up or down?"  </P> <P> "Because," Ware said, "when you are on vacation it's very comforting to talk  about money."  </P></p>

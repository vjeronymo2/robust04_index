			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Milk Marque confident over farm deals Milk Marque, the producers' co-operative that will succeed the Milk Marketing Board in November, is confident it will sign up between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of the 30,000 dairy farmers in England and Wales. Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive, said yesterday that contracts and interest so far indicated this target would be achieved. He had previously confirmed only that more than half of all dairy farmers had signed up. Farmers will be free to sell milk either to Milk Marque or direct to dairy companies under the board's plans - approved by the government last week - to open the Pounds 3.3bn market to competition on November 1. Mr Dare's confidence about attracting the vast majority of producers will fuel concern among dairy groups that Milk Marque will be too powerful. The Dairy Trade Federation said yesterday it was worried that 'the arrangements provide considerable potential for the abuse by Milk Marque of the dominant position it seeks to achieve'. Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, said last week that she expected the Office of Fair Trading and the European Commission to ensure that Milk Marque did not abuse its market power. The trade federation, which has previously threatened legal action over the board's plans, said it would consider whether the government's assurances met the needs of buyers and producers 'for a fair and stable trading environment'. The milk board announced yesterday that it expected Dairy Crest, its processing subsidiary, to be floated on the stock market in late September or October. But it might take place after the November launch of Milk Marque if stock market conditions did not improve. The proportion of Dairy Crest that ends up in public hands will depend on whether dairy farmers, who are entitled to Pounds 65m from the sale for past investments in the company, decide to take the money as cash or shares. Mr Dare said the board would announce an indicative price next week for Milk Marque's sale of milk to dairy companies, asking them for a response by mid-July. 'If we get more demand than we have supply available, we shall have to look again at prices and adjust upwards, or vice-versa if prices are too high,' said Mr Dare. 'If necessary, we will scale back (allocations) if there is not enough supply. 'Dairy Crest results, Page 28</p>

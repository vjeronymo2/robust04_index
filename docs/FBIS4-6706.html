			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Policy coordination by  seven major industrialized nations is falling apart amid a  spreading gap in credit policy, and Japan is expected to  continue facing strong pressure for fresh economic measures, a  top Japanese economist says.    The following are excerpts of an interview with Masaru  Takagi, chief economist at Fuji Research Institute, on a meeting  of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven  (G-7) nations slated for Sunday in Washington.    Q: Is substantial agreement possible when the G-7 nations  are starting to place emphasis on domestic policy?    A: It was rather easy to take cooperative steps when  interest rates were on the decline in all nations. But now that  the United States has already turned to tightening its credit  policy to prevent inflation, disarray is starting to surface in  monetary policy.    Such cracks will spread further, and I think it will be hard  to reach a meaningful agreement.    Q: Do you expect stronger pressure on Japan?    A: The U.S. and European nations brushed aside the  government's market-opening package launched in late March, and  Japan is far behind schedule to adopt concrete measures to  expand domestic demand. Moreover, resumption of the stalled  Japan-U.S. trade talks is not yet in sight, and what else can  you expect when even Finance Minister (Hirohisa) Fujii may not  be able to attend?    It's like asking, "please criticize."    Q: What should the incoming new cabinet do to dodge such  criticism?    A: Japan must rush to detail measures to boost domestic  demand and open markets. If I were the prime minister, I would  take the responsibility to implement such measures as  continuation and expansion of income tax cuts and building up  social infrastructure investment while holding separate  discussions on funding.    No country will be satisfied with Japan just repeating, "We  can't accept any numerical targets and we are not thinking of  any alternatives."    Q: What are your expectations of rising U.S. long-term  rates?    A: If the U.S. economy continues to recover, we definitely  cannot expect U.S. rates to decline. Higher rates will  probably send stock and bond prices lower, and may also drag  down the economies of Japan and Europe.    Along with Japan's facing pressure to cut its huge trade  surplus, the U.S. is also likely to come under pressure from  the other G-7 countries to curb interest rates.    Q: What about labor issues?    A: Structural problems, primarily faced by European nations,  should rather be discussed from a long-term perspective. As for  the G-7 talks, the main point is on limiting increases in  unemployment rates by ensuring economic recovery through  financial policy coordination.    Q: Do you expect much discussion on exchange rates?    A: Against Japan's expectations, I believe currency rates  will hardly be discussed at all. The U.S. dollar is not  necessarily falling against European currencies, and the yen  seems to be staging a lonely appreciation.    The usual mention may be included in the joint statement,  but  substantial talks on exchange rates are unlikely to take place.</p>

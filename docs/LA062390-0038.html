			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RYAN GIVES HOPE TO AN OLDER CROWD  </P> <P> I've read that Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak was fed to computers and predicted  to last 520 years (as a record). Let's do the same to six no-hitters and I'll  bet you have a record for 1,000 years. After all, Nolan Ryan has beaten Sandy  Koufax by 50% and the other greats by 100%.  </P> <P> STEVE LEONARD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

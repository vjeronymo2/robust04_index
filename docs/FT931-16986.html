			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / International Company News: Hammerson chief and managing director to step down HAMMERSON, Britain's third biggest property group, confirmed yesterday that both its chairman and managing director are to retire in the next 18 months, but denied this was a change in company policy, writes Christopher Price. Mr Sydney Mason, 72, the Hammerson chairman, is thought likely to retire this year after 44 years with the group. More surprising is the planned retirement of Mr John Parry, 58, the managing director, who had been widely tipped to succeed Mr Mason as chairman. However, weekend press reports that the retirements had been demanded by institutional investors as a result of the company's recent performance were denied. 'It is normal for directors to retire at 60,' the spokesman said, adding that Mr Mason's position was recognised as a unique one and that the age factor did not count. In October, the group announced plans to cut the final dividend from 17p to 6.5p. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 31.1m to Pounds 23.3m in the six months to June 30. However, market observers suggested that pressure had come from Hammerson's largest investor, Standard Life, which holds 31 per cent of the ordinary shares and 21 per cent of the lower-class 'A' shares. In 1989, Standard helped Hammerson fight off a takeover from Rodamco, the Dutch property group. Sources close to the company have also hinted that pressure has been applied from Hammerson's non-executive directors, equally unhappy at the group's performance. Hammerson's shares have mirrored the dramatic decline in property values in the last three years. The ordinary shares, which 13 months ago stood at 660p, closed at 293p on New Year's Eve.</p>

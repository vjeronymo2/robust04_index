			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent Oleg Vladykin </F> under the "Arsenal" rubric: "The Ural Dons Armor"]    [Text] The wide troop use of motor vehicles as a means of  transportation and their employment as a mount for various  weapons systems comprise a compelling reason to become concerned  about the protective properties and resistance of vehicles to  the effects of modern weapons. Tests involving exposure to mine  explosion, gunfire, and shock waves have revealed,  unfortunately, the vulnerability of series-produced vehicles to  the aforementioned effects.    The above observations were supported by combat action  experiences acquired in Afghanistan. Drivers of vehicles moving  in columns would eventually learn of the bitter experiences  suffered by comrades who fell victim to mines or were struck by  bullets while behind the steering wheel. They undertook the  practice of setting up inside the cabs pieces of armor taken  from disabled armored personnel carriers. They would install the  plates on the floor, on the sides, the doors, and sometimes on  the windshields, leaving only a small port for observation.    The above served as the impetus for the concept and  industrial production of local protection packages for  series-produced vehicles. The first lot of this kind of  equipment was subjected to testing even before our troops  returned from Afghanistan. The protection packages won the  unqualified approval of military leaders.    There are several versions of armor protection for motor  vehicles. For example, a UAZ-3151 equipped in this manner is  externally virtually indistinguishable from the standard model  of this vehicle. In this case, the cab is structurally  reinforced to take shields made of aircraft armor. Fastened to  the floor are aluminum alloy shields offering protection against  shell fragments. A special high-strength fabric fastened to the  obverse side of the plates reduces ricocheting of secondary  fragments. In addition, the windshield is replaced by a  bulletproof version.    The Ural-4320 truck, however, is fitted with external armor  plates, with armor louvers on the windshield (see photo). The  vulnerable areas are protected in the amount of 55 percent. The  armor plates are made of steel. Mass of the protection package  is about 184 kg.    Mounted on the interior surfaces of the panels and doors of  the cab of the KamAZ-4310 are armor plates. Attached to the  windshield are steel plates with ports. The size of the  observation window is adjustable by virtue of removable armor  plates. Seventy percent of the vulnerable areas is given  protection. Mass of the cab protection package is 285 kg, while  that of the cab rear is 235 kg.    The armor protection package for the truck offers protection  against bullets 7.62 mm in caliber and fragments with a mass of  up to 2.0 g. It is stored as a kit that is easily installed on  the vehicles when the need arises.</p>

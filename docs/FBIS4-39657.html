			<p>BFN     [Text] A battalion of 350 Ukrainian guards has been  transferred to Sevastopol from Simferopol in line with a decree  issued by President Kravchuk in November of 1991. The National  Guards Commander in Crimea Aleksandr Kostyukov explained the  redeployment by the fact that an army compound has become vacant  for the unit in the outskirts of Sevastopol. The armed guards  have armored vehicles at their disposal. Their main task, in  Kostyukov's words is to defend the Ukrainian constitutional  system, its integrity and frontiers and to maintain public  order. He stressed that there were no separate assignments for  the battalion in Sevastopol.    Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Black Sea Naval  Officers has sent to the Ukrainian president's ambassador in  Sevastopol a letter, asking him on what legal grounds the  battalion was brought into the city and for how long it would  stay in the port.    Kostyukov also reported that there currently is a regiment  of  over 1000 guards in Crimea's capital Simferopol.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 1 June, the government conveyed its intention to  the DPRK that Japan is ready to give economic aid to it through  international organizations even before normalizing its  diplomatic ties with the DPRK should the DPRK diplomatically  settle the nuclear issue by returning to the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and accepting the International  Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) nuclear inspections. This has  been disclosed by a government source.    After explaining its intention to the United States, the  Japanese Government informed the DPRK of the plan through the  U.S.-DPRK working-level meeting. Japan explained only its  fundamental policy and did not touch on details of the economic  aid. However, it is assumed that Japan can provide support in  such areas as development of light-water reactors, development  of the Tumen River, and increasing urgently needed food  production.    Moreover, the government named the UN Development Programme  (UNDP), the IAEA, and other organizations as possible agencies  through which the economic aid will be given. However, the  government is also taking into consideration the possibility of  having relevant nations and organizations, including the United  States, the ROK, and the World Bank, form support groups.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said that "North Korea is a  country which went through unbearable sufferings and griefs  during Japan's colonization." From this viewpoint, the  government, in an effort to normalize its diplomatic ties with  the DPRK, plans to give full- scale economic aid to it, in the  same way as Japan did to the ROK when both countries normalized  their diplomatic ties, by signing an accord on the right of  claim [seikyuken] and economic cooperation.    It seems that the government, by implementing aforesaid  government policy at an early date, firmed up a plan to  partially provide economic aid to the DPRK prior to normalizing  diplomatic ties because of its intention to urge, by using the  economic aid as a pump-priming measure, the DPRK to settle the  nuclear issue through diplomatic channels and to open up its  doors to other countries.    However, it is "difficult to give bilateral support" to  North  Korea before normalizing ties with the DPRK, according to a  government source. Therefore, the government came up with the  concept of providing aid by having international organizations  and relevant countries and agencies form support groups.    Moreover, regarding normalization of diplomatic ties between  Japan and the DPRK, the government is also studying the  possibility of establishing diplomatic ties after recognizing  the DPRK as a nation and reaching an agreement to hold  negotiations to normalize relations.</p>

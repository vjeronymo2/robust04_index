			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 24 KYODO -- Japan will enact  lasting income tax cuts by year's end, Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii told his counterparts from seven major industrial nations  Sunday.    The demand for Tokyo to extend this year's 6 trillion yen in  income and residential tax cuts, to spur domestic demand and  reduce its trade surplus, came again at Sunday's meeting in  Washington of the Group of Seven (G-7) finance ministers and  central bank chiefs.    Fujii told a news conference that he responded by saying  multi year tax cuts will be enacted this year, as promised by  the coalition government of outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa.    Japanese officials have said Fujii carried a message that a  new government to be launched Monday will carry on Hosokawa's  reforms. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is certain to succeed  Hosokawa as premier.    Fujii said the finance leaders of Britain, Canada, France,  Germany, Italy and the United States also confirmed with him  "the shared understanding that excessive changes in exchange  rates are undesirable."    He said he stressed to the meeting "that exchange rates  should reflect economic fundamentals and that excessive changes  are undesirable, and all the countries confirmed this." He said  they agreed on "close cooperation" on the exchange market.    Foreign exchange volatility is also undesirable for stock  and  bond markets, Fujii said.    Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno told the same news  conference that he recognizes U.S. economic recovery as genuine  and that other countries are steadily moving in a brighter  economic direction.</p>

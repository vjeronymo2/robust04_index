			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RACE TO FINISH CONVENTION CENTER ON TIME WILL BE A SQUEAKER  </P> <P> Expressing confidence that the much-postponed opening of San Diego's new  $160-million convention center will not be further delayed, the board that  oversees the bayfront facility predicted Tuesday that shows scheduled at the  center early next year will go ahead as planned.  </P> <P> With the board members' optimism tempered by caution stemming from the delays  and false starts that have plagued the project from its inception, the San  Diego Convention Center Corp. unanimously adopted a resolution stating that an  Oct. 31 target date for completion of construction "appears to be achievable."  </P> <P> As a result, none of the 11 major conventions and shows scheduled for next  January and February appear in jeopardy, General Manager Tom Liegler told the  board. The latest construction timetable, however, means that the center's  operators will have less than the three-month "shakedown" period they had hoped  for prior to the first major convention.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Invitations Planned  </P> <P> Moreover, recognizing that some convention organizers feel uneasy about  planning to hold their events at a still-unfinished center, the board voted to  invite them to San Diego for an all-expenses-paid effort to convince them that  the center will, indeed, be completed in time.  </P> <P> "We're confident, but we have to get the (show organizers) to feel confident,  too," said James Granby, president of the convention center board. "We think  after they see the progress, they'll feel more comfortable."  </P> <P> Tuesday's meeting provided a more upbeat assessment of the center's outlook  than the prognosis given last month, when convention center officials warned  that construction delays at the 760,000-square-foot facility might force  cancellation of events from November through January.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2 Shows Canceled  </P> <P> Although two consumer shows that had been tentatively scheduled for November  have been canceled, several pre-opening parties and other events will be held  at the center between Nov. 1 and the first major convention Jan. 3, officials  said Tuesday. Those events include a Thanksgiving weekend open house in which  San Diegans will be invited to tour the architecturally distinctive center,  which features flying concrete buttresses and a vinyl, tent-like roof meant to  evoke images of sails gliding over San Diego Bay.  </P> <P> While relieved -- at least temporarily -- over averting the public-relations  nightmare that could be expected if the center's first major conventions had to  be be scrapped, board members emphasized that the Oct. 31 completion date  leaves them with no margin for error.  </P> <P> "From our point, we've cut this right down to the bone," Granby said. "If we  can't get in by Oct. 31, we've got major problems. Even a delay of a week or  two would be very difficult to deal with."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Finishing Touches  </P> <P> During November and December, tons of equipment must be moved into the center,  assembled and tested, even as the center's 159-member full-time staff is  trained and workers put finishing touches on the structure's interior. The  "Community Celebration" open house and other so-called "soft opening" events  planned for those two months, meanwhile, will provide test runs for facets of  the center's operations ranging from parking and traffic control to food  service and cleanup.  </P> <P> "There's no play at all in the schedule," added board member Jim Durbin.  "There's no cushion as far as those 60 days are concerned. We're down to the  nitty-gritty."  </P> <P> In a related action that demonstrates further incremental progress toward the  center's opening, the board also authorized convention center administrators to  negotiate a contract under which skilled craft personnel will be hired. Bid  specifications for equipment such as chairs, tables and telescopic risers were  also approved Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Computer Analysis  </P> <P> The Oct. 31 completion date -- two years later than the original goal -- is  based on a computer analysis of the project that officials of the San Diego  Unified Port District, the body that is financing the center's construction,  say reinforces that target. Specifically, that computer study examined roughly  2,000 construction details that still must be finished at the facility, which  is more than 80% complete.  </P> <P> In addition, convention center officials have been reassured by the fact that  construction on the center's 11-acre site, situated on Harbor Drive near  Seaport Village, is meeting week-by-week progress benchmarks that Liegler  described as "the critical path . . . to Oct. 31."  </P> <P> "Ultimately, they know and we don't," Granby said of the port officials  monitoring the construction. "They're the ones in the best position to know  whether the schedule can be met. And they tell us it can."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Discussed Liability  </P> <P> During Tuesday's meeting, the board met in a half-hour closed session to assess  its legal liability in the event any of the early 1990 conventions would have  to be canceled because of unanticipated construction delays. Many of the more  than 50,000 convention delegates expected in January alone already have booked  hotel rooms, and the trade associations sponsoring those events would find it  difficult, if not impossible, to relocate their programs on short notice.  </P> <P> Board member Paul Peterson, a lawyer, argued that the invitations to show  organizers to visit San Diego to get a first-hand look at the center could help  mitigate the board's financial responsibility if that worst-case scenario comes  to pass. Those trips -- part of a 10-point plan recommended by Liegler to guide  the board's activities over the next seven months -- will be financed either by  the convention center board or the San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau  (ConVis), which has booked most of the inaugural conventions.  </P> <P> "If the people that come out here are apprised of the situation, they can make  their own choice whether they want to go forward or not," Peterson said. "As  long as we've been fair and they make an educated and informed choice, knowing  all the risks . . . I think that problem will take care of itself."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Talking to Organizers  </P> <P> ConVis head Dal Watkins, noting that his group has been talking to nervous show  organizers on a weekly basis, said he believes that the trips will  significantly enhance that public relations campaign and prompt the officials  to proceed with plans to stage their events here.  </P> <P> "This is a very encouraging sign, because there's a lot at stake here," Watkins  said. The loss of next January's shows, Watkins noted, would cost the city  about $8.3 million and would likely precipitate a stampede of other  cancellations for later events.  </P> <P> Tuesday's action, however, bolstered the board members' confidence that they  will not have to confront that unpleasant possibility, as well as demonstrated  their growing conviction that the major problems that stalled the project  throughout much of the 1980s are largely behind them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rejected by Voters  </P> <P> Controversial from the outset, the convention center proposal was rejected by  San Diego voters in 1981, but was approved two years later when the site was  moved from the city's center to the harborfront and the Port District agreed to  build it. (The city, however, is responsible for any operating deficits.)  </P> <P> Originally targeted for completion in 1987, the project was delayed for a year  when construction bids came in more than $20 million over the port's estimated  budget of $101 million to $107 million, prompting the port to seek a second  round of bids. The new bids produced a $118-million price tag, which since has  risen to $123 million because of minor changes. The $160 million figure  includes the cost of equipment, furnishings and other interior accessories.  </P> <P> Subsequent construction problems -- among them, excavation delays caused by  underground water and labor woes in Korea that postponed shipments of  structural steel -- pushed back the completion date to Oct. 31.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Comfort Level'  </P> <P> "There's always some nervousness in these things . . . but right now there's a  comfort level that wasn't there 30 days ago," board member Durbin said, adding  that the Oct. 31 date now looks "more solid" than it did.  </P> <P> While pleased by that shift in perception, Liegler used a homily to remind the  board of the obstacles that remain to meet that deadline.  </P> <P> "It is the last ounce of effort that usually wins the race," Liegler said. "I  have to say it feels good to have finally reached that point."  </P></p>

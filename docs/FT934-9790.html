			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Profits warning slices 155p off Bespak share price FOR THE third time this year difficulties in the US health market have sent shares in Bespak, the healthcare manufacturing group, tumbling. They dropped 165p in early trading yesterday before recovering 10p to close at 318p. The company said that recent announcements by its largest US customer, US Surgical, had prompted the board to warn that group profits for the first six months to October would be half the comparative figure of Pounds 5.01m. Bespak said a decrease in business with US Surgical which accounts for about a quarter of the company's sales, together with uncertainties among other healthcare customers, meant that sales in dollar terms were lower than in the first half in the previous period. The company said its cost base had been built up in anticipation of increased activity. US Surgical has 85 per cent of the market for laparoscopic devices for use in keyhole surgery. Mr Bob King, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The board is totally confident that its overall strategy is right. We had to be bigger in the US. 'There is a one-off situation relating to our major customer in the states which is reducing stocks considerably. This comes at a time when one or two other people, in response to the Clinton healthcare reforms, are also de-stocking.' Analysts cut pre-tax profit forecasts to roughly Pounds 6m for the year from Pounds 13.5m having already shaved about Pounds 1m off earlier predictions.</p>

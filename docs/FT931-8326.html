			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Schroders venture arm dilutes holding in Mitel SCHRODER Ventures, the venture-capital arm of Schroders, the UK merchant bank, is to dilute its 51 per cent shareholding in Mitel through a public equity offering by the Canadian telephone equipment maker. Mitel said yesterday that it was in the process of filing a prospectus for a common share issue underwritten by Scotia-McLeod, Midland Walwyn and Wood Gundy. The size and price of the offering will be determined in early March. Mitel begins presentations to institutional investors and analysts in London today. Schroder, representing several international investment partnerships, bought its stake in Mitel from British Telecom last year. It has indicated that it will buy up to CDollars 10m (USDollars 7.9m) of the newly-issued shares. As a result, Schroder's shareholding is expected to be reduced, but it is likely to remain the largest single shareholder. Schroder paid CDollars 1 per share for the BT stake last June. Mitel shares closed at CDollars 2.15 down CDollars 0.10 on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday.</p>

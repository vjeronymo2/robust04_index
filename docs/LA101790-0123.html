			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMPCARE CORP. CUTTING ITS LOSSES WITH 550 LAYOFFS;  </P> <P> HEALTH CARE: PROVIDER OF CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY PROGRAMS SAYS THE COMPANYWIDE  TRIMS WILL INCLUDE 55 JOBS AT ITS COSTA MESA AND ORANGE HOSPITALS.  </P> <P> In an effort to reduce its losses, the new management of Comprehensive Care  Corp., one of the nation's largest providers of chemical dependency programs,  has begun the elimination of 550 positions nationwide, including 55 at its two  hospitals in Orange County.  </P> <P> CompCare Chief Executive James P. Carmany, who in August led a proxy battle  that ousted the company's board of directors, said the companywide layoffs  began 45 days ago.  </P> <P> By year's end, CompCare plans to reduce its work force to 1,650 people from  2,200 when the layoffs started. The company operates 15 medical facilities in  11 states.  </P> <P> About 30% of 179 positions at two CompCare treatment centers in Orange County  -- Starting Point of Orange County in Costa Mesa and Care Unit Hospital in  Orange -- either have been or will be cut by the end of 1990, Carmany said.  </P> <P> Orange County was CompCare's corporate headquarters until the company moved to  St. Louis last year.  </P> <P> Carmany said the Orange County cuts are being achieved, in part, by combining  the administrative operations of the two hospitals and putting them under a  single executive director. The former Irvine corporate office was closed, said  Carmany, who still maintains a small executive staff in Orange.  </P> <P> He said some nursing jobs were eliminated at the company's Orange County  facilities, which he said are only 40% utilized. "We tried our best to maintain  the hands-on clinical staff at appropriate levels for all forms of treatment,"  he said.  </P> <P> Carmany said the cost-cutting efforts will reduce operating costs by an  estimated 23% and "get us close to break even." The company lost $61.2 million  for its fiscal year ended May 31 and nearly $7.5 million in the first quarter  of its current fiscal year.  </P> <P> Besides approving the layoffs, CompCare's new directors earlier this month  approved a plan to increase the company's revenues. "We are beefing up our  marketing and business development and looking to more effectively use the  assets we have," Carmany said.  </P></p>

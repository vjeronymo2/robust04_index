			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Growth prospects shrinking - The industrialised countries in difficulties GROWTH prospects for the industrialised world have deteriorated sharply in recent months, partly as a result of the serious slowdown in Europe and of governmental failure to tackle big budget deficits, the International Monetary Fund said yesterday. In its twice-yearly World Economic Outlook, the fund says that, in Europe, 'there is a risk that high real interest rates, weak confidence, continuing exchange rate turbulence and uncertainties about implementation of the Maastricht treaty may continue to delay recovery.' While the outlook for the US is more favourable, the recent weakening in the Japanese economy has been another factor behind the deterioration in world growth prospects. The report suggests that, in the light of low Japanese inflation and the strength of the yen, there 'remains some room' for cuts in Japanese interest rates if the economy stays sickly. The report also says the recent devaluations of some currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism may have 'overshot', worsening economic strains throughout the continent. Countries which devalued during the crisis between last September and early this year include Britain, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland. Increased economic pressures may have arisen from a stimulus to inflation in the nations affected, or by their deriving a competitive advantage which other countries might resent. The report, written by IMF economists after consultations with member states, says that, within the ERM, uncertainties are still evident as a result of the high level of interest rates in Germany. However, there are good grounds for believing German rates may come down soon, in the light of reduced worries about inflation as the German economy weakens. Growth in the industrialised world is projected this year at 1.7 per cent, as opposed to the 2.9 per cent forecast in the IMF's last economic outlook last October. Last year, output expanded by 1.5 per cent; in 1994, the corresponding figure is likely to be 2.9 per cent, according to the IMF's latest predictions. The IMF is forecasting growth this year across the European Community of a feeble 0.1 per cent, compared with a forecast six months ago of 2.3 per cent. Much of this revision is due to the IMF now thinking the German economy will contract by 1.3 per cent this year. In October, the organisation had thought it would expand by a vigorous 2.6 per cent. Projections for Japanese growth this year have also come down - to 1.3 per cent from 3.8 per cent last October. US output is expected to increase this year by 3.1 per cent, in line with what the IMF said six months ago. In the US, even though the IMF says the 'pressing priority' for the government of President Bill Clinton is to reduce its large fiscal deficit, the document is relatively bullish about growth prospects. In the industrialised countries, inflation has generally come down, in line with slower economic activity. Consumer prices went up by 3.2 per cent across these nations last year; the comparable figure is expected to come down to 3 per cent this year and stay at that level in 1994. World trade volumes have seen generally healthy expansion, thanks partly to relatively high growth outside the industrial nations. Total world output this year is likely to show higher growth than in the industrial nations alone. The figure for the whole world is put at 2.2 per cent, accelerating to 3.4 per cent in 1994. This is largely due to the good economic performance of the developing nations, which are reckoned to be responsible for 34.4 per cent of the total international economy, with the industrialised countries accounting for 54.4 per cent, and the ex-communist countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union responsible for 11.2 per cent.

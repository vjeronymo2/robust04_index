			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gisbert Kuhn: "There Are Worlds Separating </F> Political Demands and Reality"]    [Text] The political rightists who were dispatched to the  European Parliament by German voters on 18 June 1989 feel that  their performance is being undervalued and are even talking of a  "massive campaign" directed against them by the media and other  dark forces. Late in the summer of last year, when Social  Democrat European Deputy Detlev Samland presented a report  stating that the five men and one woman who were originally  grouped around Republikaner Chairman Franz Schoenhuber did  indeed have big mouths, but hardly stood out in terms of their  presence in parliament or their parliamentary work, there was a  storm of protest. Retired criminal investigation official  Klaus-Peter Koehler from Heidenheim (Brenz) even had  announcements published in newspapers in which he branded the  report "the deliberate falsification of information."  <H5>  "A Warning" </H5>   Five years ago, the Republikaner's ability to obtain 7.1  percent of the vote in the European elections attracted  attention well beyond Germany's borders and caused great  commotion in the media. At the time, their success was viewed as  a "warning" issued by citizens to those in government, but was  also seen as being partly due to the right-wingers'  anti-European program. Entitled "German Interests Have  Priority," the Dinkelsbuehl declaration on the European  elections contained the following points: "No unilateral  Western integration," "no to placing Germany at a disadvantage,"  "no to the right to vote for foreigners," "no to surrendering  sovereignty."  <H5>  No Movement Politically </H5>   This clearly indicated that the policies the German  right-wing extremists would pursue in Strasbourg would be geared  solely to obstruction and not to constructive participation.  Three and a half years later, in March 1993, former criminal  investigation official Koehler admitted to an Ulm newspaper:  "We have achieved a few minor points, but politically we have  not achieved any movement." However, initiatives such as that  launched by his colleague Johanna-Christiana Grund from the  Bavarian pilgrimage center of Altoetting could hardly be  described as a "minor point": "Entry to and the Exercise of the  Profession of Alpine Mountain Guide in EC Member States."    The history of the Republikaner in the European Parliament  was from the outset one of violent disputes and quarrels with  those of a similar political persuasion from other partner  countries. In 1989, six Republikaner moved into the building of  concrete and glass in Strasbourg: Franz Schoenhuber (journalist  from Munich) as leader, Johanna-Christina Grund (mountain guide  from Altoetting), Klaus-Peter Koehler (retired criminal  investigation official from Heidenheim), Harald Neubauer  (journalist from Munich), Emil Schlee (retired ministerial  assistant from Raisdorf-Reuterkoppel), and Hans-Guenther  Schodruch (lawyer from Siegburg).    A month later, the group started talks with right-wing  radicals from other countries to agree on close cooperation and  the formation of a joint group in the European Parliament. At  the very start, there was a dispute with the fascist Italian  Social Movement because the Germans had denounced the  "repression of the German-speaking population in South Tirol."  However, in the case of another two parties -- the French Front  National, led by Jean-Marie Le Pen, and the Flemish Vlaams Blok,  led by Carel Dillen -- Schoenhuber and his people did not want  to agree on a common platform but only on "technical  cooperation." Le Pen only reluctantly accepted Schoenhuber's  complaints about the "the German people's right to live in one  free state with guaranteed rights," whereby the German meant the  "1937 borders."  <H5>  Busy With Themselves </H5>   Of course, the Republikaner guild in Strasbourg busied  itself  most of all with itself and that led to its finally being de  facto dissolved. The party's Bavarian chairman, Harald Neubauer  (a former German National Party member and later a close  confidante of the notorious DVU leader and friend of  ultranationalist Zhirinovskiy, Gerhard Frey) challenged Franz  Schoenhuber for the leadership. As a result, in September 1990,  the Republikaner leadership released the five European  representatives (with the exception of Schoenhuber) "from the  duties toward the party immediately" and instituted expulsion  proceedings against them.    On 3 December 1990, Franz Schoenhuber left the "Rightist  Group" in Strasbourg. He justified the move by saying the  Republikaner could not have anything in common with neo-Nazis,  racists, and extremists. He leveled such charges at Harald  Neubauer, in particular. At the end of 1990, Johanna-Christina  Grund and Neubauer were finally expelled from the party; in the  spring of 1991, Koehler, Schlee, and Schodruch arrived at the  same verdict by leaving the party themselves. Schlee and Frau  Grund also left the "Rightist Group" in the European Parliament  and have described themselves as "independent" since then, while  Neubauer had himself made chairman of the extremist right-wing  splinter party the "German League," which he helped form.    Although this is fiercely disputed by those concerned, in  his  report, SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] European Deputy  Detlev Samland maintains that the Republikaner had almost no  presence at all in Strasbourg. Nevertheless, by June of last  year, they had submitted 139 statements, although they drew no  response. The possible exception were contributions during  debates made by Schoenhuber concerning himself and his past: "I  was not an SS man; I was a soldier in the SS and I am not  ashamed of that." All in all, it is not an exaggeration but  more of an understatement that over the five years in which they  have been active in the European Parliament, worlds have  separated the Republikaner's original political demands and  reality.</p>

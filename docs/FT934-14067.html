			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Chambers urge aid for industry THE GOVERNMENT should take a more interventionist role in manufacturing industry, Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, the largest chamber in Britain, said yesterday. The chamber said the government should offer tax breaks to investors, low-cost finance for new companies and enhanced credit guarantees for exporters. It said that without such state aid the weakness of Britain's manufacturing sector would impede export-led growth. The document, setting out the long-term needs of Britain's 'industrial heartlands', precedes a national survey this week by the British Chambers of Commerce which is expected to show that many companies doubt that the recovery can be sustained while the recession in continental Europe worsens. Although the survey is also understood to show a significant upturn in domestic demand in the past quarter, the Birmingham Chamber fears this is mainly through growing demand for services rather than manufacturing. Mr Tony Bradley, head of policy at the Birmingham chamber, said: 'In the absence of a strong manufacturing sector, a domestic recovery led by consumers and services will only reproduce the inflationary boom-bust cycle and will not lay the foundations for sustainable medium-term growth.' To offset the structural faults in the economy, the chamber advocates: Abolition of capital gains tax for investors who retain their shares in companies for more than five years. New financial support for exporters through export credit guarantees. An extension of tax relief on training expenditure. A reduction in 'regulatory burdens imposed on industry'. 'More flexible and responsive financing packages' for small and medium-sized companies. Mr Bradley said almost 30 per cent of manufacturing companies in the Midlands had shed jobs in the past year and 30 per cent expected to make further cuts.

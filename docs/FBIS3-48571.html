			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Teddy Molina] </F>   [Text] Bangued, Abra -- Police and provincial officials are  impatient over the alleged slow turnover of firearms by troops  of the Cordillera People's Liberation Army [CPLA] under former  rebel priest Conrado Balweg.    Two deadlines set by the local Philippine National Police  [PNP] lapsed last week but only 15 out of 45 firearms issued by  the government to the CPLA men in this province had been  returned, Supt. July Cordoviz, Abra PNP director, said. More  than a hundred government firearms were loaned by the Aquino  administration to the CPLA when the latter joined the  government's anti-insurgency campaign in 1987.    Last month, President Ramos ordered Balweg and the CPLA to  return all firearms issued to them.    Abra is the home base of Balweg but CPLA forces are also  deployed in other Cordillera provinces.    Cordoviz, however, discounted the need to retrieve the rest  of the guns by force, saying that he was relying on peaceful  negotiations he had initiated with Balweg and the tribal groups'  council of elders last 2 January.    On the other hand, Gov. Vicente Valera wanted all CPLA  firearms "whether government-owned or CPLA-owned" taken in at  once.    Valera said he will ask the national government for  "specific  moves" to hasten the turnover of the guns.    "We are ready in case (Interior Secretary Rafael) Alunan III  tells us to do," Valera said. He did not elaborate.    At the start of Oplan Paglalansag [Operation Dismantle] last  year, Valera called for the inclusion of the CPLA in the  nationwide campaign against loose firearms, branding the group  as a "private army."    He had complained against the group's alleged intimidation  of  voters during the last local elections and its alleged demand  for food rations from villagers during its operation here.    Cordoviz said they had a dialogue with Balweg and his group  in Luba, Abra where they agreed to comply with the president's  directive. "But it's taking them a long time," he added.    Of the 15 firearms turned over by the CPLA here, three  Garands and one M14 rifle were given during the 2-4 January Luba  dialogue.    Eight Garands were brought to the PNP camp here on 6 and 9  January, according to Cordoviz.    Other firearms now with the PNP were one M16 rifle and two  Garands which were confiscated from CPLA men in Bucay town last  3 November.    Cordoviz said he was scheduled to have a second dialogue  with  CPLA leaders led by Mariano Agostos from Luba this week.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / AEA sell-off move sparks union anger A union yesterday condemned a decision to privatise the Atomic Energy Authority after Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, had confirmed the planned sell-off. The Institute of Professional Managers and Specialists, which represents 2,900 of the authority's workers, said the sale would result in further job losses and add to the cost of decommissioning nuclear installations. Moreover, Pounds 300m would have to be set aside to cover redundancy costs and pensions for staff transferring to the privatised body. The IPMS said the sale made no economic sense other than as a dry run for the sale of Nuclear Electric, owner of most of the country's nuclear power stations. Sir Anthony Cleaver, AEA chairman, said the union appeared to have understood little of what the authority was trying to do. He said: 'Our option is, we believe, the best way of preserving the skills that we have built up over the years with the best possible future for the maximum number of people.' Sir Anthony added that the proposed sale was 'a unique opportunity to establish for Britain a flagship science and engineering services bureau'. Mr Eggar said the method of privatisation would be decided later. Factors that would be taken into account would include its marketplace performance and the extent to which various sale options would meet customer requirements, enhance competition, improve UK competitiveness and maximise the return to taxpayers. Mr Eggar also confirmed that the government would retain those parts of the authority that have nuclear liabilities - principally ex-perimental reactors that will have to be decomm-issioned. The authority, which has led the development of the UK's nuclear power industry for the past 40 years, is due in April to be split into a government division to manage the liabilities, and a commercial division that will be sold. The commercial division, to be known as AEA Technology, will consist mainly of the expertise built up by the authority, not just in the nuclear field but in other areas of industry as well. The commercial division is expected to have an annual turnover of about Pounds 250m to Pounds 300m. Staff figures will stand at about 4,000 and its sale value would be about Pounds 250m, City specialists believe.</p>

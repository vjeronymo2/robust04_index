			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / White House battle for Bush's ear: Los Angeles' riots have forced the president into a policy reappraisal ONCE upon a time, long before Dan Quayle and Pat Buchanan ran for anything national and when George Bush was thought to be a Republican moderate, Jack Kemp was the spiritual heir of Ronald Reagan's brand of free market conservatism. In 1988 he even planned a bid for the presidency to keep the flame alight. The current US housing secretary, former congressman and football quarterback from Buffalo - but born and raised in Los Angeles - still thinks he is that heir. In a television interview on Sunday, one of many he has given since his home town erupted, he said what America's inner cities needed was 'a conservative-based, anti-poverty programme designed to empower people, designed to give them jobs, and educational choice and home ownership'. The difference from 1988 is that these days Mr Kemp uses the word 'bipartisan' as a preface to everything he utters. And what this new urban messiah says often seems more in tune with what the Democrats who run most of the country's big cities want than what the Republican administration in which he serves is prepared to countenance. 'It is no secret', he told a group of foreign journalists last week, 'that I am not the president's closest adviser.' But it is also the case, as Mr Bush contemplates what he will do for the cities in the wake of Los Angeles, that today Mr Kemp is a man the president can no longer ignore. There is a real war for the president's ear inside the current administration. It pits Mr Kemp's vision of government activism, broadly in line with that espoused by Mr Michael Heseltine in Britain, against the more conventional law-and-order views associated with Vice-President Quayle and Mr Buchanan, a right-wing commentator. How Mr Bush resolves the conflict could affect his re-election chances. Yesterday, for example, a New York Times-CBS opinion poll found 60 per cent of 1,253 adults surveyed believed the nation was spending too little on urban problems and only 15 per cent too much. the way Mr Bush was handling race relations and 46 per cent were dissatisfied with his specific responses to Los Angeles. This may be contrasted with the overwhelming support given his handling of last year's national 'crisis', the Gulf war. There may be consolation for the president in the fact that those polled did not think that either Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the presumptive Democratic candidate, or Mr Ross Perot, the prospective independent, would have done any better. But it showed some tightening of the presidential race, with Mr Bush at 36 per cent, Mr Clinton 30 per cent and Mr Perot 25 per cent, against the 38-28-23 per cent split shown in an April survey. It is also possible that the problems of the inner cities will fade as an election issue by November. Mr Nelson Polsby, a political historian from the University of California, wrote in the New York Times on Sunday that the frequently-made comparisons with the riot-ridden year of 1968, which resulted in the election of Mr Richard Nixon and Mr Spiro Agnew on a strong law-and-order ticket, might be invalid. 'Even dramatic events', he wrote, 'frequently have a short shelf-life,' which is certainly the case with the Gulf war. He argued that the most profound political event of that year was not the urban riots but the assassination of Robert Kennedy, which fatally weakened the Democratic party. Mr Bush, however, is in all matters domestic essentially a reactive president disinclined to take the longer view, as his variable responses to Los Angeles have demonstrated. Later this week he is going to lay out what he thinks should be done now. Mr Kemp concedes he will not be given a fistful of dollars to do the job. In his view 'it's not how much money you spend as much as how you spend it'. He accepts that the safety net of the Great Society programmes of the 1960s should remain in place, though some could be reformed, and that 'they did not cause the Los Angeles riots'. He wants instead to build 'ladders out of poverty' for inner-city residents through enterprise zones, home ownership, entrepreneurship, job training and educational choice. Federal enterprise zones, which already exist in many states, were an ingredient in last year's tax bill, vetoed by the president because it also included some tax increases. This must be set against the views of Mr Quayle, also interviewed extensively on Sunday. The differences lie in the emphasis more than in the substance, with the vice-president also subscribing to much of Mr Kemp's specific agenda. But he would spend more on law enforcement and on building prisons, and less on the social safety net. 'The philosophy and ideology of the Great Society, preaching entitlement and dependency, has to change,' according to Mr Quayle. 'We need to have security. If you're going to have fear in the cities, businesses aren't going to go down there and invest.' Having been a lonely figure in the Bush administration for three years, trying to breath life into a moribund and scandal-ridden department and unable to stop a steady decline in federal funding for the cities, Mr Kemp cannot be sanguine that the president will bring him in completely from the policy-making cold. But at least he has emerged from the national political shadows into the mainstream of the inner-city debate. Even Mr Clinton, whose own views are not a million miles from Mr Kemp's, has taken to praising him as the lone voice of reason inside the administration, which is a far cry from anything imaginable just four years ago.</p>

(``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, Interpretation and Policy .01 to CBOE rule 6.51, ``Reporting Duties,'' requires both the buyer and the seller in a transaction to record on a card or ticket information concerning the transaction, including the buyer's or seller's assigned broker initial code and his clearing firm (if a market maker), the symbol of the underlying security, the type, expiration month and exercise price of the option contract, the transaction price, the number of contract units comprising the transaction, the time of the transaction, the name of the contra clearing firm member and the assigned broker initial code of the contra member. Under Interpretation and Policy .01, this information constitutes the ``transaction record.'' The CBOE proposes to amend Interpretation and Policy .01 to allow members to submit options transaction data to the Exchange for trade recording and price reporting purposes in various media in addition to paper form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CBOE states that the purpose of the proposal is to enable CBOE members to submit options transaction data to the CBOE for trade recording and price reporting purposes in various media in addition to paper form. Under current CBOE rule 6.51, members are required to submit transaction data in paper form only, either on a trade ticket or on a transaction card. The CBOE states that in today's market and operations technology environment the limitation is unduly restrictive, and some Exchange members have requested the opportunity to submit transaction record data by means of electronic data transmission. Submission in that form would enable those members to report trades and prices to the CBOE through the same automated medium they use to report that information to their clearing firms. Accordingly, the CBOE seeks authority to approve particular media in addition to paper that CBOE members may use for trade recording and price reporting purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In administering the proposed rule change, the CBOE will from time to time identity particular media and formats acceptable for use under Exchange Rule 6.51 based on members' needs and will inform members about acceptable media and formats through appropriate circulars. The CBOE expects to identify as acceptable only those media that involve secure and tested technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and with section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to facilitate cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions, consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tyrone August] </F>   [Text] The role of South Africa's defence force, which in  the past was widely regarded as one of terror and destruction,  will change fundamentally in the years ahead. Its participation  in cross-border raids and attacks such as those on a suspected  APLA [Azanian Peoples Liberation Army] base in Transkei last  year, are still fresh in the minds of many.    But the new Minister of Defence, Mr Joe Modise, is  determined  to change the role of the defence force. Among his plans is the  establishment of a service brigade. "A lot of thinking has gone  into the creation of a service brigade," said Modise in an  interview in Pretoria." This brigade will be funded by the  Government and the community."    Initially, the new SA National Defence Force (SANDF) will  provide vocational training for those who cannot become part of  the standing force of between 67,000 and 70,000 soldiers.    Those who lose their places in the SANDF as a result of  rationalisation will be given vocational training to prepare  them for civilian life. "At the same time, they will also play  a major role in the Reconstruction and Development Programme,"  said Modise.    "After dealing with ex-servicemen, the service brigade might  also bring in young people who are in the streets and train them  to play a part in the economy."    He said similar brigades were successfully established in  Taiwan and in the United States. In South Africa, they will be  managed by the SANDF but not be part of it. "It will be more or  less an auxiliary body with a lot of emphasis on preparing  people to participate in our economy," said Modise.    They will be trained as builders, bricklayers, carpenters,  electricians, and later, also as motor mechanics, panelbeaters  and spray painters. Some will also get technical training (for  example, in electronics) and at a later stage training in  agriculture.    "We would like this service brigade to carry on  indefinitely,  like it has in Taiwan," said Modise. "There it has become a  very important instrument in developing the economy."    "That's the route we want to follow. A service brigade in  South Africa could become an instrument of the people that would  help to develop our country."    The establishment of a service brigade was first hinted at  in  a review of 1993 published by the then South African Defence  Force (SADF) earlier this year. "There are a large number of  individuals who have received military training of some sort and  who will not be accommodated in the new defence force," it said  in its report.    "To leave these individuals jobless in the streets is to  invite trouble." This is where the SADF saw a role for a  service brigade.    "This brigade could be used in non-military tasks, like  building projects," it said. "After a period of service in the  brigade, they can leave and make a living in the private sector."    The old SADF saw the new defence force playing an increasing  role in socio-economic development. "The SADF has considerable  ability in this area," it said. "Although the SADF should be  designed primarily for conventional operations, pragmatic  considerations dictate that it may sometimes be used for  non-military tasks.    "The driving principle should be that the return on  investment in the SADF (now SANDF) should be maximised by  putting its community utility value to good use without  impairing its primary role," the report said.    The SADF pointed to the role of the military in the United  States during the Great Depression of the 1930s as an example  of what it envisaged. "The vast pool of management skills and  knowledge that is inherently part of any defence force was used,  rather than military equipment per se, for upliftment projects,"  the SADF said.    "Some military personnel with the necessary expertise were  seconded to other state departments for use in the  socio-economic environment. "This ensured that military  equipment, which is needed for war and developed at great cost,  could be reserved for its original purpose.    "Knowledge and expertise that had public application, for  which the taxpayer had in any case paid, thus became available  for use to the advantage of the country as a whole."    In South Africa, the report said, qualified personnel from  the SADF could be sued to help teach science and mathematics in  schools where there was a shortage of qualified teachers.  Medical orderlies could also be used to teach and promote basic  hygiene and primary health care.    Like Modise, the SADF also saw a role for the new defence  force in preparing youth who were not adequately trained to  pursue a career or profession.    "A possible partial solution to this problem is to develop  an  organisation that can equip these people with the necessary  skills to enable them to make a decent living," the report said.    "It is foreseen that the SADF can be used to train people  for  a better future. The organisation has the training facilities,  the training expertise and the will to help."    These ideas are in line with the aims of the new Ministry of  Defence. "We are in the process of reorganising our army," said  Modise.    "We have always had problems with the defence force playing  a  military role inside the country." In the short term the SANDF  will continue to help maintain stability inside the country.    But further down the road, it is clear that there will be a  major shift in the role of the new defence force.    "We are now building a national defence force," he said.  "The force is now being legitimised. This is the people's own  force. They must do everything in their power to support it  because it is their own instrument of protection," Modise said.</p>

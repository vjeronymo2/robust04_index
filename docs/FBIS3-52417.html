Rabin came to the meeting after announcing that the  declaration would not be implemented on the agreed date of 13  December.    The agreement provides for the withdrawal of Israeli forces  from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. Instead of complying  with the agreement, the Israeli side only declared willingness  to redeploy the Israeli forces in these two areas. So a  disagreement ensued between us and the Israeli side and Mr.  Rabin over two issues, the first pertaining to the party  entitled to supervise the border crossings and bridges, and the  second pertaining to the size of the Jericho area under the  agreement.    The agreement stipulates that the Palestinians should have  supervision of the bridges and crossing points, with a UN  presence and Israeli coordination. But the Israeli side has  rejected that, claiming the right of supervision for itself. We  rejected that Israeli demand because it constituted a violation  of the agreement and meant turning the Gaza Strip and the  Jericho area into Bantustans or something like a "Red Indian  reservation" with the entry and exit keys in Israeli hands.    We consider that Israeli demand to be an insult to us and to  our Palestinian people's struggle for a just peace and for a  historic reconciliation with the people of Israel. Furthermore,  nobody would accept such a serious violation of an international  agreement concluded under the sponsorship of the United States  and the Russian Federation in full view of the whole world.    There is another disagreement between us over the meaning of  external security. We have agreed to Israeli supervision of  external security but we have rejected the deployment of Israeli  soldiers on our borders because that would place us under  Israeli sovereignty.    External security, as we see it and under international law,  means that Israel would guarantee the security of our borders if  subjected to any threat from any side on the grounds that such a  threat would also be a threat to Israel's security. But that  does not give Israel the right to deploy its forces on our  borders as requested by the Israelis. We have suggested  tripartite Israeli, international, and Palestinian patrols to  guard the borders.    The disagreement over the size of the Jericho area actually  shows the extent of Israeli intransigence. Under the Israeli  administration, the size of the Jericho area was 720 square km.  We have accepted an area of 340 square km drawn on the basis of  a 32-km line along the River Jordan and a width of 10 km into  the Jericho zone. The three bridges linking the Jericho area  with Jordan are situated on that line.    The Israeli side insists that the area should only be 27  square km. We reject that because accepting it would mean  agreeing to live in a ghetto. Would anyone agree to live in a  ghetto?    We offered to coordinate with the Israeli side on security  matters to allay Israeli fears. They can use the most advanced  control technology. We could also use international forces from  any states which enjoy Israel's trust, such as the United  States, Canada, Norway, or any other European state.    At our Cairo meeting we agreed with Mr. Rabin that no  comments would be made on the issues discussed but no sooner had  we left the meeting hall than the Israeli officials began  talking openly about what went on during the meeting. That is  not in the interest of our efforts to find an acceptable  solution to these matters.    If Mr. Rabin believes that he has to look after his people's  interests then we also must take into consideration the  legitimate demands of Palestinian, Arab, Islamic, and Christian  public opinion.    We want an urgent solution to these problems, and we want  the  Declaration of Principles implemented in order to establish  peace for our people, the Israeli people, and the rest of the  region's peoples, and in order to put an end to the Israeli  occupation of our territory.</p>

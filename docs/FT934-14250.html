			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Back to work at Westminster THE ROAD to the restoration of the British government's authority is still a long and painful one. The next stage begins today, when Parliament returns. The most that can be said so far is that the government has not fallen apart. If it is to do better than that, it must hold its nerve and show that it is possible to make its decisions stick. That requires unity on its own benches. The Conservative party must decide whether it wants the responsibility of office or the luxury of a period of opposition, in which it might freely indulge its post-Thatcher propensity for ideological bickering. After the formal business of the cabinet was concluded last Thursday, ministers congratulated themselves, and the prime minister, on what they saw as a successful party conference. What actually happened at Blackpool was that various threatened disasters did not take place. The publication of Lady Thatcher's criticisms of Mr John Major did less damage to her successor than had been feared. Mr Major himself survived unscathed; his leader's speech, which relied heavily on nostalgia, was well-received by an audience primed to be receptive. A facade of unity was erected on the flimsy foundation of a number of speeches attacking various scapegoats for the government's failures: criminals, unmarried mothers, pornographers, foreign dependents on British social security and the like. Deep hole This may not leave a pleasant taste in the mouth, but it served its purpose, which was to get the government through a difficult week. Mr Major remains, however, in what the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, has called a deep hole. The man with the heaviest responsibility for the rescue operation is Mr Clarke himself. As matters stand, he is in the deepest hole of all, Pounds 50bn deep. His Budget on November 30 will be judged in part by the extent to which it reduces that deficit. Whatever he decides to do is likely to be opposed by one lobby or another, as today's debate on defence is likely to demonstrate. A government that cannot withstand lobbies is no government at all. The defence budget is already being reduced, under Options for Change, and the defence secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, appears likely to offer up politically motivated 'unthinkable' cuts in an effort to protect his department's bottom line from further raids. There is a strong case for a further challenge to the defence budget, as the wider review of public spending unfolds in the next three years. The possibilities of merging Britain's defence responsibilities with those of European allies have not been fully explored. The ambitions of the forces chiefs are still attuned to an earlier age. There is a limit to what can be afforded by a modest country like Britain, which still maintains tanks it cannot keep in good repair and which it could not protect in wartime without the assistance of allies. Radical change The defence secretary insists that spending must be tailored to the demands on the forces deployed. He wants a review before any further deep cuts. The chancellor might call Mr Rifkind's bluff. He could try setting a low figure and asking the ministry to demonstrate what commitments it could meet with that. This would be a radical but necessary change in the order of determining the budget for the only high-spending department that is not protected by election promises (health) or sheer numbers of genuine dependents (social security). Other politically difficult decisions remain to be taken before the Budget. The government appears to be soft-pedalling on British Coal's pit closure programme. This may buy a few doubtful weeks of political peace, at a cost of larger stockpiles and lower coal sales later on. It seems to be wavering on the details of rail privatisation, particularly the House of Lords amendment allowing British Rail, the management that got the railways where they are today, to bid for the privatised lines. This is government by parliamentary rebels. Mr Major needs to demonstrate that he and his colleagues can be as effective with a majority of 17, plus nine Ulster Unionists, as his predecessor could with majorities four and five times as large. The question is, will his party allow him to do so?</p>

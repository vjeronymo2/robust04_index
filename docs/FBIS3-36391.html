			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Leonid Vinogradov] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok February 7 TASS -- Russia's Far East is  suffering from the cold and this suffering is further aggravated  by the disruption of fuel and energy supplies. The Federal Fuel  and Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik has had to fly to Khabarovsk  in order to try and solve the most pressing problems "on site".    According to specialists, all enterprises in this vast  region  are likely to stop unless emergency measures are taken promptly.  The cities will have to live without electricity for ten hours  every day, and the local thermal power stations will use up all  the electricity to keep going.    The Russian Maritime Territory needs about 47,000 tonnes of  coal every day to keep its electricity-generating plants going.  At present, the daily supplies have dwindled to 23-25 thousand  tonnes, and the emergency reserves are vanishing. This is why  electricity supplies have to be cut off in the evenings and the  major cities, including Vladivostok, Nakhodka, Ussuriisk and  others are plunged in the shadows one after another in the  evenings. In many houses and departments the average  temperature never rises about 6-7 degrees centigrade.    The energy crisis is largely due to the epidemic of  non-payment, although the federal government adopted a  resolution on October 8, 1993 to bring about "emergency measures  of support of the Maritime Territory". The federal budget owes  more than 30 billion roubles to the coal producers. The  coalminers in the territory are owed 19 billion roubles in wages.    Last year the Primorugol Association was unable to purchase  a  single mechanised set of machinery. The machinery and equipment  now used by the miners are wornout and even at full capacity  produce a million tonnes of coal less than planned.    The federal government delivered 35 billion roubles to the  territory but the money was fully spent to pay for earlier  supplies.</p>

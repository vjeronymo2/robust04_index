			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / UK Company News: BSkyB makes first Pounds 50m payment to shareholders British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, has made its first Pounds 50m payment to its shareholders. The payment was the first return on a total of Pounds 1.6bn invested in the project so far. Mr Richard Brooke, BSkyB finance director, said that a further payment of at least Pounds 50m would be made before the end of the financial year. He said operating profit had reached Pounds 3m a week by the end of November but declined to say what the figure for the full year would be. Half of the first Pounds 50m went to Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. The balance was split between Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, Chargeurs, the French communication and transportation group, and Granada. Mr Brooke said the move to charge for BSkyB's channels had been a success. In July, the number of homes subscribing stood at 2.35m and should reach 3.25m by the year end.</p>

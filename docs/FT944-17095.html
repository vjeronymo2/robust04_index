			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / FT Guide To The Week MONDAY EU convergence criteria The European Commission is to make recommendations on how all European Union member states except Luxembourg and Ireland should bring down their budget deficits and government debt, to get in line with the Maastricht treaty requirements for European monetary union. The advice, due at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Luxembourg, is the first instance of the so-called 'excessive budgets procedure' envisaged by Maastricht. Unusually, the Commission recommendations are likely to be made public, partly to avoid any speculative pressure on the currencies of the most indebted states, such as Italy. Security in Europe: Officials from 53 European, North American and former Soviet states gather to start preparing for the December summit of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Russia wants the CSCE to be given greater powers to intervene in local conflicts, and is also seeking western approval for its military presence in the republics on its southern border. UK economics: Minutes of the September 7 meeting between Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England (left), are published. The duo decided to raise base rates from 5.25 to 5.75 per cent, but the decision required a second meeting two days later. Their debate may provide clues on the future direction of base rates. Nobel prizes: The annual season gets under way in Stockholm with the announcement of the prize for medicine. Tomorrow and Wednesday see the awards for economics, physics and chemistry. On Friday, the stage shifts to Oslo for the peace prize announcement. Hot favourites for the peace prize are Yassir Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres for their part in the Middle East peace process. Romanian students protesting at educational conditions have threatened to chain themselves to railway tracks. UK politics: The House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber of parliament, returns after its summer recess. FT Survey: Business Travel. Holidays: Argentina (Columbus Day), Canada (Thanksgiving), Japan, Kenya, Peru, South Africa (Kruger Day), Taiwan, US (Columbus Day). TUESDAY War crimes tribunal The chief prosecutor in the International War Crimes Tribunal, Richard Goldstone, is to hold a press conference in The Hague after his first visit to former Yugoslavia. Judge Goldstone last week visited Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia to try to persuade the authorities to hand over war criminals. The Tribunal's first indictments are due to be made by November. Tory party conference: Britain's governing party opens its annual conference in the resort of Bournemouth on the south coast of England (to Oct 14). The leadership is determined to avoid the temptation to attack Tony Blair's new-look opposition Labour party and will try to concentrate on what it sees as the government's solid record of achievement - particularly in its handling of the economy. Prime minister John Major speaks on Friday. Potential flashpoints include Northern Ireland, and home affairs, where the performance of struggling home secretary Michael Howard will be monitored closely. Pakistan opposition leader Nawaz Sharif has called a general strike as part of an anti-government campaign; prime minister Benazir Bhutto has called for talks with the opposition. Peru election deadline: Hopefuls for the Peruvian presidential election next April have to register their candidacy by today. The incumbent, Alberto Fujimori, has already confirmed that he will stand again. Fujimori's many challengers include his estranged wife, Susana Higuchi, who must win a ruling from a constitutional court to overturn a bar on relatives of the head of state standing for the presidency, and 74-year-old former UN secretary-general, Javier Perez de Cuellar. Bid to smash Windows: IBM attempts to oust Microsoft's Windows operating system for desktop computers from its market dominance by launching Warp, a new version of its OS/2. Its attack comes at a bad time for Microsoft, whose own challenger, Chicago, has been delayed. Saleroom: Two miniatures by Nicholas Hilliard, who portrayed the characters of the Elizabethan Court, come up for auction at Sotheby's in London. One of Queen Elizabeth I, dated to 1590, is estimated at Pounds 6,000 while a melancholic young man could make Pounds 30,000. They are part of a group of 200 miniatures collected by the late RL Bayne-Powell. WEDNESDAY Gore visits Nicaragua US vice-president Al Gore visits Nicaragua to attend a summit of central American presidents focusing on the environment. Central America's six presidents are to meet in Managua in a bid to strengthen the Alliance for Sustainable Development, a plan to protect the region's environment while exploiting its rich natural resources. UK economy: Inflation may be low, but judging by gilt yields, investors cannot believe it will stay that way. However, September's retail prices index, out today, is expected to show that underlying inflation is still within the lower half of the government's 1-4 per cent target range. Aftershock: A week after an earthquake off Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, measuring 8.2 on the Richter scale, Tokyo hosts a United Nations public forum and open lecture by Professor Haresh Shah on why the global earthquake risk is increasing. Ukraine president Leonid Kuchma presents his programme to parliament covering economic and constitutional reform, nuclear arms and Crimea. He will also ask the assembly to sanction budget cuts in line with an IMF plan. Saleroom: A Christie's in London auction of correspondence from the archives of Bowood House in Wiltshire is expected to raise Pounds 700,000 and includes letters to the 2nd Earl of Shelburne, who was British prime minister in the 1780s, from George III, George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. There are also 15 letters to the earl from the 18th century Scottish economist Adam Smith, who converted the earl to the doctrine of free trade, which are expected to fetch more than Pounds 90,000. Football: A host of unevenly matched UEFA cup qualifying games takes place today, including: Ireland v Leichstenstein, and Russia v San Marino. Rugby: Wales play Italy in Cardiff in a World Cup qualifying game. Holidays: Brazil; Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Uruguay, Venezuela (Columbus Day); Spain. THURSDAY Bundesbank council meets The Bundesbank policy-making central council meets with Sunday's federal election on its mind, and prices on its agenda. It will contemplate the potentially inflationary impact of the IG Metall engineering union's 1995 pay claim, due on Tuesday or Wednesday. A demand for about 6 per cent is expected, but the key question is how hard the union will press its case. That depends on the election result. The return of the current government will mean a fight. But if the Social Democrats win a place in a new coalition, a peaceful and non-inflationary settlement can be virtually guaranteed. Singapore hosts a meeting to promote links between Europe and east Asia, organised by the Singapore Economic Development Board and the Geneva-based World Economic Forum. Key speakers include Malaysian leader Dr Mahathir Mohamad and President Fidel Ramos of the Philippines. Canadian economy: Federal and provincial finance ministers meet in Toronto ahead of next week's economic statement by the federal finance minister Paul Martin. That will set the stage for consultations on his next budget, expected February 1995. Also on the agenda will be debt and deficits, and sales tax reform. FT Survey: Bulgaria. Holidays: Hong Kong, India (Bombay only). FRIDAY General strike in Italy Italian trade unions plan a general strike in protest at plans by Silvio Berlusconi's government to rein in spending and cut pension and health benefits as part of an austerity budget for 1995. The detail and timing of the action - originally planned as a four-hour stoppage - could well depend on the sector and region. Individual unions and even factories have begun to stage strikes at short notice over the past fortnight, as the general protest coincides with more localised attempts to put pressure on employers during the annual round of wage negotiations. Stock standard: Deadline for submissions on the London Stock Exchange's plans to replace the Unlisted Securities Market, which closes in 1996. Initial reaction to the Alternative Investment Market from advisers, brokers, bankers and small company representatives has been favourable. Portugal's government presents its 1995 budget to parliament. Finance minister Eduardo Catroga aims to cut inflation to between 3.5 and 4.5 per cent, keep growth between 2.5 and 3.5 per cent and reduce the deficit from an original forecast of 6.5 per cent of GDP. Economic growth, which resumed in the second quarter after a recession in 1993, is now forecast at the lower end of the government's 1 to 2 per cent target. FT Survey: International Standards. WEEKEND German federal elections Chancellor Helmut Kohl, hoping to win his fourth election in a row, may scrape home if the Free Democrats, his junior coalition partner, pick up last-minute support. Failing that, Kohl's CDU will probably form a grand coalition with the opposition SPD. There are also state elections in Thuringia, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and the Saarland, and municipal elections in North Rhine-Westphalia. Botswana holds a general election on Saturday. The Ulster Unionists, Northern Ireland's biggest political party, begin their annual conference in Carrickfergus on Saturday. The party is the main moderate unionist voice in the province and its support for the UK-Irish peace initiative is vital if it is to have a chance of success. Principal point of interest will be the speech by UUP leader James Molyneaux, expected to focus on the prospects for devolved government in Ulster. Finland is expected to vote heavily in favour of European Union membership in its referendum on Sunday. Macedonian vote: The former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia holds a general election and votes for a president. No party is expected to win an outright majority, but President Kiro Gligorov should be re-elected. Compiled by Patrick Stiles and Sean Daly. Fax: (+44) (0)71 873 3194.</p>

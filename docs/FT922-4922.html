			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Consultancy expansion for Ernst &amp; Young ERNST &amp; YOUNG, the accountancy firm, has purchased a 12 per cent stake in Kalchas, a London-based strategic consultancy, in the first of a number of alliances it plans to help broaden its consulting arm over the next three years. Kalchas, which expects to bill more than Pounds 3m this year, will remain at arms' length, preserving client confidentiality and operating with separate offices, projects and staffing. Discussions on the purchase began 18 months ago, and the firms have begun to tender for projects jointly. Mr Clive Williams, head of consulting at Ernst &amp; Young, said he planned to take several more stakes in other firms in particular market segments or offering special services as part of a process of 'branding' the consultancy arm. The purchase price has not been disclosed. Ernst &amp; Young will receive dividends and voting rights in proportion to its stake. It may buy more shares in the future, but stressed that it wants Kalchas to remain a separate company. Kalchas - named after the adviser to Agamemnon in Greek mythology who is credited with inventing the Trojan horse - was formed in 1988 by two partners from Bain and one from McKinsey, the consultancy firms. It now has two additional junior partners and 30 professional staff, and specialises in offering long-term strategic consulting to senior executives. The consultancy division of Ernst &amp; Young has about 360 professionals.</p>

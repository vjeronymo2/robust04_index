			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Malaysian market peril Those with shares in the Kuala Lumpur stock market, south-east Asia's biggest in terms of market capitalisation, should reconsider their position very carefully, Mr Daim Zainuddin, former finance minister, confidant of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and treasurer of Malaysia's dominant political party. The Kuala Lumpur market index went up 98 per cent last year. Average daily turnover has risen from about MDollars 200m (Pounds 51m) a year ago to more than MDollars 3bn. 'We have reached a dangerous stage,' Mr Daim told the Malaysian government news agency. 'Almost everybody is getting into the market. Everybody is busy on the phone. Nobody seems to be working. Everyone talks about shares. This will affect productivity and lower productivity will affect our economy.' Mr Daim said the Kuala Lumpur market was due for a big correction after its recent strong rise. 'The big question now is when. But when the fall comes, the damage is going to be massive because the market has gone up too steep, too fast' he said. 'The government will not bail out anybody.' Not only is Mr Daim a well connected political figure, he is also reputed to be one Malaysia's richest men who has been behind many of the country's biggest corporate restructurings - and an avid stock market player. He said he had already 'cashed out'.</p>

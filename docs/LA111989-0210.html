			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> DON'T LET A POWER FAILURE BE SHOCKING  </P> <P> The Home Warranty Assn. of California offers the following tips to locate  problems in a home's electrical system and to ensure your family's safety:  </P> <P>  -- Keep a supply of the required-size fuses on hand.  </P> <P>  -- Make certain that all fuses are tight. Glass screw-in fuses tend to become  loose in warmer weather.  </P> <P>  -- Periodically check to make certain all breakers are set in the "On"  position.  </P> <P>  -- A professional service contractor should be contacted if you reset the  panel after an outage and the lights and electrical outlets still fail to  operate or if your outlets or panel become very hot or begin to spark.  </P> <P>  -- Ground fault protectors are used wherever electricity might come into  contact with water. If your circuit breaker trips without apparent reason,  check to make sure that the ground fault protectors are in good condition.  </P> <P> "While regular maintenance can help prevent problems with electrical systems,  homeowners can further protect themselves with a home warranty plan in the  event repairs or replacements are needed," said Daniel J. Brinker, president of  the Home Warranty Assn. of California.  </P></p>

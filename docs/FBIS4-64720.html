			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Ministry spokesman Konstandinos Bikas said  that Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias made no promises--as  Tirana claims he did--in connection with Albanian claims that  radio stations and other organizations are being obstructed from  operating in northern Greece. Bikas said Papoulias never  promised not to obstruct operations. Bikas was commenting on  reports that the claim was made during the Zurich meeting  between Papoulias and Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi,  and that the Greek side supposedly accepted it.</p>

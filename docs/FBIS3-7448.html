Saying that the publication of the war scenario against the  North cannot be overlooked, the paper in a commentator's article  warns:    The South Korean ruling quarters should ponder over the  grave  consequences that may arise from their reckless acts of leading  the situation to the brink of war in collusion with outside  forces against fellow countrymen.    The article says:    The "plan" revealed recently by the puppet Defence Minister  of South Korea, Yi Pyong-tae, provides for "five-phase military  actions". It is a war scenario against the North which was  worked out through a confab between ranking officers of the U.S.  Forces and the puppet Army in September last year.    This is the first time that South Korea opened to the public  an established war scenario against the North. This shows the  Kim Yong-sam group is a cohort of bellicose elements more  swollen-headed for northward invasion than the preceding rulers,  and plainclothes warmaniacs more dangerous than those in  military uniforms.    This is proved eloquently by the reckless military moves of  the South Korean authorities.    The South Korean puppets recently held military confabs such  as "meeting of security-related ministers" one after another  over the "nuclear issue" of the North and "reexamined" their  "policy toward the North" and "defence posture". On that basis,  they decided to introduce Patriot missiles in South Korea and  resume the Team Spirit joint military maneuvers and issued a  "special alert order" to the entire puppet Armed Forces. These  are ill-boding military moves to carry the war scenario against  the North into practice.    As a result, a strained situation that might trigger off a  war any moment has been created on the Korean peninsula.    It has been made clear that the South Korean puppets are a  group of traitors indifferent to peace in the country and the  fate of the nation.    The Kim Yong-sam group must remember that they unilaterally  nullified the inter-Korean agreement and the joint declaration  on denuclearisation.    The United States and the South Korean authorities watching  for a chance to realise the war scenario against the North are  wholly to blame for the tensions on the Korean peninsula.    The root cause of disasters must be grubbed up in time.    The bellicose elements such as the puppet defence minister  trying to plunge our nation into the scourge of nuclear war must  be punished immediately and the Kim Yong-sam traitorous regime  be ousted.    With no military threat can the United States and the South  Korean rulers frighten the Korean people. Unshakable is the  will of our people and People's Army to punish the aggressors  and provokers and safeguard security of the country and the  nation.    We are fully prepared to deal a thousand-fold retaliatory  blow if the South Korean rulers unleash a war against the North  in league with outside forces.    The provokers will have to pay dearly.</p>

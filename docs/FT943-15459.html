			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / G7 Summit in Naples: US welcomes tax plans by Japanese US officials yesterday welcomed what they saw as a new commitment by the Japanese government to stimulate dom-estic demand through an income tax cut and so open new market opportunities for other countries. Although Japan has already cut income tax and plans another cut of the same size next year, it had intended to offset this cut with a consumption tax, thereby eliminating the effect on domestic demand. But US officials said Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's new prime minister, assured President Bill Clinton at a meeting in Naples that his coalition would not go ahead with the consumption tax until the Japanese economy had started to grow again. The bilateral meeting preceded the formal summit of heads of government from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, which began in Naples last night. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, said Mr Masayoshi Takemura, his Japanese opposite number, had assured him he 'would not detract from the income tax cut until they were sure that they were well on the way to recovery'. Mr Clinton also said that Japan had not made enough progress towards opening up its markets to foreign goods, and that he looked forward to a quick resumption of the US-Japan framework trade negotiations. Nevertheless, he showed much greater understanding than in the past for the political difficulties faced by the Japanese government in opening up its markets. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, said he would also be pressing the Japanese government for trade liberalisation measures at the summit. Mr Clinton plans to broach to his colleagues an idea for further action to follow up on the free trade promises they made in the Uruguay Round of negotiations. Besides urging the other G7 countries to ratify the Uruguay Round agreement, he said he would ask them to review and analyse remaining trade barriers and report back to next year's summit in Halifax, Canada. In a letter to the other G7 leaders, Mr Clinton mentioned financial services, standards and investment rules as examples of areas that largely escaped scrutiny in the Uruguay Round. A senior US official said this initiative, dubbed Open Markets 2000, was intended to maintain the momentum towards freer trade. Nevertheless, ratification of the Uruguay Round agreement remained the US's first priority and Open Markets 2000 was not intended to open a new 'Clinton Round' of talks. The idea was welcomed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian premier, who agreed on the need for 'more incisive measures', particularly in the area of financial services.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F> Group]    [Text] The unprecedented drop in the value of the U.S.  dollar against the Japanese yen has been coupled with great  concern in the West's monetary circles, so much so that the  Japanese foreign minister called on the United States to end the  joint trade talks by reaching a rapid conclusion and to thus  mitigate the monetary crisis in the West.    Meanwhile, the frightful drop in the value of the dollar  against the Japanese yen compelled U.S. President Bill Clinton  to call on the Treasury Department to take immediate steps to  strengthen the dollar. It should be noted that on Thursday [23  June] the U.S. dollar sold at less than 100 Japanese yen, which  is the lowest exchange rate since World War II. The value of  the dollar against the German mark also dropped to less than  1.60 German marks to the dollar.    International economic experts believe that until 1985, when  the (Plaza) Accord was implemented to reduce America's trade  deficit with Japan and Germany and the drop in the value of the  dollar against European currencies and the Japanese yen were  taken into consideration, the U.S. dollar was equal to 260  Japanese yen. This exchange rate has now dropped by more than  60 percent.    The policy of dropping the value of the dollar, which was  initially started in order to reduce America's trade deficit  with Japan and Germany, gave rise to hopes that Japan's imports  would increase while its exports would drop. However, although  this had negative impacts on Japan, it was unable to correct the  Tokyo-Washington trade deficit, which is expected to reach $70  billion this year.    Yesterday the central banks of Europe, Japan, and the United  States intervened in the foreign exchange markets in order to  strengthen the U.S. dollar; by purchasing dollars, they tried to  prevent a further drop in its current value. However, Western  monetary experts are worried that the drop in the exchange rate  of the U.S. dollar to less than 100 Japanese yen will further  accelerate the drop in the value of the U.S. currency. Also,  Wall Street monetary sources believe that although increased  bank interest rates in the United States may strengthen the  dollar, it will result in a drop in the price of shares and bond  rates and that the experience of past economic crises in the  United States may be repeated.    The question now is what impact the drop in the dollar  against European currencies and the yen will have on the  countries exporting raw materials, especially oil. Since oil is  mostly paid for in dollars, and the oil-exporting countries  import more from Europe and Japan than from the United States,  the drop in the value of the dollar against the yen and the  German mark will actually have a negative impact on the regional  countries' petrodollar purchasing powers. That is why reducing  oil incomes' dependence on the dollar and diversifying the  foreign currencies earned from oil exports is being carefully  considered by the economic experts of the OPEC member countries.</p>

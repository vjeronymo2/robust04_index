Following the  snaps of [President Scalfaro's daughter] Marianna Scalfaro and  architect Adolfo Salab in the Via del Babuino, images which one  suspects of being inspired by 007s, another photograph is  causing embarrassment to the Interior Ministry's civilian secret  service. It is the one depicting SISDE's number two, Prefect  Antonio Barrel, at the baptism of the son of a supposed  narcotics traffic boss, Maurizio Martina from Puglia. The photo  is in a dossier opened by public prosecutors Leone De Castris of  Brindisi and Francesco Mandoi of Lecce, who hold most of the key  information in the investigation into the Pugliese narcotics  trafficker. For the time being the two prosecutors have not  taken any measures. Nonetheless, the prefect's presence at the  ceremony is raising serious questions both outside and inside  the Interior Ministry.    Barrel was appointed SISDE deputy director on 3 June last,  after heading the Brindisi Prefecture since 1991. On arrival at  the capital of the Messapian region, he was immediately  confronted with the invasion of the Albanian ``boat people,''  20,000 of whom landed on the Pugliese coast that year. Apart  from the refugee emergency, the prefect got himself in the  limelight by proposing to the Interior Ministry that it suspend  local councillors and introduce initiatives against contraband  and the practice of hiring local youths for criminal purposes.    Employed by the Interior Ministry in 1953, appointed questor  in 1982 (in Naples, where he remained three and a half years),  Barrel was called to SISDE immediately after the scandal of the  reserved funds, earning the acclaim of Interior Minister Nicola  Mancino (``He was indeed a good choice'') and PDS [Democratic  Party of the Left] member Luciano Violante, chairman of the  anti-Mafia committee (``In Brindisi he succeeded in giving an  extraordinary impetus to all the administrative departments  reporting to him'').    Whilst Barrel was in this long-vacant office, the Salento  region police came into possession of a compromising family  album belonging to Maurizio Martina, not just a Mr. Nobody in  Brindisi. According the weekly L'ESPRESSO, Martina is known for  ``the unscrupulous nature of his financial dealings, his  widespread and at first glance unjustifiable property holdings,  and for being related, through his wife, with the U.S. bosses:  His wife's daughter married a member of the Gambino family.''    Arrested together with a Turk and a Pakistani, with whom he  is suspected of narcotics trafficking on a vast scale, leading  to the seizure of 60 kg of heroin, Martina invited Barrel and a  well-known Pugliese politician, Socialist member Biagio Marzo,  former chairman of the bicameral commission on state  participation in industry, to his son's baptism. In the photos,  the prefect and Marzio appear, holding the newly born child at  the time of the baptism.    Whilst the Pugliese magistracy is trying to shed light on  the  activities of Martina and his friendships ``above all  suspicion,'' the enquiry continues in Rome into SISDE's black  funds. Yesterday former civilian secret service Director  Alessandro Voci was interrogated at length. The prefect denied  ever having appropriated funds or having ``paid a salary,'' as  head of the 007s, to the then Interior Minister Enzo Scotti.  Also interrogated for five hours was his predecessor at the  head of the service, Riccardo Malpica, who replied to all the  judges' questions.    Meanwhile, from his secret refuge, one of the SISDE  officials  still hiding from justice, Michele Finocchi, threatened legal  action and denied presumed links between financiers linked to  the Magliana Band [crime gang] and the service's cover-up  company. ``The only company in which I have an interest,''  Finocchi stated, ``is the one which is the registered owner of  the apartment in which I am living.'' Finally, a meeting is  scheduled today between Prince Rainier of Monaco and the  capital's well-known criminal lawyer Nono Marazzita, 007  Maurizio Broccoletti's defender. At the center of the  discussion, which will take place at the Monte Carlo Royal  Palace, is the extradition request issued by the Italian  authorities.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- The Committee for  the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] published a  statement today, which says:    "The South Korean authorities barred our mourners' group  from  going to Seoul to mourn the death of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan at his  bier. This stripped them bare, revealing their color as  hooligans ignorant of the beautiful customs and manners and  civility and morality handed down from the ancestors and a group  of traitors who are clean indifferent to peace of the country  and its reunification. We denounce this with national  resentment.    "The South Korean authorities branded the National Alliance  for the Country's Reunification (Pomminnyon) as `an organisation  benefiting the enemy' in order to block the attendance of the  North side's mourners' group at the funeral of Rev. Mun. This  once again disclosed to the whole world that they are an  anti-national, anti-reunification group which treats all the  fellow countrymen who aspire after reunification as `enemies'.    "Worse still, they took issue with our offer of mourning  visit by linking it with the fictitious `nuclear issue.' This is  a political provocation motivated by a sinister purpose to  further aggravate the North-South relations by connecting the  humanitarian question with the political and military question  in a far-fetched manner."    The statement stresses:    "We will curse through years the treacherous crime of the  South Korean rulers in blocking the mourning visit of our side  in violation of the elementary human ethic and morality and  settle account with them for this. The Kim Yong-sam group which  is prolonging its days by dependence on outside forces,  treacheries, political swindle and irregulaties will meet its  doom before long.    "The South Korean rulers should act discreetly with reason."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Terence White] </F>   [Excerpts] Kabul, Jan 17 (AFP) -- The first relief convoy  of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in nearly  three weeks arrived in Kabul on Monday, delivering 20 tonnes of  medical supplies to the besieged city.    The supplies come at a crucial time as Kabul's hospitals and  clinics reported at the weekend that nearly 6,000 people had  been treated for wounds sustained in fighting between troops  loyal to Afghan Government troops and mojahedin under  ex-communist general Abdol Rashid Dostam.    The convoy, consisting of seven vehicles, made it to the  Afghan capital under a light dusting of snow and the sporadic  exchange of small arms fire and artillery bombardments around  the city. [passage omitted]    The Red Cross vehicles were able to make the dangerous  overland journey from the Pakistan border to the capital because  of good relations with the warring factions, said Kabul's Red  Cross chief Peter Stocker.    "Through our humanitarian work, carried out both inside and  outside Kabul, we have reliable contacts enabling us to obtain  security guarantees," Stocker said.    The Red Cross convoy brought with it badly needed  antibiotics, dressings and general medicines.    Volunteer workers of the Afghan Red Crescent Society  unloaded  the medical supplies in Kabul, which will be distributed to the  23 hospitals and clinics in and around the capital which are  supported by the ICRC.    With the arrival of winter, the arrival of the convoy, which  included four land cruisers, was welcomed as a valuable asset to  the ICRC here, enabling the organization to expand its  operations to cope with the fighting now in its 17th day.    The Red Cross also evacuated seven foreigners from Kabul by  road Monday, including six Indonesians, among them three  children aged 12 and under, and a German businessman who was  said to represent a satellite-telephone company.    Meanwhile, in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar,  the powerful Hezb-e Eslami faction, which has been fighting the  government alongside Dostam's forces, accused Saudi Arabian  intelligence Monday of maligning its leader Golboddin Hekmatyar.    Hekmatyar, who is also prime minister, has long been at odds  with President Borhanoddin Rabbani and his ally and former  defense minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud.    Hezb leader Nawab Salim in a statement advised Saudi  Arabia's  King Fahd to "bridle" his intelligence and "enslaved media" and  stop "interferring" in Afghanistan's internal affairs.    The statement said the Saudi regime was propagating "fake  fatwas," or religious rulings, against the Coordination Council  of Islamic Revolution (CCIR), which includes Hezb, Dostam's  Junbish movement and other mojahedin groups.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Silvio Berlusconi has almost reached his goal.  A final agreement on the new government was reached last night.  [passage omitted] Mauro Mazza reports:    [Mazza] Berlusconi's dream may become reality. There has  been speculation since last night that Antonio Di Pietro will  become interior minister. Maybe it is only a coincidence, but  the prosecutor was in Rome this morning to meet with his  colleague Saviotti. There are rumors that Di Pietro and  Berlusconi met before the prime minister-designate went to the  Quirinale [office of the president] at 1130. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, other problems were apparently solved at last  night's summit:    [Roberto] Maroni [Nothern League] and Giuseppe Tatarella  [Italian Social Movement--MSI] will be deputy prime ministers.  Maroni will also be justice minister, and Tatarella will also be  minister of posts and telecommunications.    Antonio Martino [Forza Italia] will be foreign minister.    Lamberto Dini [no party affiliation] will be given the  Treasury.    [Giulio] Tremonti, former member of the Pact for Italy, will  be finance minister.    [Ombretta] Fumagalli Carulli [Christian Democratic  Center-CCD] will be minister of education.    [Giancarlo] Pagliarini [Northern League] will be budget  minister.    Leoni will be given the Ministry of Public Works.    [Publio] Fiori [MSI] will be transport minister.    [Domenico] Fisichella [no party affiliation] will be  minister  for cultural heritage.    [Gianni] Letta [a journalist] will be undersecretary to the  presidency of the council. [passage omitted]</p>

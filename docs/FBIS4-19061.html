			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Philippe Vasseur, secretary general of the </F> Republican Party, by Eric Zemmour; place and date not given:  "Philippe Vasseur: `Like the Centrists in 1988...'" -- first  paragraph is LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS introduction]    [Text] In an interview with LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, the  general secretary of the Republican Party [PR] explained what  had led his party and a number of PR deputies to envision  forming an independent Republican group in the National Assembly.    [Zemmour] Why did the PR vent its fury after the victory  scored by Dominique Baudis over Jean-Francois Deniau?    [Vasseur] Dominique Baudis was nominated by the French  Democratic Union [UDF]. This will place him at the top of the  majority's list during the upcoming European elections. We have  been -- and still remain -- militant UDF members. Dominique  Baudis can count on the support of the Republican Party in the  upcoming European elections. However, I will not conceal the  fact that the feeling dominating within the PR today is one of  bitterness. Dominique Baudis is not involved in this issue;  rather it is the way in which things have happened that is to  blame. Of course, we are resigned to the outcome, but we feel  obliged to point out that some votes would not have gone the  same way a few weeks ago or even just a few days ago.    [Zemmour] Could you be more specific?    [Vasseur] Right up to the end, we believed that the UDF was  facing a strategic choice: Which name would be best at the top  of the UDF's list? Who could best reconcile the ideas and  beliefs of the RPR [Rally for the Republic] and the UDF, of  those who voted "Yes" to Maastricht, and those who voted "No";  in other words, who would best be able to rally the electorate  of the majority -- i.e., the full majority -- behind them?    We believed that we are capable of that. We then found that  we were the victims of people who made a choice based on the  economic situation, based on a line of argument that had  strictly nothing to do with the issue at hand    [Zemmour] Is it Andre Santini you are talking about in this  context?    [Vasseur] I do not wish to name any names. I merely wish to  say that after this vote some members of the PR -- and I  understand their impatience and view of events -- said that they  had had enough of it always being the PR which made an effort  and never received anything in return.    [Zemmour] In actual fact this is not your first failure to  impose your views and candidates on the UDF. Should the PR not  call its strategies within the confederation into question, stop  outwardly playing "the tough guys" only to end up bowing to the  UDF's more or less democratic procedures.    [Vasseur] We are not playing the "tough guys." We are an  undeniably political force, which is well organized on the  ground, and has a large number of active members. Furthermore,  we have long been convinced of the need for the UDF, and have  merrily played the game of confederation. However, we will not  sacrifice our identity. And the bad practices to which we have  fallen victim are leading a certain number among our ranks to  seek a new, more efficient way of affirming our identity.    [Zemmour] What do you mean?    [Vasseur] Some PR deputies, and by no means just a few of  them, are currently lending very serious consideration to the  appropriateness of establishing a Republican group in the  National Assembly.    [Zemmour] Would that be a terrible blow to the UDF?    [Vasseur] There have been precedents. Between 1988 and 1993  the centrists formed their own autonomous group. Some CDS  [Social Democratic Center] remained within the UDF, others  joined the UDC [Union of the Center]. The PR deputies would do  the same. So they would not be the first people to have  committed a crime of "high treason" with regard to the UDF.    [Zemmour] Is it a reprisal measure?    [Vasseur] No. Merely, the product of our analysis of the  situation. Within the UDF, most of the time the PR is smothered  and cannot make itself heard. There can be no doubt that having  an autonomous group would enable it to do so more. For a long  time, those in favor of keeping the PR deputies within the  single group of the UDF have been saying that the message and  ideas of the PR would become more widespread as a result. These  arguments do not stand up. We are quietly considering the  establishment of such an autonomous group. This week we will be  meeting to make our decision. We did not wish to raise this  question until after the European elections. So the dates  initially planned could now be brought forward. I repeat, this  is not a reprisal measure. However, the defeat of Jean-Francois  Deniau the other day was the straw that broke the camel's back.  Enough is enough. In my capacity as the general secretary of  the party, I am the guarantor of the party's unity, but I must  admit, the arguments of those in favor of autonomy have shaken  me.    [Zemmour] Do you have the support of PR Chairman Gerard  Longuet?    [Vasseur] Until the end of last week, Gerard Longuet was in  China and we could not reach him. No final decision has yet  been made. Nor will any such decision be made without the  backing of the party and its president.    [Zemmour] An independent PR group would develop closer ties  with the RPR than it had previously enjoyed. Are we heading for  the open establishment of a dominant RPR-PR axis within the  majority?    [Vasseur] The existence of this independent Republican group  will not prevent the PR from remaining a member of the UDF, just  as the CDS did between 1988 and 1993.    Nonetheless, it is true that we have always been in favor of  a solid union within the majority. In the absence of any  context, the Republican group would be an excellent link between  the RPR and the UDF.    [Zemmour] Nevertheless, the PR was counting on the RPR to a  great extent to reject Dominique Baudis as the majority's top  candidate. Are you disappointed by the choice made by the RPR?    [Vasseur] Even if the RPR had rejected Dominique Baudis,  Jean-Francois Deniau could not have found himself back in the  saddle. However, it is true that many members of the PR had  hoped that a refusal by the RPR to ratify the decision made by  the political leadership of the UDF would enable a third man to  emerge. The RPR made the choice that we now know. I repeat,  Dominique Baudis can count on the support of the Republican  Party.</p>

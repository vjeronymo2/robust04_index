			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Japanese MPs find the status quo has a certain appeal: Preview of party talks on electoral reform provoked by earlier scandals AFTER a year of scandal-prompted promises to reform Japanese politics and haggling between government and opposition parties over the shape of that reform, the head of a parliamentary reform committee has sagely concluded that 'the best compromise is to keep the current system'. The fate of reform will be partly determined today at a 'summit' of Japan's opposition parties, very willing to discuss radical changes to the country's tainted electoral system, but unwilling to accept a new system reducing their influence and, in particular, threatening present MPs with unemployment. Reaching a political consensus is a refined form of theatre in Japan. Principles are paraded on stage and the lines are delivered with such conviction that the casual spectator gets the impression that Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, and other members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party are genuinely intending to dismantle the system that sustains them. The urgency surrounding the political reform debate, and the theatre of politics, was of Italianate proportions three months ago. The 'don' of Japanese politics, Mr Shin Kanemaru, was indicted for tax evasion, and prosecutors found a list drafted by construction companies rating politicians from A+ to D, according to their clout - the sort of list that causes more embarrassment if your name is left off. As with so many scandals, the prosecutors' office controlled the flow of controversy-stirring evidence, leaked strategically to the Japanese media, whose reports angered the public and forced Mr Miyazawa to devote his term in office to 'the cause of political reform'. In highlighting the cosy links between construction companies, politicians and public works contracts, the prosecutors confirmed what most Japanese suspected. The evidence suggests that a small percentage of many public works contracts is essentially regarded as a LDP donation by the bid-winning, and sometimes bid-rigging, construction company. The prosecutors had tapped a rich vein of scandals by raiding the offices of construction companies. Mr Kanemaru was not the only Japanese politician to have accepted funds from the construction industry, whose level of entertainment expenses, about Y8 (4 pence) per Y1,000 of sales, is the highest of all Japanese industries. Having made the point about bid-rigging and having made an example of Mr Kanemaru, who suffered the indignity of being refused admission by Tokyo hospitals for a check-up after his release on Y300m bail, the prosecutors retreated. Construction executives ceremonially apologised and promised never to rig bids again, and the reform debate rambled off course. That does not mean Japanese think the need for reform has passed, but the flow of prosecutor-leaked headlines has dried up, and Mr Miyazawa is under no immediate pressure to respond to allegations. An annual survey by the prime minister's office released last month found that 70.1 per cent of 10,000 respondents thought public opinion was not properly reflected in national politics. About 81 per cent of those aged between 30 and 34 said their opinions were not reflected. Another poll found that 10 per cent of voters support the Japan New Party, a recently-formed reformist group. The largest opposition party, the Social Democratic Party of Japan recorded only 9.2 per cent in the same poll, down 3.7 per cent on the previous month, while other opposition parties, including Komeito (the Clean Government Party) and the Democratic Socialist Party, had their ratings trimmed. These parties have a chance today to improve their popularity by reaching agreement on a new electoral system. The LDP is proposing single-seat constituencies, which would ensure it a hefty majority, while opposition parties can't agree on a mix of proportional representation and single-seats. Compromise proposals suggested by the LDP have a touch of the absurd. An LDP reformist group suggests that a blend of proportional representation and single-seats be concocted to ensure that each party has an unchanged number of MPs. Another LDP suggestion is that the lower house, which is more powerful, be single-seat and the upper house be proportional, an idea rejected by the opposition. The emphasis on changing the electoral system is a recognition that the present multi-seat constituencies system encourages scandal by stimulating the fund raising competition among the LDP's factions. Meanwhile, the Social Democratic Party is habitually unable to select more than one candidate, condemning itself to eternal opposition, as sitting members fear that running two candidates will split the party's already small vote. Professor Rei Shiratori, dean of political science at Tokai University, is certain that the government and opposition will not reach a consensus this year: 'It is totally impossible for change to happen this time around. There must be a general election before February, and the parties are already choosing their candidates. They don't really want change.' The prospect of nothing happening challenges a breakaway LDP faction formed by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance minister, and Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the former LDP secretary-general and famed fixer, who threatened to form a new party if Mr Miyazawa does not proceed with reform. It is possible that the faction, in co-operation with opposition parties, could win a no-confidence vote in the parliament and force a general election. But it is also possible that the faction would be badly bruised at the polls, as Mr Ozawa is popularly seen as close to the fallen Mr Kanemaru and is having difficulty raising the cash for an election campaign. Even the LDP's most ardent reformers are reluctant to discard the security of the system that made them.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Splittail are adapted for life in the entrapment zone. Estuaries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are ecosystems where the entrapment zone and salinity levels are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by the interaction of river outflow and tidal action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Splittail are most abundant in the shallow waters of Suisun Bay, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is historically associated with the entrapment zone. The young of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species require high zooplankton densities produced by the entrapment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zone environment. The best survival and growth of splittail occurs when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the entrapment zone occupies a large geographic area with extensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shoal regions within the euphotic zone (depths less than 4 meters).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fall mid-water trawl survey data collected by CDFG indicate that 76  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the splittail captured from 1967 to 1992 in the Delta were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken in the shallow areas of Suisun and Grizzly Bays (Meng 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During periods of drought and increased water diversions, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entrapment zone and associated fish populations are shifted farther  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upstream in the Estuary. During years prior to 1984, the entrapment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zone was located in Suisun Bay from October through March (except in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months with exceptionally high outflows or during years of extreme  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drought). From April through September, the entrapment zone usually was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found upstream in the river channels. Since 1984, with the exception of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the record 1986 flood outflows, the entrapment zone has been located  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primarily in the river channels during the entire year because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drought and increased water exports and diversions. When located  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upstream, the entrapment zone is confined to deep river channels where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the total surface area is smaller, fewer shoal areas of suitable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spawning substrate exist, water currents are swifter and more turbulent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and zooplankton productivity is low. In all respects, the upstream  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> river channels are much less favorable for spawning and rearing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> splittail. Splittail declines since 1984 have been concurrent with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing amount and proportion of freshwater diversions that confine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the entrapment zone to the narrow, deep, and less productive channels in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the lower rivers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Educational Purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This factor is not known to be applicable. Some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientific collecting is conducted for splittail, but these activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not adversely affect this species. Little or no recreational harvest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of splittail is likely occurring because the population has dramatically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> declined, and it is not a desirable game species. No recent records of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> splittail harvest exist, probably because little or no harvest occurs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the identification of this species is often confused with other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nongame species. No other recreational or educational uses of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species exist that may affect its abundance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Disease or Predation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This factor is not known to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable. However, if the non-native striped bass populations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase, all size classes of splittail could be under greater threat of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predation. An effort by CDFG is under way to compensate for striped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bass population mortalities caused by water export projects. The 1991  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> striped bass stock was low relative to the population in the 1960s.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Previously, the striped bass compensation program annually released 1 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2 million juvenile, hatchery-reared striped bass in the Estuary in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effort to rebuild the population. However, for the last 2 years, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Director of CDFG has foregone release of striped bass because of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential harm they would cause to the federally-threatened Sacramento  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> River winter-run chinook salmon and delta smelt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory mechanisms currently in effect do not provide adequate protection for the splittail or its habitat. This species is not listed by the State of California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

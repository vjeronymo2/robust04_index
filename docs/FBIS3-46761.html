The  figure represents an average of only 1.5 metric tons of paddy  per hectare.    With a population of 245,000, the province will face rice  shortages possibly from four to five months. Those living in  mountainous areas, especially in Ta-oi and Sa-moi Districts,  will face a rice shortage for about 10 months.    Agricultural service officials reported that the 1993  provincial paddy production is low at 48 percent less than that  of 1992, with natural disasters being blamed as its major cause.  Severe drought during the production season damaged about 5,300  hectares of lowland and highland rice growing areas.    Following such low rice production, the local provincial  administration have encouraged people to grow dry season cash  crops and dry season rice on 169 hectares. The areas with  favorable conditions for these crops include 100 hectares in  Ta-oi District, 31 in Saravane District, 27 in Khong Sedone  District, and 11 in Vapi District. Farmers in areas without  favorable conditions, or without irrigation, have been  encouraged to raise as many chicken, cows, and other animals as  they can to compensate for losses resulting from low production.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FORM SHOWS MENENDEZES' FRIEND BOUGHT  SHOTGUNS  </P> <P> Two days before the savage slayings of entertainment executive Jose Menendez  and his wife, Kitty, last August in Beverly Hills, two shotguns were purchased  from a San Diego sporting goods store by a young man who identified himself as  Donovan Jay Goodreau, a former Princeton roommate of the victims' son, Lyle.  </P> <P> According to a federal firearms transaction form released Wednesday, a person  identifying himself as Goodreau paid cash for two 12-gauge Mossbergs, costing  $213.99 each, at a Big 5 store Aug. 18.  </P> <P> Authorities say this type of gun was used in the killings Aug. 20, but the  murder weapons have not been found.  </P> <P> Lawyers for Lyle Menendez and his brother, Erik, who are charged with the  murders, had tried to block the document's release. Authorities are still  seeking to identify the signature on the form.  </P> <P> Goodreau, who could not be reached for comment, reportedly maintains that his  driver's license -- used for identification -- was stolen and that he was not  in California at the time.  </P></p>

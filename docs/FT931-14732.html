			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Tie Rack forecasts sharp advance THE SHARE price of Tie Rack, the tie and fashion accessories retailer, rose 11p to 83p yesterday after the company said its annual profits would be significantly ahead of market expectations. Stronger sales in the run-up to Christmas meant that total turnover for the year to January 31 was likely to be 20 per cent up on last year's Pounds 54.6m. Tie Rack said pre-tax profits for the year would easily exceed the Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 3.5m range forecast by sector analysts last September, when it announced interim profits of Pounds 301,000. Sales growth in December, accounting for up to a quarter of annual turnover, was 2.5 per cent ahead of 1991 figures. However, Mr Nigel McGinley, chief executive, sounded a note of caution, warning: 'The economic climate is uncertain and consumer confidence is still low'. Ms Joan D'Olier, at County NatWest, who in September forecast a Pounds 2.9m profit, said she now expected Pounds 4.3m, while Mr Michael Holmes, at BZW - Tie Rack's broker - predicted Pounds 4.5m. Both anticipated earnings per share of at least 5p with a 1p dividend. The forecasts compare with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.03m last year, when earnings per share were 1.99p and the dividend 0.5p. Further improvements in trading performance, however, have been undermined by losses in the company's US operation and slowing sales at its French outlets. Franchises in Norway and The Republic of Ireland had also been disappointing, Mr McGinley said. Mr Holmes added: 'They are trying to reduce losses in the US, where they are running non-profitable shops on five-year leases.' The company could also be hit by larger than expected tax charges, according to Ms D'Olier. Earnings in high tax countries and on UK capital investments, which were ineligible for tax relief, could leave it facing a tax rate of more than 39 per cent.</p>

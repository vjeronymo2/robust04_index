			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/ TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> SPACE STATION BUDGET CUTS CRITICIZED BY SYMPOSIUM MEMBERS  </P> <P> Congress' decision to cut the budget of space station Freedom isn't very  popular in the aerospace community, judging from comments at a symposium  Saturday that addressed aspects of the $37-billion project.  </P> <P> Congress cut the space station budget from $2.45 billion to $1.9 billion for  the current year and ordered NASA to submit a redesigned station by the end of  January.  </P> <P> Charles (Pete) Conrad Jr., a former Gemini and Apollo astronaut who is now a  staff vice president for new business at McDonnell Douglas Space Systems in  Huntington Beach, said the mandate to redesign the space station is "a bunch of  junk."  </P> <P> "I like to say the future is running a little late," Conrad said, noting that  the NASA budget was cut sharply during the Johnson and Nixon administrations.  "We're 25 years behind schedule and we're about to make it worse. I don't  understand what Congress is up to."  </P> <P> The symposium in Huntington Beach was sponsored by the Los Angeles chapter of  the Human Factors Society, a group involved in efforts to design products and  equipment that suit human needs.  </P> <P> Conrad said the reduced budget could also affect decisions by international  players, such as Japan and the European Space Agency, to continue their  participation in the program.  </P> <P> Other sources at the symposium, which included a tour of McDonnell Douglas'  mock-up of the space station, said a space station redesign would lack the  years of research and billions of dollars already spent on the program.  </P> <P> If NASA goes forward with plans to shorten the 508-foot truss assembly that  serves as the main framework for the station, then McDonnell Douglas could see  an impact on its work force, sources said. McDonnell Douglas is leading a team  of contractors that are building a major portion of the station, including the  truss assembly.  </P> <P> But Tom Williams, a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas, said speculation that the  company could trim its work force is inaccurate. The company expects to  maintain its current employment on the project, he said.  </P> <P> "Our position is we can build a very good space station with $15.7 billion" in  funding through 1996, Williams said.  </P> <P> The company, which employs 2,000 people on the space station in Huntington  Beach and Houston, has frozen its hiring on the program.  </P></p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / International Company News: Hong Kong investors sell News Corp stake for Dollars 288m HUTCHISON Whampoa and the Li family have sold their holding in News Corporation for USDollars 288.4m, less than three weeks after the shares were received as part-payment for the sale of 64 per cent of Star Television. The Hong Kong investors made a profit of 10 per cent on the 6.27m News Corp American Depositary Receipts, which were sold at Dollars 46 each. The placement represented half of the proceeds from the Dollars 525m sale of the Asian satellite broadcaster. The transaction had been expected, since News Corp shares have performed strongly following the Star deal and represent a low-yielding investment with a potential currency risk. Hutchison has now raised HKDollars 2.15bn (USDollars 277m) in cash from its investment in Star, which will help fund the group's ambitious foray into UK telecommunications. Around HKDollars 1.5bn of the proceeds will be taken as an extraordinary profit, and will help offset expected provisions against Hutchison's Rabbit UK cordless telephone network. The Hutchison share price rose 80 cents to HKDollars 22.40 yesterday. Mr Adrian Faure, research director at Baring Securities, said: 'This is positive news. It adds HKDollars 100m to the bottom line from a trading profit, and Hutchison has now received all of the cash from the transaction.' Hutchison and the Li family remain partners with News Corp through their remaining 36 per cent stake in Star. They have said this will be retained as a long-term investment.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: They said . . . 'You have enormous power and influence over these proceedings, and as we struggle to understand the meaning of the treaty, the very raising - or even the half-raising - of your eyebrow will cause the government to jitter with fear.' Nicholas Budgen, Tory Euro-sceptic MP to Michael Morris, deputy speaker, December 1 1992 'So we have begun at last.' Sir Russell Johnston, Liberal Democrat spokesman on Europe, after 1 1/2 hours of points of order at beginning of committee stage, December 1 1992 Sir Russell Johnston: 'Few matters are discussed more often in my constituency than the acquis communautaire. Asking me to translate it is rather like asking me to give the English for 'spaghetti' or 'blitzkreig'.' Dennis Skinner (Lab, Bolsover): 'Or 'bullshit'.' Sir Russell: 'No, that is a different matter with which the hon. gentleman is deeply familiar.' December 1 1992 'Logically, if the union had already been established, as article A, paragraph 1 says that it has, the process of creating an ever closer union is superfluous as one cannot get closer than union itself. The process has reached its conclusion with the establishment of the union, which means that the process has ceased, although the second paragraph suggests that there is some way still to go. That raises the next question: is the European union of article A, paragraph 1, the 'ever closer union among the peoples of Europe' aimed at under earlier treaties and continued by article A, paragraph 2, of the treaty?' Bill Cash, Tory Euro-sceptic, December 1 1992 'The monumental and excessive windbaggery of the hon. member for Stafford (Mr Cash) may have allowed word to get out from the chamber that there is something marginally tedious about our proceedings on the bill.' Charles Kennedy, January 19 1993 'Is not the real point that the Maastricht treaty establishes not a federation but a union, a superstate, which has not yet been revealed in its full concept to the British people?' Bryan Gould, Labour Euro-sceptic. March 4 1993 'I cannot imagine a more feeble and foolish posture.' Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, addressing Euro-sceptics. March 11 1993 'Would it be possible - this is a question for you, Mr Morris - given that we seek to reject the amendment in order to prevent the artificial delay of the bill, for a further debate to take place on the matter before the division is called?' Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister, as the government faced defeat over a Labour amendment. March 8 1993 'No.' Michael Morris, deputy speaker, in reply.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Valery Giscard d'Estaing, president </F> of the French Democratic Union, by Franz-Olivier Giesbert --  live]    [Excerpts] [Giesbert] Now a word about Rwanda and the  French operation or this humanitarian invasion, as Info Matin  calls it -- is it a good thing?    [Giscard] [passage omitted] I think we have to look very  carefully at this operation, which poses problems, because it is  not a United Nations action, it is a national action being  carried out by France. [passage omitted] Our mission is thus in  fact a humanitarian mission, but one which must be temporary and  extremely cautious, because Africa has responsibility for the  situation, not Europe, much less France. [passage omitted]    It is a mission which has a chance only if it is strictly  humanitarian and above all temporary, and its objective is to  wait for the planned arrival of UN forces, which may arrive  late. So, you see, it is an operation which must be carried out  very carefully. The French forces must remain close to the  border and must not penetrate into the interior of the country.  Their mission is to protect groups of men, women, and clergy  against the threat of massacre. It is not to take part in the  fighting inside Rwanda.</p>

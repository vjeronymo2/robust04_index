			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Military statement No. 22, issued by the Ministry of </F> Defense; place and date not given]    [Text] For the 22d consecutive day our brave forces  continued their heroic resistance [words indistinct] and with an  unyielding and uncrushable will to the human shields and the  barbaric war machine which the criminal gang of the al-Ahmar  family has plunged toward the former [word indistinct] border  regions.    The comeback actions which our defending forces have reached  last night and today morning in the orientation of Karish,  al-Dali and Abyan were characterized by the decisiveness and the  [word indistinct] and strong defense on all fighting fronts.  Meanwhile, the hostile forces continued their retreat and  surrender. In Karish frontline more than 1,500 officers and  soldiers from the forces which the gang of the al-Ahmar family  has plunged in this direction surrendered themselves to our  forces yesterday, on the one hand after their strength was  exhausted and on the other after they discovered how false were  the claims of legality which this treacherous and [word  indistinct] gang gives a big-mouthed talk about it.    On another level, our hero citizens in Radfan District were  able to destroy a number of tanks which tried to sneak toward  al-Habilayn. With close struggle and coherence with the  citizens and volunteers who came from various governorates, our  brave forces continued chasing the remnants of the forces of the  al-Ahmar family in all directions.    The Ministry of Defense, which feels [word indistinct]  confident of the ability of our courageous Armed Forces,  supported materially and morally by the masses of dignified  people of inflicting defeat following defeat on the gang of  treachery and treason, would like to affirm to the masses of our  people and the Arab and world public opinion that there is not  even a grain of truth in the allegations and claims fabricated  by the information sections of the bloody gang of the al-Ahmar  family, which the listeners were told about illusionary  victories in this (?connotation). Our forces, which foiled all  the attempts of the forces of the al-Ahmar family and stopped  their attempts after inflicting (?total flight) to them, are  also able of coming forward decisively and [word indistinct] and  strong defense and inflicting decisive punishments on the  adventurist aggressions anywhere.</p>

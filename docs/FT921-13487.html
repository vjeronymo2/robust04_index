			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Franchise refusal was 'irrational', TSW tells court TELEVISION South West, the commercial TV company that lost its broadcasting licence for south-west England in last October's auction of ITV franchises, yesterday asked the Appeal Court to quash the decision to award the licence to Westcountry TV. Mr Gordon Pollock QC, for TSW, said the rejection of the company's business plan by the Independent Television Commission was irrational. The court heard that the ITC rejected the TSW plan after describing its forecast of annual growth in national net advertising revenue (NAR) over the 10-year licence period as 'incredible, implausible and very optimistic'. The decision was so irrational that it should be quashed and the licence awarded to TSW, Mr Pollock said. Westcountry bid Pounds 7.8m against TSW's bid of Pounds 16.1m. The main issue concerned the variance between TSW's forecast of annual growth in advertising revenue over the licence period and that of the ITC, Mr Pollock added. TSW had forecast 5.3 per cent growth in revenue. The ITC had taken a figure of 4 per cent - an average of all the forecasts by all the applicants for the 16 franchise areas. For the ITC, Professor Alan Budd, an independent expert, had forecast 5.6 per cent. TSW's experts, NERA, the economic consultants, had forecast 5.5 per cent growth, and KPMG, the management consultants relied on by Westcountry, said any forecast between 4 per cent and 6.2 per cent would be acceptable. Had TSW known in advance that the ITC would choose the average 4 per cent forecast as the test then its bid and its business plan would have been entirely different, Mr Pollock said. The 4 per cent test had the inevitable effect of destroying the basis on which it had calculated its Pounds 16.1m bid. The ITC did not object to TSW's prediction of Channel 3's share of advertising revenue, nor to its prediction of TSW's share of that. The ITC's complaint related to TSW's assessment of national revenue. But in asking applicants to look into the future it was inevitable that they would come up with a range of forecasts. It was impossible to say that one forecast was correct or even to say whether one forecast was more or less likely to be reliable, Mr Pollock said. All that could safely be said was that there was a 'credible, realistic range'. TSW's forecasts were 'well-considered, consistent and credible'. The ITC's approach was 'wholly unsustainable', he said. 'It is extraordinary that our NAR figures were characterised as 'incredible' when their own expert said annual growth in NAR would be 0.3 per cent higher.' Mr Pollock said the evidence showed that the ITC had simply failed to read TSW's application properly. 'It is not a very difficult application, but their approach was thoroughly shoddy, incompetent and unprofessional,' he said. The hearing continues today.</p>

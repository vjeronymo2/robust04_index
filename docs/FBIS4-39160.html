			<p>BFN     [Text] An extended session of the military collegium of  Ukraine's Ministry of Defense took place on 3 June. Our  free-lance military correspondent reports:    [Correspondent] The combat training of Ukraine's Armed  Forces  during the winter training period was summed up at the session  under the chairmanship of Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy,  minister of defense. The main conclusion drawn at the collegium  was that the troops had achieved a high level of discipline and  combat capability during the winter period. This allows one to  efficiently fulfill the main task of Ukraine's Armed Forces: to  defend the state's sovereignty and territorial integrity.    At this session of the military collegium, the minister of  defense set tasks for the summer training period and outlined  the set of issues that it is necessary to resolve urgently.  Among them are the tasks of establishing strong statutory order  and military discipline in the units and subunits and to prevent  injuries and noncombat losses among personnel. Commanders at  all levels should pay great attention to the storage and  operation of hardware and armaments and to the precise  organization of mobilization work.    Radetskyy stressed that resolute and urgent actions would  continue to be used in relation to officials who abuse their  official position and have an indifferent attitude to the theft  of military property and other illegal actions by servicemen.</p>

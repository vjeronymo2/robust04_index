			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Vymura bought by management for Pounds 15.5m VYMURA International, which makes vinyl-covered wallpapers in Greater Manchester, has been bought by its management for Pounds 15.5m. The buy-out secures 360 jobs because four rival bidders would probably have rationalised production had any outbid the management team. The company, which as Western Hyde Products developed the first stripable vinyl wallpaper 30 years ago, was owned by European Vinyls Corporation, a Brussels-based joint venture between ICI and Enichem of Italy. With sales of Pounds 30m, Vymura was not big enough to be of strategic significance to EVC. Barclays Development Capital provided Pounds 5.5m of equity for the deal, with the balance from Midland Bank as long-term loan and overdraft.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by President Ion Iliescu at the opening of a </F> joint news conference with Republic of Serbia President Slobodan  Milosevic in Bucharest on 5 April -- recorded]    [Text] We have hailed the presence of President Milosevic  in the context of the good and traditional relations that are  prevailing between our countries. In the past four years since  the December 1989 revolution, there have been numerous contacts  between us. President Slobodan Milosevic is visiting Romania  for the second time. He visited Romania in 1992 and I have  visited Belgrade twice in this period. Our relations have a  longstanding tradition and are positive from every point of  view. Throughout history, including the more recent history,  Serbia and Yugoslavia have been Romania's best neighbors. We  have never had conflicts or any type of dissensions. There have  always been feelings of friendship and solidarity in relations  between our peoples. These relations continued to develop after  the December 1989 revolution and the economic relations between  our countries also registered an upward course until the  establishment of the embargo.    First of all, we followed with great concern and awareness  the tragedy that people in the former Yugoslavia and in the  republics which have emerged in Yugoslavia had to face and are  still facing today. We believe that it is a real tragedy that  our neighbor has had to face and this human tragedy still  continues. We have always believed that the only solution is to  find ways out from the state of conflict solely through  political and peaceful means. The way of force, of military  conflict, or of taking measures such as the embargo -- which is  also a measure of force -- are not meant to ease actions of  finding solutions to the problem. On the contrary. The  situation in Yugoslavia has just confirmed this.    Therefore, we have hailed all elements of realism that have  appeared in the meantime and that are aimed at supporting the  efforts made by internal forces, which are directly interested  and are the only ones able to find the best ways to solve this  conflict.    During our talks, we tried to find out in what way the  leadership of Serbia regards the evolution of the situation in  Yugoslavia, including the conflict in Bosnia, and the effort  made to find political and peaceful solutions to problems.    We have also discussed bilateral relations and preparations  made by the two sides for the period that will follow the  lifting of the embargo, because we believe that, in the  situation that has been created today in the area of the former  Yugoslavia, the lifting of the embargo is an important element  in the process of creating premises for finding peaceful  solutions to the conflict.    We also expressed the belief that we should be prepared, so  that immediately after the lifting of the embargo we should be  able to resume normal relations in the economic area and be able  to diversify and revive these relations.    In 1992, until the embargo was imposed, for five months the  volume of exchanges between our countries reached over $260  million. We estimate that after the lifting of the embargo we  will be able to reach easily a volume of $1 billion in our  bilateral relations, even as early as the first year after the  embargo. Likewise, we believe that the positive relations  between our countries, under conditions of peace in the region  of former Yugoslavia, will be a stabilizing, positive, and  constructive factor in our efforts to develop dynamic economic  relations in our area, with all the new states that have been  formed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and with  Bulgaria, Greece, and the other neighboring countries in our  region. Thus, we wish to make preparations for such prospects.    In the same spirit we discussed the issue of finalizing the  process of drafting the text of a treaty of friendship and  cooperation between our countries, which should be concluded in  the near future and should be signed at an appropriate time,  within a framework that we are going to establish mutually.    Hence, we believe that the visit paid by President Slobodan  Milosevic to our country and the talks we have held represent a  significant political element for the relations between our  countries and a constructive factor in the joint efforts aimed  at promoting a climate that is favorable for the normalization  and development of a political climate in this region of joint  interest.</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BONDHOLDERS GET SHARE IN TENTATIVE LINCOLN S&amp;L PACT  </P> <P> Bondholders of bankrupt American Continental Corp. would recover a small  portion of their investments under a tentative, $21-million agreement between  the company's creditors and the federal government.  </P> <P> The two sides also agreed to seek court approval to liquidate the Phoenix  company and oust its controversial chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr. American  Continental, now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, is the parent of the failed Lincoln  Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine.  </P> <P> Under the agreement announced in U.S. District Court in Phoenix on Friday, much  of the $21 million would go toward providing 22,000 mostly elderly bondholders  with at least partial repayment of the $200 million they invested. They would  have a chance to recover more if the court approved the liquidation.  </P> <P> A representative for Keating said the executive plans to resign as American  Continental's chairman and chief executive next week to head a court-approved  shareholders committee, which will take part in the bankruptcy court  negotiations over the company's fate.  </P> <P> The actions are strategic moves in the high-stakes contest between federal  regulators and Keating over assets of American Continental.  </P> <P> The agreement would settle significant differences between creditors and the  Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency operating Lincoln. It also gives  the agency rights that will help it move faster and more easily against  Keating.  </P> <P> Regulators hold Lincoln up as the epitome of everything that has gone wrong in  the thrift industry. They estimate that the S&amp;L will cost taxpayers $2  billion, one of the costliest thrift cleanups in the nation. Federal  authorities have launched an all-out attack on Keating through a series of  criminal investigations and a $1.1-billion racketeering suit against him and  his top executives. Keating denies any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> Details of the agreement have not been worked out but are expected to be  announced by next Friday, when the unsecured creditors committee has said it  will file its reorganization plan. American Continental's bankruptcy is the  fifth-largest in U.S. history.  </P> <P> The pact provides that American Continental's "estate will be liquidated and  that those proceeds will be distributed first to the creditors," said Michael  Manning, a Phoenix lawyer for Resolution Trust. The creditors and the  government would also seek the removal of Keating and all top American  Continental executives. They would be replaced by a new, independent  management, Manning said.  </P> <P> The agreement in principle was announced in U.S. District Court in Phoenix and  came as a surprise to Keating and his associates, who knew only that the  creditors committee and the government agency had been talking for the past two  months.  </P> <P> "RTC has simply refused to negotiate with us," said James J. Feder, a Los  Angeles lawyer for American Continental. "It's too big a cause celebre for them  to do a settlement with us. They've made Lincoln and Keating their major  target."  </P> <P> He said the agreement "settles nothing" because the company must be involved in  the final negotiating process and the court must approve any plan. American  Continental has had an outline of a reorganization plan pending since last June  but has not pursued it.  </P> <P> Feder said Keating will probably resign next week as American Continental's  chairman to head up a shareholders committee, the formation of which was  approved Friday by District Court Judge Richard M. Bilby. The committee will  take part in negotiations on a reorganization plan to be presented to Bilby for  his approval, Feder said.  </P> <P> The agreement between the creditors and the government does not affect three  other legal areas: the racketeering lawsuit against Keating and others,  American Continental's challenge of last year's federal takeover of Lincoln and  the lawsuits filed against Keating and others by holders of American  Continental's debt securities.  </P> <P> Those bondholders make up the bulk of the company's creditors and would benefit  most under the agreement. Although the bondholders' payment hasn't been  determined yet, lawyers in the case said talks have put the figure at about $14  million, or nearly 7 cents on the dollar. The other $7 million would go to  other creditors.  </P> <P> The bondholders are mostly elderly Lincoln depositors who were persuaded to buy  nearly $200 million of the parent company's debt securities at the S&amp;L's 29  Southern California branches.  </P></p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Barclays Bank falls 30% to Pounds 533m: Pounds 96m withdrawn from reserves to pay unchanged dividend of 21.2p BARCLAYS yesterday ceded the title of the UK's most profitable bank to Lloyds Bank, when it disclosed that profits in 1991 had fallen 30 per cent to Pounds 533m. Like its rivals, Barclays has been hurt by record losses on UK loans. It made a provision of Pounds 1.76bn, up from Pounds 1.3bn the previous year, to cover the risk of losses on loans. The recession also caused a sharp increase in losses due to fraud, according to Mr Peter Wood, Barclays finance director. Credit card fraud resulted in losses of around Pounds 30m. The fall in profits meant Barclays was forced to withdraw Pounds 96m from reserves to meet the Pounds 338m cost of its dividend, which was 21.2p a share, unchanged from the previous year. 'This is the first time that Barclays has been unable to finance its dividend from profits', said Mr Wood. Mr Wood said there had been long debates among Barclays' directors about whether the dividend should have been cut. Like its rivals, Barclays has been cutting its workforce to reduce running costs. Sir John Quinton, the chairman, said staff numbers had been reduced by more than 5,000 in 1991 and that 'thousands' more employees were to go in the current year. The bulk of Barclays' bad debt charge stemmed from the financial difficulties of small companies and individuals. Sir John said it was worrying that a sharply rising number of older established companies - which had been 'sound banking propositions' - were running into difficulties. It was not simply young, fragile businesses which were collapsing, he said. 'Bad debts are likely to remain at a high level this year', he said. But he added that there were 'faint' signs of an improvement. He said that the bank was retraining lending staff to try to prevent a repetition of the loan losses. He also said that the bank would no longer lend to the smallest most fragile businesses. But he stressed that Barclays would continue to lend to sound businesses and would not deliberately contribute to a 'credit crunch' which would hold back recovery in the UK economy. However, he admitted there was a risk that individual managers, chastened by bad debt charges of last year, might be wary of lending, even to sound customers.

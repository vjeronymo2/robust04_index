			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Soaring inflation likely to stop China freeing prices Continuing inflation of more than 20 per cent is likely to forestall further price liberalisation in China during the first part of 1995, a government statistics official suggested yesterday. The State Statistical Bureau, China's chief economic monitor, reported that 11.8 per cent growth in gross domestic product in 1994 lifted retail prices 21.7 per cent and the consumer price index by 24.2 per cent for the year. That inflationary increase is more than double the government's target of 10 per cent for 1994. Mr Ye Zhen, the bureau spokesman, said China's GDP was Yn4,300bn (Pounds 328.5bn) in 1994, the first time national domestic output has crossed the Yn4,000bn threshold. The blazing growth rate substantially overshoots the government's goal of 9 per cent, set in a bid to cool inflation. In a reversal of a slight downward price trend recorded in November, the spokesman forecast that inflation would continue to rage into early 1995. He said it would begin to slow as control measures took effect and would eventually show a 'big decrease' for the full year. He declined to provide an inflation target for 1995. This year, the Chinese economy suffered from 'excessive price rises', Mr Ye said, as well as reduced grain output and mounting subsidies for state-owned enterprises. He admitted the 1994 inflation target was unrealistic because statistics officials underestimated the impact of the lifting of price controls and had not anticipated the effects of floods and drought that reduced grain production by 2.5 per cent. But even such setbacks were not enough to destabilise supply and demand as the agriculture sector grew 3.5 per cent in 1994. The government, reluctant to close thousands of loss-ridden state enterprises because of fears of mass unemployment and worker unrest, reported that these companies' losses as reflected in the state budget jumped 27.6 per cent last month. Industrial output was reported to have surged by 18 per cent in 1994. With state industry and pricing reform stalled by economic and political uncertainty, western analysts predict the bleak inflation outlook will not improve soon, since the government seems ready to tolerate continued subsidies to state-owned factories and sharply higher food prices to placate struggling farmers. With almost 200m rural Chinese in migratory flux between the countryside and cities 'the government can ill-afford a greater flood to the cities where there are no jobs for the existing workers, let alone newcomers,' said a western economist. A long commentary by the New China News Agency said over 40 large Chinese cities reinstated controls this year to stop price exploitation and profiteering. Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and other cities reported rises in food prices ranging from 27 to 30 per cent in November. The news agency said: 'Macro-economic control will continue to play an important part in the country's price control campaign'. China, meanwhile, registered a Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) trade surplus, the first in three years. Exports rose 30 per cent to Dollars 120bn against a 10 per cent increase in imports to Dollars 115bn. At the end of November, foreign exchange reserves stood at Dollars 48.9bn compared to Dollars 21.2bn at the end of 1993. China expects more than a doubling of reserves for all of 1994.</p>

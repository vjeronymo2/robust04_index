			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> The telecast of "Why, Charlie Brown, Why?" was certainly television at its  finest.  </P> <P> Instead of the usual frivolous and silly things for children, here was a  half-hour of sensitivity and information done with the ever-popular Peanuts  gang. Any family with a seriously ill child must be very grateful for this  wonderful way to teach children, and all of us, not to shut out the sick.  Congratulations to Charles M. Schulz, the CBS network, the sponsors and the  medical advisers. We are all better for their caring efforts.  </P> <P> Pat Locher, Chatsworth  </P></p>

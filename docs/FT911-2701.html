			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / UN accord likely over W Sahara referendum A SOLUTION to the conflict over the status of the former Spanish colony of Western Sahara, which has pitted Morocco against the Polisario Liberation Front, appears to be in sight, reports Francis Ghiles. The UN Security Council is expected to agree today to proposals for a referendum, drawn up by Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, secretary-general. Both parties to the conflict - especially, it seems, Polisario and its main ally Algeria - have made recent concessions. Under the plan, Morocco would cut its troops by two thirds, to 65,000, within 11 weeks of a ceasefire. All remaining Moroccan troops would be confined to defensive positions along the protective wall Morocco has built to defend itself from Polisario guerrilla attacks. Polisario's estimated 7,000 fighters would also be confined to camps around the main refugee centre south of Tindouf, in south western Algeria. The existing Moroccan administration will however remain, contrary to Polisario's initial wishes. Considerations of cost strongly militated against the UN a wholesale takeover of taking over the administration of the territory by the UN before during the run-up to a referendum. An election commission would decide who is eligible to vote in the referendum. To those names included in the census conducted by the former colonial power just before it relinquished control of the territory and which estimated the Saharawi population to be just short of 74,000 would be added people from the Sidi Ifni region which Spain returned to Morocco in 1969 and those born in Morocco, Algeria and Mauritania who could bring proof of the Saharan origin. That, ironically enough includes the Polisario leader, Mohammed Abdelaziz, who was born in Marrakesh and whose father still lives there. King Hassan has accepted the idea of a referendum but made it clear that the result could only 'ratify' what most Moroccans strongly feel is theirs historically. His prestige would suffer a considerable blow were the outcome of the vote to be a call for independence. His opposition, frustrated by having no share in running Morocco, has systematically been more 'royaliste que le roi.' Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid for his part has gone to great lengths to rebuild links with Algeria's his eastern neighbour, notably by re-establishing diplomatic ties, broken off in 1976, three years ago. But the outcome of the first-ever free elections in North Africa, due next July in Algeria, could bring to power people far less willing to compromise. Furthermore, King Hassan and his Algerian counterpart know that the pipeline due to carry natural gas to Spain across northern Morocco and the Straits of Gibraltar will only get the final go-ahead if the two big north African countries settle the status of the Western Sahara once and for all. Finally, were the long festering dispute to be settled, the Maghreb countries would be in a better bargaining position with the EC with whom they share so many links. Instead of engaging in quarrels which leave most Europeans indifferent and buying weapons with money better used in civilian projects, they would for once have shown they were capable of doing something constructive. With turmoil likely to continue in the Middle East, that would at least leave the Maghreb al Aqsa (and of the setting sun) as one part of the Arab world with no major disputes.</p>

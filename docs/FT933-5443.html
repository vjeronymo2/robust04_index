			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Tory constituency heads give Fowler a warm welcome IT IS early days yet. But if yesterday's enthusiastic reception in Manchester and Liverpool is repeated elsewhere, then Sir Norman Fowler's tour of Conservative constituency associations has the makings of a rare central office success. A sprinkling of the 60 or so constituency heads who attended yesterday's two meetings appeared thrilled to bits that the Tory party chairman had taken the trouble to consult them about their views. The only hiccup was the hotter than expected weather. 'It is rather warm up here,' said Mr James Fuke, a regional campaign executive, confiding that those meeting Sir Norman over tea in west Derby had their jackets off and 'none of the ladies are wearing hats'. Sir Norman has earmarked much of the next two weeks for what has been billed as a morale-boosting tour of Tory constituency associations in England and Wales. Part of the purpose is to explain what lies behind the sweeping changes in the party's central organisation that have been set in train over recent months and to explain aspects of strategy ahead of next year's local and European parliamentary elections. But the greater part of the gatherings will be devoted to listening to local grievances after what is acknowledged to have been a tough year for the party. Sir Norman's introductory speech to yesterday's meetings  - in a region where the Tory vote held up well in the last general election - lasted just 15 minutes. Constituency heads yesterday were reluctant to go into the detail of what was discussed but agreed his performance had been impressive. 'We all went away in good heart,' said Mr John Longworth, chairman of the Altrincham and Sale constituency. 'We had an excellent exchange of views both ways.' Ms Lynn Pratt, head of Bury North, said Sir Norman had been 'very willing' to listen to ideas in what was a 'positive, frank and open' discussion. According to Mr Fuke, officials expressed 'a cross-section of views' on whether Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, should impose further tax increases in November as part of the government's drive to reduce the public sector deficit, or concentrate on cutting spending.</p>

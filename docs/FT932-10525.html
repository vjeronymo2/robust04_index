			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Old hand Demirel heads for Turkish presidency TURKEY'S parliament will today vote in the first ballot for the country's presidency, with Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel the leading candidate. But there are signs that the vote may not go all Mr Demirel's way. Seven times prime minister, and twice ousted by the military, the 69-year-old Turkish conservative has been a feature of the political map for almost three decades. There is nonetheless some disappointment that he is taking up what is a largely ceremonial office and leaving the government without strong leadership to face an urgent political and legislative agenda. Mr Demirel's supporters say he deserves the post, and despite opposition criticism, he is expected to be elected, if not on the first ballot then by the third ballot on May 16 - when a straight majority in the 450-member national assembly should be sufficient to secure him the seven-year term as Turkey's head of state. Mr Demirel has pledged to act as a 'constitutional president' although the strong ties he is likely to retain with his True Path party (DYP) means he will still have influence over policy. Among the business community there is also concern that Mr Demirel's instinct will be to interfere in commercial contracts. Inevitably he is being accused of opportunism, a charge he himself levelled at the late president Turgut Ozal, whose death on April 17 created the present crisis. Mr Ozal was accused of using the office for party political purposes. When elected in 1989, the DYP together with its current coalition partner, the Social Democratic Populist party (SHP), boycotted the parliamentary vote. The difference is that Mr Ozal saw his party fortunes flagging and moved to the presidency as a way to continue his radical reform programme. The DYP is under no such threat. Indeed, with Mr Demirel's departure many commentators believe the party could disintegrate, leaving the way open for the Motherland Party (Anap), Turkey's other right-wing party. Mr Demirel's move must raise doubts therefore about the durability of the coalition and the social and political reforms it promised when it came to office in November 1991.</p>

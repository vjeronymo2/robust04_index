			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 31 March -- Commenting on the results of the  first round of elections to Ukraine's Supreme Council and  analyzing the possible influence of the new council on foreign  policy, Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Zlenko noted: "One  would naturally want the future council to be a democratic one.  I have grounds to believe that various polar forces will be  represented in it and, on the one hand, this will reflect the  democratic nature of the council. On the other hand, I think  that each deputy, and the council as a whole, reflects the  essence of his people -- the main bearers of power. Therefore,  both the old and new councils will not be able to radically  change foreign policy. There are factors that determine the  future of our independent state, and any kind of radical  changes in this or that direction will not serve the further  strengthening of our independence and sovereignty. We have a  concept of foreign policy, which has been confirmed by Ukraine's  Supreme Council, but we should all understand that the concept  is a changeable system, which should adapt in accordance with  the relevant realities, but not in a radical manner. I admit  the introduction of adjustments to Ukraine's foreign policy, but  not radical ones, because such changes could have a negative  influence on the attitude of the international community to our  state, and this is then dangerous."</p>

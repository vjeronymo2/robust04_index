			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Rene Haquin: "Rwanda: Nonassistance During </F> Massacre?"]    [Excerpts] Some serious questions are being asked while  reactions increase following the "open letter to our leaders"  from the "Mortier platoon" of Flawinne, to which the 10 blue  helmets massacred in Kigali belonged. The comrades in arms and  the families of the victims are accusing the command of  "nonassistance to persons in danger and a lack of team spirit"  and are casting doubt on "the competence of certain officers."    On Tuesday [26 April], General Charlier replied that "no  element gives reason to believe that the command failed."  [passage omitted]    Did not the Rwandan Prime Minister's escort come under the  UN  mandate? The CGSP [General Directorate for Public Services]  military union asks whether this mandate "explicitly" excluded  the use of force except in cases of legitimate defense and  whether the Belgian Government accepted this without reservation.    Who gave the order to hand over the weapons? Why were they  not assisted? The CGSP asks who made such decisions: The UN  civil or military authorities, Belgian politicians in Brussels  or at the embassy in Kigali, the Chief of Staff in Belgium or  the Belgian command in Kigali? [passage omitted]    Defense Minister Leo Delcroix has stated that the initial  findings of the UN enquiry should be known by mid-May, but that  on the basis of the first elements, there was "no failing of  responsibility at the command level, Lieutenant Lotin and the  UNAMIR [UN Mission in Rwanda] command acted correctly." Leo  Delcroix is of the opinion that any armed intervention should  "take into count the threat which would have been posed to the  two other groups of blue helmets who were also surrounded." (15  at the airport and seven in another area -- editor's note).  [passage omitted]</p>

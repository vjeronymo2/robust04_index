			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ana Fernanda Valderrama from the Gonzalo Jimenez </F> de Quezada Convention Center, site of the Liberal Party  convention, in Santa Fe de Bogota; from the "National Newscast"  -- live relay]    [Text] After being proclaimed the Liberal Party's [PL]  presidential candidate and sole leader, Ernesto Samper Pizano is  ready to officially announce at any moment Humberto de la Calle  Lombana as the PL's vice presidential candidate.    Humberto de la Calle Lombana has repeatedly denied he will  accept this nomination. Nevertheless, within the past few  hours, following extensive consultations within the PL, he has  accepted the nomination. A few minutes before entering this  hall at the Gonzalo Jimenez de Quezada Convention Center, where  the PL convention is being held, Humberto de la Calle Lombana  said he decided to accept the nomination for the sake of the  fatherland and not as a personal challenge. We have prepared a  report on why Humberto de la Calle's acceptance of the  nomination is a key victory for Ernesto Samper Pizano.    [Begin unidentified reporter recording] Humberto de la Calle  holds the key for Samper to become the president of the  Republic. He is at the top of the polls, and he finished second  in the primary. There is no significant opposition to him  within the party, which should guarantee at least 80 percent of  the party's support for a Samper-De La Calle ticket. He comes  from the provinces, which means he can garner regional votes,  and he is associated with the Gaviria government and is  considered to have the utmost integrity. In vain, De la Calle  had struggled to coerce Samper to face him in a public debate,  and he had vowed he would never become a vice presidential  candidate. He is a neoliberal, and, in sharp contrast to  Samper's status quo views, he personifies a political  renaissance.    De la Calle is well-know throughout the country thanks to a  Conservative, Belisario Betancur, who appointed him registrar  during his administration. His other great promoter was Cesar  Gaviria, who appointed him government minister to serve as his  right-hand man in political matters. As minister, he presided  over the National Constituent Assembly, and ironically, as the  presidential designate he led the battle for the creation of the  vice presidency. His work in the assembly groomed him as a PL  presidential hopeful. [end recording]    Humberto de la Calle has just been officially named the vice  presidential candidate on Samper Pizano's presidential ticket,  and the news is being well received. The convention also has  just proclaimed Ernesto Samper as the party's official  presidential candidate and sole leader of the PL. Samper Pizano  is already presenting his platform.    Right now, Ernesto Samper is presenting his economic  proposals. His main issue will be employment. He also says, if  he is elected president, he will appoint a peace commissioner at  the ministerial level. This would mean the elimination of the  Office of the Peace Adviser, as well as the elimination of the  Government Ministry, which would then be called the Ministry of  the Interior and would be placed in charge of developing a  policy to decentralize the state.    Samper Pizano also has voiced full support for the pastoral  work of the bishops of Colombia, who have been seriously  questioned in recent days. He also said he will promote women  into various government posts.    Ernesto Samper Pizano has just announced a very radical  proposal in his peace policy. He says he will wage an all-out  fight against the guerrillas without any negotiations  whatsoever. Likewise, he has announced he is favor of Colombia  ratifying the Second Geneva Protocol, which would include the  guerrillas in reports that pertain to human rights violations.</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Flying into a storm of competitor protest - The fears resulting from BA's acquisition of Dan-Air BRITISH AIRWAYS yesterday sparked off a furious controversy over the future of competition in the UK airline industry by acquiring Dan-Air, the financially troubled Gatwick-based carrier, for a nominal Pounds 1. Smaller UK carriers warned that the deal would severly undermine the government's multi-airline policy, designed to promote competition in the industry, by further strengthening BA's stranglehold of the market. By far the most theatrical reaction came from Mr Richard Branson, the Virgin chairman, who announced he was launching a new short-haul carrier Virgin European Airways to compete against BA. His own rescue proposals for Dan-Air were abandoned ten days ago. He has already applied to the Civil Aviation Authority for licences and slots to fly from London to Paris, Brussels and a number of other European destinations. But Mr Branson said the new venture could only take off 'if the government now reviews competition amongst British airlines and slots at Heathrow and Gatwick which are two of the world's busiest airports'. Echoing calls from all the other UK independent carriers for a detailed investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of the acquisition, Mr Branson said: 'If there is no intervention, then competition will suffer, the consumer will suffer and we will not see a flourishing multi-airline industry.' The other independent carriers with scheduled services, including British Midland and Air UK, have been especially worried by suggestions that the BA deal has already received tacit approval from the authorities anxious to avoid the complete collapse of another UK airline two years after the failure of Air Europe, Dan-Air's former Gatwick competitor. All have called for a MMC investigation and some have already written to the Office of Fair Trading. Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland, said he had already complained to the UK and European Commission authorities. 'A deal like this one simply cannot be waved through,' said Mr Andrew Grey, Air UK's managing director. But Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive, warned yesterday that BA would not go through with the deal if it were forced to give up routes or slots. The deal would also be threatened if it faced long regulatory hurdles. Both Sir Colin and Mr David James, the company doctor who has been running Dan-Air, said the alternative to the BA acquisition would have been bankruptcy. BA is planning to create at Gatwick a new, low cost short haul airline, operating 11 Dan-Air Gatwick routes using 12 Boeing 737 airliners as well as the existing 10 BA Gatwick short-haul routes with 10 Boeing 737s. Eventually they would all be under BA livery. The deal will save about 400 jobs from Dan-Air's present full-time workforce of 2,000, but on lower pay. 'That's better than no job at all', said Sir Colin. In its submission to the OFT, one independent UK carrier notes that the job issue was one of the persuasive arguments in favour of the earlier merger between BA and British Caledonian. But the carrier also argues that the implications of the Dan-Air acquisition are greater than those of the British Caledonian merger. At the time of the Caledonian deal there were at least two airlines at Gatwick, Dan-Air and Air Europe, capable of providing competition against BA. 'Now, so far as European scheduled services are concerned, there is no other competitive force at Gatwick nor is there a prospect that an airline could enter the market in order to provide that force.' BA carried 66.1 per cent of all passengers carried by UK airlines on scheduled services in 1991. At Heathrow it holds 40 per cent of slots, while at Gatwick it holds 15.8 per cent of slots. Dan-Air only has a handful of slots at Heathrow, but it holds about 23 per cent of slots at Gatwick. After the Dan-Air transaction and the restructuring of its own short haul activities at Gatwick, BA expects to operate about 21 per cent of slots at Gatwick. The deal will see the closure of Dan-Air's charter operations. But what especially worries its competitors is the fact that BA will be taking over six important Dan-Air routes to Brussels, Paris, Nice, Rome, Toulouse and Zurich on which Dan-Air was the sole carrier out of Gatwick. BA already serves these routes from Heathrow and the Gatwick operations will further reinforce BA's dominance in the market. For the competitors, the liquidation of Dan-Air would have been preferable. They argue that then there would have been a greater chance that other airlines would enter the market. But this begs the question of why no other carrier stepped in to the rescue. Even the Labour party said yesterday the BA deal 'looks as though it is the best of a bad set of options'. Mr James acknowledged that the short haul business was 'a dog of a market' and the only way it could be financed was under the umbrella of a strong organisation. By passing his patient on to BA, the company doctor yesterday was falling in line with the general trend of consolidation in the European airline industry accelerated by the recession and the advent of liberalisation. 'We did not have the pocket,' he admitted.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- GATWICK MARKET SHARES IN 1991  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Per cent share of passengers carried on scheduled services  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Airline                      Domestic     International     Total  ------------------------------------------------------------------- British Airways                  43.1              77.8      66.1 British Midland                  18.7               5.4       9.9 Air UK                            9.5               3.5       5.5 Dan Air                           6.2               5.3       5.6 Virgin Atlantic                   0.0               4.2       2.8 Other UK carriers                22.4               3.8      10.1  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: CAA  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

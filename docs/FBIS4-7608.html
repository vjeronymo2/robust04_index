			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Bihac region tried to heal its wounds today  after almost two months of the Serb aggressor's offensive.  However, members of Abdic's paramilitary units stepped in to  make up for somewhat lower intensity of attacks launched by  Karadzic's terrorists. The chetniks began by launching an  artillery attack on the defense lines on the Grmusa-Srbljani  plateau on the Bihac part of the front.    Civilians were the victims of this madness again today. A  16-year-old girl was killed by a sniper shot. Abdic's  paramilitary forces, reinforced by their chetnik allies, resumed  their destructive attacks. On this occasion they shelled  industrial facilities in the Cazin municipality belonging to the  meat industry Puran in Pjanici. These facilities were one of  the most important parts of Agrokomerc [food processing company  founded by Abdic] in the Cazin municipality before the war broke  out. The autonomists also attempted infantry breakthroughs in  the Pecigrad area. [passage omitted]</p>

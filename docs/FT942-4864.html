			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Japan's planners upgrade outlook The Japanese government's Economic Planning Agency yesterday slightly upgraded its outlook, saying the economy remained stagnant overall but showed emerging bright spots. The agency's change in tone in its latest monthly report comes a day after the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development upgraded its forecast for the Japanese economy, from 0.5 per cent to a still weak 0.8 per cent growth in gross domestic product this year. Last month, the EPA said the economy was sluggish, in a record 37 months of decline. The OECD and EPA changes reflect the gradual impact of previous governments' four economic stimulation packages, worth Y45,000bn (Pounds 286bn) over 18 months. The EPA highlighted a smaller-than-expected fall in industrial production in May as a bright sign. 'It is too early technically to declare the economy has reached bottom, but my impression is that it has,' said Mr Yoshio Terasawa, EPA director-general. This latest EPA survey adds weight to market expectations that the Bank of Japan's Tankan quarterly study of business confidence, the country's most authoritative indicator of the short-term economic outlook due out on Friday, will show a broad improvement. Recently, the EPA has used more pessimistic language to describe the economic outlook than most private-sector forecasters, yet at the same time stuck to an official forecast of 2.4 per cent GDP growth this year, seen by most private-sector economists as unachievable. But Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, said yesterday the government had to seek to hit the official target by passing this year's budget and implementing steps to stimulate demand, such as the one-year income tax cut agreed by the last government. The budget for the year starting in April, delayed by Japan's internal political wranglings, is expected to clear parliament this month. New stimulus packages or monetary measures will be unnecessary, so long as the budget is passed, said Mr Masaru Hayami, head of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives. Corporate performance should improve by autumn, in line with market forecasts that profits will pick up gently this year, after a four-year decline.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: British Steel It is no surprise that Midland Bank is the best performing FT-SE stock since the election was announced. More curious is that British Steel should rank as high as eighth when it is under dividend warning. In fact the outperformance dates from before the campaign, but there is no sign of recovery in British Steel's markets and first quarter price rises are barely holding. A Labour government would be too constrained financially to be of much help, but the company would find it harder to retrench further in response to the chronic overcapacity in Europe. Perhaps the market is less frightened of the dividend announcement since its worst fears for other companies were overdone. But it would make sense for British Steel to conserve cash by cutting deeply. If the dividend were halved, the yield would fall below 8 per cent.</p>

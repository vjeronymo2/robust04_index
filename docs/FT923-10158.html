			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: T Cowie ahead of offer forecast with 56% rise T COWIE, the car leasing, motor trading, bus and tractor group, announced a 56 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 12.1m in the first half of the year. The figure beat the forecast of not less than Pounds 11.5m Cowie made in its offer document for its Pounds 25m all-paper bid for rival Henlys Group. Cowie's shares rose 4p to 132p, valuing each Henlys share at 66p under the 1-for-2 offer terms. That matches Henlys shares which were unchanged yesterday. Cowie's offer was accepted by only 0.6 per cent of Henlys shareholders at its first closing date. Cowie can change the terms of its offer until August 18. Cowie's increase in operating profits was a more modest 12.8 per cent to Pounds 31.5m, on sales up 10.7 per cent to Pounds 322.6m. Interest charges fell from Pounds 20.1m to Pounds 19.3m. The group is highly sensitive to falling interest rates, each percentage point cut adding Pounds 2.4m to pre-tax profits. However, the group had capped 90 per cent of its borrowings, which totalled Pounds 315m or 321 per cent of shareholders' funds at the half-year end, so that it would be relatively immune to any rise in interest rates, Mr Gordon Hodgson, chief executive, said. The group gives a divisional break down of its profits at the pre-tax level. Its vehicle leasing business increased profits by 64 per cent to Pounds 8.2m on sales 26 per cent up at Pounds 124.8m. Acquisitions, which added 9,000 vehicles to the fleet taking it to 60,000, led to economies of scale which boosted profits. Lower interest rates also helped. The motor division's profits rose to Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 3.2m). The group is expecting to benefit from some relaxation of franchise restrictions. Profits of Cowie's Grey-Green bus business, which operates a number of routes in London, rose from Pounds 507,000 to Pounds 854,000. Its bus and coach distribution side made Pounds 941,000 (Pounds 349,000) and the agricultural division put in Pounds 147,000 (Pounds 143,000). After a tax charge estimated at 30 per cent (25 per cent) earnings per share rose by 46 per cent to 6.68p. As indicated in the offer document, the interim dividend is 2p (1.5p).</p>

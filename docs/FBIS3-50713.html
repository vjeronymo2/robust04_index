			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santoyo] </F>   [Text] We arrived in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas  State, after a long journey, as has been the case in the past  days. We learned that Eloy Cantu Segovia, the federal  government's official spokesman in San Cristobal de las Casas,  will give a news conference. He told us, as we reported to our  listeners moments ago, that Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, president of  the National Human Rights Commission, would visit San Cristobal.  We will give details of Madrazo's news conference later.    He reported that there were clashes overnight, that clashes  continued at about 0400, especially in the mountain areas near  San Cristobal de las Casas. It was also reported that the  rebels managed to corner a squad that was attacking these law  violators, but the Mexican Army rescued them.    Cantu admitted that there are still areas where uncertainty  prevails. The rebels continue to operate out of and to hide in  houses, as was the case in Ocosingo. Members of the Zapatista  National Liberation Army [EZLN] are hiding in houses there and  holding its occupants hostage to protect their own lives.    He said that the bodies of 20 EZLN members were found in  Ocosingo. According to the observations and estimates we made  on 4 January, the EZLN sustained more than 30 dead here. Cantu  added that the rebels have sustained 61 dead so far. This is  the figure registered by the Mexican Army, which managed to  arrest 34 subversives.    As for Jorge Madrazo Cuellar's visit here, Cantu said that  the priority is to ensure a respect for human rights and the  civilian population. He added that greater guarantees will be  granted to reporters to allow us to perform our work. Cantu  also reported that in a few hours there will be shipments of  food, potable water, and food to the residents of Ocosingo,  which will mark its fifth day under siege, so to speak, or amid  clashes.    Cantu profoundly regretted the incidents involving our  fellow  reporters who were sent here. He added that each incident will  be investigated. We will now hear Jorge Madrazo Cuellar,  president of the National Human Rights Commission, during his  news conference.    Madrazo said that he came with other officials of this  commission to register complaints and reports on human rights  violations during the clashes. Madrazo reaffirmed that each of  these reports will be investigated, because human rights are  respected and guaranteed in Mexico. He added the following:    [Begin Madrazo recording, in progress] ...in Tuxtla  Gutierrez. We initially responded to a request to help in  evacuating tourists from the conflict area [words indistinct] I  am accompanied in this work brigade by the first general  inspector, the third general inspector, experts on criminology  and forensic medicine, and personnel who are involved in  investigations and communications.    At this juncture of the conflict the National Human Rights  Commission's work will focus on offering support to civilians  who have nothing to do with the armed confrontation. The  commission will also register all existing evidence on alleged  human rights violations. The investigation and the report on  conclusions will take place within the terms established by the  Constitution and the Basic Law of the National Human Rights  Commission. [end recording]    These were the highlights of developments that occurred on 5  June in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas State.</p>

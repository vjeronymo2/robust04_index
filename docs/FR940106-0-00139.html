			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 28.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Break delay.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ODHR, commenting on &sect;617.15(d)(1)(i), explains that by including the phrase ``and resumes participation'' as a condition for payment means that no payment for the break can be paid until the break is over and this is verified. The ODHR states that this contradicts the intent of the rule that ``An individual will continue to receive basic and additional weeks of TRA during scheduled breaks in training'' and would create problems if the break fell within the individual's scheduled reporting period. The NYDL provided similar comments on &sect;617.15(d)(1)(i).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department agrees that it is not the intent of this regulation to delay TRA payments during scheduled breaks in training that do not exceed 14 days. However, if a worker fails to resume participation in the training immediately after the break ends, any payments made during the scheduled break shall be established as overpayments, subject to repayment under the provisions of &sect;617.55. Therefore, no change in the regulations is necessary to reflect this intent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 29.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Inconsistency.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The MESC, commenting on &sect;617.15(d)(2), stated that no basic TRA may be paid if the individual is on a scheduled training break of 15 days or more. The MESC stated that denial of TRA to a claimant during a break which exceeds 14 days, but less than 30 days, is inconsistent with the definition of ``enrolled in training'' in &sect;617.11(a)(2)(vii)(D)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), which allows payment of TRA to a claimant who will enter training within 30 days. A claimant during a break in training of less than 30 days should be considered enrolled in training and eligible for basic TRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of these two provisions is not similar, nor is there a basis in the statute for altering the specific 14-day provision of section 233(f). The 14-day break in training provision is a statutory requirement and not subject to change in regulations. On the 30-day provision, see the discussion in item 20 above. Therefore, no change is made in the final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Holidays during breaks.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The West Virginia Department of Employment Security (WVDES) commented that, in counting days of breaks under &sect;617.15(d)(3), Saturdays and Sundays are not counted but holidays are counted. The WVDES recommends that for purposes of counting the days in a break, holidays not be counted along with Saturdays and Sundays. The MESC, NYDL and the Oregon Department of Human Resources (ODHR) provided similar comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department agrees that recognized legal holidays should not be counted, and has already acknowledged this change in section E.3. of Attachment A to GAL 15&hyph;90 (also see page 3 of the GAL). Ordinarily, breaks in training are oriented to National and State holidays, and to periods within terms or semesters of the training institution. The one long holiday oriented break each year is the holiday beginning around the second or third week in December and ending after New Year's Day. Since these holidays are the reason for the break, the Department agrees that such holidays should not be included in counting the number of days of the break. The critical point is whether a particular day would ordinarily be a scheduled training day in the particular training program. Therefore, official State and National holidays are added to the days not counted in counting the days of a break, if training in the program concerned would not normally be scheduled on such days. (See the explanation in item F. above.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 31.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EB work test.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The MESC, commenting on &sect;617.17(b)(2), stated that this section indicates that on or after November 21, 1988, claimants in training which is State approved (but not TAA approved) must satisfy the EB work test. The MESC further states that before November 21, 1988, the EB work test was not applied to claimants in State approved training. The MESC argues that there should be no change in the exception to the EB work test on or after November 21, 1988. Section 231(a)(4) of the Trade Act, unchanged by the 1988 Amendments, requires that to be eligible for TRA, a worker would not be disqualified for EB due to the work test. An EB claimant in State approved training would not be disqualified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenter incorrectly reads section 231(a)(4) and the effect of the substantive amendment to section 231(a)(5), which was effective on November 21, 1988. Prior to November 21, 1988, for the purposes of basic TRA, participation in training approved under the State law or under &sect;617.22(a) was sufficient to make the able and available requirement, including the EB work test, inapplicable. The amendment to section 231(a)(5) makes training approved under section 236 an eligibility requirement for basic TRA, effective on November 21, 1988. After November 20, therefore, claimants for basic TRA may not satisfy the requirement of section 231(a)(5), or avoid the EB work test, by participating in training which is not approved under section 236. The Department's position was clearly set forth in section 4.C. of GAL 7&hyph;88, and was reiterated without change in section C. of Attachment A to GAL 15&hyph;90; it also is correctly stated in &sect;&sect;617.11(a) (2), (3), and (4) and 617.17(b) of the proposed rule and is retained in this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

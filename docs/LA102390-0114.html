			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGITAL'S LINE TO 'TALK' TO RIVALS' COMPUTERS;  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY: THE COMPANY IS ABANDONING ITS STRATEGY OF MAKING MODELS THAT ARE  INCOMPATIBLE WITH OTHER LINES. SALES HAVE BEEN LAGGING.  </P> <P> Digital Equipment Corp. said Monday that it plans a major shift in strategy  toward the "open" computer standards that are gaining increasing popularity in  the computer industry.  </P> <P> Analysts said the world's second-largest computer maker was pushed into the  change by a slumping market for its machines, which cannot easily be connected  with computers made by other companies or operate their software.  </P> <P> Digital will announce Thursday that it will modify its mainstay VAX computer  line to run software designed for the popular Unix operating system.  </P> <P> That means companies equipped with both VAX and Unix-based computers could run  the same software on all, saving the cost of buying or writing a second version  of the software.  </P> <P> An operating system is the base layer of software than controls a computer's  internal housekeeping functions. Applications software, such as word processing  programs, enables computer to perform specific functions. It runs on top of an  operating system.  </P> <P> Digital said it will release a version of its VAX operating system next year  that will adhere to an open-system standard called Posix. Posix, in turn, is  compatible with Unix.  </P> <P> Analysts said Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., needs to make its VAX computer  line more attractive.  </P> <P> "There is clearly a slowdown in orders for VAX," said Jay Stevens, who follows  the computer industry for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.  </P> <P> Part of that sluggishness is due to the desire for open systems, but it also is  due to a delay by customers in ordering new Digital computers while they await  promised new models, analysts said.  </P> <P> One such model, also to be announced Thursday, is a new top-end version of the  VAX 6000 mid-range computer line. The VAX 6000 model 500 will offer 85% more  processing power than the current top-end 6000, but cost only 18% more, said  Stephen Blanchette, the line's marketing manager.  </P> <P> Digital admits that the move to open systems is driven by the marketplace.  </P> <P> "It is apparent that open-systems computing is the way of the future, and  Digital intends to address that market," said Phil Auberg, marketing manager  for the VAX software line.  </P> <P> While Digital's move is important for a company that has relentlessly promoted  a proprietary computer line, it isn't unique. NCR Corp. made perhaps the most  dramatic move into open systems of any old-line computer maker with an  announcement last month that it will replace its entire product range with  open-system machines.  </P></p>

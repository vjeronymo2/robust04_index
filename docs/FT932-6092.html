			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: In Mr Toad's slipstream EXCITING cars are the ultimate present you can give yourself. For one thing, they are relatively affordable compared with yachts or helicopters. And you can justify the outlay by arguing that it is 'necessary' - after all, most of us need to drive. Motoring correspondents, most of whom show few signs of preferring to test Metros rather than Maseratis, do point out increasingly that the 1993 family saloon is of such a high standard that it compares favourably for performance and reliability with the luxury car of a decade ago. Yet, in an unbroken line from Mr Toad onwards, those with the cash or the position to treat themselves do so. 'I'm totally in love with my Jaguar. I couldn't believe my luck when the company agreed to give me one,' says Yve Newbold, company secretary to Hanson. For a long time, Jaguars were off the list of Hanson-approved vehicles. Newbold was fortunate to combine her own legendary persuasiveness with the Ford-acquired company's improved quality standards. 'Although it's exotic to me, it's got to have a little bit of gravitas,' she adds. 'I'd call it a racy, sensible car. It's not the top of the range or flashy. I'd love one of the V-12s but it just would not be appropriate.' Other City figures, just as in love with their vehicles, find them more enjoyable as private pleasures. Amschel Rothschild, chief executive of Rothschild Asset Management, is famed among clients and colleagues for his passion towards his 1960s' BRM Formula One racing car. Yet very few have seen the boss in action at the occasional club race or classic rally. Possibly not quite the right degree of gravitas for the family image? Passers-by could scarcely miss the eight-litre 1930 Sports Bentley of investor and sportsman Graham Walker. He has owned a string of successful racing yachts, all named Indulgence, and created the 1986 British challenge for the America's Cup, besides being chairman of the newly-revived British Pathe News. 'This is probably my favourite indulgence,' says Walker. Yet the Bentley is very much a working car (although, for Monday-to-Friday chores around town, he uses an Aston Martin). On one recent weekend, it took his daughter to her wedding before leaving early on the Monday for the 1,200-mile drive to Italy to compete in the Mille Miglia rally, a re-run of the classic road race. Walker and his son Jago were kitted out for the trip in full helmets and goggles. Handling this car, still capable of more than 130mph, on the autoroute is not for the faint-hearted. 'We drove her down because, frankly, the Bentley is far more reliable than any pick-up or truck we might have hired from a garage,' says Walker, one of life's enthusiasts. 'You come back from a trip like that with shoulders like Schwarzenegger.' The chic and poised Newbold, a lawyer by training, has no desire for incidental body-building when she drives but, like Walker, confesses to a love of flamboyant, muscular cars that goes back many years. 'When I was studying law, I drove a white MGB convertible around London with my four kids scrunched in the back or sitting on the rolled-down top. Quite against all the rules nowadays, of course, but I thought it was a blast and so did they.' Her progress in the lovely scarlet Jaguar is now more restrained.</p>

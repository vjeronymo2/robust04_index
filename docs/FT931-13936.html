			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Councils 'planning 100,000 job cuts' MORE THAN 100,000 redundancies are likely in local government during the next two years, says a survey of council personnel directors released yesterday. The figure is about 10 per cent of the workforce. The estimate, in a survey of 55 authorities across Britain by the CAMC Personnel Policy Research Unit, is the most gloomy yet. It was dismissed by Mr John Redwood, local government minister, as 'scaremongering'. The survey found that councils were set to make redundant the equivalent of 84,000 full-time employees, amounting to the loss of 'well in excess' of 100,000 jobs. That was on top of losses through natural wastage. Last week's Local Government Chronicle estimated that more than 33,000 full-time posts were at risk in England over the next 15 months. The CAMC research shows white-collar staff such as architects, site supervisors and senior officers are likely to bear the brunt of the redundancies, with compulsory competitive tendering and the current local government review blamed for many of the projected job losses. Mr Redwood said most councils he had spoken to recently 'have assured me that they will not be making people compulsorily redundant'. The government's marginal relaxation of local spending controls announced earlier this week was welcomed by councils yesterday, but the Association of County Councils suggested it was less generous than the government's estimate of Pounds 150m. Among shire counties, London boroughs and metropolitan districts, the relaxation has given 17 councils an increase of 1.5 per cent in their 'notional amount' - the sum which is the basis of government calculations - but in only four of these is there a similar percentage rise in the capping limit, because of the method used to determine capping. The most extreme example is Kent, where an increase of Pounds 16m in notional amount does not change its capping limit.</p>

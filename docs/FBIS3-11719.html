			<p>Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H5>  Samper Campaigns in Santander Department </H5>   Campaigning in Santander--among the departments most  affected  by guerrilla violence, and where the candidate traveled  accompanied by a doctor and an ambulance--Liberal Party  Presidential hopeful Ernesto Samper focused on public order  problems and social policy.    Speaking in San Vicente de Chucuri, Samper said he responded  to his advisers' suggestion that he not visit this conflictive  municipality by saying he would "prefer to renounce his  candidacy" rather than refrain from visiting a particular area.  Samper said "not one inch of ground" will be relinquished to  those who perpetrate violence, according to EL TIEMPO.    During a campaign stop in Bucaramanga, the capital of  Santander, Samper discussed his social policy emphasizing that  "without jobs, there can be no peace." According to EL TIEMPO,  the candidate's social program will focus on jobs, housing, and  the problems facing Colombian women.    Samper described this policy as the second phase of the  "apertura" [economic liberalization] program, saying that up to  now the model has been "incomplete" because "the focus has been  on economic reform, and people have been forgotten." Samper said:    "During the past five years an additional 2.5 million poor  have appeared in Colombia. For this reason I've said it's now  time to give `apertura' a heart because there is a direct  relationship between social conditions and the prevailing  violence," according to EL TIEMPO.    Samper repeated his promise to generate 1.5 million jobs and  said he would accomplish this by promoting recovery of the  agricultural sector, stimulating exports, restructuring  industry, assisting very small business, making housing  available, and implementing social programs. He also emphasized  that women would receive more recognition in a future Samper  administration. He reportedly said that, if he is elected, women  would be better represented at the decision-making level of  government, more attention would be given to the needs of poor  women, and that mechanisms would be introduced to help working  mothers.

He invited  all members of Congress to join him in promising "to be vigilant  in the proper management of public funds." Samper promised to  "protect and promote respect for the rights" of the country's 8  million blacks. Noting that the department is rich in terms of  natural resources and biodiversity, Samper said he would like to  see a center for the study of biodiversity established there.

In Bogota, Samper addressed businessmen at a forum organized  by his campaign and offered a three-pronged approach to  developing the telecommunications sector. His program consists  in supporting incipient regional enterprises, increasing  cooperation between public and private sectors, and developing  human resources. Samper said national and international  telephone communications systems must be modernized, and  declared that he favors restructuring the National  Telecommunications Enterprise (Telecom) and giving it greater  autonomy.    Samper stated that he would promote development of the  nascent software industry through the creation of free-trade  zones for technology and by making credit more accessible.    During a later address to members of several business  associations in Cali, the candidate reportedly warned that, if  the current exchange rate policy continues, in five years the  only thing the country will be able to export will be petroleum.  Samper predicted that his administration would be able to  generate 350,000 jobs in small and medium enterprises and said  he will make it easier for small business to obtain credit.    In addition to Bogota and Cali, Samper visited Medellin,  Cucuta, Barranquilla, Pereira, Valledupur, and several smaller  cities.

The  recommendations, contained in a report presented to Turbay,  reportedly stated that adjustments in macroeconomic policy and  the "apertura" program must be made. According to the report,  the exchange rate policy, which was initially aimed at fighting  inflation, has had a negative impact on the agricultural sector  by favoring imports over domestic products. The report  recommended incentives and subsidies for certain producers  selected on the "basis of efficiency and social equality." It  further recommended providing facilities to provide cold storage  during shipping from collection points to domestic and foreign  ports. The commission report also stated that fixing tariffs on  agricultural imports is in line with the constitutional mandate  to provide adequate protection to domestic food production.  (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO 7 Mar 94 p 11A)  <H5>  Pastrana Campaigns in Several Departments </H5>   Conservative Party Presidential candidate Andres Pastrana  said during a tour of at least eight municipalities in Cauca  Department that, if elected, he would spend $2.55 billion on  highway projects, including construction of 5,000 km of new  roads, repairs on 9,000 km of existing roads, and maintenance of  70,000 km of roads throughout the country. Among the projects  directly benefiting the people of Cauca would be the  construction of a highway from Popayan to the sea which would  facilitate export of the department's agricultural produce  within the framework of the "apertura" program. Pastrana also  said preliminary studies on the feasilibity of building a  hydroelectric plant in Micay looked favorable.    The candidate also pledged that a future Pastrana  administration would promote the interests of children, women,  and the family. He said he would decentralize the Family Welfare  Institute so that it could obtain the necessary resources.  Pastrana also said he would promote public housing and expand  food programs aimed at children in the poorest regions of the  country. He also promised to promote equal rights for women,  saying that while the situation has improved, there is still  "much discrimination." Pastrana was scheduled to visit Valle and  Huila Departments after completing his tour of Cauca.    During later campaign stops in Cesar and La Guajira  Departments, Pastrana said he is willing to conduct a dialogue  with the guerrillas when they show a real desire for peace, but  until then, the Armed Forces and the police must be strengthened  so they can protect Colombians as the Constitution requires.  Touching on the controversy surrounding accusations by  Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff that Colombian bishops have  had unauthorized contacts with the country's insurgents,  Pastrana noted that the bishops are protected by an  internationally recognized agreement which includes restrictions  on investigating and prosecuting members of the church hierarchy.    Pastrana said he favors constructing irrigation systems to  restore productivity to 25,000 hectares of land in several La  Guajira municipalities.

In his address, Pastrana reportedly  asked all Latin American countries and the entire international  community to take up the fight against corruption "immediately  and with all possible force." Pastrana reportedly said this was  the only way to prevent the destruction of the democratic  system. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL ESPECTADOR 2 Mar 94 p 6A; 3 Mar p  5A)</p>

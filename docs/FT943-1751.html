			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Lehman barely breaks even Lehman Brothers barely broke even in the three months to the end of August, managing a return on capital of just 1.6 per cent, according to the first results from the US investment bank since being spun off from American Express. The latest figures come a month ahead of other US investment banks' results and point to generally weak profits and more cost-cutting on Wall Street. The Lehman figures reflect a fall-off in activity in many areas of the financial markets due to the volatility of recent months, according to Mr Richard Fuld, chairman and chief executive. Uncertainties about interest rates and concerns about inflation 'continued to dampen the activities of both issuers (of securities) and investors,' he said. Lehman is also labouring with a higher cost base than many of its rivals, and continued yesterday to point to cost-cutting as a way of improving profitability. Since the beginning of the year, staff numbers have fallen by about 775, to some 8,625, with 300 of the jobs cuts coming in recent days. During the latest quarter, revenues were lower across the board compared with the third quarter a year ago, which ended on September 30 1993. Revenues from principal trading fell 24 per cent to Dollars 335m, while investment banking revenues slipped 8 per cent to Dollars 172m, net interest and dividend income fell 29 per cent to Dollars 83m and commission income was down 10 per cent at Dollars 113m. If current market conditions continue to the end of the year, bonuses paid to Lehman employees are expected on average to be 30-40 per cent lower than in 1993. Overall, the bank reported post-tax income of Dollars 22m on revenues after interest costs of Dollars 719m, compared with Dollars 112m on revenues of Dollars 893m earned on the same businesses the year before. Earnings per share were 10 cents, compared with 96 cents on all Lehman businesses including some later sold the year before.</p>

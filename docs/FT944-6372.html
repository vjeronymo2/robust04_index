			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Cuts in job loss payments unlawful Government deductions from protective awards to redundant workers were declared unlawful yesterday by an industrial tribunal. In the first successful challenge to the Department of Employment's policy of cutting payments to redundant workers, 1,500 workers who lost their jobs at the Swan Hunter shipyard will receive extra money as a result. The Newcastle upon Tyne tribunal has also referred two other issues raised in the case to the European Court of Justice. These cover the government's policy of restricting protective awards to a maximum of eight weeks and limiting a week's pay to Pounds 205. 'This decision will affect thousands of workers made redundant in other industries,' said Mr Stefan Cross, the solicitor representing Swan Hunter workers. The Department of Employment said the case raised complex issues concerning linkages between UK law and European Union directives.</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAMIR IS GUARDING ISRAEL, NOT QUIBBLING;  </P> <P> MIDDLE EAST: IT'S A MATTER OF SURVIVAL. TALKS CAN ONLY BE HELD WITH THOSE  PALESTINIANS WHO WANT AND URGENTLY NEED PEACE.  </P> <P> The Middle East peace process appears to have gotten so bogged down in arcana  that only diplomats and specialists can follow its twists and turns. But the  occasional reports and leaks that penetrate the public perplexity leave one  clear impression: behind the obfuscation, it is Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's  niggling insistence on procedural details that is keeping us from the dawn of  Middle East peace -- and keeping the Bush Administration from a diplomatic  triumph, the first-ever Israeli-Palestinian talks.  </P> <P> Shamir has made a very large issue of two points. But they are about as  procedural as Churchill's refusal to negotiate with Hitler.  </P> <P> Point 1. Israel's peace initiative calls for free elections in the occupied  territories to produce Palestinian negotiators to work out some interim peace  ("autonomy") that would end the Israeli military occupation. After three years  of living together, after having reassessed each other's worst assumptions  about the other's ultimate intentions, then and only then do negotiations start  talking final peace, because only then can they have any chance of success.  </P> <P> Elections, negotiation, interim solution, final status -- everybody but the  Palestine Liberation Organization has accepted this sequence in principle.  Nevertheless, an Egyptian plan pointedly puts the "final status" issue --  Israel's giving up the West Bank -- on the table before the first words are  exchanged or the first ballot cast.  </P> <P> Shamir's "wrangling" is over demands for an ironclad American guarantee that  the initial talks will be only about elections. Israel does not want to start  talks that are destined from day one to fail and for which failure it is sure  to be blamed.  </P> <P> Point 2. Israel's other wrangle is to insist that the Palestinian negotiators  who will arrange the elections be insiders (West Bankers) and not outsiders  (Palestinians living abroad and representing the PLO establishment in Tunis).  </P> <P> This is not a procedural point, because the only talks that can possibly  succeed are talks between Israel and the insiders. It is true, of course, that  both insiders and outsiders swear allegiance to the PLO. (Those who refuse have  a way of getting shot: 125 of those killed during the intifada have been  Palestinians killed by other Palestinians.) But there is a natural divergence  of interests between insiders and outsiders in the Palestinian movement, and on  every major issue, the insiders' interest is more favorable to peace.  </P> <P> It is the insiders who suffer daily the dislocations and casualties of the  intifada; thus their objective is to end the occupation quickly. For the  outsiders, the intifada is a political boon. It revives an issue that had been  dead for years. They are in no hurry. They can hold out to the last West Banker  for their maximal demands.  </P> <P> The first freely elected Palestinian leadership ever, though nominally pledged  to Yasser Arafat, will enjoy a status and legitimacy rivaling that of the aging  rejectionists in Tunis. Precisely for that reason the PLO is not happy about  elections.  </P> <P> It is conceivable that West Bankers would trade an end to occupation for a  Palestinian entity that truly renounces all designs on Israel proper. The  outsiders will not. The vast majority of them come not from the West Bank but  from Israel proper. Their program is to use the West Bank as a staging point  for returning to -- retaking -- what is now Israel.  </P> <P> In sum, the insiders have a more urgent need for peace now and a more moderate  objective for the final peace to come. That is what prompted Israel to propose,  and the United States to back, West Bank elections. The whole point of the  election idea is to get the peace process moving by exploiting the natural  divergence of interests between insiders and outsiders and shifting the center  of political gravity from the outside to the inside.  </P> <P> Talks with outsiders -- representatives of the PLO in Tunis -- are guaranteed  to fail. But don't you have to negotiate peace with your enemies? The answer to  that fatuity is: There are enemies and there are enemies. You negotiate with  enemies whose objective is somehow to settle with you. With those who want only  to expunge you, there is nothing to negotiate.  </P> <P> Israel does not want to negotiate with PLO outsiders because it understands  that such negotiations can only be about a single issue: a PLO state. For most  Israelis, that is a prescription for national suicide. They are not interested  in entering a negotiation whose purpose is to work out the finer modalities of  their demise.  </P> <P> That may look like procedure in Washington. In Jerusalem, it is life and death.  </P></p>

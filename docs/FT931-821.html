			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions IN THE WEEK of the Budget, directors continued to take profits on their own shareholdings, a trend which has not altered much since the start of the year. With shares in Serco Group outperforming the market by 21 per cent over the last month David Perkins, the finance director, continued to take profits from his holding, selling 50,000 shares at 925p. This follows on from his sale earlier this month of 20,000 at 825p. Earlier this year three directors of First Leisure, the holiday and leisure centres group, sold shares at 325p. Most recently, a fourth director Richard Mills sold 25,000 - about a third of his holding - at 358p. Following the announcement last week of results for 1992, which were broadly in line with market expectations, Brian Hawkins, managing director of Hall Engineering, bought 10,000 shares at 165p. Louis Goodman, managing director of Citysite Estates, the property development company, bought 295,000 7 per cent CULS at 25p adding to the significant purchases he made in February.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                         No of Company                Sector      Shares    Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Amstrad                Elns        55,500      19         1 Concentric             EngG         6,000      15         1 European Colour        Chem       100,000      19         1 First Leisure          H&amp;L         25,000      90         1 Greggs                 FdRe         2,650      14         1 Hambros                Merc        55,000     180         1* Laporte                Chem        34,047     229         1* London Merchant Sec    Prop        20,000      17         1 Manders Holdings       BdMa         9,000      27         1 Marks &amp; Spencer        Stor       380,627   1,339         4* Metal Bulletin         Med          5,000      14         1* Microgen Holdings      Pack        45,500     100         1* Paramount              Brew       100,000      11         1 Photo-Me Intl          H&amp;L        100,000     310         1 Porter Chadburn        Cong        50,000      12         1 Property Sec Inv       Prop        50,000      59         2 RIT Capital CULS       InTr       250,000     285         1 Serco                  BuSe        50,000     462         1 Tams (John)            Misc        13,000      11         1 Witan IT (warrants)    InTr        52,069      60         1 Wolvhmpton &amp; Dudley    Brew        20,000     120         2 Wood (John D)          Prop       100,000      45         1 Wyevale Garden Ctre    Stor       507,500     874         1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES Aberforth Split Uni    InTr        16,000      32         1 Abtrust Pref Income    InTr        48,342      40         5 Allied Lyons           Brew         2,000      11         1 Banner Homes           C&amp;C        200,000      60         1 Citysite Est CULS      Prop       295,000      74         1 Deb,Tews &amp; Chinnock    Prop        20,000      15         1 Hall Engineering       EngG        10,000      17         1 Hartstone              Misc         7,811      11         1 Lloyds Chemist         Stor         5,000      15         1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

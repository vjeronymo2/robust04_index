			<p>BFN     [Text] Lefkosa [Nicosia] (A.A) -- Rahmi Ozyazgan reports:  Assessing the Vienna talks on the confidence-building measures  for Cyprus, Rauf Denktas, president of the Turkish Republic of  Northern Cyprus, said: "The Turkish Cypriot side has rejected  the changes to the confidence-building measures and will  continue to do so."    In a statement to ANATOLIA, Denktas pointed out that by  going  to Vienna and discussing its problem and its views once again,  the Turkish Cypriot side showed its good will once again, and  also "said its last word, drew the last line."    Denktas pointed out that the masks of the Greek Cypriots are  falling. He added: "It has become obvious that the Greek  Cypriots do not intend to reach an agreement with us, but that  they are ready to hide behind the false title of the legitimate  Cyprus government and to wage their ugly struggle for another 40  years in order to get the entire island."    Denktas stressed that the Greek Cypriot efforts to join the  European Union [EU] are of a nature that can totally eliminate  any developments. Criticizing the stand of the EU, Denktas  said: "The ball is not in our hands any more. Had the EU made  a realistic diagnosis of the Cyprus problem, it would not have  treated the Turkish Cypriots so unjustly for so many years, nor  would it have given the green light to the Greek Cypriots to  join the EU on the 30th year of the Cyprus problem. We are  faced with a strange and unacceptable situation. If we agree,  our reward will be that the Greek Cypriots will join the EU  which will mean Cyprus will integrate with Greece in line with  Greek Cypriot requests. If we refuse, our punishment will be  the same.    "It is our fundamental decision not to join the EU so long  as  Turkey is not a member. This is our right, granted to us by the  1960 agreements. We must defend this right. We will certainly  not give the Greek Cypriots the opportunity to integrate with  Greece by seeming to agree to this situation. We prefer to be  punished and to maintain our rights outside this integration.  We are being left with no other alternative."    Asked to comment on the results of the Vienna talks, Denktas  said: "The difficulty in Vienna arose because there was  insistence on the second map we were offered, on the changes  made in favor of the Greek Cypriots. They insist on the use of  the Lefkosa Airport by the Greek Cypriot Airline and they insist  on controlling the road leading to Maras [Varosha] and its  surroundings. The Turkish Cypriot side has categorically  rejected this and it will continue to do so."</p>

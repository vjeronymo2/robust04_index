Mr Zimbiri, who identified himself to SAPA  using a pre- arranged code, said regional and sectional  commanders as well as ground forces of the Pan Africanist  Congress' [PAC] armed wing had met in Bloemfontein for five  hours on Monday. "We want it to be known that we are not  uncontrollable," he said.    Asked if the three men killed in an attack on a police  station in central Durban early on Monday were APLA members, he  said he did not want to make any claims and would "leave this to  the media's imagination".    While he respected PAC President Clarence Makwetu's decision  to end the armed struggle, it was premature of him to announce  this before the conclusion of APLA's negotiations with the South  African Defence Force. "We will strike tomorrow and today...We  are always on the offensive."    Mr Zimbiri said the ball was in the SADF's court. APLA would  not surrender its arms to the "minority (President F W) de Klerk  settler regime" until its demands had been met. These included  a United Nations peace-keeping force, he said.</p>

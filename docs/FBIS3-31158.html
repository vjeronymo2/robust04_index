The opposition Hungarian Socialist Party (HSP) collected  50,000 authenticated signatures for parliament to include a  media bill in its agenda. Meanwhile, the government has also  submitted its media bill draft, to be discussed by Parliament in  the near future.    HSP's Ferenc Kosa wants Hungary to have a media law before  the election campaign. If not, supervisory committees could be  set up to ensure ethical campaigning on radio and television, he  presumed.    Miklos Haraszti of the main opposition party, the Alliance  of  Free Democrats (AFD), noted that the government had a new  version of the media law differing from the original consensus  at several points. As the bill can only pass if supported by  two-thirds of deputies, he felt preliminary consultations were  inevitable.    Attila Zsigmond of the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum  said  the HDF was ready for discussions, but he was not authorised to  announce this officially.</p>

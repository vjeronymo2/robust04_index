			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUTBACKS IN PROBATION PROGRAM  </P> <P> Politicians and government officials do not want to appear soft on crime.  Behind the scenes, however, they occasionally make decisions that run counter  to their public posturing on law and order and the war on drugs. A case in  point is at hand.  </P> <P> Hidden in this year's deliberations over a budget for Los Angeles County lies a  recommendation from Chief Administrative Officer Richard Dixon that, if  adopted, will have major impact on the criminal justice system. He is  recommending the elimination of active supervision for 80,000 adult offenders  currently on probation. They would be placed on a computerized caseload and  would not receive any ongoing contact from a probation officer. For all  practical purposes, probation supervision for 80,000 adults convicted of a wide  range of offenses, many of which are felonies, will be eliminated.  </P> <P> This is not a plea for the increased use of probation. Rather, if probation is  ordered let it mean something. Offenders should receive the monitoring and  enforcement of court orders that judges and the public expect.  </P> <P> Probation is a viable sentencing alternative for certain offenders and when  combined with the threat of incarceration and enforceable court orders can  effectively inhibit further law violations. But not in Los Angeles County if  Dixon's recommendation is accepted.  </P> <P> Make no mistake, the word will spread quickly. After all the effort, expense  and danger of arrest, trial and conviction, not much is really going to happen  to the majority of offenders.  </P> <P> Because of severe overcrowding, time spent in jail or prison has been shortened  tremendously to accommodate a growing backlog of criminals waiting to serve  their sentences. The revolving door spins at frightening speed. With the  elimination of probation, there will be no real consequences for those people  who do not serve even these limited sentences.  </P> <P> These are critical issues that receive little or no attention from the general  public. What you hear is often far different from what you get when it comes to  the so-called justice system. In the next few weeks that difference could  become even greater.  </P> <P> CHARLES HAMSON, Chairman  </P> <P> Supervising Deputy Probation  </P> <P> Officers Assn.  </P> <P> Joint Council, Local 660, SEIU  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

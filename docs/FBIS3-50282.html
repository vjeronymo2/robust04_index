			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 25  January publishes three commentaries in reaction to statements  by Sandor Lezsak, executive chairman of the Hungarian Democratic  Forum [MDF], about the situation of the Hungarian minority, made  during his recent three-day visit to Slovakia, held at the  invitation of the Hungarian minority's Coexistence Movement.    Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 25 January on page 3  carries a 450-word Dominik Hurny commentary entitled "Boundless  Ruthlessness." The commentary takes issue with Lezsak's  statement that, "as long as the basic rights of citizens of  Hungarian nationality in Slovakia are not guaranteed, it is  impossible to speak about a Hungarian-Slovak settlement--that  is, about the signing of an interstate treaty." Hurny asks:  "What basic rights do the Hungarian citizens of Slovakia not  have? Do they have no schools and periodicals, are they  forbidden to speak Hungarian, do they not have their own radio  and television broadcasts and bilingual names of streets and  shops? What are they being denied--church services in Hungarian,  the use of Hungarian in dealings with the authorities in  southern Slovakia? What is being denied to them in comparison  with Hungary and its minorities? Who gave Mr. Lezsak the right  to declare in Slovakia that Hungarian citizens in Slovakia do  not have basic rights?" After denouncing Lezsak's assertions as  a "lie" and "boundless ruthlessness," the commentator goes on to  challenge "Messrs. Duray, Bugar, and Nagy," the leaders of the  Hungarian parties in Slovakia, "to state in public which basic  rights the Hungarian population of Slovakia does not have and in  which areas Hungarian legislation and, above all, the Hungarian  practice vis-a-vis the Slovak and other minorities is better and  of a higher standard than is the case in Slovakia." He says:  "It is necessary to ask Messrs. Duray, Bugar, and Nagy to  furnish evidence for their propaganda attacks, which run counter  to reality. We know very well who in southern Slovakia is  threatened with assimilation! As long as Mr. Duray and company  do not try to specify their attacks, any further talks are  superfluous. The government must demand from these muckrakers a  clear answer to the question of their alleged basic rights.  There can be no talk of a dialogue until then."    On the same page, REPUBLIKA carries a 600-word Eva  Zelenayova  commentary entitled "And Who Will Protect the Citizen?"  Commenting on the MDF delegation's visit to southern Slovakia,  Zelenayova says: "During the delegation's first stop, at  Kralovsky Chlmec, Stefan Pasztor, the mayor of that city, let  himself be heard that Hungarians in Medzibodrozi [area between  the Uh and Latorica Rivers in east Slovakia] are not free and  that the government does not take care of them, which is why  they have to help themselves. The guests from Hungary, in turn,  stated that they are fulfilling their electoral program, which  includes taking care of Hungarians beyond the borders of the  Hungarian Republic. At his news conference on Sunday [23  January], MDF Executive Chairman Sandor Lezsak went so far as to  term the Komarno rally [of 8 January, at which Hungarian  minority representatives formulated their demands] the beginning  of efforts at a Slovak-Hungarian settlement, which, however, is  still a long way off, in his opinion, because the basic human  rights of the Hungarian minority are not guaranteed in the  Slovak Republic.... We could scarcely find a state in Europe  that would let its sovereignty be jeopardized the way we allow  our southern neighbors to do this. They are not alone, receiving  substantial help from their notoriously known lackeys in our own  country. By their statements and initiatives, they jeopardize  and offend with impunity the state and its population.  Meanwhile, the General Prosecutor's Office is silent, and the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not sent a single protest note  yet. Quite the contrary, we are being generous and assume an  accommodating stand, imprudently and to our own detriment." In  concluding, Zelenayova calls on the government "to act as the  government of a sovereign state so that the citizen will not  have to fear about who will protect him."    On the same day, on page 1, REPUBLIKA carries a 400-word  editorial by Roman Kalisky entitled "Public Matter." According  to the author, telephones had been ringing in the REPUBLIKA  editorial office "since yesterday morning," with "indignant  readers" asking how it is possible that "a foreign politician  can present ultimatums," speaking about the impossibility of a  Hungarian-Slovak reconciliation "as long as the basic rights of  the Hungarian minority are not recognized in Slovakia," and  accuse Slovak representatives of trying to "provoke Hungarians  living in Slovakia." Kalisky continues: "What could I tell  them? I advised them: Phone the Slovak Government, the  minister of interior, the General Prosecutor's Office! Because  I know that they are not going to phone them, let me tell these  institutions on the callers' behalf:    "Esteemed gentlemen, governmental and nongovernmental Slovak  politicians!    "In every sovereign state from Albania to the United States,  from New Zealand to Zaire, a foreign state representative such  as Sandor Lezak [Slovak spelling of Lezsak's name used] would  get in his passport the `persona non grata' stamp. And the  matter would be settled!    "Second, every citizen of the Slovak Republic who flagrantly  establishes contact with the representative of a foreign power  with the aim of subverting this Republic should be made  criminally liable!" In this context, Kalisky reiterates his  earlier call for the adoption of a "law on the protection of the  Republic" to be applied against "conspiratorial criminal acts  directed against the state, such as are being publicly committed  against the Slovak Republic today."    Lezsak's visit to Slovakia is also the subject of a  statement  made by Docent Jan Cuper from the Theory of State and Law  Department of Comenius University's Law School to the Slovak  news agency TA SR, which is published by Bratislava NARODNA  OBRODA in Slovak on 25 January on page 2. The TA SR report on  Cuper's statement includes the following passage: "Referring to  Sandor Lezsak's tour of southern Slovakia, Jan Cuper said that  the naivete of the Slovak state power is being quietly abused in  this way in order to prove that Budapest has sovereignty over  southern Slovakia. It is no coincidence that the tour did not  start in Komarno this time but, rather, in Kralovsky Chlmec in  the east, Jan Cuper said, adding that `if you are not acting  like a sovereign subject, you will not be treated like a  sovereign subject. It is not customary for someone who is not  yet the winner to set preliminary conditions for someone who has  not yet been defeated and to blackmail him.' According to Jan  Cuper, the developments are aimed at the Hungarian minority  being granted autonomy rights, so as to make possible the  establishment of Hungarian state power in southern Slovakia."</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / People: Bayfield takes a seat on British Bus Stephen Bayfield, 40, a partner in accountants Robson Rhodes, has decided to jump aboard British Bus to help Britain's biggest privately-owned bus company acquire even more bus companies. Bayfield, who works in Robson Rhodes' corporate finance team, has been advising British Bus on aspects of corporate strategy and finance since plans were mooted to separate British Bus from National Express in 1992. Gordon Watt, 41, British Bus's deputy chief executive, is also a former partner in Robson Rhodes and was keen to recruit another finance man. British Bus, whose interests range from Derby City Transport to Midland Fox and Crosville Wales, has more than doubled in size since its management buy-out in December 1992. It has 4,300 buses, a staff of 9,000 and turnover of Pounds 250m a year. It raised Pounds 35m of equity from Charterhouse and CINVen in May and has also increased its bank borrowings substantially to finance a steady stream of acquisitions. Watt's formula for successful acquisitions is 'to buy the revenue and cut costs'. He believes that the combination of predictable cash flows, substantial capital investment and small need for working capital, means that bus companies can be much more highly geared and should start being regarded as akin to utilities. Although Watt says that the City does not 'fully appreciate the cash-generative nature of the bus business', British Bus has been able to finance a hectic acquisition spree and its appetite shows no sign of abating. Whether British Bus will turn into the modern-day equivalent of the old British Electric Traction company which once dominated Britain's bus industry, will depend partly on Bayfield, who will be responsible for group and acquisitions strategy. One of his first tasks will be to help decide when the time is ripe for British Bus to seek a stock market listing for its shares.</p>

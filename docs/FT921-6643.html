			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (1): Apres moi, le deluge - The economic picture has brightened in the past 18 months. President Balaguer, who is 85 and blind, says he will not fight the next election in 1994. Though few people believe him and there is no obvious successor, the end of an era is in sight THE DOMINICAN Republic is approaching the end of an era. The man who has dominated it for more than a generation, President Joaquin Balaguer, is now 85; his chief political opponent, former president Juan Bosch, is only three years younger. President Balaguer has been prominent for 60 years in the politics of his country, whose 7.2m people share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with Haiti. He was re-elected for a sixth term in elections in May 1990 by the narrowest of majorities over Mr Bosch: less than 25,000 in a total vote of 1.93m. Mr Bosch denounced the result as a fraud. Mr Balaguer was a minister and later titular president of the Trujillo dictatorship which ruled the country from 1930 until 1961. After the assassination of Rafael Trujillo in 1961, the state seized (and still owns much of) the property of the Trujillo family, which had ruthlessly used its position to become the country's largest landowners. Following the election of 1962, Mr Bosch assumed the presidency, only to be deposed seven months later in a military coup. A virtual civil war followed, prompting intervention in 1965 by US marines. The 1966 elections enabled Mr Balaguer to assume the office he has held continuously since, except for the two presidential terms from 1978-86. Although the sightless president has announced that he will not contest the next presidential election in May 1994, most Dominicans believe that if his health and luck hold out, he will go on. Until his departure, the pattern of Dominican politics will continue much as before. What happens afterwards is a mystery, even to the closest followers of the Dominican scene. Mr Balaguer fits into the mould of the traditional Latin American caudillo, or strongman. He remains adept at the exercise and preservation of power, which means limiting the influence of others. As a result, his opponents are weak, and no obvious successor has been allowed to rise through his own party. His approach has also meant a centralisation of power on the office of the president that is matched in few other countries, and therefore a severe weakness of most of the other institutions of state. His political antennae remained perceptive enough to recognise that, when he reassumed office in 1990, something drastic was needed to reform the economy. Near economic collapse was the price being paid for the free-spending years of his fifth term. Inflation exceeded 100 per cent in 1990. There were severe shortages of fuel and food. The notoriously unreliable water and electricity supplies had become even more erratic, with power cuts of 20 hours or more a day. The last 18 months have made quite a difference. Now, as the country prepares to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the new world, the economic picture appears much brighter. Inflation last year dropped below 5 per cent. After two years in which the economy shrunk perhaps by 7 per cent, there are renewed prospects for economic growth. The astonishing collapse in inflation was due to an orthodox economic policy, which sharply reduced the deficit on public sector spending. The government abolished subsidies on food, petrol and energy. It cut financing to public sector enterprises and stopped the central bank from issuing currency unbacked by genuine government revenues. Reforms to simplify the customs structure have been decreed; tax reform is in prospect, as is a restructuring of the financial sector. Less than a year ago, the country was behind in payments to all its creditors, thereby cutting off important sources of finance from international financial institutions such as the World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank. Now, having cleared the arrears to them, it is drawing funds from the two institutions and the International Monetary Fund, with which it signed a standby loan agreement last July. This has cleared the way for negotiations now under way with the Paris Club of creditor governments over debt rescheduling. The government is pursuing bilaterally debt concessions from other governments. It has already secured debt relief agreements from Mexico, to which it has repaid Dollars 52.9m to eliminate Dollars 162.8m face value of debt, and Venezuela. The government is also proposing significant debt relief from commercial banks, to which it suspended payments in September 1989 and which are owed Dollars 900m of its Dollars 4.5bn foreign debt. The speed of the turnaround in economic fortunes is said to have surprised even the IMF. However, the economy and the government's management of it have been notoriously volatile in recent years, and there have been no institutional changes to guarantee that this situation will alter. To the cynical, the reforms so far have merely abolished claims on the public purse from subsidies and public enterprises, leaving more revenue in the hands of the central government. Some economists, lawyers and businessmen in Santo Domingo are urging an intensification of reforms to the structure of the economy, including an overhaul of the legal system which inhibits foreign and domestic investment. The prospects for such profound change in the near future are less than rosy. Although most of the country's fundamental economic problems remain - unemployment for example is estimated at over 25 per cent - the Dominican government's attempts to diversify the economy away from sugar have had some success. Free trade zones - where businesses can import and export free of taxes and duties - now employ 120,000-130,000 people and contributed Dollars 250m in hard currency last year to the central bank. There has also been some success in non-traditional agriculture - for example, fruit. The most successful of these have depended on foreign investment. Domestic agriculture is in need of reform, for example giving farmers unchallengeable legal title to their property, to reverse a trend which could leave the country needlessly dependent on food imports. Tourism income was estimated at Dollars 880m in 1991, a significant contribution to an economy whose merchandise exports totalled some Dollars 730m last year. More than half of the tourists now visiting the country are from Europe, reducing the heavy dependence of the Dominican economy on that of the US. This dependence on the US - reinforced by the remittances of the many Dominicans living there - may be further reduced by the country's accession in March 1990 to the Lome Convention. This allows duty-free access to 320m consumers in the EC. The country has been a beneficiary since 1983 of the US's Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) which gives duty and quota free entry of many goods to the US market. However, there are concerns that the signing of a free trade agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico will displace investment and exports from the Dominican Republic. Another cloud which could influence US trade concessions is the Dominican human rights record. The US State Department published last month a 1991 report on human rights practices. It cited abuses, particularly in the treatment of the many Haitians working in the Dominican sugar cane industry. Relations with neighbouring Haiti, which has invaded morethan once, have long been poor and worsened with the election of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Last June, the president decreed the repatriation of all foreigners under 16 and older than 60. According to the State Department, 6,000 Haitians were involuntarily repatriated before the programme was suspended on the day after the Haitian army coup in September. In addition, 'some 50,000 to 55,000 Haitians left, mainly to avoid the possibility of losing their possessions.' The influence of the US remains strong, as it has been throughout the century. The other main influences on the president - the army and the Roman Catholic church - are also traditional. Mr Balaguer has long awaited the celebration of the 500th anniversary of Columbus's 'discovery and evangelisation of the Americas' and may well see this year as the culmination of his life's work. The scale of his country's festivities contrasts with the equivocation evident elsewhere in the region. The Pope will be among a stream of visitors to Santo Domingo, the first permanent settlement established by Columbus in the new world. The president has ordered a refurbishment of the fine colonial quarter of the capital, dominated by its coral rock cathedral. In a typically grand gesture, in a poor country where electricity is a scarce commodity, Mr Balaguer has also decided to complete a commemorative lighthouse first commissioned from a student Scottish architect in 1929, and only now reaching completion. The lighthouse, costing tens of millions of dollars, will project the symbol of the cross on to the clouds above. A more important bequest for his people would be for President Balaguer to use his last years in office to further economic reform, to strengthen the institutions of state and to reinforce the democratic process. But that would probably be too much to ask.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROBE OF LINCOLN S&amp;L'S OUTSIDE AUDITORS PLANNED  </P> <P> A state agency will investigate three major accounting firms that worked on  financial statements for the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine to  determine if they were negligent, a state Board of Accountancy official said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The board will initiate its investigation of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., Arthur  Young &amp; Co. and Touche, Ross &amp; Co. within the "next few weeks," said  Gregory J. Newington, the agency's enforcement program director. The Arthur  Young firm merged with Ernst &amp; Whinney earlier this year and now is known  as Ernst &amp; Young.  </P> <P>  Federal regulators, who filed a $1.1-billion racketeering suit last week  against Lincoln's former operators, also are investigating the role of those  accounting firms in Lincoln's collapse.  </P> <P> The racketeering suit levels a harsh blast at Arthur Young and Jack D.  Atchison, one of its partners in Phoenix who quit last year to work for  Lincoln's parent company, Phoenix-based American Continental Corp. Though it  does not name either as a defendant, the suit nevertheless claims they  misrepresented Lincoln's condition in a 1987 letter to a public official.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stand Behind Audits  </P> <P> The letter, together with the intervention of U.S. senators called in by  American Continental Chairman Charles H. Keating, a heavy contributor to  political campaigns, "protracted the examination process and afforded  (operators) additional time in which to exacerbate their frauds" on Lincoln and  regulators, according to the racketeering suit.  </P> <P> "We stand behind the audits," said Eugene Erbstoesser, Arthur Young's associate  general counsel in Los Angeles. He denied that the accounting firm did anything  wrong either in responding to public officials or in auditing Lincoln's and  American Continental's books.  </P> <P> He also criticized the accountancy board for revealing its investigation  through the media. He said his firm had not been notified yet about the board's  intentions.  </P> <P> Lawyers and spokesmen for the other two accounting firms could not be reached  for comment Wednesday.  </P> <P> Federal regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, a day after American Continental  filed for bankruptcy. Industry experts claim the S&amp;L, which has since been  declared insolvent, will cost taxpayers up to $2.5 billion, which would make it  the most expensive thrift bailout ever.  </P> <P> Last month, the accounting firms, particularly Arthur Young, were roundly  criticized in a review by the accounting firm of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. of  15 major real estate transactions at Lincoln. Regulators hired Leventhal to  conduct the review.  </P> <P> In addition, lawsuits filed by investors against corporate insiders and their  advisers, including the accounting firms, claim that favorable audits helped to  stall regulators for more than a year in their effort to seize Lincoln.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Focus on 2 Firms  </P> <P> In that time American Continental sold nearly $200 million of high-risk  subordinated debentures, essentially corporate IOUs, through Lincoln's 29  Southern California branches to some 22,000 investors. Now, the investors  expect their holdings to be wiped out in the bankruptcy proceedings in Phoenix.  </P> <P> Newington said the accountancy board's investigation will center on Arthur  Andersen, which audited the thrift's books through 1985, and Arthur Young,  which audited the books for the next two years.  </P> <P> The board also will look at Touche Ross, which was hired to help American  Continental prepare the report on its third-quarter results last year, he said.  </P> <P> It was the 1988 third-quarter report that provided the first dramatic, public  evidence of trouble at the thrift and American Continental. The company wanted  to record a $56-million profit as part of what it claimed was an $81-million  profit from the increased value of stock a Lincoln subsidiary held after a swap  of stock interests with British financier Sir James Goldsmith.  </P> <P> Arthur Young disagreed and quit over the issue. Its replacement, Touche Ross,  suggested getting approval from various regulators before booking the profit.  </P> <P> But the Securities and Exchange Commission rejected the attempt to book the  profit. Lincoln then posted a $20-million quarterly loss, and the company  reported a consolidated quarterly loss of $36 million.  </P> <P> Newington said Touche Ross' involvement in Lincoln may be "on the periphery"  but will still be investigated.  </P> <P> The investigation into Lincoln's outside accountants likely will take "many,  many months, perhaps a year or so," he said.  </P></p>

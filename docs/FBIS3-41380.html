The six went through a trial within a trial after four of  them had applied for change of their initial plea of guilty to  not guilty.    The convicted were Shelter Rebecca Ritchie (36), Lovemore  Ndlovu (34), Cecil Matongo (33), Harry Kaliofas (22), Joshua  Kelemera Zidala (25) and David Muchineripi (40).    Mr Joseph Mate for the State told the court that on an  unknown date but before August 23 this year, Ritchie was asked  to sell Mandrax tablets by a friend.    She approached Ndlovu, who later gave a sample of the  tablets  to Matongo.    A few days later Kaliofas requested for the whole packet  after consulting Zidala who allegedly said that the tablets were  the correct stuff.    On August 23, Muchineripi took the tablets and was  approached  by Kaliofas to discuss the price.    On September 23 this year, Muchineripi was arrested at a  local hotel.    They were all remanded in custody to January 19 for  sentencing after evidence is led in mitigation.</p>

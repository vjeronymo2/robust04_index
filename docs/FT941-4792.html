			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Boddington talk In a busy drinks sector, Boddington attracted speculative interest on talk that Whitbread may be considering a hostile bid for the pub retailing group. Such a move would cost Whitbread in the region of Pounds 440m. Whitbread already owns around 20 per cent of Boddington, inherited from last year's share restructuring with the Whitbread Investment Trust, and under the government's regulations it must reduce its holding or make a bid. Analysts were divided over the speculation, some arguing that Boddington's portfolio of public houses, hotels and nursing homes would not fit with Whitbread's business. Boddington shot forward 18 on the talk, closing at 294p. However, Whitbread, together with some other brewing stocks, retreated in line with the market and also on a cautious note from NatWest Securities. The broker argued that the weak earnings growth potential of the sector pointed to short-term underperformance. Whitbread slid 10 1/2 to 550 1/2 p, Scottish &amp; Newcastle 10 to 549p and Allied-Lyons also 10 to 625p.</p>

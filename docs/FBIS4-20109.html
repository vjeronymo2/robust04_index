			<p>BFN     [Text] Luxembourg, April 26 (AFP) -- Budgetary constraints  imposed by the European Commission on setting European Union  [EU] farm prices for the 1994-95 crop year have paralyzed  ministers' negotiations on those prices in Luxembourg,  delegation sources said on Tuesday [26 April].    They said the chances of reaching agreement this week on EU  farm prices for the new farm year looked very slim, and the  majority of delegations consider measures suggested by  Agriculture Commissioner Rene Steichen as insufficient or even  unacceptable.    Greece, the current EU president, wants quick agreement and  was carrying out intensive consultations with the member  delegations. But a suggested compromise worked out Monday night  by Steichen and Greek Agriculture Minister Giorgos Moraitis got  an unenthusiastic reception on Tuesday from some delegations.    Discussions were made particularly difficult by numerous  specific demands made by each EU delegation taking part in the  price negotiations.</p>

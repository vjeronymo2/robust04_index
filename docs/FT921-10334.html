			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Technology: Fast-talker gets the job - Computers which recognise human speech are making their voices heard Some people talk to themselves, others talk to their television sets. These days some people even talk to their computers. And the biggest culprits of all are lawyers and doctors. In Edmonton, Canada, for example, lawyers at Duncan &amp; Craig are producing everything from pleadings and debentures to general correspondence on a voice-activated computer - also referred to as a voice-operated typewriter or a talkwriter. The firm is using a system developed by Dragon Systems of Cambridge, Massachusetts, which can recognise up to 30,000 spoken words. Some 25,000 words are stored in the computer, the other 5,000 determined by the user. The latter would include terms specific to one profession. Duncan &amp; Craig bought its first system in April last year and now has 10. The system is ideal for lawyers who have no background in computing, says litigation partner David Cook. 'It's less work than learning to touch type.' Its huge vocabulary makes the DragonDictate system one of the most sophisticated voice recognition computers available. It can recognise such a large number of words because it is 'speaker dependent' - trained to recognise the accent, stammers and verbal idiosyncrasies of each user. 'To begin with it will often get it wrong,' concedes Les Kingham, systems development manager of Aptech, which sells DragonDictate in the UK. The computer, trained on a diet of US speakers, will get only about 50 per cent of the utterances of a typical British user correct the first time. But within a couple of hours the machines will guess up to 70 per cent of the words correctly and 90 per cent given several days of training. At Duncan &amp; Craig, Cook says a user can be 'quite functional after 10 hours' training, and really starts humming along after 20'. In commercial applications the training is swiftest if the keyboard is used in conjunction with the voice activation system. When the machine fails to recognise a word, the user can quickly type it in. Every user trains the system to their own voice, and the model for each is stored on the hard disc. Each file takes between 2.5 and 4 Megabytes: thus the size of the disc determines the number of users. The system can be slow to use - each word has to be enunciated clearly to avoid confusion. But it can be taught to introduce repeated phrases - invaluable in the standard documentation of the lawyer. 'The way to use the system at its best is to teach it to cut corners,' says Kingham. 'The speed will never be as good as a 100 word-per-minute typist, but that is not what it's designed for. It's intended for executives and professionals who want to write their own reports but don't want to have to rely on their secretaries.' Cook reports that one lawyer at his firm has set up a routine so that when he finishes the body text of a letter he simply has to utter 'complete letter' and the machine will finish the formalities and even print the envelope. Although such systems are attractive, they only account for a very small proportion of the voice recognition market, says Rob Walters, of Satin Information Services, the voice systems consultancy. The vast bulk of systems have only a relatively small vocabulary and are 'speaker independent' - they treat every speaker in exactly the same way. Many speaker independent systems are used in conjunction with telephone services, such as telephone banking. The Royal Bank of Scotland, for example, has been conducting trials on a system which enables its customers to order cheque books or pay bills over the telephone. Users of the system need to speak digits, words such as 'yes' and 'no' and a number of commands  -'mini-statement', for example. The bank reports that customers have been enthusiastic. The problem now is to extend the system nationwide by putting the recognition technology on to the company mainframe. Other applications for these small vocabulary systems include cellular telephones. These enable drivers to speak the number - or even tell the phone to 'call the office' - thereby eliminating the need to release the steering wheel. Potential uses include hands-free maintenance or manufacture, so that the grubby-handed mechanic could 'speak' a report to a computer. Developers of such systems include Scott Instruments, the Voice Processing Corporation and Voice Control Systems of the US and BT, Logica and Marconi of the UK. The day when these two types of system can be combined - to produce a speaker independent system that could recognise some 20,000 words - is still a long way off. The problem is the time needed to train the system, says Denis Johnston, senior engineering adviser in speech technology at BT Laboratories. 'You would need thousands of voices to train the system and then thousands more to test it.' But if these problems could be overcome, such a system would work better than user dependent models. 'The integrity of the training would be so much better,' says Johnston. The systems, large or small, use pattern recognition to match the utterance. The sound wave is broken down into small units, usually relating to the frequency of the sound - a fricative (such as the sound 'f'), is usually high frequency, whereas vowels are low frequency. Each unit, of 10 to 30 milliseconds is looked up in a sound library and mathematical algorithms are used to arrive at the best match. Some of the more sophisticated systems match the phonemes, or smallest sound elements, in each word. And artificial intelligence techniques are used to 'teach' the computer to recognise individual speakers' voices. Advances in digital signal processing chips and disc technology have helped to bring voice recognition into the mainstream computer market. So much so, that IBM recently launched a voice-activated computer system for hospital radiologists. Following trials in 10 Italian hospitals, IBM will be delivering its first commercial systems early this year, says Alessandro Fusi, manager of the language technology department in IBM's Rome Scientific Centre. One aim in selecting radiology reports was to shorten the time a patient spends in hospital, says Robert Alexander, of IBM's health marketing division. 'It could easily take two to three days, or sometimes longer, to get the report.' On inspecting the X-ray, the radiologist would dictate the report to a secretary or dictation machine. That would be typed up, and then returned to the radiologist for checking. 'The hospitals have found that more time is spent by the radiologist, but overall the time is reduced,' says Alexander. Although IBM believed the problem would be with the voice technology, it actually arose in developing a system with which the radiologists felt comfortable. 'Every radiologist wanted to add some bells and whistles,' says Alexander. The radiological application uses a PS/2 machine with two additional computer cards and software which can recognise 12,600 words. Each radiologist can add their own words, although no radiologist has added more than 100, says Fusi. The system can, however, recognise up to 26,000 words in more general use. IBM is now looking at applying the system to other medical applications - pathology, for example - and in offices. And researchers in IBM centres outside Italy are working on systems to deal with different languages. The Belgium company Lernout and Hauspie has developed systems that can recognise six languages, including Korean. The company has also devised the technology to recognise continuous speech for specific applications, says joint founder Pol Hauspie. One example is a telephone reservation service for airlines. If the caller reserves a seat on the Boston-to-San Francisco flight at two o'clock the system can pick out the appropriate words. However it will be years before a machine which can recognise contiguous speech - complete, uninterrupted sentences - is developed. According to Johnston: 'Speech is more than words nailed together end to end.'</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Search starts for way to revive CrossRail Ministers and business leaders yesterday began an urgent search for a means of reviving the Pounds 2bn CrossRail project for a cross-London rail link after its surprise rejection by a Commons committee on Tuesday. The government is studying three possible options for overturning the four-man private bill committee's controversial decision: relaunching the proposal as a hybrid bill; promoting it through the new and untried Transport and Works Act; or sending it back to the committee. Whichever method is chosen the project is expected to suffer considerable extra delays. Downing Street last night underlined the government's commitment to CrossRail. A spokesman said ministers would be addressing the situation with 'urgency' because of the time involved in bringing forward a new bill. The Treasury has been told it cannot divert the Pounds 200m earmarked for preliminary work to other projects. Labour and members of the business community also reaffirmed their support for the plan, which would link Paddington station in west London and Liverpool Street station in east London by an underground rail tunnel. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, urged the government to put a motion before the Commons sending the bill back to the committee and instructing them to look at it again. There was a precedent in the shape of a bill to build the South West Durham Railway which was returned to a private bill committee in 1836, Labour said. More likely options are the restarting of the parliamentary process by means of a hybrid bill - so named because it involves both public and private interests. This requires a second committee stage - during which objections, known as petitions, are considered - and is a lengthy procedure. The Transport and Works Act of 1992 would involve the sponsors requesting Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, to lay an order before parliament. Objections are then heard at a public inquiry or inquiries along the route. The Corporation of London said it was working to mobilise City backing for the project. Mr Michael Cassidy, policy chairman, said the corporation would be happy if parliament would approve the principle of the CrossRail link, allowing modifications to the present plans to be made. The proposal has been criticised for failing to provide interchanges with the planned Channel tunnel rail link and with the Heathrow Express link. CrossRail said its 350 staff would continue work on the project's design until a decision was taken on its future. Spending so far amounts to Pounds 109m. The private bill committee has given no reasons for its decision but it is believed to have been swayed by an engineers' report which said the link would not be justified by demand until 2010. The private bill procedure was chosen because the bill's backers were British Rail and London Underground and it involved an infrastructure project that could damage property rights.

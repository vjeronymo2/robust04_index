			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has stressed the  inadequacy of shaping and sharing contemporary and universal  values on paper, adding that the international community should  collectively establish a new order in which peace, cooperation,  and prosperity will reign. Demirel, on an official visit in  Bucharest, participated in the dinner Romanian President Ion  Iliescu gave in his honor this evening. TRT correspondent Mesut  Ertugay reports from Bucharest:    [Begin recording] [Ertugay] Demirel, on an official visit in  Bucharest, participated in the dinner Iliescu gave in his honor.  During the speech he delivered at the dinner, Demirel indicated  that Romania and Turkey, which share the same geography,  historical neighborhood, and friendship, also share a common  future. Explaining that the relations between the two countries  are based on respect and security between states and love and  understanding between the peoples, Demirel said that  strengthening this friendship bridge will further common  interests.    Demirel said extremist movements and aggressive nationalism  are threatening state structures and causing wars in various  parts of the world these days. Noting that international  organizations are ineffective in fighting circles which are the  cause of instability, Demirel stated that regional clashes cast  a shadow over agreements. Demirel stressed that under these  circumstances great duties befall Turkey and Romania. Demirel  said:    [Demirel] We cannot accept that [word indistinct] in our  region be made a center for instability like in the past. The  first condition for this is that all regional states respect  each others' territorial integrity and avoid making the existing  border issues a reason for discussion. The geographical and  historical realities of the Balkans do not permit additional  ruptures.    [Ertugay] Recalling that the borders of the political  geography in the Balkans were reshaped with the countries that  emerged following Yugoslavia's dissolution, Demirel said that  now the main concern should be to find a permanent solution to  the human shame being lived in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Noting that  the developments achieved under the leadership of the United  States are very satisfactory, Demirel said that the Bosnian  Serbs should also show the same political maturity as the  Bosnians and the Croats. Demirel said:    [Demirel] Serbia and Nagorno-Karabakh, within today's  borders, should take their rightful place among the Balkan  countries. We will establish our future jointly and with the  voluntary contribution of all our neighbors. Solidarity will  take the place of clashes in our region. [passage indistinct]    [Ergutay] Iliescu, in turn, voiced Romania's concern over  the clashes in the region. Iliescu stated that the clashes, the  loss of lives, and the refugee drama in the former Yugoslav  territories are preventing the people from having better living  conditions and are adverse to democratic goals. Pointing out  that Yugoslavia supports efforts toward finding a just solution  to the issue, Iliescu added that they believe that a continuous  security system should be established in Europe. Within this  framework, Iliescu stated, they view the NATO as the sole  organization which has the capability of establishing security  in Europe. Indicating that Turkey and Romania have  outstandingly good relations which have their roots based in  history, Iliescu added that they greatly appreciate the Turkish  people's readiness to share their economic and social success.

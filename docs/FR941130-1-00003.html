			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notice is hereby given of the filing with the Hearing Clerk of this recommended decision with respect to the proposed further amendment of the Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 945, regulating the handling of Irish potatoes grown in designated counties in Idaho and Malheur County, Oregon, and of the opportunity to file written exceptions thereto. Copies of this decision may be obtained from Valerie L. Emmer, James B. Wendland, or Gary D. Olson, whose addresses are listed above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act,'' and the applicable rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing agreements and orders [7 CFR part 900]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed further amendment of the Marketing Agreement and Order No. 945 is based on the record of a public hearing held in Idaho Falls, Idaho, on September 8, 1993. Notice of this hearing was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 11, 1993. The notice of hearing contained eight proposals submitted by the committee, which locally administers the order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those proposed amendments would: (1) Redefine ``ship or handle'' to include shipments of potatoes within the production area; (2) provide seed producers with representation on the committee and add authority for the committee to recommend to the Secretary changes in the committee size and composition; (3) update ``Districts'' to show the current composition; (4) require the committee to consider, at least every six years, whether to recommend changes in committee size or reapportionment of committee membership; (5) change committee quorum procedures; (6) remove an outdated assessment limitation of $1 per carload and allow the committee to impose late payment or interest fees, or both, on late assessment payments, accept advance payments, and borrow monies in an extreme emergency for program administration; (7) add authority for the committee to recommend container marking and labeling requirements; and (8) specify confidentiality requirements for handler reports submitted to the committee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The notice of hearing also included one proposal and a portion of another by the Fruit and Vegetable Division, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (Department), which would add requirements regarding the verification of reports; and make such changes as are necessary to the order, if any or all of the above amendments are adopted, so that all of its provisions conform with the proposed amendments. The Department also proposed revising the language in several sections of the order that are in need of updating. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No person testified in opposition to any of the proposals offered at the hearing and no alternative proposals were offered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the conclusion of the hearing, the administrative law judge fixed October 1, 1993, as the final date for interested persons to file corrections to the hearing transcript, proposed findings and conclusions, and written arguments or briefs based on the evidence received at the hearing. On October 1, the administrative law judge extended the deadline to October 15, since the transcript of the hearing had not been received. On October 14, the deadline was further extended to November 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Russell O. Baum of Ashton, Idaho, submitted a comment objecting to the term ``Irish Potato'' as an ethnic misrepresentation of the true identity of the commonly referred potato. He suggested that consideration be given to more accurately renaming the potato by either: (1) Dropping ``Irish''; (2) changing it to ``Burbank Potato'', in recognition of the fact that Luther Burbank originated the major species of potatoes grown in Idaho; (3) changing it to ``American Generic Potato'' because the potato originated in the Americas, and not in Ireland; or (4) adopting any other more correct name. Since this comment is outside the scope of the proposals specified in the notice of hearing, it is denied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

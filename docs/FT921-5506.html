			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Taiwan plan makes virtue out of necessity  -A Pounds 186bn, six-year infrastructure development programme TAIWAN'S Nationalist Kuomintang government is looking to its brainchild, a six-year National Development Plan, to consolidate its support at home and win greater recognition for Taiwan abroad. The plan - which the government calls 'the beginning of responsible government' - is in fact less a plan than a list of things which desperately need doing in Taiwan. A side-effect of the island's economic miracle has been the overburdening of the infrastructure and supplies of electrical power and water, as well as a lack of educational, cultural and recreational facilities; and while the economy has been growing fast, the filth has been pouring into Taiwan's rivers, countryside and air. The six-year timespan was set to coincide with the term of office of President Lee Teng-hui - who is also chairman of the Kuomintang  - which ends in 1996. However, many of the 700 or more projects were started before 1991, and with more than 30 behind schedule at the end of last year, the plan looks set to go beyond 1996. With a budget of TDollars 8.2trillion (Pounds 186bn), the plan includes several big highways, construction of which is already under way and a high-speed railway linking Taipei to Kaohsiung. The need for a fourth nuclear power station is still under debate. As part of an attempt to even out the island's development internally, Taiwan will be divided into 18 new community hubs, each with its own employment opportunities and e and recreation, all interconnected by mass rapid transit systems. The plan is intended to indicate the Kuomintang's commitment to Taiwan in the long term and bolster confidence in the island's political stability, without softening its stance against independence or preconditions for re-unification with mainland China. Stimulating domestic demand and encouraging more investment on the island, especially in research and development, are among other goals of the six-year plan, along with the development of Taiwan as a regional financial centre. The government is increasingly worried that Taiwan will become over-dependent on trade with China through Hong Kong, if the economy does not become more mature. Trade with Hong Kong exceeded Dollars 5bn in 1991. Financing for such a huge plan has long been the subject of a cabinet-level controversy. The government has to find TDollars 3.6trillion from its own capital accounts, including revenue from privatisation, sale of government stocks and the issue of construction bonds. It hopes that another TDollars 2.5trillion will come from investment by public and private companies. Mr Wang Chien-hsien, finance minister, has, however, criticised these estimates as being unrealistic and says 'the financial resources of the entire nation will be needed,' if government finances are not to be overstrained. Mr Wang estimates that in 1992-93 the government must issue Dollars 34 of bonds for every Dollars 100 it spends. Ms Shirley Kuo, head of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, which oversees the plan, is adamant that money is not a problem. Ms Kuo expects that the issue of bonds will make up less than 20 per cent of the government's commitment. 'There are many ways of borrowing from the public. . . . The government is confident of covering the annual shortfall because our people here have always had so much spare money,' she says. The wealth of opportunities for participation by foreign companies has boosted the flow of high-level missions to Taiwan in recent months. Among those successful so far have been Acer John Taylor and London Transport International as consulting engineers, and LT's French counterpart Metra which has won a contract to build an entire line of the rapid transport system. Involvement of other foreign companies has so far mainly centred around the construction of the rapid transport systems, already under way in Taipei and planned for four other big cities. The Anglo-French GEC-Alsthom has high hopes of clinching the contract to make rolling stock for the transport system.</p>

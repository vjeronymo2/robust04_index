			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / German Free Democrats criticise Steffan Heitmann for Holocaust remarks MR Steffen Heitmann, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's candidate for federal president when the post is vacated in May, yesterday came under criticism from the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the governing coalition, for remarks he made about the Holocaust, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. In an interview with the Suddeutsche Zeitung daily, Mr Heitmann, justice minister of the eastern state of Saxony, said: 'The time has come - now that the post-war period is finally over after German unification - to put this event (the Nazi period) in its proper place.' He said the killing of 6m Jews by the Nazis was a unique event, but that Germany 'must not have a special role until the end of time'. Mr Hermann Otto Solms, parliamentary leader of the Free Democrats, told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper that Mr Heitmann's comments 'make me doubt if he has really understood the people of our country and German history'. Mr Heitmann's remarks on the Holocaust follow last week's controversial comments challenging ratification of the Maastricht treaty. In an interview with El Pais, the Spanish daily newspaper, Mr Heitmann was reported to have said the Maastricht treaty had been 'imposed' on European Community countries. 'It was not a result of a big debate over European unification, but it was ordered from above.' The Christian Social Union, sister party of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, still has to decide whether to back the CDU's candidate. But the controversy surrounding Mr Heitmann may persuade the Free Democrats to apply more pressure on Mr Hans Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister, to stand, despite his reluctance.</p>

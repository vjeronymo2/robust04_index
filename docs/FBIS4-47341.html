			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I. Mazheyka, R. Pyatroshyus (Geology Institute, </F> Lithuanian Republic), R. Yasyulyonis and P. Shirvaytis (Physics  Institute, Lithuanian Republic); received Nov. 4,1992; UDC  621.039.8:504(474)]    [Abstract] Recently AESs have become an important source of  tritium in the environment. Its content in AES regions in Russia  and Ukraine has been increasing. Studies of tritium in the  Ignalina AES region have been conducted since 1983.  Concentration of tritium was measured in atmospheric moisture  and precipitation and in surface, ground and artesian water.  Emission of tritium in 1985-1992 as a result of Ignalina AES  activity was calculated. Complex variances of distribution of  tritium in the water objects in the Ignalina AES region  demonstrate its important ecological role. Accumulation of  tritium in vegetation can be up to 200 times higher than  background amount. These effects can occur in the AES region,  and they can affect dose loads.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by Gao Jianxin] </F>   [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Jurists here said that  the recently-issued British report on Sino-British relations  deliberately confuses right and wrong, tries to create chaos and  wantonly interferes in China's internal affairs.    The British report referring to relations between Britain  and  China before and after 1997 was issued by the Foreign Affairs  Committee of the British House of Commons on April 13.    The report indicated that in total disregard of the  interests  of Hong Kong residents, Britain insists on taking the path of  confrontation with China, the jurists noted.    They said that the attacks launched by the report on the  Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region serves  to expose the ill intentions of Britain.    Every article of the Basic Law reflects the fundamental  interests of the Hong Kong people, they said.    However, the report went so far as to attack Article 18 and  Article 158 of the Basic Law as a "serious potential threat" to  the autonomy of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and  the implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration.    That attack is "untolerable and without any reason," the  jurists said.    Article 18 of the Basic Law states that in the event of the  Standing Committee of National People's Congress (NPC) deciding  to declare a state of war or, by reason of turmoil within the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region which endangers national  unity or security and is beyond the control of the government of  the region, deciding that the region is in a state of emergency,  the central people's government may issue an order applying the  relevant national laws in the region.    The jurists agreed that such a turmoil not only endangers  national unity and security, but also seriously damages Hong  Kong's stability and prosperity, as well as the safety of Hong  Kong people's lives and property.    In the event of such a turmoil, China's central government  must act promptly and the NPC Standing Committee must declare a  state of emergency in Hong Kong, the jurists said.    Only by doing so will it be possible to put a swift end to  the turmoil in order to maintain China's unity and security, and  to ensure Hong Kong's stability and prosperity and Hong Kong  people's lives and property, they pointed out.    The jurists explained that as regards other types of turmoil  or riots, such as riots resulting from serious natural  disasters, economic crisis or other social problems, as long as  they do not endanger China's unity or security and are not so  grave as to be beyond the control of the government of the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), the Hong Kong SAR  Government will handle them independently.    Anyone with common sense can conclude that the attack by the  British report on Article 18 of the Basic Law is "totally  groundless," the jurists said.    Article 158 of the Basic Law states that the power of  interpretation of the Basic Law shall be vested with the NPC  Standing Committee.    Jurist Wang Shuwen, who is also an NPC Standing Committee  member, said that the Basic Law was formulated by the NPC  Standing Committee, so its interpretation involves China's  sovereignty.    That article also states that the courts of the Hong Kong  SAR  may also interpret other provisions of the Basic Law in  adjudication cases.    It also stipulates that the NPC Standing Committee shall  consult its committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR  before giving an interpretation of this law.    Half of the committee's 12 members are from Hong Kong.    Article 158 of the Basic Law makes sure that in adjudication  cases, courts of the Hong Kong SAR enjoy a high degree of  autonomy in interpreting all provisions of the Basic Law.    In attacking the two articles of the Basic Law, the Foreign  Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons had ulterior  motives, Wang said.    The articles 18 and 158 serve as a "reliable guarantee" for  a  high degree of autonomy of the Hong Kong SAR, Wang added.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / C&amp;G unveils new payout plan to smooth takeover by Lloyds A new scheme put forward yesterday by Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society for sharing out the Pounds 1.8bn cash bid from Lloyds Bank would increase payments to members to up to Pounds 13,500 for each qualifying account. If the revised arrangements - which exclude from payments investors who opened accounts after 1992 and all borrowers - enable C&amp;G to secure the approval of its members, completion of the deal could sharpen the interest of other financial organisations in acquiring a building society. The original announcement in April sparked renewed speculation that banks and others would court societies for agreed takeovers, since it appeared to overcome some of the difficulties previously associated with such bids. But a High Court ruling in June, which restricted cash payments, showed that some of the hurdles to obtaining the necessary high levels of support from society members for such a deal remained in place. The need to revise the payment scheme has delayed the original timetable by about three months. The meeting at which members will vote is now planned for March 1995, and completion is intended to take place next summer. Under the new arrangements, borrowers will not receive the Pounds 500 cash included in the earlier scheme. Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G chief executive, said he was sure they would bear in mind the rationale for the Lloyds/C&amp;G deal, which was to be able to reduce costs and so offer more competitive rates. While investors who joined the society after the end of 1992 will not qualify for payments, those who do qualify will benefit more. For example, flat rate payments of Pounds 500 will be on the basis of each account, rather than each member; and those who receive percentages of their balances up to a maximum of Pounds 100,000 will receive about 13 per cent instead of the 10 per cent or so the first scheme would have provided. C&amp;G said the average total payment to an individual would be about Pounds 2,000. Mr Longhurst said he was confident the necessary approvals from members would be achieved. He refused to say, however, how many of the society's members would be able to vote on the Lloyds' bid but would not be eligible for cash. This could be important because of the high proportions of members who must actively back acceptance of the offer. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at stockbrokers UBS, estimated that the proportion of investors able to vote but not eligible for cash was less than 10 per cent - not enough to stop the deal on their own even if they all voted against it.

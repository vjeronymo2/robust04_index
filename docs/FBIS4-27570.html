			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Press Pocket" column: "Veiled Toughness"] </F>   [Text] After rejecting IAEA's [International Atomic Energy  Agency] attempt to monitor the removal of spent fuel from the  5-megawatt reactor, North Korea appears to be wary of possible  international sanctions.    According to Naewoe Press, South's official North Korean  watcher, said North Korea abruptly increased radio broadcasts  and newspaper articles arguing that sanctions will not work,  claiming that they will not serve the interests of the United  States either.    Meanwhile, North Korea stresses the importance of dialogue  with the United States for peaceful solution to the nuclear  issue.    All of these are seen to be a revelation of how seriously  North Korea is holding on to the coattail of the United States  to avoid possible sanctions which it really fears, North Korean  observers said.    The radio said North Korea is prepared for either war or  dialogue.    North Korea also took issue with the remarks of Russian  Ambassador to Seoul Georgiy Kunadze. He said North Korea should  live up to all international nuclear obligations as an NPT  [Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty] member.    An article in the NODONG SINMUN, organ of the North Korean  Workers' Party, said North Korea has no obligations citing the  special position of suspending its move to withdraw from the  NPT. Because of this, North Korea is not in the NPT nor out of  it either.</p>

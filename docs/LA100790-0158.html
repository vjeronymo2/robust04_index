			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPPOSING RALLIES IN KIEV HIGHLIGHT DEBATE ON LENIN  </P> <P> A national debate on the historic role of V. I. Lenin was brought into the  streets of Kiev on Saturday, with rival rallies praising and denouncing the  founder of the Soviet state.  </P> <P> About 1,500 elderly war veterans waving Soviet flags and hammer-and-sickle  insignia marched past monuments celebrating Lenin in the capital of the Soviet  Ukraine.  </P> <P> At the foot of the city's largest statue to the Bolshevik chief, about 10,000  people gathered in silence under blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flags at an  encampment set up by students. Many jeered as the pro-Soviet marchers passed.  </P> <P> The Ukraine, the second-largest Soviet republic, has been the focus of much of  the debate on how the country should now view Lenin, for years revered as the  infallible architect of modern socialism in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Rallies for and against him have been staged in various cities, and fierce  arguments have raged over whether to dismantle monuments associated with his  name.  </P> <P> The outspoken weekly Moscow News, in a telling example of the new tide against  Lenin, reported last week that half the inhabitants of Leningrad want the city  to revert to its former name of St. Petersburg or Petrograd.  </P></p>

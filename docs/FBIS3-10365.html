			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Luiz Carlos Azedo] </F>   [Text] Sao Paulo -- Talks are under way between the leaders  of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party [PSDB] and the Liberal  Front Party [PFL] to set up a broad alliance to launch the  candidacy of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso for  president of the Republic and of Deputy Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes,  leader of the PFL-PTB [Brazilian Labor Party]-PSC [Social  Christian Party] bloc in the Chamber of Deputies, for vice  president. Yesterday in Sao Paulo, PSDB bloc leader Deputy Jose  Sierra spent the morning trying to persuade Senator Mario Covas,  leader of the PSDB bloc in the Senate and candidate for governor  of Sao Paulo State, that the alliance is possible and essential  for the country. Covas opposes the alliance because he feels  that the PSDB and the PFL are ideologically incompatible.    Covas' major point of concern is the situation in Bahia  State, where the PSDB members are diehard opponents of Governor  Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, the father of Deputy Luiz Eduardo and  sponsor of the Cardoso-Magalhes slate. Ranking PSDB members in  Bahia such as Waldir Pires, Jutahy Junior, and Salvador Mayor  Lidice da Mata -- who are in favor of setting up an anti-Antonio  Carlos Magalhaes front -- are against the proposed PSDB-PFL  alliance. Senator Jutahy Magalhaes has warned Covas that such  an alliance would cause the PSDB in Bahia to implode.    The economic team would be delighted with a PSDB-PFL  alliance, on which some PSDB sectors have been working from the  outset of negotiations over the stabilization plan. The chances  for this alliance to materialize have improved following the  outcome of the latest PFL meeting last week when Governor  Antonio Carlos Magalhaes described as hasty the launching of his  candidacy and endorsed the idea of an alliance with the PSDB.    Deputy Jose Anibal (PSDB-Sao Paulo) said: The PFL has worked  with the PSDB and has contributed far more closely to making  Finance Minister Cardoso's economic policy a success than the  PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and the PT [Workers  Party]. Aware of this situation, Governor Magalhaes made his  move.    Encouraged by the positive reaction to the proposal, PFL  President Jorge Bornhausen yesterday met with Deputy Luiz  Eduardo Magalhaes and with Senator Marco Maciel to discuss the  issue and the position the PFL should adopt from now on. Yet,  he is elusive about all this.    Bornhausen said: The three of us always work together.  Based on a decision made at the PFL meeting in Recife, we are  going to tour the country until 25 March to sound out the  feelings of leading PFL members. We have contacted the PSDB and  Minister Cardoso and the possibility of a PSDB-PFL alliance has  always been considered but never pursued. Thus far we have not  received any formal proposal from the PSDB to this effect.</p>

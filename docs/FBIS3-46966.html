			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Korea has been given observer status by the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to  its committee on capital movements and invisible transactions  (CMIT), the Foreign Ministry said yesterday [6 January]. The  CMIT is one of five finance-related OECD committees whose  observer status Korea requested in July last year as a step to  becoming a full member of the body composed of 24 advanced  economies in 1996.    A ministry official said that the Paris-based OECD is  expected to allow Korea observer status to the remaining four  committees soon.    The four are the committee on international investment and  multinational enterprises (CIME), the insurance committee, the  committee on financial markets and the committee on fiscal  affairs.    The gaining of observer status to the CMIT, a key move for a  country seeking to join the OECD, is expected to promote  internationalization of Korea's financial and capital sectors,  the official said.    Now, Mexico, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are  active as observers to the CMIT.    The OECD has a total of 26 committees and four organs, of  which Korea is a regular member or observer to 10.</p>

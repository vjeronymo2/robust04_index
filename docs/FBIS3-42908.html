			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Gurvich: "Prime Minister of Russia </F> Approaching the Presidency. Chernomyrdin-Yeltsin, Or Look Who  Just Arrived"]    [Text] Carte blanche. And so many hours of conversation  between President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin about the composition of the new government ended  with the withdrawal from the game of key "market" figures, Yegor  Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, and the destruction of the president's  last stronghold in the government.    Since that day one can say that the prime minister quietly  but openly removed himself from the president's chain of command  and began to move in his own autonomous orbit which is aimed,  quite obviously, toward a future presidency. The prime  minister's new inner circle must clear a starting space for this.    And so we know who left. Who came to replace them?  Individuals who are personally devoted to Chernomyrdin,  especially trusted figures. Oleg Soskovets. Completely  "his"--only such a person can be trusted with the distribution  of quotas for preferential government credit. In other  words--quotas for the approach to the government by large and  medium-sized financial and commercial structures.    Yuriy Yarov--a fairly good person and a convenient one since  he holds no position or real power in the government.    Yuriy Shafranik--a nominee from the petroleum and gas  complex  and thus by virtue of his mentality he has also fallen from the  common "nest." These people can always reach agreement among  themselves.    But this government will not conquer inflation, instability,  or the decline of production. With the departure of Gaydar and  Fedorov, on whom it was possible to place the blame, these  economic troubles will be linked in the public consciousness to  the name of Chernomyrdin personally. But the prime minister does  not want to bear all the responsibility for his failures. Thus  in the government Aleksandr Shokhin will become minister of  economics. He is a figure of a somewhat different level from  that of Gaydar or Fedorov but he is suitable as another  lightning rod.    In this group the appointment of Anatoliy Chubays remains  something of a mystery--he is the only figure among the top  individuals of the current cabinet who is formally supported by  the president. But if we look carefully we will see that he is  assigned the role of embodying the failure of privatization.  Quite reliable rumors have already been leaked to the press and  television: Behind the facade of loud and tasteless advertising  of innumerable age-old investment funds was concealed financial  impotence, if not out-and-out swindling. They were incapable of  paying solid dividends to the investors, and soon their secret  will be told. The failure of checkbook privatization and the  collapse of the majority of so-called investment funds will be  linked to the name of Chubays. This spot will not stain  Chernomyrdin--again far-sightedly and adroitly he sidestepped  the president: Chubays was appointed by a personal edict of the  president "in excess of the established limit of deputy prime  ministers." Chernomyrdin has nothing to do with this.    There are also lesser figures in Chernomyrdin's inner  circle.  As though always in the shadows, they nonetheless do important  work for advancing him toward his goal. Vladimir Kvasov. One of  the strongest apparatchiks who, possibly, will become the  driving force the future election campaign. "Temporarily  assigned" by the prime minister as a deputy to the Federal  Assembly, Kvasov then, by an edict from the president, will also  become a minister. Chernomyrdin adroitly placed this figure in  the field, while successfully working on both flanks--the  legislative and the apparatus.    Gennadiy Petelin is a personally devoted person, the leader  of the secretariat, and he can do a great deal to bring the  candidate for the presidential office closer to influential  industrial and financial groups.    Valentin Sergeyev. An unsinkable bureaucrat who came from  journalism. He is now a cabinet member in Chernomyrdin's  government. A commander without an army. A minister of  information without a ministry, but with delicate functions: to  coordinate the work for creating the image of the future  president.  <H5>  A Chernomyrdin Party? </H5>   On whom besides his inner circle can Chernomyrdin rely in  such far-reaching plans? On the one hand, on the industrialists  with whom he is literally "blood brothers." On the other hand  there is indirect information that the prime minister is also  supported by other large new financial and commercial  structures. But with the foresight typical of such significant  organizations this support, of course, is not given  unconditionally. It is, as it were, based on the concrete  situation, depending on where the new government policy leads.    But for now Chernomyrdin, playing on the interests of  national industry and large Russian banking structures (where he  parts company with his partner--the country's chief banker,  Viktor Gerashchenko, and this will be discussed below), is  actively preparing for the battle for the presidency.    Judging from certain symptoms, we will soon witness the  birth  of a new party--the Chernomyrdin party. It is possible to  predict with a good deal of certainty that it will consist of  two different blocs. On the one hand--political structures of  the regionals being created today by Sergey Shakhray. With them  the prime minister obviously has a personal agreement on  positions in the '96 elections. On the other hand there is a  certain absolutely controllable bloc of industrialists in  parliament, which is now being organized with the direct  participation and coordination of Chernomyrdin's staff.  <H5>  Skokov-Chernomyrdin </H5>   The poignancy of the situation consists in that most likely  Chernomyrdin achieved the formation of a large faction of his  like-thinkers in the party and the overt assistance from  Shakhray's party with the president's consent, finding some  convincing arguments for this. But the outcome is obvious: As a  result of these efforts, fairly strong groups have been created  which are in political opposition to the current president.    It is worth noting that in order to achieve his goal  Chernomyrdin selects people with a great deal of political  ambition. Following his logic he is entering into an unambiguous  political game with Yuriy Skokov. It is difficult to imagine  that these contacts were not sanctioned by the president. But  the motives for returning Skokov to the political arena  presented to the president might very well be one thing (for  example, the need for tactical concessions), and the real  intentions for whose sake some time ago Chernomyrdin spoke with  Skokov for several hours--are quite a different thing. We do not  know whether they agreed upon the conditions under which the  parties would coordinate actions in the '96 elections. But a  step toward interaction between the prime minister and a person  who is known for his haughty and condescending attitude toward  the president has already been taken.    Let us repeat: All the aforementioned steps are apparently  being taken with the president's consent. But is he aware of how  cleverly he is being "led"? Does he notice how quickly the  opposition to himself is being reinforced?    A special role in this sly game belongs to the team of  Chernomyrdin-Gerashchenko. The country's chief banker was  advanced to this key post by Chernomyrdin. The prime minister  has protected him from being ousted several times during the  past year. This concern is no accident: Both of them protect  domestic industry, the military complex, and former state banks.  But they play on differences of opinion in one fundamental  issue. Gerashchenko, in spite of economic logic and decisions of  the higher authorities, with inexplicable persistence is doing  everything possible to bring foreign banks to our country. His  partner in the game opposes him. Nonetheless it is clear that in  reality both today and in the future this is a very solid team.    Well, in 1996 (or perhaps much sooner?) history will show  how  this game of solitaire plays out in the corridors of Russian  power.</p>

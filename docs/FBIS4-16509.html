			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Amangeldiy Akhmetalimov, </F> Gennadiy Kulagin]    [Text] Almaty, 15 April (TASS) -- "Kazakh President  Nursultan Nazarbayev has chronic radiculitis exacerbation,"  Nazarbayev's physician Vladimir Perekhoda told KAZTAG. This is  the reason for his today's absence from a meeting of the  Commonwealth councils of state and government heads.    "The president used to work in a foundry. He lifted heavy  things and once overstrained himself. The trauma later  developed into chronic radiculitis," he said.    "A whole group of physicians is taking care of the  president.  We are unanimous in the opinion that radiculitis and cold  Nazarbayev is suffering from must be cured. That is why, we  recommended the president to cancel his Moscow visit," stressed  the physician.</p>

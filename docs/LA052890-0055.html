			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HONOR GUARDS;  </P> <P> FOR THOSE TOUCHED BY WAR, MEMORIAL DAY IS CHANCE TO REMEMBER;  </P> <P> A NEW LIFE  </P> <P> Tony Lam is a Buddhist from Vietnam, but Memorial Day has become an important  tradition since his arrival in the United States.  </P> <P> The Westminster businessman honors the memory of Robert Burns, the man Lam, 53,  calls "my best friend for 25 years."  </P> <P> Burns was Lam's administrator during the early 1970s when Lam was in charge of  stevedoring at the U.S. military installation at Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam.  </P> <P> Burns was also one of the Americans who sponsored Lam and his family when they  fled Saigon during the turbulent days of April, 1975, when the North Vietnamese  Army was laying siege to the city.  </P> <P> Every Memorial Day, Lam also remembers Robert Shidler, a retired Army colonel  who died last year in Hawaii. Shidler, said Lam, was in charge of the Army  Transportation Command at Cam Ranh Bay; he also agreed to sponsor the Lam  family in their efforts to come to America. Lam flew to Hawaii to deliver  Shidler's eulogy.  </P> <P> "He was the kind of person who was deeply rooted in me," said Lam.  </P> <P> Several of Lam's relatives died in combat in Vietnam, and he remembers them and  others who fought in that war as "valiant people who fought for freedom."  </P> <P> When he looks at the new life he and his family have made in Westminster -- a  successful restaurant and college educations for his six children -- he  remembers specifically the old friends who helped them attain it.  </P> <P> "It really makes me feel that I have the obligation to think of them," said  Lam, "to be grateful that I'm here and safe and happy with my family."

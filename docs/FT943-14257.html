			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Big electricity users not paying too high a price Sir, Electricity users have enjoyed price cuts since privatisation four years ago. The regulatory body, Offer, confirmed this in its recent annual report. Despite this, the Chemical Industries Association says that large users are paying too much ('Big electricity users 'suffering high price rises' ', July 13). The association claims that there are no incentives for 'cost-reflective supplies to large users'. But their own figures, quoted in your report, demonstrate that this cannot be true. They appear to be paying just over 3.5p per unit and they are able to secure this price because they are free to choose between suppliers in an increasingly competitive market place. In comparison, I suspect that small business users, who will not be able to shop around until 1998, would be delighted to pay 3.5p. The large users are right about the charges imposed by the monopoly transmission and distribution businesses. Cost-cutting there would benefit all users.

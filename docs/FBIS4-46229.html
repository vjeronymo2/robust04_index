			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Colombian guerrilla activities monitored through 1  June.    A few hours after the Cano Limon-Covenas Pipeline had  resumed  operations following 20 days of semiparalysis by the fire that  destroyed five plants, guerrillas dynamited the line yesterday,  knocking it out of service. The rebel attack, which caused the  spilling of more than 5,000 barrels of crude, occurred at km 437  in the Municipality of El Tarra, in northern Santander  Department. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 28 May 94  p9a)    The murder of Aguedo Calle, a member of the Communist  Party's  regional electoral commission, Chigorodo, in the Uraba banana  region, disclosed on Thursday evening the existence of a new  group that takes justice into its own hands. Although the new,  self- styled, paramilitary group the "People's Children" (Hijos  del Pueblo) has not claimed responsibility for the crime,  authorities believe it was one of its actions. Alleged  spokespersons for that group have sent a communique to the  Chigorodo Municipal Prosecuting Office claiming responsibility  for the murder of Gabriel Ortega, the Patriotic Union candidate  for mayor, who was shot in Chigorodo last week. (Santa Fe de  Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 28 May 94 p 9a)    A guerrilla terrorist plan to destroy political and  government offices, as well as the Justice Palace in Cucuta, was  discovered in northern Santander Department yesterday. In  addition, an action to disrupt the elections in Cali was  discovered by the 3d Army Brigade. Meanwhile, the killing of two  soldiers and wounding of six were the results of a clash between  troops of the 12th Army Brigade and FARC (Revolutionary Armed  Forces of Colombia) rebels in Guacamayas, San Vicente del Caguan  (Caqueta). (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 29 May 94 p  24A)    Three members of the Civil Registry Office in Cucuta who  were  kidnapped last Sunday by Army of National Liberation rebels were  released last night. The three officials are safe and sound.  (Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish 1200 GMT  31 May 94)</p>

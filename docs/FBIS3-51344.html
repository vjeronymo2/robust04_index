			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified correspondents in Colonia, Uruguay] </F>   [Text] Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy has  obtained assurances from his Brazilian counterpart Itamar Franco  that customs restrictions to bilateral trade enforced by  Brazilian officials that amount to a virtual intimidation  campaign -- through the confiscation of commodities purchased  by Brazilian citizens at the Paraguayan city of Ciudad del Este  -- "will be immediately revised and that the appropriate  corrective measures will be adopted to end this situation that  runs contrary to the integration process between Paraguay and  Brazil."    Early yesterday morning, before the opening of the Mercosur  [Common Market of the South] summit, Wasmosy conveyed this  problem to Franco based on a protest note submitted to him by  Ciudad del Este Mayor Guillermo Campuzano and by the Foz do  Yguazu-based Parana-Paraguay Chamber of Commerce. The note  charges Brazilian customs officials with a harassment campaign  "that has caused a major reduction in the flow of tourists to  Foz do Yguazu and Ciudad del Este, with the subsequent reduction  in sales for stores, hotels, and restaurants." The drop in  business has been estimated at nearly 40 percent.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: NS certificates mature The 33rd issue of National Savings certificates will start to mature from May 1. Investors should check carefully to see when their own certificates mature: after five years, the certificates earn only the general extension rate of 5.01 per cent. Matured certificates can be reinvested in the current fixed interest and index-linked issues.</p>

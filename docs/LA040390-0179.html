			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> DETAILS OF ZSA ZSA'S WORK ASKED  </P> <P> The judge who ordered convicted police-slapper Zsa Zsa Gabor to work at a  women's shelter as part of her sentence wants a detailed accounting of her  hours of community service.  </P> <P> "Kindly send me copies of all records kept to document her community service  activities as to dates, times and activities performed," Beverly Hills  Municipal Judge Charles G. Rubin wrote to the director of the homeless shelter.  </P> <P> Rubin gave Vera Davis, executive director of the Venice-area LIEU-CAP shelter  until April 13 to document Gabor's work there. Gabor was to have completed her  sentence by last Friday.  </P> <P> Davis filed a three-paragraph letter with the court Friday stating that Gabor  completed her 120 hours of community service work but provided no detail. Last  month, the shelter director said Gabor worked about 50 hours at the facility  but completed the rest of her sentence through guest appearances and in  planning a June 8 celebrity auction at her Bel-Air home to benefit the shelter.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Elden Fox said the judge is trying to resolve the  conflicting information. Substituting guest appearances and a celebrity auction  for hands-on shelter work was unacceptable, the prosecutor said.  </P> <P> Gabor has said that planning the auction had taken up "countless" hours and  fulfilled her sentence.  </P></p>

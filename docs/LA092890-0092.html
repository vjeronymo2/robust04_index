			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> SHARP DIFFERENCES EMERGE BETWEEN WILSON, FEINSTEIN;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE CANDIDATES HAVE TAKEN DIVERGENT POSITIONS ON TAXES, SCHOOL  FINANCE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.  </P> <P> As their contest for governor approaches a critical test in October, Democrat  Dianne Feinstein and Republican Sen. Pete Wilson have established sharply  divergent positions on key issues like higher taxes, school finance and the  environment -- defying the perception that there are no substantial differences  between the two political moderates.  </P> <P> California political analysts and commentators have repeatedly characterized  the race as dull, contending that the candidates are ignoring the real issues  and that Feinstein and Wilson seem more like philosophical soul mates.  </P> <P> But during September, when their campaign often was overshadowed by the Middle  East crisis, the candidates added considerable meat to their skeletal policy  positions, either in speeches or in response to questions from reporters. The  result has Wilson sounding more conservative and cautious, particularly on  money issues. Feinstein is more willing to talk about the need for expanded  state programs and new state revenues to pay for them.  </P> <P> The continuing state fiscal crisis -- with the potential for additional taxes  simply to support existing programs -- has emerged as a defining issue that  could dominate the candidates' televised debates on Oct. 7 and Oct. 18.  </P> <P> In light of the temporary balancing gimmicks used to stitch together the  long-delayed state spending plan, the new governor is likely to face a  multibillion-dollar deficit in drafting his or her first state budget.  </P> <P> If California still needs more revenue after making whatever budget cuts she  could, Feinstein said, she would raise the income tax rate for the most wealthy  Californians, couples making $200,000 or more annually. The top rate was  reduced in 1987 from 11% to 9.3%. Feinstein also has endorsed Proposition 133,  which would raise the sales tax by half a cent to pay for anti-drug and crime  programs.  </P> <P> Wilson, by contrast, has said it would be foolish to rule out the need for new  taxes, and has refused to do so, but he has said he would oppose any increase  in personal income tax rates. This week, he strongly endorsed Proposition 136,  which would require a two-thirds vote of the Legislature or the electorate to  increase any state or local tax.  </P> <P> But while he declined to endorse Proposition 133, the sales tax increase, he  said he might vote for it. On Thursday, Wilson said that if Proposition 133  loses, he would be willing to consider an effort in the Legislature to raise  the sales tax half a cent for anti-drug and crime programs.  </P> <P> The candidates also differ on budget reform, school finance and Proposition 98,  the 1988 initiative measure that guarantees public schools at least 41% of the  state's general fund revenues each year. That amounts to about $17 billion this  year out of a total budget of $55.7 million.  </P> <P> Feinstein, with the support of state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig and  the California Teachers Assn., has declared Proposition 98's guarantee  "inviolate" and vowed to oppose any effort to change it. She favors budget  reform that would reduce the level of spending required for some programs by  state law or the state Constitution, but would not cut back on most major  health and welfare programs, which account for nearly a third of the general  fund budget.  </P> <P> Wilson also wants budget reform, but insists that all state spending items,  including Proposition 98, be on the table for negotiated changes. The only  exception is that Wilson would oppose any cuts in the state's supplemental  Social Security payments for the aged, blind and disabled -- a program that  costs $2.3 billion a year.  </P> <P> Both candidates are considered strong environmentalists, but again there is a  key difference. Feinstein is endorsing Proposition 128, the far-reaching  Environmental Protection Act of 1990 dubbed Big Green by its supporters. Wilson  opposes the proposition.  </P> <P> Both Feinstein and Wilson also promise to be activist governors who will attack  problems such as California's unbridled growth.  </P> <P> But Feinstein promises the more aggressive effort, describing her approach as a  "new awakening" fueled by "the politics of optimism and rebirth." Appearing at  an Orange County Democratic meeting in Anaheim earlier this month, she talked  of running a "creative administration" like that of Edmund G. (Pat) Brown in  the 1960s "that built the best university system and built the California Water  Project."  </P> <P> "I want to be the governor that says, 'Wake up, California. Let's move this  state into a problem-solving mode, let's develop that water policy, let's solve  the problems of the environment, let's manage our growth. . . . ' "  </P> <P> Wilson vows to be the real candidate of change but his efforts could be  hampered by his anti-tax stance and conflict with the Legislature's Democratic  leadership.  </P> <P> It has been a struggle for the candidates to get their messages across in a  period when Saddam Hussein and his Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait continue to  dominate the news. Feinstein has been dogged by questions about the business  dealings of her financier-spouse, Richard Blum, who joined with Feinstein in  lending her campaign $3 million for her primary election.  </P> <P> Labor Day marked a major turning point, leaving behind a desultory summer of  exchanges of costly television commercials in which the candidates tried to  taint each other with allegations related to the savings and loan crisis.  </P> <P> The policy differences between them were accentuated by Feinstein during  September as she ventured into the risky world of taxation, pledging support  for billions of dollars for existing state programs and campaigning for  stronger environmental regulation.  </P> <P> The July-August television campaign seemed to result in a standoff. Going into  September, the major public opinion polls indicated that the ad campaign had  little effect. The two candidates were considered to be running about even,  just as they were after the June 5 primary. October and its two scheduled  debates provide Feinstein and Wilson the opportunity to capture the undecided  swing voter.  </P> <P> "There are a large number of people who sort of see Dianne in a positive  context, but they have been comfortable with Wilson the way people are  comfortable with an old pair of shoes," said Bill Carrick, Feinstein's campaign  director. "Those people, in my view, have been postponing their decision until  they get some point of comparison that is beyond the 30-second commercial."  </P> <P> Some political experts have said that Feinstein has to make some sort of  breakthrough to capture voter imagination and defeat Wilson -- something akin  to the dramatic television commercial that propelled the Feinstein image into  the public consciousness in her primary campaign. The ad showed Feinstein  firmly taking control of San Francisco as acting mayor after the shooting death  of Mayor George Moscone. The commercial has not been rerun since the June 5  primary.  </P> <P> Both campaigns say they want to continue discussing issues during October  rather than getting into another television commercial shoot-out. Wilson's  theme, campaign director Otto Bos said, will be: "It's performance that counts,  not promises."  </P> <P> With 23 years of experience in the Legislature, as mayor of San Diego and U.S.  senator, Wilson has a broader record of which to boast. Feinstein held public  office for nearly 20 years, but entirely at the city and county level in San  Francisco.  </P> <P> Carrick said Feinstein intends to continue to emphasize issues and the  intangible values of leadership, believing that voters are getting turned off  by an "electric Ping-Pong" exchange of personal and negative television ads.  </P> <P> "We've been specific on issues," he said. But he also noted that Wilson "has  beaten up on us on taxes." The senator constantly reminds voters that he  actually cut some taxes as mayor of San Diego while Feinstein raised levies in  San Francisco.  </P></p>

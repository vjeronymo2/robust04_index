			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Escudo news enlivens market PORTUGAL'S decision to enter the ERM on Monday and frenzied activity in Finland enlivened an otherwise steady day on the foreign exchanges. The announcement that the escudo would enter a 6 per cent fluctuation band at a central rate of 180 escudos to the D-Mark took the markets by surprise  -traders said they had expected Portugal to wait until the end of the year. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, said sterling's central rate against the other currencies in the ERM would not be affected by the escudo's entry but Mr Nigel Newman, senior economist at Barclays, warned that if the escudo rose strongly within the system it could pressure the lower limits of sterling in the long-run. The dollar sank in late European trading as longed-for positive economic data failed to materialise. Traders said US jobs data for March confirmed market suspicions that the US recovery was proving somewhat anaemic. 'The dollar needs a steady diet of good economic data as it just hasn't got the interest rate attractions enjoyed by the D-Mark,' said Mr Julian Callow, international economist at Chase Investment bank. The US unit closed in London at DM1.6265. Sterling got off to a wobbly start, picked up a little during the day, only to sink below DM2.84 at the close. Jitters began in the morning with rumours in the newspapers that some Middle East countries were dumping the UK currency and pushing sterling towards a crisis. Mr David Coleman, Treasury adviser at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce described the morning's activities as 'crazy'. 'People were selling sterling this morning on the basis of a newspaper story that said there was going to be a sterling crisis,' he said. The pound ended the day at DM2.8350. Turbulence hit the Finnish markets following the announcement by the Bank of Finland's governor, Mr Rolf Kullberg, that he would retire at the end of June. Short-term interest rates soared and currency flooded out of the country. One analyst reported rumours of a Pounds 10bn outflow of markkas. According to one dealer, nervousness intensified after newspaper reports that some academics were calling for a 25 per cent devaluation of the currency. The appointment of Ms Sirkka Hamalainen as the new governor was judged to have come too late to stop the feverish trading, although it was expected to have a calming effect by Monday. The markka ended the day less than half a per cent from its bottom limit against the Ecu.</p>

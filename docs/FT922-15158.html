			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Shake-up at Royal Mail is completed ROYAL MAIL, the letters arm of the Post Office, yesterday completed a reorganisation which has cut management and administrative staff by 3,500 and forced a further 9,000 managers to re-apply for their jobs, Diane Summers writes. The number of reporting levels between the managing director and the postal worker delivering letters has been cut from nine to six. Headquarters staff have been reduced from about 2,000 to 160. The shake-up will result in annual savings of Pounds 60m to Pounds 70m. Nine divisions, each with average turnover of Pounds 300m, have replaced four territories and 64 districts.</p>

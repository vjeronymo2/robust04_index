			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Construction slump leaves Vibroplant 24% behind VIBROPLANT, the plant hire group with operations in both the UK and US, yesterday blamed the slump and price cutting in the UK construction industry for a sharp decline in interim pre-tax profits. Mr Jeremy Pilkington, chairman, said that output in most UK construction sectors is still in decline, and warned that commercial and industrial construction is unlikely to recover before 1994 'at the earliest.' As a result second-half profits are expected to be lower than those in the first half. Although US profits were maintained in the latest period, the reduced UK contribution resulted in a 24 per cent decline in group pre-tax profits which fell to Pounds 2.03m in the six months ending September 30, down from Pounds 2.68m. A further deterioration in construction activity levels in both the UK and the US during the first half, resulted in an 11.4 per cent drop in turnover to Pounds 36.2m (Pounds 40.9m). Earnings per share fell to 2.93p (4.05p) but the interim is maintained at 1.22p although the dividend policy will be kept under review. In the UK, pre-tax profits fell by 34 per cent to Pounds 1.22m on revenues which were broadly maintained at Pounds 18.7m (Pounds 19.3m) including a first-time revenue contribution of Pounds 1.1m from Alphabet Event Hire which was acquired in February. The underlying decline in plant hire revenues reflected a further deterioration in hire rates and the group's 'reluctance to engage in highly marginal business at some of the prices prevailing in the marketplace.' Revenues from the group's US businesses dropped by 19 per cent to Pounds 17.5m (Pounds 21.5m) because of a reduction in machine sales and the sale in March of the loss-making Baltimore business. Rental revenues from continuing businesses increased by 3 per cent and, helped by cost reduction measures and lower financing costs, pre-tax profits from the US operations were flat at Pounds 810,000 (Pounds 821,000). Strong positive cash flow enabled the group to invest about Pounds 3m during the first half, and to continue its objective of reducing borrowings. At the end of September group debt stood at Pounds 32m, representing about 60 per cent of shareholders' funds, down from Pounds 37m, representing gearing of 70 per cent, at the end of March. A further reduction in borrowings is expected in the second half with year-end gearing falling to about 50 per cent. Looking ahead Mr Pilkington noted that the prospects for US economic recovery have suffered 'several false dawns' but added 'we would expect the recovery to start earlier in the US, and proceed more rapidly than in the UK.'</p>

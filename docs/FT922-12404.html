			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Books: Capital culture THE 100 MILE CITY by Deyan Sudjic Andre Deutsch Pounds 20, 313 pages CITIES began as market-places fortified against attack. In this double genesis lies their essence. By bringing together seekers and suppliers they provide an arena for every imaginable kind of transaction, and thereby generate wealth and its concomitant, power. By focusing that power they dominate their hinterlands, once consisting of the passes, fords and arable lands viewable from their watchtowers, but now consisting of economic and political landscapes spreading right across the world. Cities are also the forcing-houses of culture. Rural life enthrals people in long rhythms not of time but of recurrence, whereas city life restlessly pushes people into the future, demanding of them quick thinking and quicker reflexes. Urban existence constitutes a different dimension of human experience, and almost every type of material and intellectual progress is owed to it, as is almost every type of spiritual regress. Until the late eighteenth century the character of the city was a given. Cities were constrained in size by pedestrian endurance, sewerage arrangements, food supplies from the neighbouring regions, the reliance of trade on winds and tides. The city that Aristotle premissed as the setting for ethical life, and the city that Renaissance princes sought to beautify as an expression of their personal grandeur, are in every essential the same. But with the agricultural and industrial revolutions came dramatic change. To point the contrast one need only compare, say, San Gimignano and London. Deyan Sudjic suggests that in the last few years another great transformation has occurred in the nature of the city. It no longer has an identifiable core of civic spaces and monumental buildings; it is a 100-mile diameter catchment area, whose city gates are airports and whose 'centres' are shopping malls. The paradigm is Los Angeles, sprawling vastly under a haze of pollution thrown up by the phenomenon that made it possible: the motor-car. Sudjic's book is a collection of admirably perceptive essays on the nature and implications of these recent changes. In swift, polished, highly readable prose he scrutinises the roles of developers and architects, the experience of work in the city, and the evolving character of tourism, transport, housing, conservation, shopping, and much besides. He is especially good on the themes he identifies as pivotal, some of them unexpected: the economic and cultural significance of the airport, the role of the museum, the effect of 'corporate egos' on city skylines.</p>

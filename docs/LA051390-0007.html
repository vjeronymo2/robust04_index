			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITICS' PICKS  </P> <P> Noteworthy films, with mini-reviews by Times critics.  </P> <P> Sidewalk Stories  </P> <P> Channel 28 Wednesday at 9 p.m.  </P> <P> In this magical 1989 movie, film maker Charles Lane had the audacity to make a  black-and-white silent movie with a brimming heart and an activist's outraged  passion. Lane casts himself as the film Chaplinesque hero, a bashful, ingenious  Greenwich Village street portraitist who unexpectedly finds himself in charge  of an adorable 2-year-old.

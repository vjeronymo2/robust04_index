			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Corporate Finance (8): Profits in the recession - Financial restructuring WHILE the accountancy firms are proud to trumpet their growing involvement in corporate finance, they keep deathly quiet about one of its most profitable aspects during the recession: financial restructuring. Management buy-outs take place in a spotlight of publicity cultivated by the parties involved. Mergers and acquisitions are often celebrated with elaborate tombstones, and the case made in widely-circulated glossy brochures. Only rarely do financial restructurings hit the headlines. News that a company is in discussions with its bankers about rescheduling debt or reorganising its operations is likely to destroy confidence, hit the share price and often precipitate its collapse. 'It's desperately important to keep it quiet or else the company will suffer,' says Mr Richard Reid, a partner in KPMG Peat Marwick's corporate turnround department. 'You can't shout about successful restructurings from the rooftops.' Some companies - such as Maxwell Communications Corporation and Olympia &amp; York - began with work for corporate restructuring divisions, and ended up in insolvency proceedings. However, these examples create a distorted impression. Peat's corporate turnround department, for example estimates that 80 per cent of the restructurings to which it has been appointed have survived as going businesses. Heron Corporation - on which both Price Waterhouse and Peats worked - is one example of a company which has so far managed to cling on. Indeed, the company needed to communicate with its bondholders, and even cultivated press coverage to help put its case clearly and sympathetically. Mr Richard Stone, head of corporate finance at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, lists Berisford, LEP and Vestey Group alongside MCC as companies which at least passed through his department. Other recent high-profile examples among the leading firms have included Brent Walker and News Corporation. Insolvency fee income has helped keep the total income buoyant in accountancy firms, which have seen demand for consulting and other professional services slump in recent months. Restructurings have done the same in microcosm for some of their corporate finance departments, acting as a counter-cyclical source of billings during the dearth of merger and acquisition activity. Nonetheless, the restructuring divisions are keen to separate themselves from any taint of insolvency. Coopers, for example, moved its function into an entirely separate unit five years ago, linked to its corporate finance department. Mr Stone says the merchant banks initially became involved in restructuring work themselves, but soon lost interest. 'They thought they had come across a bonanza, but realised the work was much more long-winded than deal-making, and less rewarding than they first thought,' he says. Restructuring is still a relatively new industry. In spite of growing billings, Peat's division, for example still only numbers five partners. That compares with just one about a year ago. In the previous recessions in the 1970s and early 1980s, it was far less developed. That has changed because of the growing sophistication of lenders, financial instruments and corporations. 'Life was rather simpler back then,' says Mr Richard Mead, head of corporate finance at Ernst &amp; Young. Changes include the emergence of large syndicates of banks, a plethora of new types of loans, and the increasingly international and diverse operations of companies. Mr Richard Stone believes the proportion of companies surviving is probably marginally better than in the previous recession, fuelled in part by a concern about the value of their assets if they do call in the receivers. 'The approach of the banks has been that bit more constructive,' he says. 'You only ever read about the ones where banks appear to be difficult. On many occasions they are very supportive.' He argues that management teams are still too reluctant to bring in outside advice earlier enough. 'They don't want to go to the banks and tell them about their problems,' he says. 'They leave it too late.' One of the reasons has been that during the intense competition of the last few years, traditional banking relationships with clients broke down. As Mr Jerry Acher, of KPMG Peat Marwick, puts its: 'In the 1980s many company treasurers searched for the lowest one-sixteenth of 1 per cent interest to get borrowings down to a minimum. That upset many close relationships.' The typical restructuring, according to Mr Reid, begins with a referral from a bank. A company may have a short-term problem paying its debts, or be anticipating difficulties in the medium-term. The accountants set about understanding the business, and particularly the elements contributing to cash flows. They consider how to deal with any short-term debt problems, and then analyse the operational aspects of the business. Finally, they will present a plan, which might include cost-cutting and reorganisation options for the company, and debt-equity swaps and rescheduling for its bankers. He says that a continuing problem is inadequate management information systems, or systems created during periods of growth and not adjusted to be attuned to the downturn. Insufficient sensitivity to cash flow problems catches many managers unaware. And many directors have no experience of senior managerial jobs during a previous recession. The accountants working on restructuring projects are sensitive to the charge that they are having to make good the wrongs of the corporate finance excesses during the 1980s. 'No-one could have anticipated a recession of this length and severity,' says Mr Acher. Since loan agreements were drawn up, the prolonged recession has hit many companies' ability to pay. That might reflect rises in interest rates, falls in share prices against which loans may be secured, or a disposal of core businesses to help keep the company afloat and sustain cash flows. It might come as a result of financial agreements which were staggered, so that new, harsher repayment requirements are only just being triggered months or years after the original agreement was prepared at a time of economic growth. On one thing the accountants are all agreed. It will be many months yet before their restructuring work goes on the wane.</p>

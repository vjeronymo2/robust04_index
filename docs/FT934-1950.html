			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Arts: Sumi Jo - Recital Sumi Jo's star is very much in the ascendant - front-rank opera houses (Covent Garden among them) are competing for her services, leading record companies are assiduously recording her, and, in London at least, the public has fallen sufficiently prey to her charms to fill the Wigmore Hall on Tuesday for her first song recital. Both in the matter of presence and in exhibition of her exquisitely cultivated soprano - with notes pearly-pure, exactly fashioned and placed, and strung together with the most delicate art - the tiny Korean has up to now made perhaps her strongest impression as the doll in Offenbach's Tales of Hoffmann. At more than one moment during this recital, I began to wonder, indeed, whether it were not being delivered, in character, by the Jo Olympia: for, much of the time, the delivery had a curiously mechanical quality. All trace of human emotion and involvement was carefully expunged; all the chosen music was delivered, simply and insistently, in terms of display. This worked best, therefore, in the coloratura-canary display-items, such as Arditi's Il bacio, in the first half, and the Shadow Song from Meyerbeer's Dinorah, in the second. These were pealed off by Miss Jo with expertly schooled facility and no less expertly supported by Malcolm Martineau, her patient, tactful pianist. The skitterings-about high above the staff were prettily done, the echo-imitations well placed; without being patronising, one easily sensed that hereabouts the singer was on firmest, most secure artistic footing. But when it came to the songs by Rossini, Debussy and Strauss, her inability to contrive a single shade, nuance or punctuation-point of anything that could be appreciated, let alone described, as 'personal response' made for a severe limitation on listening pleasure. Words were regularly turned into mush, whether Italian, French or German; the notion that (for instance) in Debussy's settings of Verlaine poems the verbal images might require equal attention to the musical seems not to have entered Miss Jo's head. In sum, a bizarre experience: I felt badly in need of Hoffmann's rose-coloured spectacles in order to enjoy it the more.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "jiz": "The Entry of the Czech Republic Into </F> the North Atlantic Alliance May Be Feasible in Two Years"]    [Text] Prague--A feasible time for us to join NATO would  be after 1996, when the first stage of the transformation of our  Army is completed. This is what Vladimir Suman, chairman of the  Defense and Security Committee, told the CESKY DENIK  correspondent after meeting [NATO representatives] Loic Bouvard  and Peter Corterier. Furthermore, according to him, it is in  NATO's interest that a country with our strategic location and  economic stability become a member. Suman said that the NATO  representatives' assessment of our republic was unequivocally  favorable. Only Partnership for Peace will test our specific  military ability to cooperate with the NATO armies and the  possibility of joining this structure. In his opinion, the  security development in Europe may electrify the situation.</p>

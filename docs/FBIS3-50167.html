			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Stojan Rumenovski, leader of the diplomatic </F> mission of the Republic of Macedonia in Sofia, by Mariyana  Boyadzhieva; place and date not given: "Bulgaria's Recognition  of Macedonia Was Welcomed With Esteem and Gratitude"]    [Excerpts] [Boyadzhieva] Two years ago, Bulgaria was the  first to recognize the independence of the Republic of  Macedonia. How has this fact contributed to the development of  bilateral relations?    [Rumenovski] For the past two years, Bulgarian-Macedonian  relations have been developing positively. Bulgaria's  recognition of the Republic of Macedonia was welcomed with  esteem and gratitude both at the highest level and by all the  Macedonian people, as well as by all the remaining citizens of  the republic, as you know well. Furthermore, this act acted as a  stimulus for developing mutual contacts in specific fields.  [passage omitted]    [Boyadzhieva] Has the position that Greece has adopted  regarding the name of the Republic of Macedonia hampered the  young state from establishing itself internationally?    [Rumenovski] The Republic of Macedonia is an equal member of  the world community and the United Nations. It has received  international recognition from over 50 countries, most of which  have established diplomatic relations. These include all the  members of the European Union, China, Russia, Japan, and others.  Macedonia does not threaten any of its neighbors. Our  independence and international recognition are not a cause of  instability. Quite the contrary, we have demonstrated -- and  the world is convinced of it -- that an independent Macedonia is  a factor that prevents the war from spreading. The Macedonian  state is a key factor for Balkan peace and stability.    If I have to give a specific answer, it is certainly true  that Greece's position delayed the process of recognizing  Macedonia but failed to halt it. This is an irreversible  process because Macedonia is established as an entity in  international law.    [Boyadzhieva] Bulgarian-Macedonian relations are developing  well at the personal level. What is hindering them from  developing better at the interstate level? The position adopted  by official representatives in Skopje is strange, to put it  mildly, especially regarding the two countries' histories.    [Rumenovski] I would not completely agree with this  assessment. On the contrary, official political contacts are  developing well, as I mentioned previously. With no other  neighboring country is the Republic of Macedonia developing such  lively political contacts. Many ministries maintain regular  contacts between one another. Our Foreign Ministries hold  periodical consultations. However, the political will for  cooperation is not being sufficiently well expressed in concrete  terms. The reason for this is that the legal basis for our  relations has not yet been developed.    Many bilateral agreements are in the process of preparation.  We have already concluded an agreement on economic and  commercial cooperation, a consular agreements, and so on.    As far as history is concerned, it is possible that the  picture seems like this from Sofia's viewpoint. This is  understandable, because many things have been inherited from the  old system and prejudices have accumulated over the years. Both  sides have a lot of work to do on overcoming these viewpoints,  and this will be achieved by developing cooperation in all  spheres, thus strengthening the trust between the two countries.  Similarly, it is normal to expect that the contradictions and  differences of view in this direction will be overcome.    [Boyadzhieva] Bulgaria has opened its embassy in Skopje.  Will Skopje respond by making a similar gesture, and how will  this contribute to bilateral contacts?    [Rumenovski] The establishment of diplomatic relations  between Macedonia and Bulgaria was reciprocal. On 21 December  1993, the two Foreign Ministries exchanged notes on raising the  consulates general in Skopje and Sofia to the level of  embassies. The raising of our interstate relations to the  highest level will certainly speed up and enrich both the  development of Macedonian-Bulgarian relations and understanding  and friendship between our two peoples. In the very near  future, Macedonia will seek approval for its first ambassador in  Sofia. This will open a new page in the relations between the  two countries and peoples.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Observer: Updating an official image The idea of John Major hosting regular White House-style televised press conferences is rather appealing at first sight. The nation's leader could pick and choose his questioners, if not his questions, confident that the nation would hear his answers rather than some biased hack's version of them. The need for a change does not result solely from prime ministerial concern about the bad press he has been getting lately. He feels that the present 'lobby' system is outdated and inappropriate for a government supposedly commited to openness. The question is: how can the system be reformed? The biggest stumbling block is sensitivity over the convention that ministers are accountable to parliament. MPs do not like hearing about important announcements being made publicly to newspapers or on television before they are told. The other problem, which might not yet have been noticed in Downing Street, is that formal White House press conferences appear to be a thing of the past under the new administration in Washington. Indeed, it is rather ironic that whilst Bill Clinton can hold his own better than most at formal press conferences, his media advisers are now advocating a much more targeted approach to getting the presidential message across.</p>

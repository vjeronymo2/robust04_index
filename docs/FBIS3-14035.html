According to the spokesman, India is very disappointed by the  Pakistani campaign against India.    Pakistan took back the resolution it presented in the United  Nations when India expressed a desire to discuss the various  disputed issues, including Kashmir; expressed its willingness to  add the Kashmir issue to the agenda as a separate item; and some  friendly nations had assured Pakistan of India's serious  interest in holding developmental talks. This resolution was  introduced by the former government with the cooperation of some  friendly nations. When it was taken back, it did not mean that  Pakistan had forfeited its right to introduce it in any other  forum of the United Nations. Providing India an opportunity for  some constructive talks was a step to prove to the international  community that the main stumbling block to these talks is  India's stubbornness. Thus, Pakistan initiated talks at the  foreign secretary level in Islamabad at the beginning of  January. Seeing India's negative attitude, however, we fought  India's efforts to lengthen these talks. The opposition  expressed anger and disappointment at our government's step and  reproached the government. The government, however, had made it  clear that if the these talks failed, it would raise the Kashmir  issue at every regional and international forum.    At present, the situation is that Pakistan distributed a  draft of the resolution among commission members, and its  representatives are lobbying with representatives of other  countries to pass this resolution. Russia, the United States,  and Great Britain have expressed displeasure at India's  attitude, and India is worried that on 25 January, when this  resolution is introduced in the Human Rights Commission meeting  in Geneva, it will face failure and disappointment. Prime  Minister Benazir Bhutto, Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali,  and some diplomats have raised this issue among the  international organizations very effectively. Therefore, it is  expected that this Pakistani resolution in support of the  Kashmiri people's struggle will be approved. Thus, the struggle  of the Kashmiri people will get the moral and political support  of the international community.    The fact is that the present government has not shown any  hesitation or weakness on the Kashmir issue. Instead, Prime  Minister Benazir Bhutto, after giving a decisive opportunity for  some serious talks, and after their failure, has raised this  issue during all her foreign trips and in front of various  international agencies. The Indian government's reaction also  proves that Pakistan's diplomacy on this front has been  successful, and that they are threatened by it. They have come  down to various negative and capricious actions. Keeping in mind  the solid efforts by our government, we can expect that the  Human Rights Commission will approve the resolution and that the  international community will increase its pressure on India.  That, in turn, will force India to involve itself in  result-oriented talks with Pakistan. Its threat of canceling the  talks will only prove to be a false one. Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto, in a speech in Lahore, expressed her support for the  Kashmiri people's struggle for freedom. She said, "Pakistan  supports the Kashmiri people's struggle for freedom and will  continue to do so. We want to see the Kashmiri people free in  the 21st century." There is no doubt that Pakistan is very busy  supporting the Kashmiri people's cause on the diplomatic front;  however, bearing in the mind the seriousness of this situation  and the political ups and downs in this region and at the  international level, we must ensure that our nation is united in  action and thought. We lack this unity, and our weakness on the  internal front can affect our efforts on the external front.  Particularly in the National Assembly, the opposition's  confrontation with the government, blocking the passage of laws,  the making of flagrant accusations against each other, and  starting a no-confidence campaign against the chief minister in  the assembly have all created a situation that is unacceptable.  All these are destructive incidents and keeping in mind India's  attitude about the Kashmir issue, the Indian government's  threats of war against us, and threats of some serious  consequences all demand that we be fully united in our country  to be effective in our foreign affairs. The nation demands that  our politicians and leaders be aware of their responsibilities.  Only then can we play a constructive role in making sure that  the freedom struggle of the Kashmiri people is successful.  *</p>

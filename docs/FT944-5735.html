			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / World Trade News: EU to amend origin rules After a long internal battle, the European Commission has approved modest proposals for changes in rules of origin as part of its effort to boost trade and investment in central and eastern Europe. EU leaders are expected to adopt the proposals at next week's European Council summit in Essen as part of a more generous market access package for the six associate EU members: Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania. Rules of origin determine whether products receive preferential tariff treatment, and are viewed as a test of the EU's commitment to integrating eastern European countries as full members. The rules are particularly important in industries such as textiles, electronics and motor vehicles which involve processing or transforming materials and goods imported from outside the preferential trade zone. The battle within the commission centred on how far free traders led by Sir Leon Brittan would overcome resistance from, among others, French and Portuguese lobbies worried about likely job losses resulting from progressive harmonisation of rules of origin. Some estimates ran as high as 100,000 jobs at risk in the textile industry alone, said a senior commission official. The specific issue at stake was the degree of 'cumulation' of origin, whereby products originating in partner countries such as Hungary or Poland could be used in another partner country such as Bulgaria to yield a finished product in that country eligible for preferential tariff treatment. After more than a year's debate, the Commission adopted a step-by-step approach covering the EU, the European Free Trade Association and the six eastern European countries. The first stage would streamline and simplify rules of origin in existing agreements with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia; extend these rules to Bulgaria and Romania; and consider extending full cumulation to Switzerland. Shortly thereafter, it would introduce 'diagonal' cumulation between the EU/Efta countries and the six east Europeans. This would would create a common European area of origin, but it would not cover Asian and US assembly plants in eastern Europe seeking preferential trade access to the EU. Full cumulation. The commission failed, however, to set a date and made this stage conditional on a 'thorough evaluation' of the impact on employment in the EU. It could also lead to limited sectoral exceptions, according to a commission paper to be sent to EU ministers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ['Atif 'Umar commentary: "The Syrian Cards in the Upcoming </F> al-Asad-Clinton Summit"]    [Text] The eyes of the Arab region are turned toward the  upcoming meeting in Geneva Sunday between Presidents al-Asad and  Clinton. The meeting comes while the world is watching the  developments of the Middle East, which sees calm at times and  tension at others. Since the convening of the Madrid  conference, movements toward peace in the Middle East have taken  on new dimensions that finally resulted in the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement, which was signed at the White  House amid international welcome, U.S. support, and Arab  backing. All Arab countries showed an eagerness for a just and  lasting peace based on a land-for-peace exchange and recognition  of the legitimate Palestinian rights as stated in the successive  UN resolutions.    That President Clinton fixed his meeting with President  al-Asad after contacts and consultations by the U.S. secretary  of state in the Syrian capital means that there are far more  points of agreement between Washington and Damascus over Middle  East issues than differences. If that was not the case, what  would the meeting and the talks be for?    Through its contacts and watch of the region's developments,  the United States realizes that peace in the region cannot be  achieved without Egypt and Syria. Now that things have settled  down between Egypt and Israel since the signing of the Camp  David agreement, and the two sides have seen the positive  economic, political, and even social results of the peace  process, this successful experiment can be repeated on the  Syrian front. But the Israelis need to realize that the  continuation of the current situation will have serious  implications. The opponents of peace agreements with Israel use  this situation to support their rejectionist positions, and any  delay in reaching a genuine peace between the Arabs and Israel  would encourage the Israeli parties and individuals that reject  peace agreements with the Arabs, especially since a state of  anxiety and tension still prevails in Israel due to the violence  and counterviolence between Jewish settlers and Palestinians.    The upcoming meeting between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton  may prompt a serious call for a comprehensive peace in the  Middle East. Among his cards at the talks, the Syrian president  carries unlimited Arab support for reaching a just and  comprehensive peace in the region. He also has Saudi support  and blessings for reaching a just solution to the Jerusalem  problem. And above all, Syria has special relations with  Lebanon, which in turn enjoys special relations with the West  and the United States, especially since Lebanon has never been  involved in any hostile acts against any of its neighbors.    We stress that the U.S. Administration, out of its eagerness  to promote the Middle East peace process and to achieve  security, stability, and peace in the region, will give these  factors due consideration and, consequently, push the  Syrian-Israeli track toward serious negotiations to achieve this  peace, which all peoples of the region, including the Israeli  people, aspire to. The Israeli people reject isolation and  demand normalization of relations and the lifting of the trade  boycott. These are vital matters for the Israelis, but as the  Arab League has announced, they are linked to a full Israeli  withdrawal to the 1967 border and to exchanging land for peace.</p>

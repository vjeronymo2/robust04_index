			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / 60,000 join strikes against Hyundai A GENERAL strike yesterday at Hyundai group factories raised concerns that the labour dispute at South Korea's largest conglomerate could affect the nation's economic recovery. About 60,000 workers at eight Hyundai subsidiaries, including its large car and shipbuilding companies, escalated their industrial action by staging an one-day strike after conducting partial walkouts since mid-June. The trade unions were debating last night whether to continue their general strike or revert to walkouts, which have already cost Dollars 300m (Pounds 198m) in lost sales for Hyundai. The workers are seeking pay increases above the 4.7 per cent rise offered by Hyundai. Wage growth at Hyundai last year averaged 16 per cent. The government wants to limit pay rises in the big industrial groups to about 5 per cent this year in a bid to restore the country's competitiveness, which has been harmed by high wage increases since democracy was introduced in 1987. The Hyundai workers are also demanding the company accept Hyundchongryong, an alliance of the Hyundai trade unions, as legal representative in all labour talks. This is likely to strengthen the workers bargaining position. Hyundai now holds separate negotiations with individual company unions within the group. The government fears that a lengthy strike at Hyundai could affect exports since the industrial group is the country's biggest producer of autos and ships. The government yesterday ordered the arrest of four Hyundchongryong officials for their role in the strike. But concerns that the Hyundai labour dispute could spread to other industrial groups appeared to be receding A threatened strike at Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Industries was averted after workers accepted a 4.7 per cent pay offer. Workers at nine of Hyundai's 33 companies have also accepted similarly modest wage rises. The government reported that about half of the wage negotiations in the country's 5,500 leading companies have been settled for this year. Officials also report that the number of industrial disputes have fallen by 53 per cent.</p>

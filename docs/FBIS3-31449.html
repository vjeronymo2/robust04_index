Speaking at a news conference, Colonel Richard Pernod, head  of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Sarajevo sector press  center, could not confirm that the Serb artillery had already  begun withdrawing.    Asked what was happening on the territory of Sarajevo,  Pernod  explained that weaponry was being assembled, and expressed the  hope that the Serb and the Muslim sides would begin withdrawing  within the envisaged period.    He added that "convoys were being formed on the Serb side"  in  five locations: Lukavica, Mokro, Vela, Blagovat, and Saracevac.  As regards the Muslim army, these locations are Malo Polje and  Marshal Tito barracks.    Asked whether the Serb convoys would move in the next 24  hours, Pernod replied: "Naturally, the withdrawal should begin  today, but so far I have no information." TANJUG has learned  from Serb sources that more than 100 Serb artillery pieces on  the territory of Sarajevo have already been put under control  [as received], and that the handover of heavy artillery will be  completed within the deadline agreed on with UN representatives.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Co-op Bank almost doubles to Pounds 8.1m LOWER bad debt provisions and increased interest income helped to nearly double pre-tax profits at Co-operative Bank to Pounds 8.1m in the 28 weeks to July 23. In interim figures released yesterday, the bank reported earnings of 0.37p per share, compared with losses of 0.02p in the first half last year. Mr Terry Thomas, managing director, said: 'We are very pleased. We are ahead of where we thought we would be.' The bank reduced provisions against bad debts by 14 per cent to Pounds 19.5m (Pounds 22.8m). Mr Thomas said the reduction reflected more customers repaying their debts and a 'cleaning out' of the corporate loan book. Net interest income was Pounds 69.4m (Pounds 67.9m), after a reduction in interest receivable to Pounds 133.7m (Pounds 178m) was more than offset by a reduced interest charge of Pounds 64.3m (Pounds 110.2m). Dealing profits more than doubled to Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 760,000), while non-interest income rose substantially to Pounds 55.8m (Pounds 49.2m). Deposits rose by nearly 9 per cent, which Mr Thomas said partly reflected the bank's ethical code launched last year. He said 36 per cent of new customers mentioned this as one reason why they joined. Staff costs rose to Pounds 43.3m (Pounds 41.3m) including severance payments and miscellaneous costs of Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 2.2m). Other expenses jumped to Pounds 43.8m (Pounds 35.9m). These included higher marketing and promotional costs, enhancing customer services - including a switch to 24-hour operation of telephone banking and work on centralised banking administration - technology and other infrastructure developments. Operating income rose 8 per cent to Pounds 119.4m (Pounds 110.3m). The tax charge was Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 1.6m). The interim balance sheet showed contingent liabilities of Pounds 124.4m, down from Pounds 144m. The bank's figures were presented in the format required by FRS 3, the new accounting standard on the profit and loss account. Mr Thomas said: 'For Joe Punter this is just a maze of numbers. And the definitions leave something to be desired.' But referring to the greater disclosure of information required by the standard, he said: 'It must be in the best interests of depositors and shareholders because it's all hanging out for you to see.'</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Butte issues amendment to 1993 accounts Butte Mining, the London-listed company whose main activity is pursuing US lawsuits, has amended its accounts after discussions with the Financial Reporting Review Panel - the accounts watchdog. Butte, which is seeking Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in damages from former managers and promoters, has issued a supplementary note relating to its accounts for the year to June 1993 in its 1994 report and accounts. The panel's statement, the 24th it has issued as a watchdog since its foundation in 1991, expresses concern that a bank overdraft of Pounds 750,000 was shown in the balance sheet as falling due after more than one year. In Butte's opinion the overdraft could not be shown as falling due within a year and still give a true and fair view of the company's affairs. It claimed the overdraft payment was entangled with a Montana law suit and could not fall due within a year. The company, however, did not want to 'become party to a test case'. On two other counts the company had invoked the true and fair override with respect to the cash flow statement but the panel considered the treatment incorrect. It noted that a Pounds 560,000 sale of an equity investment was not shown in the cash flow statement but was 'incorrectly' treated as a cash equivalent. Also, a repayment loan of Pounds 500,000 was not shown because it was 'incorrectly' treated as a cash equivalent.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Credible coffee data base called for Establishing a credible data base on world coffee output must be a priority for producers, according to the secretary-general of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries. Mr Roberio Oliveira Silva told a meeting of the Interafrican Coffee Organisation in Lome that uncertainty over the true levels of supply was contributing to the highly volatile behaviour of the coffee market. 'No organisation exists which has the conditions to assess the world level of production and the conditions in each producing country, including the difficult question of production costs,' he said. 'I am convinced this is one of the most important tasks the ACPC has to undertake: to organise a data base on world coffee production with sufficient credibility to be able to make a difference to the situation in the market today.' The ACPC was established last year when producers introduced a successful export retention scheme. Mr Silva said the organisation also had to work with the International Coffee Organisation to achieve higher long-term consumption. The International Sugar Organisation yesterday predicted a bigger deficit for the coming year of 1.9m tonnes, compared with 1.3m tonnes forecast in September. Production in Europe alone, hit by poor weather in June and July, was expected to be 1.63m tonnes lower in 1994-95. The ISO said a second year of deficit provided strong support for prices at current levels, but warned that big buyers such as China, India or Russia were extremely price sensitive.</p>

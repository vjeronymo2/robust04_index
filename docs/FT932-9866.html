			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Profit from sale of bank denied THE SALE in May 1991 of Impexbank, the trade finance bank in Istanbul which Mr Asil Nadir used to own, did not give him a 'single penny', Mr Nadir claimed yesterday, John Murray Brown writes. Mr Nadir's personal creditors say the sale was in breach of an agreement by Mr Nadir. In 1989, the last financial year before the sale, Impexbank reported profits of TL3.6bn and assets of TL255.6bn. Behind the present row is a battle between Mr Nadir and Mr Bulent Semiler, also a native of northern Cyprus and an adviser to former Turkish president Turgut Ozal, who died last month. Mr Semiler has said the Eliyesil family, the current owners, paid Dollars 8.9m in full for the bank which Mr Nadir bought in 1988, and that Mr Nadir was paid Dollars 4.9m immediately. A due diligence test after the sale established the value of the bank at Dollars 6.9m Mr Semiler is senior director of Impexbank, and through marriage is connected with the Eliyesil family. He was also one of the main figures behind the rescue attempt for Polly Peck International before it was put into administration. Mr Nadir said yesterday: 'I don't know what the situation is now. I've not had the time to look after anything but I intend to.' He added that he planned to travel to Turkey soon to reclaim his business assets. He indicated he would dispute 'vigorously and totally' that and other sales of his Turkish assets.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Missing links European Union finance ministers were right this week to rebuff a European Commission proposal to issue 'Union bonds' to fund investment in large cross-border infrastructure projects. The scheme is deeply flawed. However, the debate it has stimulated offers an opportunity to explore more constructive alternatives. Union bonds, and the so-called trans-European networks they are supposed to finance, owe much to the desire of Mr Jacques Delors, the commission president, for a grand political initiative to fight recession and promote European integration. But his proposals are unlikely to produce those results. At a time when national budgets are under severe strain, and the demands of the public sector weigh heavily on European economies, the EU should think carefully before embarking on a large amount of new borrowing. That might fuel recent rises in long-term interest rates and make it harder for private borrowers to obtain financing. If the EU needs extra funds, they should be sought from the existing lending capacity of the European Investment Bank. Nor has Brussels made a convincing case for its proposed infrastructure projects. It says they will create cross-border links which member states have had no incentive to provide in the past. However, that confuses cause and effect. The priority sectors identified by Brussels - telecommunications, surface transport and energy - have long been dominated by national monopolies. Their myopia, conservatism and resistance to competition - not market failure or lack of demand - are the main reason for Europe's deficient cross-border infrastructure. Too much of the spending envisaged by Mr Delors' plan would be channelled through public sector bodies. As well as being inefficient, that could blunt efforts to liberalise and privatise sectors, such as telecommunications and energy. The EU should instead use trans-European networks to support those goals by maximising the scope for competition and private sector initiatives. These are the most cost-effective way to identify and achieve worthwhile projects. In many promising areas, such as advanced information highways, Europe's biggest handicap is not scarce capital, but over-regulation, which has needlessly restricted opportunities for private investment. The most important contribution Brussels can make is to keep attacking those obstacles. Imaginative and radical policy measures are needed to ensure that trans-European networks are driven by the market, not by bureaucrats' dreams. That way, the idea could breed innovation and enterprise, rather than expensive white elephants.</p>

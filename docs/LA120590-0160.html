Final  </P> <P> BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PADRES SEND CARTER, ALOMAR TO BLUE JAYS  </P> <P> The San Diego Padres sent Joe Carter and Roberto Alomar to the Toronto Blue  Jays today for Fred McGriff and Tony Fernandez in the first big trade of the  winter meetings.  </P> <P> The Blue Jays and Padres broke up a flurry of free agent signings with the  announcement. At last season's winter meetings, the Padres acquired Carter from  Cleveland and he hit 24 home runs and had 115 RBIs.  </P> <P> Alomar batted .287 for the Padres with six homers and 60 RBIs.

He hit 23 homers for the Dodgers in 1986 and  was traded to Houston before the start of last season.  </P> <P> On Tuesday night, the Giants signed reliever Dave Righetti to a four-year  contract for $10 million and started talks with the Twins.  </P> <P> Bedrosian, 33, was 9-9 last season with 17 saves for the Giants.

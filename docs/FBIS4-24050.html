			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg June 21 SAPA -- PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Premier Tokyo Sexwale on Tuesday [21  June] warned of people turning away from the African National  Congress government if premiers were not given their powers  soon. Speaking after a PWV Provincial Legislature sitting at  Nasrec [National Exhibition Center] near Soweto he said people  were expecting him to tackle issues such as housing, health and  education for which he needed powers stipulated in terms of the  constitution.    He and his 10 MECs [members of the Executive Committee] have  been given powers equivalent to that of the Transvaal Provincial  Administration Executive Committee, but many other powers had  yet to be conferred.    Mr Sexwale said people would seek another government if no  progress was made because he had no power to act. Mr Sexwale  hoped an announcement on the remaining powers would be made soon.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (11): Encore for a star performer - Stock Exchange Last year the Warsaw stock exchange became the star performer among the world's emerging capital markets. The challenge this year is to complete its transformation into a fully-fledged capital market institution by ensuring a copious flow of new issues and rapid expansion of the meagre crop of 23 listed companies. The list is expected to double this year. The achievement of 1993 was to attract foreign capital and raise investor interest, and show millions of Poles that a flutter on the market can be more profitable than a bet on the horses, or leaving cash under a mattress. Even in dollar terms average share prices soared by more than 700 per cent, taking market capitalisation close to Dollars 3bn. The surge continued into 1994 with the Warsaw WIG index crossing the 20,000 mark for the first time on February 28. For Poland's fast-growing private companies, and for the government which needs to raise revenue by privatising state companies, high share prices represent a possibly unique opportunity to raise equity capital cheaply. Current price levels, with price/earnings ratios in the high 30s and beyond, are as much a function of limited supply as frenetic demand from virgin shareholders attracted by visions of easy money in what, until now, has been a one-way market, upwards. The worst that could happen in 1994 is a spectacular collapse in over-inflated share prices which would deter potential investors for years. The best would be a gradual calming of prices as investors were offered more and more new companies and new shares. The latter is what the market authorities, and prospective new listed companies, and the government are pinning their hopes on. The market, where trading takes place three times a week under a modified form of the French Bourse system with a 10 per cent limit on daily share movements, survived the September elections with hardly a blip and is backed by the substance of a growing economy and rising profits for many companies. But, on occasions, the prospect of easy wealth has proved too much. When the shares of Bank Slaski made their debut on the WSE earlier this year they were quoted at 13 times the 500,000 Zloty issue price. Then it turned out that most of the 800,000 Poles who applied for the shares were unable to trade them, because of the long delays in getting shares registered. Practically the only shareholders able to sell were employees of the bank, which is the second of nine state-owned banks hived off from the central bank five years ago. The Slaski affair taught some important lessons. Politically, it led to the dismissal of the deputy-finance minister who was responsible for floating the shares, and selling a 26 per cent stake to the ING bank of the Netherlands. With hindsight it was obvious the shares were pitched at too low an offer price. But that was not so clear at the time the share offer was being prepared. Share prices generally were much lower and it was not easy to find a foreign bank to take a significant stake. Foreign banks have been wary of putting capital into Polish banks until a London Club debt agreement was in place. Probably the most important consequence of the Slaski affair is the thorough way the Polish Securities Commission mounted an investigation of the first day's trading, and the speed with which it then decided to close down the bank's brokerage department and censure top management. By this prompt action Mr Leslaw Paga, the tough, independent-minded chairman, raised the already high reputation for probity of the Commission. A reputation for transparency is probably the greatest long-term asset of the stock exchange, which is run by Mr Wieslaw Rozlucki, the president and chief executive officer. But the Slaski affair also revealed the logistical difficulties facing the back-room activities of the new securities industry. Virtually overnight, brokers with little prior experience in an industry which did not exist three years ago, have had to gear up to register and service more than 1m new shareholders. Most of the buyers have no experience of share purchase and only the vaguest ideas of the true nature and worth of the companies behind the share certificates. But this, too, is changing as the popularity of the stock exchange has spawned a growing volume of high-quality financial analysis.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 21 (CNA) -- The research panel under  the National Unification Council (UNC) [as received] will meet  Wednesday [22 June] to discuss ways to promote mutual trust  between the two sides of the Taiwan strait, a presidential  office spokesman said Tuesday.    This will be the first time the UNC research panel has met  since the March 31 Qiandao lake travel disaster in Mainland  China, in which 24 Taiwan tourists were murdered, said Raymond  Tai, deputy secretary-general to the president.    "We hope all UNC researchers will pool their wisdom to work  out ways to boost cross-strait mutual trust and rapprochement,"  Tai, himself a UNC member, told a regular presidential news  conference.    The UNC is an advisory body under the presidential office  that helps formulate the country's policy and blueprint for  China's unification.    After more than four decades of separation, Tai said, Taiwan  and the mainland lack mutual understanding and trust even though  bilateral civilian exchanges have increased in recent years.    As a result, he said, cross-strait relations have been full  of suspicions and misunderstandings, which resulted in bilateral  ties coming to an abrupt halt in the aftermath of the Qiandao  lake tragedy.    Tai said President Li declared in his new year's message  that  1994 will be the year for Taiwan and the mainland to forge  mutual understanding and trust to pave the way for future  cross-strait cooperation.    "We hope mainland authorities will make a goodwill response  to Li's call for the well-being of all Chinese people," Tai  said, adding that maintaining steady, peaceful relations is in  the interest of both sides.    He also said Li is concerned about the recent floods in  southern China and has ordered relevant government agencies to  study ways of getting relief aid to the victims there.    Tai refused comment on a wave of sharp personal attacks on  Li  launched by the mainland media in recent days, saying the  presidential office would not respond to such criticism.    The diplomat-turned spokesman said the Republic of China  [ROC] has never changed its ultimate national goal of promoting  China's reunification.    While seeking to expand its diplomatic frontiers, Tai said,  the ROC will continue to forge good will and rapprochement with  the mainland.    The ROC has unveiled the national unification guidelines to  promote the "phased" development of cross-strait ties and  eventual national unification, Tai noted.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xiao Wang: "892000060040f U.S. Companies Want MFN Renewed"] </F>   [Text] American businesses in Beijing and Shanghai support  the unconditional extension of most-favoured-nation (MFN) status  to China according to a recent poll.    Over 89 percent of U.S. companies surveyed by the American  Chamber of Commerce in Beijing said they backed the extension of  MFN.    And more than half said MFN should be permanent, rather than  under annual review.    The poll, conducted last month under the supervision of  Gallup (China) Survey Company, covered 104 American companies in  Beijing and Shanghai.    About 11 percent of companies declined to comment on MFN.    U.S. President Bill Clinton has until June 3 to decide  whether or under what terms to extend MFN to China for 1994.    The report said 85 percent of companies think their business  will be affected if the preferential trade status is revoked or  changed.    If it fails to get renewed, 48.1 percent said they would  suffer severe losses.    The other half said it was hard to predict the impact on  their business. But 13.5 percent believed the denial of MFN  would affect them for two or three years.  Negative Effect [subhead]    About 17 percent said the negative effect would only last a  year or two.    Still, 11.5 percent of companies were optimistic, saying the  shadowy period would last less than a year.    Nearly half of the companies said the removal of MFN would  cause Chinese and American firms to cut staff, but a third  disagreed.    On human rights, more than 70 percent of respondents opposed  linking human rights to the MFN issue. Only one per cent of  companies regard the linkage as effective.    The report said most American companies are afraid the  cancellation of MFN will play right into the hands of rivals  from other countries competing in the China market.    Over 66 percent of companies were worried about losing  ground  to competitors.    There was also a strong feeling that competition will obtain  more favourable tariff treatment in China.    The Americans also fear the annual review of MFN will  increase their business risks in China.</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> AUTHOR CLANCY SEES END TO WAR  </P> <P> Best-selling author Tom Clancy, whose "The Hunt for Red October" and other  thrillers are noted for their detail of military technology and combat  maneuvers, says an end to war is desirable and possible.  </P> <P> "There's no law of God or nature that says we have to have a conflict  anywhere," Clancy said Sunday.  </P> <P> He is in Omaha through today to speak at a benefit for the Greater Omaha  Chamber of Commerce and the Omaha Public Library Foundation. He is also  scheduled to tour Strategic Air Command headquarters with Gen. John T. Chain,  the SAC commander, as his guide.  </P> <P> Known for being publicity-shy, he reportedly consented to the visit at the  urging of Chamber of Commerce President Bob Bell, a retired Navy vice admiral  he met at the Pentagon.  </P> <P> "I got hustled very skillfully," he said. "I don't mean to seem ungracious, but  I have four kids. I'm just domestic, I'm sorry. I think there were two weeks in  this year I didn't have to leave home for something."  </P></p>

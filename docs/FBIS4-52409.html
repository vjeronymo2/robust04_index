			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Shameless Utterances Reversing Black and White" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam  at "Chongwadae" [presidential offices] on May 4 blared that the  North was "engaged in nuclear development" targeted against  South Korea and that the North was "violating the truce  agreement, not abandoning its ambition for communization of the  South". He also slandered the North's recent negotiation  proposal vis-a-vis the United States to replace the Korean  Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement and establish a new  peace arrangement.    Branding them as shameless remarks reversing black and  white,  motivated by an intention to slander and harm the North, a news  analyst of NODONG SINMUN today says:    They who are hell bent on moves to plunge the nation into a  holocaust of nuclear war, acting as a shock brigade of outside  forces in their "nuclear racket" to isolate and stifle the DPRK,  are slandering the North over its "nuclear development" and  "attempt at communizing the South". This is the height of folly.    Although more than 40 years have passed since the conclusion  of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the United States is still  keeping up its military occupation of South Korea, far from  withdrawing from there, and has reinforced its aggression  forces in South Korea and ceaselessly staged new war provocation  moves against the North together with the South Korean puppets.  This itself is a flagrant violation of the Armistice Agreement.    It is ridiculous and impudent of the traitor Kim Yong-sam, a  colonial puppet without even the military prerogative, to  slander and meddle in the North's just negotiation proposal to  establish a new peace arrangement which will replace the present  armistice body.    In slandering the North, the traitor Kim Yong-sam sought to  calm down sentiments of the people who turn out in  anti-American, anti-"government" struggle and thus defuse his  ever worsening ruling crisis.    But the truth cannot be concealed and the miserable end of  the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is inevitable.</p>

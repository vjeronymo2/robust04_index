			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: TeleWest The decision to pull the Comcast and General Cable flotations is being blamed on 'market conditions'. The same excuse will probably be given if TeleWest is pulled this morning. But it will take more than an improvement in the market to resuscitate plans to float the cable industry. Investors who have been burnt on Eurotunnel will need reassuring that discounted cash flow calculations are more solid this time round. They will also want to know why the valuations being sought in cable share issues are much higher than the prices trade buyers have recently paid for franchises.</p>

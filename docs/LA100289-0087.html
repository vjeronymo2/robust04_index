			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER LETS SCREENWRITER DO JOB AT HOME  </P> <P> When Steve Sharon wrote the screenplay to the Clint Eastwood thriller "The Dead  Pool," he didn't rely much on outside help. He typed away on a computer in his  Huntington Beach home.  </P> <P> He didn't even use a typing service or a research assistant.  </P> <P> "I can do the typing just as quickly myself," he said. "And I prefer to do my  own research so I have a fuller understanding of whatever it is I'm writing  about."  </P> <P> But he does have his own special -- and rather costly -- computer equipment.  And he has attended several seminars on screen writing techniques. "Always  check the background of the person teaching the seminar," he suggests. "If  they've sold some screenplays, it probably gives them more credibility, but  that's not necessarily a prerequisite."  </P> <P> Sharon, 33, also said novice screenwriters probably don't need to invest in a  large library of screen writing books. "There's nothing new being invented  about writing screenplays," said Sharon. "If you've read one good book, you  probably don't need any others."  </P> <P> The business of screen writing is very unusual, Sharon said. "A screenwriter is  someone who creates his own problems and then tries to solve them as creatively  as possible." BRUCE HOROVITZ  </P></p>

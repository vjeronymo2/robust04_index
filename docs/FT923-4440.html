			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Arts: Don't be put out for Jack's Out - Theatre IN Danny Miller's first play, an 'old-fashioned thriller' set in the Brighton underworld (under the Pier, perhaps), Jack is out rather sooner than people had been hoping. The cast-list betrays the fact that we're not to meet him: like 'George and Margaret', the long-expected guests in the old farce, he reaches the threshold just as the lights go down for the last time. By then, the four characters still alive and present have excellent reasons for not wanting to meet him either. It is an old-fashioned thriller, if 'old-fashioned' takes in not only film noir, but the specialised vein of criminal diction that goes back to Runyon and Orton, with a late flowering in 'Arfur' Daley - archly elaborate, stuffed with sinister euphemisms. When Kieron Forsyth's shifty Jules declares that in school he was no good at 'the words', he must be lying: like everybody else, he is hell bent to put a spin and a wink on every single phrase. James Clyde's pretty-boy Luke has rashly taken up with Jack's girlfriend Barbara (Georgiana Dacombe) during Jack's enforced absence. They supply the film noir element, even a bit of Greenery; and there is a practised performance by Richard Tate as Chunky, the shameless old fence. John Challis's looming Frank supplies the real menace, and for all the script's verbal high-jinks he delivers the only real laughs too. There is a strong whiff of television about all this, and one can't help reflecting that TV could have got it into one tidy hour. Jack's Out is longer than that, though the tightening screw of the plot is just about enough to bring you back after the interval to see what happens. I shouldn't recommend a long crosstown trip to watch it, but if you live nearby, Miller's deft script may offer some wry pleasure. Ken McClymont directs; Graham Johnston's inelegant set serves its purpose. Presented by Barmont Productions at The Bush, London W12; until 26 September</p>

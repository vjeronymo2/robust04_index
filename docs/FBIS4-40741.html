			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yegor Gaydar, leader of Russia's Democratic </F> Choice party by correspondent Medvedev in an unidentified office  setting; date not given; from the "Novosti" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] Yegor Timurovich, the congress is over and now one  can sum up some of its results. It seems to me that people and,  in particular, journalists, are wondering who exactly acquired  who. Was it you who acquired the Olbi firm or the Olbi firm  acquired you, the Democratic Choice party?    [Gaydar] We thought that the first two jokes might be  something like this -- the Russia's Choice party bought a bit of  Olbi and the latter, Olbi, bought a bit of Russia's Choice.    [Medvedev] Do you look upon such jokes with a sense of humor  or do you take them seriously?    [Gaydar] I approach them with a sense of humor. I treat this  as something inevitable.    [Medvedev] It was your idea that Oleg Boyko [chairman of the  party's executive committee] was one of the party's leaders.  Why?    [Gaydar] Without any doubt, our party needs intelligentsia  and entrepreneurs. It should not be a party of just  intelligentsia or a party of just entrepreneurs. In my view, we  do better when intelligentsia joins forces with entrepreneurs  and we fail when they act separately. In connection with this,  the idea of including a respected and prominent entrepreneur in  the party's leadership was the right one.    [Medvedev] The president did not send his regards or any  message of greetings to the congress, so your relations with the  president remain somewhat unclear. It was officially stated in  the press some time ago that you still were the presidential  party.    [Gaydar] I really do not like the word "presidential" party.  It evokes an image of orderly files of top officials under the  president's command joining the party. I do not think the  president likes it too much either.    We are the party that is without doubt a political and  strategic ally for the president. This, however, does not mean  that there are no disagreements between us and him. For  instance, an edict on the fight against organized crime was  published this week. I am convinced that it is a mistake. I am  convinced that violation of human rights cannot be justified by  invoking most serious situation with criminality. I am  convinced that attempts to fight crime by curbing human rights  cannot result in anything but administrative racketeering,  arbitrariness, and extortion of bribes. I very much hope the  president will review his decision, that he will listen to our  arguments.    Nonetheless, despite our disagreements even on important  matters, I am convinced that on the most vital matters of  Russia's future, Russian democracy and reforms in Russia, we are  allies and our views coincide.    [Medvedev] It is clear from the party manifesto what its aim  is. It is to win, to win the elections. What is not clear is  who will be the main candidate. If the president decides to  continue his campaign for the presidential post, will Gaydar  fight against him, or will he withdraw from the race? Or is it  too early to ask?    [Gaydar] We will do everything within our powers to ensure  that a single democratic candidate with the best chance of  success is put forward and backed. No one's personal ambitions,  including mine, God forbid, will stand in the way.    [Medvedev] Do you think that with the existing disagreements  between yourself, say, Sergey Shakhray [leader of the Party of  Russian Unity and Accord], and Grigoriy Yavlinskiy [leader of  the YabLoko bloc], is it possible to have a single candidate?    [Gaydar] Well, I think President Yeltsin is the most likely  choice.</p>

She had been shot to death.  </P> <P> Riverside County Sheriff's Sgt. Jon Carlson said Bowie's body was found  Saturday by an irrigation worker about two miles north of Indio and Interstate  10, the route the woman was known to be taking home after an Easter visit to  friends in Arizona.  </P> <P> Carlson said an autopsy determined that she died of multiple gunshot wounds.  Though bullet casings were found nearby, it was unknown if they were from the  murder weapon. It was also unclear whether Bowie was killed at the scene or  elsewhere. There are no suspects in the case.  </P></p>

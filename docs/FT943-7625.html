			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / International Company News: Cemex pays Dollars 58m for Panamanian plant Cementos Mexicanos, the Mexican cement company, has extended its presence in Latin America by buying Cementos Bayano, the Panamanian plant, for Dollars 57.7m (Pounds 37.2m). The plant was sold by the Panamanian government as part of its privatisation programme. Its sales reached 300,000 tonnes of cement last year, about half Panama's domestic consumption, while its production capacity is estimated at 360,000 tonnes of cement and 700,000 tonnes of clinker. The purchase widens the global reach of the Mexican cement company, which is the fourth largest in the world with capacity of 40m tonnnes. Earlier this year Cemex bought a controlling stake in Vencemos, Venezeula's largest cement company, adding to existing operations in the south of the US, in Cuba and in Spain. 'This acquisition represents an important step in our strategy of expansion in the Latin American market and for the first time gives us production in Central America,' said Mr Lorenzo Zambrano, the head of Cemex. Cemex will acquire 95 per cent of the company. The remaining 5 per cent will go to Bayano employees.</p>

			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSING WON'T CURE BROKEN LIVES;  </P> <P> HOMELESS: FRAMING THE ISSUE IN TERMS OF SHELTER ALONE DIVERTS RESOURCES FROM  THE BIGGEST NEED -- REHABILITATION.  </P> <P> Mitch Snyder has found a new way to distort the homeless issue.  </P> <P> Snyder, a homeless activist and head of the Washington-based Community for  Creative Non-Violence, is urging the homeless to boycott the 1990 Census. His  argument: Only a fraction of the homeless will be counted, yielding a number  that the Bush Administration will use to prove that the problem of housing  isn't as serious as thought.  </P> <P> To some, Snyder's boycott may seem strategic, almost rational in calling the  Administration to task on cuts in federal housing assistance. In reality, it's  just another tactic aimed at persuading the public that homelessness is a  housing issue and that more government funding (which would depend, of course,  on higher estimates of the homeless population) will solve the problem.  </P> <P> In truth, homelessness is a symptom of many complex problems: mental illness,  emotional instability, chronic substance abuse, illiteracy, unemployment  (largely due to a lack of job skills) and, most basic of all, breakdown of the  family structure.  </P> <P> The vast majority of homeless in the United States are individuals who are  unable to function successfully in society and who require intensive  rehabilitation. And while they may not fit the stereotypes of the older,  alcoholic male, neither are they mostly young families thrust out onto the  streets by a soured economy and a stingy Administration.  </P> <P> More than a lack of housing, the crack-cocaine epidemic is the single biggest  cause of the great leap in the numbers of homeless people on the streets. And  it is why the average age of the homeless has fallen from around 40 to under 28  in less than 10 years.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, too many "homeless activists" would prefer that the whole story  go untold, largely for fear that it would result in a decline in public  sympathy for the homeless. And while they may have cause for that concern, the  tragic result of continuing to frame homelessness as a housing issue is that  resources are continually channeled into construction of more shelters and  low-income housing instead of the rehabilitation services that the homeless so  desperately need.  </P> <P> By framing the issue in terms of housing, and attempting to manipulate the  homeless through his boycott, Snyder may succeed in advancing his personal  brand of social activism but will do little to advance the needs of those he  supposedly represents.  </P> <P> After 25 years of working with the homeless -- day in, day out as the director  of the Los Angeles Mission and with similar organizations in Northern  California -- I know that shelter and housing alone will do little more than  warehouse the homeless in their own misery.  </P> <P> What's more, the majority of the chronically homeless would be hard pressed to  keep a home if they received one. Because of emotional problems, substance  abuse and low self-esteem -- which is more the cause of their plight than the  result of it -- they generally do not have the wherewithal to manage their  lives successfully.  </P> <P> Snyder or others cannot be allowed to frame the issue in such a way that the  numbers become more important than the real needs of the people. While the  census is a positive first step -- a commendable effort to count a segment of  the population that has been overlooked in the past -- we must resist the urge  to fixate on how many people are homeless. The numbers simply give us a body  count of people with no fixed addresses. They tell us nothing about their pain,  their desperation or their needs.  </P> <P> At the Los Angeles Mission, we will do everything we can to assist the Census  Bureau on the night of the count. Gaining some sense of the size of the problem  is important, even though everyone agrees that the census count will be far  from totally accurate. And frankly, we believe the estimates, which range from  250,000 to 3 million, have often been inflated to attract more government  funding.  </P> <P> The important point is that whatever the count of the homeless population,  whatever estimate any group gives, defining the scope of the problem will never  mean that the solution is simply to pump more federal funds into more housing.  </P> <P> We do not receive government money, so perhaps that's why we are concerned less  about counting the homeless and more about rehabilitating them through  intensive counseling, job training and re-creating a sense of family and love  that they have lost or never had.  </P></p>

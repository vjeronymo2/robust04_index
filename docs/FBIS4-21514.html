			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sean Ryan, environment correspondent, additional </F> reporting: Matthew Loup: "Water Companies Exposed as Worst  Polluters of Rivers"]    [Text] Water companies have become Britain's biggest  criminal polluters, wrecking wildlife and sport along thousands  of miles of river with illegal discharges of sewage. A SUNDAY  TIMES investigation has found they were fined more often than  any other firms last year, with 39 convictions for pollution  offences.    Government ecologists have warned that contaminated  waterways  pose a growing threat to aquatic plants and animals.    Yorkshire Water performed worst. Its 12 convictions in 1993  included two for allowing raw sewage to cascade across a beach  crowded with holidaymakers near Whitby, for which it was fined  &pound;75,000.    Last year Sir Gordon Jones, the chairman, promised that the  company would "undertake whatever investment is required by  legislation in environmental improvements." Last Monday, two  75-year-old pipes burst at its Bradford sewage works, pouring  30m gallons of effluent into the river Aire.    The second longest criminal record belongs to North West  Water. Sir Desmond Pitcher, its chairman, said that its  expertise in tackling environmental problems in the region was  "evident in the contracts we are winning around the world."    The company had seven convictions in 1993, including one for  allowing a tide of raw sewage more than 1ft deep to flood a  hotel in Greater Manchester.    Severn Trent, with six convictions, and Thames, with five,  have also climbed into the top four in a league table of  polluters. They overtook British Coal, ICI and Rechem, the waste  disposal company. All were prosecuted repeatedly in previous  years but improved their performance.    Water companies, which have almost doubled charges in five  years and made a combined profit of more than &pound;1.5 billion  in  1992-93, admit to operating nearly 200 sewage works illegally.  They say it will be another three years before the problem --  first highlighted by THE SUNDAY TIMES "Water Rats" campaign in  1989 -- is brought under control.    The National Rivers Authority (NRA), which monitors the  waterways, said it had detected a substantial increase in  reports of pollution incidents relating to sewage and the water  industry. The number rose from 4,578 in 1988, the year before  privatisation, to 6,420 in 1992.    Fewer than one incident in every 100 results in a  prosecution  by the NRA, according to a study compiled by Friends of the  Earth. Liana Stupples, the group's water specialist, said  government promises of a big clean-up of rivers had been broken.    "Instead, customers face escalating water bills while some  of  our finest rivers are devastated by sub-standard sewage  treatment," she said.    One of the most severely affected rivers is the Roch in  Greater Manchester, contaminated by Rochdale sewage works, which  has breached legal limits on pollution six times since last  summer in spite of a &pound;6m improvement programme.    The failures have angered local inhabitants, who remember  kingfishers swooping on fish that were plentiful in the river  until pollution drove them away. Last week some said they could  not bear to eat meals in rooms overlooking the river because of  the smell.    "If a stranger comes to the door in summer, you're  embarrassed. You see them sniffing and wondering what it is,"  said Michael Greene, 56, a plasterer whose garden backs on to  the sewage plant.    Elsewhere, dozens of smaller rivers have had their wildlife  tainted by sewage. Among them is the Kennet, one of England's  most beautiful waterways, where discharges have been blamed for  encouraging the growth of choking weeks at the expense of  spectacular species such as water crowfoot.    Malborough sewage works, beside the Kennet, is one of 35  identified by English Nature, the government wildlife agency, as  needing relatively small improvements totalling &pound;10m to  protect the rivers of greatest scientific value. Thames Water,  however, has so far refused to do the work, claiming it would  make no significant difference.    The worsening pollution of some of Britain's most attractive  waterways has also dismayed leisure groups. Ramblers have  protested about finding condoms and sanitary towels on the  banks, wile anglers, fed up with finding rivers choked with  stinking mats of sewage fungus, are resorting to legal action.    Four companies, including Yorkshire, are being sued by the  Anglers' Co-operative Association, a pressure group, after  allegedly failing to clear up discharges that left fishing nets  coated in slime.    Rowers have protested, too. On the Aire, Bradford Amateur  Rowing Club has stopped its tradition of throwing a first-time  winner into the water on health grounds.    Sir Gordon Jones, the Yorkshire Water chairman, played down  the significance of the pollution. "We're talking about a  problem, of course, but not a major problem," he said. All but  12 of the company's 620 sewage works now operated within the  law, he added.    The Water Services Association, which represents the  privatised companies, said the proportion of its 4,000 sewage  works failing to comply with legal requirements had fallen  substantially from 13 percent at privatisation. It was estimated  at 7 percent by the NRA last June.    According to the industry, the huge cost of complying with  European Community rules on beaches and urban waste means  improvements to the sewerage system cannot be carried out any  faster.</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / People: Brockbank George Stevens is to step down as group managing director of Brockbank, one of the largest managing agencies at Lloyd's of London. Stevens is understood to have been frustrated at the last minute failure of Brockbank's plans to raise Pounds 50m from a US investor to set up a new company which was intended to invest in Lloyd's next year. The company said Stevens plans 'to pursue other interests outside the Lloyd's market'.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Clinton takes campaign trail President Bill Clinton finally hit the campaign trail on Monday night by venturing out into the Washington suburbs to raise money for Senator Chuck Robb of Virginia. The president told an enthusiastic rally he and the senator had been the subject of unfair Republican attacks. 'They exalt fear over hope, division over unity,' he said, 'and they are brilliant at it.' He also took an oblique shot at Mr Oliver North, the Republican candidate. Never mentioning him by name, Mr Clinton noted the biblical commandment against bearing false witness, a clear reference to Mr North's conviction - later overturned on a legal technicality - in the Iran-Contra scandals. Senator Robb is one of the few Democratic candidates for election who has openly embraced Mr Clinton and sought his help. Equally a large part of the North campaign is to portray Mr Robb as 'Bill Clinton's senator,' thus hoping to capitalise on the president's unpopularity in the country at large and in Virginia, where he was defeated by President George Bush in the 1992 presidential election. Political experts believe Mr Robb is taking a sizeable gamble in hitching his star to Mr Clinton's sagging fortunes. However, the Virginia race remains tighter than expected following the withdrawal last month of Mr Doug Wilder, the former Democratic governor and independent candidate. One recent poll gives Mr North a slim lead, with the third man Mr Marshall Coleman, previously a Republican lieutenant governor, trailing badly. Mr Wilder's withdrawal, it was assumed, would boost Mr Robb by unsplitting the Democratic vote but the former governor still has not endorsed his party rival. Mr Robb is also being heavily outspent by Mr North, who is well financed by the far right-wing and its religious supporters. The Republican campaign chest is already Dollars 15m strong, while the Democratic incumbent has raised only Dollars 3m and Mr Coleman less than Dollars 1m. The estimated Dollars 500,000 generated by Mr Clinton's appearance at two fundraisers on Monday night certainly helps Mr Robb, who has been unable to match Mr North's televised commercial blitz. The senator's aides reckoned that the new infusion of funds could buy 10 days worth of concentrated statewide TV advertising.</p>

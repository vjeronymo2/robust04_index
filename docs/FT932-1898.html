			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Import surge from outside EC raises fears IMPORT VOLUMES from countries outside the European Community measured at the underlying level rose sharply last month, reviving concerns that the trade deficit might worsen in the later stages of a recovery. Underlying import volumes, which exclude oil and erratic items such as gems and aircraft, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 per cent in May compared with April, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. Underlying export volumes to countries outside the EC slipped back slightly in May, although they remain at high levels due to many UK manufactured goods being more competitively priced after sterling's devaluation. In terms of value, the overall trade account last month benefited from high exports of erratic items and from a Pounds 5m surplus on non-EC oil trade - the first for five years. These trends pushed the trade deficit with non-EC nations to Pounds 769m last month, down from a revised Pounds 901m in April and the lowest deficit since September. On an underlying basis, the trade deficit last month for nations outside the EC was Pounds 846m, up from Pounds 785m in April. Figures for the EC are not available yet. Statisticians are ironing out a new system for collecting the data. In volume terms, the underlying level of non-EC imports in the three months ending May 31 was up 2.5 per cent compared with the previous three months, and up 14 per cent on the same period last year. On the same basis, exports in the most recent three-month period were up 6 per cent compared with the three months ending in February, and 12 per cent up on a year ago. Last month underlying export volumes slipped 3 per cent on a high April figure described as 'a bit of freak' by government statisticians. The better export performance in recent months led to a small Pounds 5m surplus on trade with North America last month, and an Pounds 85m surplus in April. This was against the trend of recent years which has normally featured deficits on this part of the trade account. In the three months to the end of May, non-EC exports of manufactured goods totalled Pounds 11.42bn, 7 per cent up on the Pounds 10.67bn for the previous three months. Over the same period imports of manufactured items have fallen 2 per cent. These developments have pushed down the trade deficit on such goods from Pounds 2.23bn in the three months to the end of February to Pounds 1.25bn in the latest three-month period. Even so, due to the steep increase in imports in the past year, the deficit for the past three months still stands higher than for any quarter last year except October-December. Over the whole of last year the non-EC deficit on manufactured goods came to Pounds 4.64bn, from Pounds 2.89bn the year before.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  VALUE OF TRADE WITH NON-EC COUNTRIES        Balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted (poundsm)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 ex oil and erratics*             Exports   Imports   Balance     Exports   Imports   Balance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991         44,477    53,884    -9,407      38,289    45,252    -6,963 1992         46,573    56,510    -9,937      40,522    48,187    -7,665 1992 Q1      11,288    13,618    -2,330       9,832    11,550    -1,718      Q2      11,641    13,898    -2,257      10,106    11,820    -1,714      Q3      11,556    13,678    -2,122      10,048    11,676    -1,628      Q4      12,088    15,316    -3,228      10,536    13,141    -2,605 1993 Q1      13,431    16,784    -3,353      11,538    14,003    -2,465      Jan      4,320     5,414    -1,094       3,738     4,575      -837      Feb      4,434     5,724    -1,290       3,797     4,720      -923      Mar      4,677     5,646      -969       4,003     4,708      -705      Apr      4,659     5,560      -901       3,951     4,736      -785      May      4,649     5,418      -769       3,894     4,740      -846  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *defined as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

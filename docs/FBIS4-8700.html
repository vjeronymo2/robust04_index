			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 17 (TANJUG) -- Foreign Ministers  Stanislav Daskalov of Bulgaria and Vladislav Jovanovic of  Yugoslavia said in Sofia on Sunday that peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina should bring about the lifting of sanctions  against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) which had affected its  Bulgarian neighbours and other European countries.    Jovanovic, who arrived in Bulgaria from Greece late on  Saturday, has told TANJUG the talks brought to light a shared  view that the embargo has been rendered obsolete by developments  in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that it was detrimental to all the  countries in the region.    Jovanovic, who has ended his visit to Sofia and left for  Belgrade, said that there were no questions outstanding or any  serious problems between the two friendly countries.    Bulgaria and Yugoslavia have a large stock of good will and  awareness of the importance of the neighbours and the  inter-relations of their interests and fates, which will allow  their relations to bloom after the lifting of the sanctions,  said Jovanovic.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> 2 GROUPS GET OK TO DON LAPD UNIFORMS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council voted Wednesday to permit off-duty and retired  police officers to wear their LAPD uniforms during crowd and traffic control at  filming locations.  </P> <P> The council also voted to grant the off-duty and retired officers authority to  direct traffic.  </P> <P> Both votes brought the city into compliance with a new state law requiring  off-duty officers who moonlight as private security personnel to wear their  city-issued police uniform. The state law required each city to specifically  authorize the off-duty activity as well as establish rules governing it.  </P> <P> Although the state law did not address the issue of retired officers, city  officials decided that Police Chief Daryl F. Gates will decide which retired  officer may wear the LAPD uniform while at filming locations. Any retired  officer would be required to wear a special badge indicating he is retired.  </P></p>

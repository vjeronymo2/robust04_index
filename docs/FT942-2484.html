			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Books: The peak of her career ON TOP OF THE WORLD by Rebecca Stephens Macmillan Pounds 14.99, 196 pages BEYOND THE LIMITS by Stacy Allison with Peter Carlin Little, Brown Pounds 16.99, 282 pages It turns out to have been a well-kept secret. But few who know her well doubt that Rebecca Stephens has a fascinating tale to tell of how a beautiful upper-middle class English woman became the first Briton of her gender to make it to the top of the world's highest mountain. With few big climbs under her belt she is disarmingly frank about her lack of climbing experience. Up to the very moment of her Everest triumph with the aid of bottled oxygen on May 17 1993, two Sherpas at her side, she does little to hide her reliance on other team members - an act of humility of which the average macho male mountaineer would be incapable. But for most of the book she is less forthright. There is no mention of the startling fact that the famous picture of her on the summit of Everest with her two Sherpa colleagues was in part a fabrication. Virtually every newspaper published it but that flag - with the carefully delineated initials of her main sponsor, DHL, flying from her ice-axe - was taken not at 29,028 feet but at ground level, and patched in afterwards in England. As one of her Everest expedition colleagues put it later: 'To some extent you can sell your soul to your sponsors.' In a sport traditionally associated with amateurism the issue has become even more controversial since last autumn's phenomenal increase in peak fees charged by the Nepalese government. The result has been that Everest by the traditional South Col route has become almost exclusively the preserve of commercial expeditions who charge their clients up to Dollars 65,000 per person for the privilege of being guided up. When Stephens launched her attempt by the same route in spring 1993 the writing was already on the wall: some 85 people climbed the mountain in the five weeks prior to her ascent, 13 of them women. It would be churlish to fault the author for her decision not to elaborate on her sometimes stormy romantic relationship with the colourful and often controversial John Barry, leader of the 16-person expedition that put her on top of Everest. But one longs for a detailed description of her more unusual team members. Where, for example, is the portrait of the acerbic and powerful Bill Barker - a man central to the history of the still unclimbed North East ridge of Everest - and where the tale of Joe Smith, who missed his flight in Moscow and spent three days trying to get out of Llubianka prison to join his fellow climbers on the expedition? Indeed the central dramatic moment of the DHL Everest expedition - Harry Taylor's oxygenless ascent on May 10 and his epic struggle to stay alive afterwards - is given surprisingly short space. There is hardly a quote from this highly regarded former member of the SAS who nearly died just a few hundred yards above Stephens' and Barry's tent on the South Col, bringing her first summit attempt to a fearful and abrupt end. Nor is there a mention by name or nationality of the two heroic but angry Basques who left their own tent that night to drag the blind, frost-bitten climber down to a perilous kind of safety at 26,000 feet. Less than a week later our heroine's own defining moment - the debate over whether she should make a second summit attempt or not - is described in a way that is a model of diplomacy and possibly naivety. With the weather looking threatening and her climbing partner out of action because of his efforts to rescue Harry Taylor, all but John Barry argued strongly in private that she should descend - a fact of which she seems to have been unaware. That she chose instead to go back up is history and true testament to Rebecca Stephen's courage and tenacity. Although twice in her account she refers to coarse remarks suggesting she had no chance of succeeding, she gives little or no space to discussion of 'the woman's role' in the highly masculine world of Himalayan mountaineering. One suspects that for Stephens feminism is not an issue. And there is certainly no soul-searching about the nature of mountaineering or the universe for her. In sharp contrast Stacy Allison reveals all you ever wanted to know and more in her enthralling account of the first American female ascent of Everest in 1988. She bares her soul, her life, her climbs and loves, as perhaps only an American could. In occasionally embarrassing detail, she gives us an account of a life, seemingly one long battle between the sexes, on and off the mountain. She tells of the blond god Scott Fisher; Sue 'killer' Giller, the macho maiden; of how her own mother was deserted by her drunken father; how her husband beat her up; and how she manoeuvred to beat her female colleague to get to the top of Everest first. She tells too of how a French expedition hurled its dead sherpa off Everest in front of her; and how she combatted the expedition leader's chauvinistic half-truths after the climb. And top place goes to her pride in her achievement of becoming a woman housebuilder. Interspersed with all this is a bravura discussion of the philosophy of mountaineering. For climbers, feminists, psychologists and others this is a must read.</p>

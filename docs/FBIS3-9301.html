			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus: "English </F> Conservatism Is Close To Us"]    [Text] Springtime is already well advanced in London at the  beginning of March. The grass is really green; not only  narcissi but also pansies are flowering, and the first fruit  trees are blossoming. Prague seems to be several weeks behind  in this regard.    England is--by the way, as always--the real England. The  taxis are the same as they were before World War I, and the  policemen, too. Respectable gentlemen ride horses early in the  morning in Hyde Park near your hotel. You go through precisely  the same formalities with John Major in front of No. 10 Downing  Street as previously. At dinner in a club with Conservative  Party Chairman Norman Fowler, a fire is glowing in a real  fireplace (just as in the Rothschild banking house). Quite  simply, everything is the way it should be. Only Attali's bank  exceeds your expectations because it is even more ostentatious  (although in very refined taste) than you had imagined.    You again realize that England is and is not Europe. It is  the only important European country that is an island.    It is proud of the fact that, in the period from 1066 to  1945, it never succumbed to an external onslaught, and it has  never lost a war on its own territory. It proceeds from the  premise that, in the 18th and 19th centuries, it spread  throughout the world the ideas of Locke, Hume, and Adam Smith on  individualism, private ownership, a law-governed state, and the  market economy, and that these ideas were--and still  are--formulated in English, and that, by their intensity,  profundity, and ethos, they have left a fundamental mark on  today's world. It does not want to abandon these ideas and its  indisputable independence, and it is from this angle of vision  that it looks at present-day Europe and its unification within  the framework of the European Community (or Union).    It would be an exaggeration to say that destructive  Euroskepticism prevails in England; the British are, on the  contrary, constructive Eurorealists, and I have the feeling that  we are in the same boat. They believe in European integration;  they do not believe so much in European institutions. They do  not want a federalist superstate, but this stance is based on  something else, something far more profound than rigid and  shortighted nationalism. They are, in essence, a unitary state  and are watching closely, from this very angle of vision,  developments in other European states with regard to today's  integrative mechanisms. They are afraid that the Maastricht  model will have, paradoxically for its supporters, very strong  disintegrative consequences. Apart from the danger of Brussels'  bureaucratic centralism, which they are really worried about,  they see no less a danger in the gradual disintegration of  certain existing European states (they see and hear Catalonia,  Lombardy, and their own Scotland; they monitor the Flemings and  the Walloons in Belgium, and Bavaria, also) with only one  possible outcome--disturbing the status quo and the dawn of a  clouded European future. Instead of the European Twelve,  several dozen small states may evolve, proceeding more from the  concept of the 16th than the 20th century.    All of this is important for us, from both the point of view  of our incorporation into Europe and that of our domestic  territorial arrangement. When I discussed this with Mrs.  Margaret Thatcher (this was a couple of hours after the  Hungarian foreign minister had proposed in Trieste the cantonal  model as a suitable method for the future Central European  arrangement), she said "you cannot cantonize the world" and  added that it is vital to clarify what the "natural unit of  self-determination" is. For her (and for me, too), the nation  state is such a unit--that is, not a smaller unit but a larger  one. In this sense, the reasoning in the discussion on internal  and external integration is in fact concordant. Supporters of  regions are supporters of a unionist (if you like, federalist)  Europe, while the critics of the excessive regionalization of  the small Czech state are, at the same time, critics of the  excessive federalization of Europe.    English conservatism is, in many ways, close to us, and I  think that this feeling is mutual. The successes of the Czech  Republic during the past four years are really appreciated very  positively there, and the level of mutual understanding is  unusually great.    When I deliver speeches to the public there (this time in  the  Royal Institute of International Affairs and the Adam Smith  Institute, of which I ceremonially became a member), I have to  "sell" our successes, I have to strive for good publicity for  our country. At home, we are often, for incomprehensible  reasons, criticized for this by our ill-wishers, but I am  convinced that, in essence, we are doing so correctly.    So as not to make an evaluation myself, I will end this  recollection of England with a quote from the influential daily  THE GUARDIAN (of 26 February 1994): "Let us imagine that the  Czech prime minister takes over the presidency of the European  Union and that, at the same time, he becomes involved in a  conflict with French farmers, whom he accuses of being spoiled  by the state.    "The koruna, fully convertible, is attracting extraordinary  attention on world stock markets, and the British press,  pointing to the further loss of British prestige, is complaining  that the Czechs are catching up with us.    "Is this a futuristic fantasy? Or is it Europe at the end of  this century?    "Unless something extremely unpleasant happens in the world,  the Czechs have every right to expect that this scenario is very  close to reality."    We should certainly accept with pleasure this vision of a  British journalist, and I believe that each of us is doing, and  will do, his utmost to ensure that it is fulfilled as soon as  possible.</p>

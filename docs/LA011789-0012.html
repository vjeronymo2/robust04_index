			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: DANCE  </P> <P> Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet is leaving London and moving 110 miles northwest to  the industrial city of Birmingham. The lure: $10.6 million in extra funding.  "The facilities to be built in Birmingham and the new money to be made  available add up to an offer we cannot refuse," explains Jeremy Isaacs,  director of the Royal Opera House. Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet is the touring  section of the Royal Ballet and usually performs in London at Sadler's Wells  Theater, while the Royal Ballet appears at the Royal Opera House, Covent  Garden.

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / International Company News: My Kinda Town heads for the City with Pounds 24m price tag The Chicago Pizza Pie Factory and Henry J Beans are coming to the City, through the flotation of the restaurant owner and operator My Kinda Town, which will have an initial market capitalisation of Pounds 24.25m. Around 90 per of the company is to be sold off through a placing, and subsequent rights issue, and the directors will retain 10 per cent. The initial venture capitalists have been bought out. MKT was formed in 1977 with the opening of The Chicago Pizza Pie Factory by the colourful American entrepreneur Mr Bob Payton. It was followed by the Chicago Rib Shack, Henry J Beans, Chicago Meatpackers, Tacos and Salsa] MKT made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.59m in the year to June 1993, and is forecast to make adjusted pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 1.9m this year. The company will have to make a deferred payment of Pounds 100,000 to management shareholders if profits exceed Pounds 3m in 1995. MKT has expanded aggressively into Europe, and only 39 per cent of last year's sales were derived from the UK. It has also built up a substantial network of franchisees, which should account for 20 per cent of profits this year. It plans to open five new restaurants this year, three in Germany, one in Paris and one in the UK. It currently owns 29 restaurants. The shares are being issued at 10p and trading will commence on May 9. The issue is sponsored by Hill Samuel and Credit Lyonnais with Laing acting as broker.</p>

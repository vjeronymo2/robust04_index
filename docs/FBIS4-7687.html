			<p>BFN     [Text] The Slovak National Party [SNS] did not send its  deputy chairman, Juraj Molnar, to the fifth Congress of the  Liberal Democratic Party in Moscow. This was stated by SNS  Chairman Jan Slota in an interview with TASR today. He said  that Molnar had left as an observer for the world congress of  Slav Orthodox and Christian nations with the consent of the SNS  executive but without authorization to deliver any kind of  message.    According to Jan Slota, the invitation to the congress of  Slavs did not mention the Fifth Congress of the Russian Liberal  Democrats.    The SNS chairman stressed that the SNS has not made any  contacts with Zhirinovskiy's party nor has it the intention to  do so in the future.</p>

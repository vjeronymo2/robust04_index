			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Novell warns of unchanged earnings NOVELL, the computer software company, yesterday announced that third-quarter European sales were weaker than it had anticipated. It now expected its earnings per share for the period to be flat relative to 1992. The announcement came after the close of the New York Stock Exchange, where Novell's shares had already fallen sharply yesterday as analysts anticipated weaker-than-expected results. Novell closed at Dollars 21 1/4 , down Dollars 3 1/2 . Analysts had previously expected earnings per share of around 27 cents, but some cut these forecasts to around 23 cents yesterday. In the third quarter of last year the company made 21 cents. Novell, which is based in Utah and specialises in software to link computers in local area networks, recently acquired Unix System Laboratories from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. It said yesterday that because of the European weakness it now expected total third-quarter revenue, including about Dollars 8m from Unix System Laboratories, to be roughly flat with its second quarter. Net income per share, exclusive of charges due to acquisitions, was now expected to decline modestly from the previous quarter. Revenues were expected to be up 15 per cent compared with the same quarter of 1992. The company expects to announce its third-quarter figures during the week of August 23.</p>

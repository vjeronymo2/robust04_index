			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOL has determined that the four indicators of substantial disruption listed in the interim final rule, coupled with the ``other'' indicator of substantial disruption, strike the proper balance in addressing the concerns raised in the comments. These indicators satisfy the need for standardized criteria that can be used by facilities in determining whether they qualify to file an attestation and by DOL in carrying out its enforcement responsibilities. Therefore, they have been retained in this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, based on its operating experience, the Department has determined that a brief explanatory statement is not necessary if the employer attests to a vacancy rate of 7 percent or more, or to an unutilized bed rate of 7 percent or more. The employer is still required to maintain supporting documentation and to make it available for review at the facility in accordance with &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .350(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. No Adverse Effect <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A nurses' association, a labor organization, and one Member of Congress submitted comments endorsing the Department's approach to determining no adverse effect on wages. The labor organization and the Member of Congress advocated using the same approach to determining whether there would be no adverse effect on working conditions. A nationwide employer organization and a statewide employer association both commented that the rule should state that the wage need only be the lowest point on the prevailing wage range since most H&hyph;1A nurses start out in entry-level positions. One attorney commented that facilities should not be required to get prevailing wage determinations prior to filing their attestations, and another attorney and an attorney association commented that the prevailing wage requirement should be deleted entirely. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful consideration of the comments received, the Department has determined that there will be no substantive changes made to the interim final rule's requirements concerning no adverse effect on wages and working conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement concerning no adverse effect on wages is statutory and, as such, cannot be removed from the regulations. As pointed out in the preamble to the interim final rule: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The phrase ``not adversely affect the wages'' is a well established legal term of art that has been used for decades in alien labor certification programs, with a very specific meaning of at least the area prevailing wage for the occupation *&blank;*&blank;*. Presumably Congress was aware of this meaning in incorporating this language in the INRA. [55 FR at 50506.] <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The prevailing wage rate is derived by averaging the wages paid by a sample of facilities in the geographic area. If the prevailing wage determination was not obtained prior to submitting the attestation, the facility would not have the knowledge needed to determine whether it could truthfully attest to paying each nurse it employs at least the prevailing wage for the geographic area, nor would it be able to attest to having the supporting documentation available at the facility for examination by interested parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operating experience has indicated that clarification is desirable as to how far in advance a health care facility can obtain the prevailing wage from the SESA. Some facilities have allowed an inordinate amount of time to elapse between obtaining a prevailing wage determination from the SESA and filing an appropriate attestation. Since prevailing wage surveys and determinations are frequently updated by SESA's, to minimize the possibility of adverse effect on the wages of U.S. registered nurses the prevailing wage determination should be reasonably contemporaneous with the filing of the attestation. To assure that the prevailing wage determination supporting the attestation is current the regulation at 20 CFR 655.310(e)(1)(i) has been amended to require filing of the attestation within 90 days of the date the prevailing wage request was submitted to the SESA by the facility. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

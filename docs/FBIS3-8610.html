			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Panorama" newscast--relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia </F> Network in Polish]    [Text] [Announcer Martin Zimoch] Dariusz Rossati, the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] candidate for the post of deputy  prime minister for economic affairs and finance minister, has  flown in from Geneva. Tomorrow, he is to meet with Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak, who will decide after this talk  whether he will entrust Professor Rossati with the vacant posts  in the government.    [Begin recording] [Rossati] The point, above all, is to  avoid  misunderstandings later. So, I judge that it is good to clarify  all of the matters that might become subjects of dispute before  the decision is made on the subject of a possible nomination.  So...    [Unidentified correspondent interrupting] What matters might  these be, in your view?    [Rossati] Well, I judge that it is necessary to very clearly  specify the prerogatives of the deputy prime minister for  economic affairs because, probably, the past has shown that,  well, if there is a lack of this, that is a precise  specification of prerogatives, and certain misunderstandings  might ensue on certain matters. And another matter is the  assurance of some sort of good day-to-day cooperation with both  the prime minister and the remaining members of the government.  Well, for this it is necessary to set some sort of procedure  for contacts, meetings. I think that these are not matters that  cannot be determined.    [Correspondent] The case of the Foreign Indebtedness  Servicing Fund [FOZZ]?    [Rossati] I judge that this is obvious. If one carries on  investigative proceedings in such a case as that of the FOZZ, it  is necessary to seek the views of, or to interview, all the  people who can bring something into the case, who know something  about the case. It is just that I am surprised that this is  being spoken of only two and half years after the investigation  was begun. So, in my view, the choice of this moment is, well,  not a coincidence.

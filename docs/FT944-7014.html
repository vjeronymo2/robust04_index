			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: North West links with Bechtel - Two water companies report different non-regulated experiences Shares in North West Water rose 2 per cent to 529p yesterday as the biggest of the 10 UK water and sewerage companies announced plans to link up with US-based Bechtel Corporation, which is one of the world's top engineering and construction companies. The two companies plan to establish a wide-ranging business partnership to pursue international opportunities. Bechtel, which led the restoration of Kuwait after the Gulf War, will also take on the management of North West's Pounds 2.3bn capital investment programme. Mr Brian Staples, North West's chief executive, said the alliance would bring substantial benefits to both partners. North West, which has been one of the most active UK water and sewerage companies abroad, would benefit from Bechtel's procurement practices. The UK company now expected to achieve savings on its investment programme above the 10 per cent indicated just two weeks ago. North West would also be able to step up its international expansion, while sharing the costs of marketing and development. Currently it is spending about Pounds 10m a year. For Bechtel, the link brings in-depth expertise in the rapidly-growing international water and sewerage market. Bechtel is buying North West's engineering division, which designs and builds treatment plants, for Pounds 15m. The companies will form a joint venture in the US, where interest in the privatisation of water services has grown dramatically over the last two years. It is estimated that US municipalities need investment of about Dollars 127bn (Pounds 77bn) to meet current Clean Water Act requirements. North West's announcement almost overshadowed its interim results, which showed a marginal decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 138.2m to Pounds 136.8m for the six months to September 30. Sales were 7 per cent ahead at Pounds 488.4m (Pounds 455.3). Profits were depressed by a Pounds 13.5m goodwill write-off on disposals. The dividend was increased by 8.9 per cent to 8.35p (7.67p) from earnings down 13 per cent to 34.3p (39.3p). COMMENT North West appears to have staged a coup. None of the other water and sewerage companies forging links abroad have found such an internationally influential partner. Bechtel is renowned for its tough procurement practices and the link-up will do much to ease anxieties over thin margins on international contracts, which have plagued North West's strategy for some time. The alliance is also bound to reduce the risk substantially. On the downside, privatisation in the US is slower in coming than expected, and international contracts still carry a certain degree of risk. Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of Pounds 290m before exceptionals and a prospective yield of 6 per cent. Its prospects are more encouraging than for many of its peers.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: TALES FOR A WINTER'S NIGHT BY ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE (ACADEMY  CHICAGO PUBLISHERS: $4.95)  </P> <P> Eight brief, pleasantly convoluted mysteries that resemble Sherlock Holmes  stories without Sherlock. Doyle titilates the reader with seemingly unsolvable  conundrums, but Baker Street Irregulars can easily imagine the master detective  uncovering the dark secret of the Man With the Watches, detecting the paste  stones substituted for the priceless gems in the ancient Breastplate of the  Jewish High Priest or rescuing a ne'er-do-well young heir from the claws of the  Brazilian Cat. In the introduction, Doyle stated that he would like these  stories to be "read 'round the fire' upon a winter's night," a suggestion that  offers a family or group of friends a cozy respite from television.  </P></p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Insurers adapt to different lives - Changes in policies LIFE insurance is supposed to be about protecting your family in the event of an untimely death. While this might seem obvious, the industry appears to have forgotten it amid the proliferation of investment products it has marketed heavily in the past few years. Endowments, single premium bonds and personal pensions, for example, are all mainly investment products where life cover is minimal. Now, attitudes could be changing again, and customers are being offered a range of useful protection products. Many could be worth looking at, since this area has seen little development for some years. Part of the problem is that early death does not seem as great a risk now as it did in the 19th century when the UK's life insurance industry grew up and the most simple form of life insurance evolved. This is 'term assurance' and pays out a fixed sum to your dependents if you die within a set period. This makes it a 'protection' or 'risk' policy. If you do not die within the term of the policy, you receive no money, so there is no investment element. Such insurance tends to be cheap, but is it also rather dated. Parents, even with young children, very rarely go out of their way to buy it. A recent survey for London Life found that 51 per cent of people do not know how much life assurance they have, and only one in five has enough insurance to cover between five and ten times their annual income. In most cases, insurance is taken out because it has to be (as is the case with the 46 per cent of those surveyed who took it out to cover a mortgage) or because it is provided via a company pension scheme (which accounted for 47 per cent of those with cover). Changes in society have created a demand for new angles on term assurance. For example, DBS, the independent financial adviser network, has launched a policy which allows divorced women to insure their husbands' lives. This insures against the risk that their maintenance will be cut off if their husband dies. CE Heath, the broker, offers 'confidential life' which allows you to insure another individual without their permission or knowledge. This is also aimed at the divorced, but also at people in the entertainment industry, banks and financial institutions, and the legal profession. Improvements in medicine have created a demand for insurance which protects you from the financial consequences of surviving a serious illness. Life Benefit Resources will buy policies from people who are terminally ill. The policyholders are offered an average of 69 per cent of the value of their policy (up to a limit of 80 per cent), which they can then spend on making their last days as happy as possible. It is of most obvious use to those who are single, or without dependents. In many ways this converts an 'old-fashioned' life policy into another new breed of insurance, usually referred to as 'dread disease' or 'critical illness'. These pay out on death, or when you contract one of a set list of life-threatening illnesses. Therefore it can also pay for the costs of recuperation, time spent off work, or a stay in a hospice. In many ways these contracts seem more relevant to the problems of today, but underwriters are still 'feeling their way', and the differences in the precise illnesses covered make shopping around for the best-priced policy more difficult. Another form of protection, slightly further removed from traditional life insurance, is the oddly named 'permanent health insurance'. This might better be described as 'sick pay insurance' or 'income replacement'. Such a policy will protect you against the risk of losing income through not being fit enough to work. Such protection is especially important for the self-employed but should also be considered by employees who are not covered by competitive company sick pay arrangements. The underwriting skills needed for this are very different from straightforward life insurance. But traditional insurers have not been able to ignore such policies. The latest entrant to the market is Standard Life, the UK's biggest mutual life insurer. Standard Life has built its reputation on investment performance. Now it will join forces with US-based disability insurer UNUM. They aim to spark life into the stagnant permanent health insurance (PHI) market. Following the launch three weeks ago of a mortgage-linked critical illness policy by Scottish Amicable, this is the strongest sign yet of a shift in consumer demand, brought on by the recession, away from investment-orientated products to policies that provide security and protection. The launch of the new policy, planned for November 16, will coincide with improvements across Standard Life's range of protection-based policies, including the introduction of non-smoker rates on its life term assurance. This also shows an attempt to compete on the price of protection, rather than on investment performance. However, the decision to team up with UNUM could prove controversial. Since UNUM's arrival in the UK two years ago, it has gained a reputation as a hardnosed underwriter which takes a tough line on claims. Its sophisticated system of 'claims management' incorporates a team of counsellors who visit claimants' homes in an attempt to speed both their recovery and return to work, and it has recently been involved in several high profile disputes with claimants over benefits that have been refused or withdrawn. Standard Life said it had chosen UNUM because of its extensive experience in the PHI market, adding that criticism of UNUM's claims handling was exaggerated. UNUM's role in the new venture will be to underwrite and administer the product, which will be branded with the Standard Life name. The basic design of the policy will follow an established format: it will pay out 75 per cent of salary, minus state benefits, after claimants have been off work for either 13 or 26 weeks, depending on the deferral period selected at outset. Perhaps most important, however, the definition of disability to be used to determine the validity of claims will relate to the claimant's 'own' occupation. Other plans require the claimant to be rendered incapable of pursuing any occupation before they pay out. If the policy proves successful, the way should be open for consumers to find ways of protecting themselves cheaply, without taking on over-priced investments on top.</p>

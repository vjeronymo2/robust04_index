He had led his  country's delegation to bilateral talks with Nigeria at the end  of which the two countries agreed to consolidate existing ties  between the two countries. State House correspondent Chris Ngu  has more on the bilateral talks:    [Begin recording] [Ngu] The talks featured a wide range of  bilateral, regional, and international issues, according to a  joint statement issued in Abuja today. Nigeria expressed  support for the determination of the government of Niger to  safeguard the territorial integrity of that country. In that  regard, Nigeria commended ongoing efforts to end the armed  rebellion in the northwestern part of Niger Republic. On the  other hand, the Nigerien side commended efforts of the Nigerian  Government at national unity and reconciliation. Niger  considers peace and stability in Nigeria as inextricably linked  with development and progress of the entire West African  Subregion. The two leaders resolved to reinforce efforts of  their governments to mitigate the effects on their peoples of  the deteriorating international economic environment. Nigeria's  Foreign Affairs Minister Ambassador Babagana Kingibe has more on  other areas of cooperation agreed on at the talks:    [Kingibe] Specific areas of cooperation were considered to  formalize cross-border trade and to enhance the unimpeded flow  of goods and services. They further agreed to encourage private  investments in each other's country and the formation of joint  ventures. They therefore, directed that high level officials of  the concerned ministries should immediately work out the  modalities for effecting these decisions. In addition, the two  leaders directed the joint commission to intensify its efforts  in the implementation of its program of action, especially in  the fields of agriculture, pest control, animal health, and  management of water resources. The two sides reviewed progress  in regional integration. They renewed their commitment to the  realization of the objectives of ECOWAS [Economic Community of  West African States] and the Abuja Treaty of African Economic  Community. The two leaders exchanged views on a wide range of  African and international issues and resolved to make concerted  efforts to contribute to the maintenance of peace and security  in Africa and the rest of the world. In this context, they  expressed their full support to the OAU's newly established  mechanism for the prevention and resolution of conflicts as well  as the UN secretary general's agenda for peace.    [Ngu] The Nigerien head of state extended an invitation to  General Sani Abacha to visit the Republic of Niger at a mutually  agreed date. President Ousmane, who left the country this  morning, was seen off at the airport by Gen. Abacha and top  government officials. [end recording]    At a special dinner in honor of the Nigerien president in  Abuja last night, Gen. Sani Abacha appealed to members of the  Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, to implement  the organization's protocol of cooperation as a way of removing  existing barriers to development and free interaction of peoples  in the subregion. Here is again is State House correspondent  Chris Ngu with the report:    [Begin recording] [Ngu] Gen. Abacha, talking about  cooperation at the subregional and African regional levels, said  that success of ECOWAS would advance the drive toward attainment  of the Abuja Treaty on African Economic Community. Much as,  Gen. Abacha said, he considered development desirable in West  Africa, he is of the view that economic development in the  subregion cannot flourish until all conflict situations are  responsibly managed. For that reason, he called on the warring  factions in the Liberian crisis to implement the Cotonou Accords  for peace in their country. Gen. Abacha noted with satisfaction,  as he put it, the commitment of the leadership of Niger and  Nigeria in satisfying the aspirations of peoples of both  countries. He said that since coming to power, his  administration has embarked on a determined course to create  conditions for a stable and enduring nation. Referring to the  recently established National Constitutional Conference  Commission in Nigeria, Gen. Abacha talked about what he expects  to follow from the commission's work:    [Abacha] As a result of the work of the conference, my  administration hopes to leave for posterity a balanced and  carefully drawn up framework for the governance of this country.  We intend that it would be a framework which will guarantee to  all Nigerians [words indistinct] liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness in a society, where the rule of law reigns supreme and  justice will done and seen to be done to all.    [Ngu] Looking downward the African Continent, Gen. Abacha  expressed satisfaction at political developments in South  Africa, especially the recent decision of Mr. Clarence Makwetu  and the Pan- African Congress of South Africa to call off its  military activities and fully participate in the democratic  elections scheduled for 27 April this year. He appealed to  Chief Buthelezi and the Inkhata Freedom Party to show similar  patriotism. He especially thanked the Nigerien Government for  the role it played in ending the Nigerian Airways plane hijack  with minimum risk of innocent lives.    President Ousmane, in his response to Gen. Abacha's address,  commended Nigeria's efforts at promoting African unity. He  referred to what he called Nigeria's preventive diplomacy  strategy by which Nigeria is involved in many international  peace missions and said Niger would emulate Nigeria in that  regard. He said Niger's role in the Nigerian Airways' plane  hijack was informed by his government's belief in upholding  international diplomatic ethics. Nigerian cultural groups  entertained guests.

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Visit aims to ease Sellafield fears UNION OFFICIALS at the Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria will meet other trade unionists and ministers when they visit the Irish Republic on Monday. The three-day visit, funded by the GMB general union and British Nuclear Fuels, the state-owned operator of the plant, is part of an attempt to counter opposition from the Irish Republic to the reprocessing plant. Five officials from the GMB, the largest union at Sellafield with 3,000 members, will meet union officials and politicians from both sides of the Irish border. The Sellafield delegation includes a shop steward from the complex which controls discharges of cooling water with traces of radioactivity into the Irish Sea. The aim of the visit is to achieve a better understanding of grassroots Irish opinion on Sellafield and to correct mis-apprehensions. 'There's been a lot of misinformation given to them,' said Mr Nick Johnston, GMB branch secretary. Mr Johnston said he did not believe the delegation was taking on management's job of disarming opposition.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Danilo Izaguirre; from "The Morning Newspaper" </F> newscast]    [Text] President Carlos Roberto Reina has stated his  position on the World Bank recommendations to Honduras. The  president refused to consider the recommendations made by the  World Bank. He said efforts are being made to overcome the  crisis, particularly the energy crisis and its repercussions on  the economic stability of our country.    Members of the World Bank and international credit  organizations have recommended that the government privatize the  National Enterprise for Electric Power [ENEE], the Honduran  Telecommunications Enterprise (Hondutel), and the National  Autonomous Aqueduct and Sewage Service (SANAA), among others.  They also recommended that the National Autonomous University  of Honduras be privatized, and school tuition be increased.  These financial institutions suggested that other restrictive  actions be taken so that the government reduces decentralized  institutions and some of them disappear.    All these actions have been included in a document that was  delivered to the government on 2 February 1994. President  Carlos Roberto Reina has said several times he was not going to  yield to international credit organizations. At this time,  Reina ratified that the intentions of the international credit  institutions will not even be taken into consideration, much  less those of the World Bank.    Reina made the aforementioned statements after being  questioned on his visit to the Foreign Ministry.    [Begin recording] [Reina] I come from a meeting with the  foreign minister and the members of the Commission of  Sovereignty and Borders. I gave specific instructions to the  Foreign Ministry.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, what do you know  about  the measures the Reina administration must adopt regarding the  World Bank recommendations?    [Reina] I am not aware of those measures. You are better  informed than I am.    [Reporter] But what will the government's position be? Will  the recommendations made by these institutions be observed?    [Reina] Our position is unchanged. The sovereignty  corresponds to the Honduran people who spoke at the polls. No  measure recommended by any international organization will even  be considered if it does not respect the basic interests of our  people. [end recording]    President Reina's statements were very clear. He said he  will not even consider the recommendations made by international  credit organizations. When asked about the devaluation, this is  what he said:    [Begin recording] [Reina] Those are very technical terms.  What we must do is improve the country's economy. If we do not  improve the country's economy, if we do not produce more, if we  do not close the commercial deficit of Honduras, it will be  useless to have wise people handling these affairs.    I want the Honduran economy to improve because we produce  more, we export more. In addition, the secure supply of food  that I offered during my campaign is a fundamental objective of  my administration, on which we are working tenaciously and with  determination.    [Unidentified reporter]) Are you concerned about the  situation of the ENEE in the face of the latest power outages  and the announcements made by this institution? Will the supply  of energy receive priority treatment?    [Reina] Of course. The situation of the ENEE is serious. It  has been dragging on for some time. It is partly the result of  nature. The deforestation of the Francisco Morazan Dam basin is  part of the problem, but we are seeking, through the most honest  persons we have been able to find, adequate solutions.    [Reporter] Mr. President, another problem that concerns  society is the situation of the ENEE. Some sectors believe this  situation may deteriorate irreversibly if specific and necessary  actions are not taken. It is believed this situation may result  in an increase in energy rates of over 100 percent. A business  leader stated that the ENEE must file for bankruptcy so it can  be turned over to private enterprise. To what degree does this  statement affect the image of the ENEE before the eyes of  international organizations.    [Reina] I do not think that is the solution. This may  undermine the prestige of the country. We must seek correct  solutions at the appropriate time. [end recording]    These were statements by President Carlos Roberto Reina on  the recommendations of the World Bank and the actions to be  taken regarding the ENEE, Hondutel, and SANAA, and specifically  the problem presented by the announced devaluation.</p>

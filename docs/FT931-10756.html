			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / International Company News: Petrofina tumbles 72% to BFr4.6bn CONSOLIDATED profits at Petrofina, one of Belgium's largest industrial groups, fell by 72 per cent last year, to BFr4.6bn (Dollars 135.3m) from BFr16.3bn in 1991. Petrofina halved its dividend - the first pay-out reduction since 1959  - to a net BFr210 per share. Though the group warned of the cut in mid-December, Petrofina shares fell 2.1 per cent to BFr7,370 yesterday, accounting for about a tenth of high turnover on the Brussels bourse as Belgian investors celebrated Thursday's fall in German interest rates by hoisting the Bel 20 index 0.54 per cent. The results reflected low crude prices, sharp pressure on basic refining profit margins, falling margins in petrochemicals because of overcapacity in the industry, and losses at Fina, the group's US sub-sidiary. Industry analysts said the drop in refining margins - of between Dollars 1 and Dollars 2 a barrel - could account for two-thirds of the fall in income. Petrofina stressed that consolidated profit before extraordinary items, mainly new US accounting standards to cover post-retirement health care benefits, was estimated at BFr7.9bn, against BFr15.8bn in 1991. One brokerage firm read this emphasis as anxiety to demonstrate that even the halved dividend payment, worth about BFr6.5bn, was covered by current earnings. The group's investment budget this year has been set at BFr38bn, down from BFr42bn last year. The investment will be centred on modernising its Antwerp refining facilities. Net debt to equity in its 1991 balance sheet was 66 per cent, up from 34 per cent in 1989, one market analyst underlined. In spite of some disposals and pulling back from projects, this ratio was expected to have crept up; full 1992 results are not due until May. Fina, the US arm, turned in a loss for the full year of Dollars 10.2m, against net earnings of Dollars 42m in 1991 and Dollars 125m in 1990. A decision is still awaited on three-year long negotiations with Arabian Petroleum, the private Saudi Arabian company on a joint venture involving Fina selling APC its downstream assets for about Dollars 500m. The Saudi government is believed still not to have made up its mind whether to bless the deal.</p>

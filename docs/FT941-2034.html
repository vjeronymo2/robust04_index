			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Post Office to face strikes The Post Office faces disruption from three industrial disputes over the coming weeks. Engineering staff working for the Royal Mail in London voted yesterday to strike over the proposed closure of half the capital's mechanised letter offices, starting next month. The Royal Mail's 5,000 engineering workers around the country are voting in a strike ballot to oppose the transfer of its building engineering services to a separate subsidiary company RoMEC. The result will be known next week. London's main post office workers will strike on March 30 about post office closures after a three-to-one majority vote in support of industrial action. But the Royal Mail appears close to agreement with the Union of Communication Workers on a revised productivity deal for workers after the original one was rejected last month in a ballot. Mr Steve Jones, Mount Pleasant sorting office branch secretary of the National Communications Union, said yesterday: 'Post Office management have misjudged the mood of our engineering membership about the closure of mechanised sorting offices in London and we will shortly be issuing notice of strike action.' He added: 'We would like to see a negotiated settlement, however this does not seem likely.' On a 60 per cent turnout, 56 per cent of London's engineering workers backed industrial action while 82 per cent supported disruption short of an all-out strike. Royal Mail said last night that the NCU had 'no mandate' to call its London engineers on strike and added there was 'no question of any of them being made redundant'. The NCU's Mr Jones said: 'We are, without doubt, faced with the most comprehensive set of attacks we have ever faced. We simply cannot afford to ignore the consequences of not responding to management's unnecessary and unjustified actions. Any sign of weakness will see in its wake even greater attacks on our jobs and conditions.' The UCW is lobbying parliament on March 30 in support of London post office counter staff and calling on the public to back their one-day strike.</p>

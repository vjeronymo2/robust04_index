			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian diamond find 'world class' AUSTRALIA'S BHP Minerals and its Canadian partner, Dia-Met Minerals, have moved one step closer to building North America's first diamond mine in the Lac de Gras area of the Northwest Territories. The two companies said that they planned to erect a pilot recovery plant in the area early next year to analyse a bulk sample of between 5,000 and 10,000 tonnes of ore. Depending on the results, these tests would be followed by a full feasibility study for a mine. Lac de Gras is just below the Arctic Circle, about 320 km (200 miles) north-east of Yellowknife, the territories' capital. The decision to go ahead with such a large sampling programme is based on the results of drilling last winter which appear to confirm a sizeable diamond deposit. Analysts at Pacific International Securities in Vancouver said yesterday that the grade of ore recovered from one of four kimberlite pipes at Lac de Gras 'puts it into the league of world-class diamond pipes'. Despite such enthusiasm, Dia-Met's shares tumbled by CDollars 9 to CDollars 57 in early trading on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday. The share price had tripled in the past year in anticipation of positive results from Lac de Gras. According to BHP and Dia-Met, a total of 206 carats were recovered from just over 400 tonnes of ore extracted from the four pipes. The results include only stones with a diameter of more than half a millimetre. The companies said that they had found several gem diamonds in the one to three carat range. The proportion of gem diamonds ranged from a low of 6 per cent in pipe number two to 31 per cent in pipe four and 33 per cent in pipe three. Pipe four contains a grade of 17.5 gem carats per 100 tonnes. Pacific International estimates that this is nearly double the grade indicated by a sample recovered from the nearby Point Lake property in late 1991 which set off the diamond stampede in the Northwest Territories. Meanwhile, the Canadian government has announced changes in income tax rules to encourage diamond exploration. Developers of diamond mines will in future be entitled to accelerated depreciation of capital costs, while exploration companies will be able to finance their work by means of 'flow-through' shares which offer substantial tax benefits to investors.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 28 TASS -- The Russian Foreign Ministry  positively appraised the appointment of Koji Kakizawa on  Thursday to the post of Japanese foreign minister.    A high-ranking representative of the Russian Foreign Office  noted in an interview with ITAR-TASS that Kakizawa "was long  known as a man who actively participated in implementing  Japanese foreign policy in many spheres, including the problem  of ensuring security and settlement in Cambodia.    As for relations with Russia, the diplomat noted, "We  proceed  from a premise that they will constructively develop in the  spirit of the positive tenor which is characteristic of the  bilateral dialogue after the Tokyo visit by President Boris  Yeltsin last October".    Kakizawa who was parliamentary deputy of the Japanese  foreign  minister in the past, repeatedly pointed to the need for  "serious efforts to establish closer and normal relations  between Japan and such important neighbour as the Russian  Federation", stressing that these should be "long-term relations  of friendship" turned to the 21st Century.</p>

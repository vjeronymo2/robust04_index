European deputies; legislators from various countries;  Guillermo Bedregal, the Bolivian Chamber of Deputies president;  George Melikjanz [name as received], editor in chief of the  Russian newspaper IZVESTIA; former Tunisian Minister Faiza Kefi  [name as received]; and other renown intellectuals and  politicians from Europe, America, and Africa are participating  in this conference.    A group of Chilean center and left-wing politicians  presented  a document for discussion by the conference that will end on 9  January. It was sponsored by International Christian Democratic  Union and the European Union.    The document includes issues such as ethics, politics, and  new humanisms; international economy and solidarity; and peace,  security, and disarmament.    The document points out that technological change and  capital  operations represent basic aspects of today's life. In the case  of Chilean, this may be translated into the fact that 25 percent  of national assets are in the hands of foreign entrepreneurs.  This begs the question: How much sovereignty is a state forced  to give up if it seeks to attract massive volumes of foreign  capital?    The document also indicates that there still is "an  overwhelming contrast between the standard of living in rich  countries and in poor countries -- even though the wealth of the  former, to a large extent, has been generated by the work of the  latter."    The document adds: "There are regions of our planet which  seem to have been deprived of all possible benefits that result  from the progress derived from an international free trade  system." This is the case, for example, in sub-Saharan Africa  where conditions still exist that prick the consciences of the  rest of the world." [no opening quotation marks as published]    The document concludes: "The ethical imperative of our times  is to create a humanist civilization that will respect mankind  and harmoniously integrate him and his fellow men and into the  natural, religious, economic, and cultural environs" to prevent  him from becoming a "slave of economic, political, and cultural  systems that do not respect" the "values and rights" of humanity.    Chilean intellectuals like Roberto Garreton, Carlos Hunneus,  and Claudio Troncoso are among the signatories to the document.</p>

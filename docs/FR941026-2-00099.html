(Honda) for an exemption from the parts marking requirements of the vehicle theft prevention standard for a high theft car line whose nameplate is confidential. This petition is granted because the agency has determined that the antitheft device to be placed on the car line as standard equipment, is likely to be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as compliance with parts marking requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The exemption granted by this notice is effective beginning with the (confidential) model year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Ms. Barbara A.

Ms. Gray's telephone number is (202) 366&hyph;1740. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  In a letter dated April 29, 1994, American Honda Motor Company, Inc. (Honda) requested an exemption from the theft prevention standard for a car line beginning from the (confidential) model year. The nameplate of the car line is also confidential. The letter was submitted pursuant to 49 CFR part 543,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Exemption from Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> and requested an exemption from parts marking based on the installation of an antitheft device as standard equipment for the car line. In a June 29, 1994 telephone conversation with NHTSA officials, Honda clarified the scope of its petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Together, Honda's April 29 letter and information provided in the June 29 telephone conversation constitute a complete petition, as required by 49 CFR &sect;543.7, in that it met the general requirements contained in &sect;543.5 and the specific content requirements of &sect;543.6. In a letter dated May 31, 1994 to Honda, the agency granted the petitioner's request for confidential treatment of most aspects of its petition, including the nameplate of the car line and the model year of its introduction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its petition, Honda provided a detailed description and diagrams of the identity, design, and location of the components of the antitheft device for the new car line. The antitheft device includes an engine starter interrupt function and an alarm function. The antitheft device is activated by removing the key from the ignition and locking the driver or passenger door with the key. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The alarm monitors the doors, hood, trunk lid, battery terminals, engine starter circuit, and battery circuit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to ensure the reliability and durability of the device, Honda stated that it conducted tests, based on its own specified standards. Honda provided a detailed list of the tests conducted, including tests for temperature extremes, vibration, shock, and power voltage. Honda stated its belief that the device is reliable and durable since the device complied with Honda's specified requirements for each test. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Honda compared the device proposed for its new car line with devices which NHTSA has determined to be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as would compliance with the parts marking requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Honda concludes that the antitheft device proposed for its new car line is not less effective than those devices in the above car lines for which NHTSA has granted exemptions from the parts-marking requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on this substantial evidence, the agency believes that the antitheft device for the new Honda car line is likely to be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as compliance with the parts-marking requirements of the theft prevention standard (49 CFR part 541). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency believes that the device will provide the types of performance listed in 49 CFR 543.6(a)(3): Promoting activation; attracting attention to unauthorized entries; preventing defeat or circumvention of the device by unauthorized persons; preventing operation of the vehicle by unauthorized entrants; and ensuring the reliability and durability of the device. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As required by 49 U.S.C. 33106 and 49 CFR 543.6(a)(4), the agency also finds that Honda has provided adequate reasons for its belief that the antitheft device will reduce and deter theft. This conclusion is based on the information Honda provided on its device. This information included a description of reliability and functional tests conducted by Honda for the antitheft device and its components. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the foregoing reasons, the agency hereby exempts the Honda car line that is the subject of this notice, in whole, from the requirements of 49 CFR part 541. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If Honda decides not to use the exemption for the car line that is the subject of this notice, it should formally notify the agency. If such a decision is made, the car line must be fully marked according to the requirements under 49 CFR &sect;&sect;541.5 and 541.6 (marking of major component parts and replacement parts). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has attempted to compare the effectiveness of compliance with the theft prevention standard (parts marking) with the effectiveness of antitheft devices. NHTSA has compared the theft rates of 17 parts-marked MY 1986 vehicle lines, with the theft rates of the same 17 lines in MY 1991, when each line had an exemption from parts marking because it had an antitheft device as standard equipment. Of the 17 lines reviewed, 10 experienced theft rates for MY 1991 that were below their respective rates in MY 1986. Although the results of the data are inconclusive, it indicates a likelihood of lower theft rates for vehicle lines that have been exempted from parts marking because they are equipped with an antitheft device. With implementation of the requirements of the ``Anti Car Theft Act of 1992,'' NHTSA anticipates more probative data upon which comparisons may be made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA notes that if Honda wishes in the future to modify the device on which this exemption is based, the company may have to submit a petition to modify the exemption. Section 543.7(d) states that a Part 543 exemption applies only to vehicles that belong to a line exempted under this part and equipped with the antitheft device on which the line's exemption is based. Further, &sect;543.9(c)(2) provides for the submission of petitions ``(t)o modify an exemption to permit the use of an antitheft device similar to but differing from the one specified in that exemption.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency wishes to minimize the administrative burden which &sect;543.9(c)(2) could place on exempted vehicle manufacturers and itself. The agency did not intend in drafting Part 543 to require the submission of a modification petition for every change to the components or design of an antitheft device. The significance of many such changes could be  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Therefore, NHTSA suggests that if the manufacturer contemplates making any changes the effects of which might be characterized as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> it should consult the agency before preparing and submitting a petition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modify. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  49 U.S.C. 33106; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 20, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Ricardo Martinez, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Administrator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26495 Filed 10&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Pressing ahead with an inherited strategy - The future of Wace without John Clegg THE CRISIS of Mr John Clegg's departure last Friday as managing director has raised questions about Wace Group's underlying commercial health. How secure is the printing company's immediate future, and what kind of long-term business have Mr Clegg's colleagues on the board inherited? Despite the past week's speculation over the sources of Wace's funding and the consequent fall in its share price from about 260p to 132p last night, it declined to put out a trading statement ahead of its full year figures in April. Shareholders, understandably, have been pressing for urgent clarification on the reasons for Mr Clegg's departure. However, the closest City followers of the company have not cited worries about the March figures when searching for explanations. At this stage, at least, they are not expecting his departure to herald a plunge in trading fortunes. Throughout the past week's swirling rumours, analysts have stuck by their estimates of between Pounds 17m and Pounds 18m pre-tax profits for the year to December 1991, compared with Pounds 26.5m last year. The expected slump in profits is no worse than that indicated in the half-year figures. Those showed that demand for pre-press services, the preparation and amendment of text and pictures before printing, has slumped sharply with the downturn in the economy and in advertising. It is the company's longer-term future which attracts more debate and it is these questions the company will need to answer if it is to succeed in its efforts to rehabilitate itself in the City. It may find it is lecturing to a difficult audience. The company's past dependence on acquisitions for its growth - some 40 in the past five years - and its image as a one-man band, over-reliant on Mr Clegg, had made sceptics of many City investors. A more difficult issue for the company to address, because answers are not clear cut and views differ widely, is whether a technological revolution will undermine the future of the pre-press business. Mr Clegg's unambiguous view, expressed vigorously to City institutions at each of the four rights issues between 1987 and 1990, was that pre-press, formerly a fragmented cottage industry, had a brilliant future. Advertising agencies and publishers, he argued, would put an increasing amount of their pre-press business out to specialist houses, not wanting to invest in the expensive new capital equipment. Mr Clegg believed the recession simply strengthened Wace's hand, allowing it to 'mop up' its smaller competitors, invest in the expensive state-of-the-art electronics that they could not afford, and take over their clients. Some in the printing industry disagree vigorously with that view. The core of their argument, which in a simplified version could be christened 'the Apple Mac threat', is that the price of some pre-press equipment is plummeting because of technological changes. Greater microprocessing power makes it possible to run more powerful software on a single machine such as an Apple Macintosh. The result is that some of the main clients, such as advertising agencies and glossy magazine houses, may begin doing more of their own work in-house. On this view, Wace has expensively positioned itself as the leader of a rapidly-shrinking market and this trend could deprive it of long-term growth even when the advertising recession ends. One senior executive of a leading advertising agency, which has made some investment in its own in-house pre-press facilities, said: 'There has been a real revolution. There used to be only expensive equipment, incompatible with other brand of equipment. But then the smaller manufacturers began to develop open systems that would talk to each other. 'Now you can buy one machine, and load extra software on it - buying extra typesetting fonts for a few thousand pounds each, for example, instead of lots of different machines costing several hundred thousand pounds each.' However, even the most fervent believers in this 'revolution' agree it is only partial. Small machines cannot yet properly handle high resolution in digital graphics, and other crucial jobs such as the retouching of transparencies are generally done by specialists. Unsurprisingly, some manufacturers of pre-press technology believe the capabilities of small machines have been overstated. Mr Jim Salmon, managing director of Crosfield Electronics, one of the world's leading manufacturers of electronic printing technology, said: 'It is true that the world is now an open systems marketplace of compatible machines, and that is a fundamental change. But without dismissing the technological trends, which are real, by far the greatest impact on the business at the moment is the advertising recession.' Wace itself does not dismiss the changes but emphasises that the company has many types of customer. Mr Brian Dudley, Wace's new managing director, said: 'Although the Mac technology, for instance, has advanced enormously, from Wace's perspective that is not a threat.' He gives as an example Wace's magazine design work. A year ago only 5 per cent of the raw designs and text were sent to Wace in digital form. Now it is 50 per cent. But in Mr Dudley's view 'Wace still has the job of putting it into high resolution' and that is enough to protect its hold on its clients. 'Buying the best machines for that highest quality work is still a very significant investment - you need a critical mass of customers', he argues. The strategy he inherited from Mr Clegg, in particular the company's past heavy investment, relies on those economies of scale being achievable. It is an argument he may have to rehearse many times with City investors if he is to win them back.</p>

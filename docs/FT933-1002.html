			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Computing: Today gorillas, tomorrow a network THIS WEEK I want to consider recent technical developments in the DOS operating system. We will take them in order of priority. Two gorillas are standing on skyscrapers silhouetted against the New York skyline. Each lobs an explosive banana at the other. The angle and speed of the throw, the force of gravity, the wind speed and direction, all affect the accuracy of the banana. The first gorilla to score a direct hit wins. Owners of PCs purchased within the last year or two may not be aware that this rather enjoyable game comes free within DOS 5 and DOS 6. To find out whether you have Gorillas: Go to the C:&gt; prompt, type VER and press Enter to check whether you have DOS version 5 6. If you do: Type CDDOS and Enter; type QBASIC Enter; press the ESC key to clear the Survival Guide comment; hold down the ALT key and press F for the FILE menu. Highlight OPEN and Enter; from *.BAS press the TAB key once so the cursor is under GORILLA. BAS; press the SPACE BAR to highlight GORILLA. BAS; press Enter to bring up the rules. DOS 6.0 was released by Microsoft in March and I recently tried it on my own machine. Its big attraction is the 'Doublespace' disk compression feature. If you have a 20 or 40 megabyte disk and are short of space, DOS 6.0 can nearly double your available capacity. Typing CHKDSK at C:&gt; showed that my disk capacity was 120 megabytes, of which about 32 megabytes remained available. Installing Doublespace was very easy: just launch it, and off it goes. It took about two hours to compress and 'defragment' my disk. I was delighted to find that Doublespace had generated an extra 86 megabytes of disk space from 32mb to 118mb. Next I tried running some of my programs to make sure everything still worked, but got the message 'insufficient memory'. Typing MEM from C:&gt; showed only 440k usable memory so this was the cue to try another feature of DOS 6.00, 'Memory Maker'. Again, you just have to launch it and off it goes. At the end my available memory was increased from 440k to 592k and there were no more memory problems. All in all, I was impressed with DOS 6.0. There are further valuable features such as an 'Anti-virus' detector and 'MSBackup' from Symantec Corp. which makes copying far easier than under the usual DOS 'Copy' and 'Backup' commands. Even the accompanying manual seemed sensible and clearly-written. At around Pounds 59 DOS 6.0 is a bargain. However, problems with Doublespace have surfaced in the computer press and my local dealer recently told me a terrible tale. He has a customer who installed Dos 6.0 and Doublespace. The disk drive is now unreadable and Microsoft say nothing can be done to retrieve the data. To cap it all, the poor fools were not taking backup copies so they have lost 300 megabytes of data and five years' accounting records. So if you run a mission-critical application such as accounting on your PC, do not use disk compression. And if daily copying starts to involve too many floppy disks, invest in a tape drive for quick, easy backup. Finally, a note on something very exciting indeed - networking DOS. The biggest defect in DOS has always been that it is single-user. If a manager wants to call up on his computer the financial information residing on his accountant's PC, he cannot simply connect the two machines together with a cable and look; he has to buy special networking software such as Lantastic from Artisoft or Netware from Novell. Recently the latter took over Digital Research, whose own version of DOS, DRDOS, is generally acknowledged to be superior to Microsoft's. The first fruit of the marriage - Novell DOS 7 - will be released before the end of the year. This new version of DOS will, for the first time, integrate networking into DOS itself. Theoretically it will be possible to cable all your office PCs together, load Novell DOS 7 on to each one and, hey presto, you have a network. If it makes connecting PCs together in a network as simple as hooking a PC to a printer, Novell DOS 7 will be the most important DOS development yet.</p>

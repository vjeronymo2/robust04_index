			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: South African gold mines reveal falling profits THE March gold quarterly results released this week by four of South Africa's mining houses testify to the extremely difficult times the industry is experiencing. Mines in the Gencor and Rand Mines groups were particularly badly hit. Gengold, the gold arm of the Gencor group, saw after-tax profits fall 33 per cent to R63.6m in the three months ended December 1990. A one-off retrenchment payment at Harmony mine pushed the Rand Mines group's gold operations into an after-tax loss of R30.4m (Dollars 11.19m), against an R11.2m loss last time. Gengold admits that with the group having reached the limit of cost-cutting measures, it is now virtually beyond management's ability to do anything about the declining trend in profits. Gold production fell by 3.5 per cent. The one-off payment at Rand Mines' Harmony was for 6,000 redundancies. The group's Durban Deep mine continued to recover though, earning R2.7m after tax. Harmony would have broken even but for extraordinary expenses. Randfontein and Western areas, two of the mines managed by Johannesburg Consolidated, suffered from unexpected production disruptions during the quarter. Randfontein made a profit of R31.1m, against R32.5m, but Western Areas saw profits drop by 29 per cent to R6.6m following power supply problems. The developing mine Joel continued to show improved development grades. The four mines managed by the Anglovaal group maintained profits at R39m, due mainly to a decreased tax charge at Hartebeestfontein, the group's leading mine which made a profit of R39.8m. The marginal producer Loraine made a loss of R5.2m despite stringent measures aimed at cutting costs.</p>

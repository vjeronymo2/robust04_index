			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Kawasaki Research (main office: 5-18, Higashi  Koraibashi, Chuo-ku, Osaka-shi; Toru Kawasaki, company  representative; Tel: 06-949-3265), a survey and consultant  company in high-tech fields, such as advanced materials, will  conduct surveys on ``methods for developing the next generation  of semiconductor sealing material'' using a multi-cliant method  (particdipation of multi companies). In addition to the current  situation concerning all-important epoxy resins, from the  standpoint of recycling, the future possibility of thermoplastic  engineering plastics will be covered.    The survey consists of those on ``situations in raw  materials,'' ``recycling,'' ``packaging and its technology,''  and ``trends in device and material makers.'' Demand and supply  of raw materials, compounds, and package, as well as technical  trends, of all-important epoxy resins and fine ceramics will be  surveyed, and, at the same time, the potentials and future of  thermoplastic engineering plastic and liquid cryustal polymer  (LCP) will be explored.    According to Kawasaki Research, the majority of  semicondoctor  sealing materials is made of high-purity novolak type epoxy  resins, and, the annual world-wide consumption is said to range  from 60,000 to 70,000 tons. Moreover, recently, underwater  R&amp;D  activities, dealing with environmental problems and recycling,  have been gathering momentum. Especially, ``thermoplastic  engineering plastic whose properties are good enough to replace  epoxy resins and whose effective utilization is feasible, has  begun to attract attention,'' according to the Kawasaki  representative.    The survey will be put together as a report (A4, 200-250  pages) and issued on 25 November 1993. The number of members  invited to participate on the multi-client method basis is 10  companies. The participation fee is &yen;500,000. Application  for membership must be submitted by 10 October. After the number  has reached 10, the company will stop receiving applications.</p>

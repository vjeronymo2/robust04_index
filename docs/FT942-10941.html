			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Fashion: A St Trinian's summer rampage - Fashion on a shoestring is investigated by our writers. Here, Avril Groom visits the jumble sales two skirts and a jacket - for Pounds 27.95. Before you say that I must have either special contacts or extraordinary luck, let me tell you that anyone can do it. This is the summer when no one needs to spend much in order to look thoroughly a la mode. You must banish any residual belief that designer labels are good for you and any reservations about wearing clothes that have seen better days. Then you can join all the best people combing the rails of thrift shops, jumble sales and school outfitters. The ultimate in recession chic this summer is a clothing item that has been shrunken, truncated, crushed, boiled to ribbons and squeezed to within an inch of its life. You could pay a designer handsomely to put clothes through all those processes. Or you could have fun - and save lots of money - and find examples for yourself. As this odd little look is not a long-term investment, it seems best to go for the second option. This is how I did it. The skirts came from Jean Muir's sale. There you are, designer labels after all - but these skirts cost only Pounds 3 each. They are in her favourite, floppy, Hurel jersey and when I bought them they were dowdily box-pleated to knee-level. Quite why Miss Muir did not see their potential and price them accordingly I do not know, because with six inches chopped off (this cost Pounds 5 each), hey presto they are the new flippy skirt shape, in a fashionably school-uniformish maroon and a nice tan that will liven all this spring's dreary beige. The jacket was a bigger bargain. Doing my duty behind the counter at the local scouts' jumble sale, I noted that elderly pinstriped jackets and waistcoats were being snapped up - not by needy pensioners but by bright young things. Even better, from the pile, I unearthed an original early 1950s coat in the black floppy, crepy wool currently beloved of avant-garde designers. Trendily waisted and fluted, silk-lined, with small revers and unobtrusive buttons, it cost me 20p. All it needed was a good clean and a foot off the bottom (Pounds 11.75). Also at the sale were plenty of shrunken, greyed, felted and crinkled jumpers that had seen one hot wash too many. I did not need those because my wardrobe contains several examples that have formed spontaneously in my washing machine. Now I know what to do with them: a fellow fashion writer tells me they look seriously chic worn with grey polyester school trousers. She waxes lyrical about the straight-legged John Lewis version of these. Not having the washboard abdomen of the average 12-year-old schoolboy, I may give them a miss, but Marks and Spencer has a pleat-topped version suited to paunchier lads (and lasses). Add a plain white school T-shirt, approximately for an age 10 size, vigorously scrunched in the wash and un-ironed, and no one will know you have not spent serious money on Helmut Lang's neo-punk look. In fact, the school uniform department of the local chain store is the fashion freak's best friend this summer, supplying all the necessary ingredients for those who, unaccountably, have decided that St Trinian's provides a valid fashion role model for grown women. The pleated games' skirt, the too-small school shirt, even ankle socks sauntered down expensive catwalks in the spring collections but the chain store version will do sterling service for a look of such sublime frivolousness. Far more practically, now that VAT has been removed on clothes intended for children with up to a 37in chest, to allow for the generally baggy nature of youth fashion, childrenswear departments open up all sorts of possibilities for cheap casual dressing if you are less than generously proportioned. Why use a so-called 'petites' department when you can get jeans, sweatshirts and other basics in the same sizes but VAT-free? Then there is lingerie. Ever since Jean-Paul Gaultier put Madonna on stage in coned-off corsets we have adjusted to underwear as overwear, everywhere. The latest twist is that the lingerie is pre-owned. The hot-fashion designer slip dress has its origins in 1930s bias-cut nighties and these are what thrifty fashion fans are buying, to cut short and plonk over a skinny white T-shirt. The fastidious get theirs sorted, washed and mended from upmarket second-hand shops: the less squeamish at jumble sales. If you find all this a little seedy, there is always the chain store version. This will, of course, look too new so you must give it a very hard time in the wash. This process is known as 'distressing' which, unless you are careful, might also describe the results. A safer option may be pyjamas. Classic drawstring trousers and loose shirts are this season's obverse of the fashion coin, the opposite of skinny and short. As they look like pyjamas anyway, why not wear the real thing, often cheaper and better quality? Put them over the ubiquitous fitted body, while the enviable few with that washboard tum can buy a size too big so the trousers drop trendily to navel level. This theme goes further. Marks and Spencer's spring nightwear includes a gracefully draped and pleated tunic and trousers that, with some metallic ribbon added at under-bust level, could convincingly come from the Grecian-inspired evening wear collections of Chloe or Romeo Gigli. All these ideas are mere suggestions. The dedicated fashion money-saver will doubtless think up far more inventive ways to sidestep designer bills this summer. Think what you could do with all the money you are not spending on clothes this summer. Personally, a classic investment that I can justify to my bank manager might be in order. There is a wonderful suit in Armani's window . . .</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Small business cites satisfaction as goal MORE than nine out of 10 people running small businesses in Britain would start up all over again in spite of the obstacles and relatively meagre rewards, according to a survey published yesterday by Barclays Bank. Independence rather than a desire for riches is the main incentive for people setting up businesses, the survey adds. The owners of such small businesses worked on average more than 60 hours a week and earned only Pounds 6.67 an hour, compared with the average wage of Pounds 7.30 an hour for a normal 40-hour week. There are 400,000 more small businesses than a decade ago. Of the 400 business owners questioned in the survey 68 per cent said they found more satisfaction from being their own boss than from working for somebody else. Although money was not the main motivation for run-ning their own businesses, 32 per cent thought it would offer better financial pros-pects. A third said that when they worked for others they thought they could do better than their employers or other businesses in the field. A further 31 per cent thought they could do as well as existing businesses. Nineteen per cent had identified a gap in the market or developed a new product or service. The qualities that those questioned said were needed to succeed were hard work, mentioned by 91 per cent, determination (89 per cent), pride (87 per cent) and being good with people (76 per cent). The less highly rated characteristics were intelligence (21 per cent), aggression (13 per cent) and cunning (9 per cent). The single most important piece of advice offered by people who had started up businesses was to 'research your market' (19 per cent) followed by 'get good advice' (18 per cent). Women believed that they faced more difficulties than men in getting started in business. Forty-five per cent said they were not taken seriously, while 40 per cent mentioned the additional burdens of family responsibilities, 26 per cent sex discrimination by suppliers or customers and 15 per cent pressure to stay at home.

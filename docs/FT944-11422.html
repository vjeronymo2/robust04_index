			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections - November 8: Democrats fear poll earthquake in Walla Walla - A Republican threat to Speaker Tom Foley Walla Walla in south-eastern Washington, close to the Oregon border, seems an unlikely place for an electoral earthquake. But it might play a small role in the defeat of a sitting Speaker of the US House of Representatives - a feat last accomplished in 1860. An early missionary outpost that never matched the growth of coastal cities such as Seattle, the town sits in the shadow of the Blue Mountains, surrounded by onion fields and vineyards. It is the sort of place where a visiting reporter asking directions at Bill McClure's farm machinery store, will prompt customer Bob Tinker to jump into his pickup truck - with a deer rifle hanging behind the seat - to show the way. These are the folk on whom Republicans are counting in their confidence over tomorrow's US congressional elections, predicting that they will make sweeping gains. And nothing would seal their victory more sweetly than the defeat of Mr Tom Foley in eastern Washington state. As Speaker, Mr Foley is third in line to the US president. After Mr Foley's surprisingly weak showing in September's primary ballot, opinion polls showed him trailing far behind Mr George Nethercutt, a lawyer who is the most moderate candidate the Republicans have sent against him for years. The gap has narrowed, but Mr Foley himself says it is still 'very much of a nip and tuck race'. In Walla Walla there is growing irritation with politicians and government, and more locals seem ready to throw out Mr Foley, whose intellectual and sometimes aloof manner symbolises for some the alienation of that other Washington on the east coast. Perhaps the most incendiary issue has been Mr Foley's decision to join a lawsuit questioning the constitutionality of limits on the number of terms a politician can serve in Congress - a decision that prompted his opponents to accuse him of suing his own voters. 'He has been ineffective here in our own district because his lack of support for issues such as term limits, the balanced budget amendment . . . and immigration reform have assured their defeat despite overwhelming support in eastern Washington,' complained Ms Ruth Fleenor, a Walla Walla voter. The anti-Foley tide has left business leaders in the state, who have a healthy respect for the clout of the Speaker's office, aghast. 'Don't they know he's the third most powerful man in the country?' asked an executive with Johnson Matthey Electronics, near Spokane, second largest city in Washington state. And Mr Tony Sandoval, president of the Washington state council of La Raza, the Hispanic community organisation, shook his head in wonder. 'It's very important to have the Speaker of the House. You'd have to be brain-dead to pick somebody else,' he said. But some people in Walla Walla despise the power of the Speaker's office and the very tangible benefits it can bring to the district. 'It 'helps' to get more pork in the state, and I don't believe in the pork barrel,' said Ms Edith Largent. Although this is his 16th election, Congressman Foley's campaigning skills have rarely been put to such a test. At a meeting with voters this weekend in the Red Apple restaurant, on Spokane's Main Street, he appeared deeply uncomfortable when appealing for votes. He relaxed only when offered the chance for a detailed lecture on policy or the constitution. But the campaign, like many across the US this year, has been unpleasant, with each candidate ferociously attacking the other in television and radio advertisements. The viciousness of the campaign has turned away voters such as Mr McClure, the farm machinery store owner. 'I think they're both really fine gentlemen, but they are both trying to degrade each other to the point where we don't want to watch it any more,' he says. The US goes to the polls, Page 4</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Belgium (4): Grip remains tight on crown jewels - A look at prospects for foreign predators BELGIUM operates one of the most open economies in Europe, and yet has a reputation for being sensitive about foreign hands getting near its corporate crown jewels. The psychological starting point for this concern was the unexpected and predatory raid on Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company, launched by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian financier in 1988. Its latest benchmark was the planned bid for Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), one of Belgium's three leading banks, by Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance company. Discussion of this topic is usually peppered liberally with reference to the need for an 'ancrage Belge' - an anchor of Belgian control over its manufacturing base and financial resources, to ensure that corporate strategy and economic development are designed at home rather than abroad. As in most EC countries, a distinction is made between foreign investment (invariably welcome) and takeovers by foreign companies - to be regarded with suspicion. But in practice, as opposed to the debate, there is little resistance to outside encroachment among Belgium's business elite, and little more than faint regret among government policy-makers. 'I think it's unrealistic to think that we could prevent the sale of Belgian assets,' says Mr Phillipe Maystadt, Belgium's highly-regarded finance minister. 'We are interested in a European market, so there are some rules we have to apply. The European single market doesn't allow us to prohibit sellers and buyers from other members of the EC. 'To put it another way,' he adds, 'in the period 1985-90 there were 222 sales of Belgian assets. Of these 59 went to French companies, 57 to Dutch companies and 28 to British companies. Most of them, indeed, are sales to European companies, and in fact to neighbours. We have no way to prevent that, and there may be no desire to prevent that.' If there were, it would be a bit late to start. Belgium is a small country which relies on its open economy, good ports and infrastructure, and high productivity, to earn a much better than average living in the international marketplace. According to Generale de Banque, Belgium exports per capita twice as much as Germany, and five times as much as Japan. From the 1960s onwards it has turned itself progressively into an attractive base from which multinationals can serve the European market. As a consequence, 32 per cent of Belgium's top 3,100 companies are owned by foreign interests, according to a University of Louvain study. The Louvain analysis points out, moreover, that this greatly understates the position, since these multinationals account for 43.5 per cent of total added value generated in Belgium. Yet familiarity and ease with foreign investors did not prepare Belgium's tightly-knit corporate clans for the De Benedetti attempt to take over La Generale. Part of the reason was sheer lack of exposure to corporate raiding. When Mr De Benedetti made his move, Belgian business had experienced only one real assault from abroad. Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL), Belgium's second largest holding company, in 1987 saw off a hostile bid by Axa of France for Royale Belge, Belgium's second-biggest insurance group. To do so, however, it had to combine forces with Union des Assurances de Paris, another French group. The following year, La Generale was finally rescued by a French 'white knight', the Compagnie de Suez conglomerate. By last year, the French had sent in one of its top executives, Mr Gerard Mestrallet, to get a grip on the sprawling holding, leading to fears that decision-making would shift from Brussels to Paris. However, Mr Mestrallet has punctiliously observed local form and sensitivities, in a way that some La Generale executives felt Mr De Benedetti would not have done. For instance, he delivered part of his first presentation of annual results in Flemish, which he set about learning. This is more than anecdotal in a country constantly beset by rivalries between the French and Dutch-speaking communities. But it is, nevertheless, hard-headed business logic that takes precedence. What was remarkable about the near-paranoia unleashed in 1988 about La Generale falling under outside control was how quickly it subsided. Mr Maystadt says the fears 'have not completely died, but, I repeat, we have no choice. We are a member of the EC and part of the single market, and we are a small country.' Subsequently, leading Belgian companies such as Solvay, the chemicals group, moved fast to plug the glaring gaps in their defences exposed by Mr De Benedetti - who had secretly amassed a nearly 18 per cent stake in La Generale before revealing his hand. But this was logical protection against any form of hostile takeover, more than an assertion of specifically Belgian control. The search by Sabena, the troubled national airline, for a foreign partner provides another example. Regionalist rivalries surfaced among employees during 1990's abortive link-up with KLM, the Dutch carrier, and when Air France acquired a chunk of Sabena equity after the Belgian government refloated the airline. The 'ancrage Belge' argument was plausibly fanned because the Belgian state led the Dollars 1bn bail-out, in what looked to be straightforward, flag carrier nationalism. Senior officials in the debt-strapped government underlined, however, that it would have been more expensive to close Sabena than to refloat it, mainly because of costly social transfers to its 12,000 workers. In the event, ING's proposed takeover of BBL will not resolve the issue. Ten days ago, BBL announced the bid plans had been scuppered by differences over the price to be offered. However, the basic idea of a merger to set up a 'big player' group on the Allfinanz or Bancassurances model, selling insurance and banking services throughout the Benelux countries through an integrated network, had a logic and appeal to BBL's management which has added fuel to the discussion. The bank's main shareholder, the entrepreneur Mr Albert Frere, chairman and managing director of GBL, is thought to favour a link-up with Credit Communal, the credit institution jointly owned by all Belgium's provinces and municipalities. That idea - an ancrage as Belge as you could get - could now become a reality, despite suspicions that it was merely a tactical flirtation, aimed at jacking up the ING offer price. Mr Maystadt told the FT before the outcome of the ING-BBL talks was known that the government had no intention of preventing a Dutch takeover, but 'would prefer that BBL remains in so-called Belgian hands'. Now it looks as though he may get exactly what he wanted all along.</p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> VICTIM, BENEFACTOR HURT IN CRASH  </P> <P> A shooting victim and a good Samaritan who was driving him to the hospital were  injured this morning when their car crashed in Mission Hills and flipped over,  police said.  </P> <P> The shooting victim was then taken by ambulance to the Northridge Hospital  Medical Center and was in stable condition after being treated for a gunshot  wound to the chest and cuts and bruises from the car accident.  </P> <P> Police declined to identify the victim or the car's driver, who also suffered  minor injuries in the crash.  </P> <P> Lt. Harvie Eubank said the incident began about 3:30 a.m. when a 24-year-old  man pulled into a service station at Nordhoff Street and Sepulveda Boulevard  and was confronted by a gunman who demanded money. When the motorist refused to  turn over any money, he was shot and the gunman fled on foot.  </P> <P> The victim went into the service station and asked for help getting to a  hospital. He said he did not want police called because he was wanted by  authorities, Eubank said.  </P> <P> A 34-year-old customer who was in the store volunteered to drive the victim's  car and take him to a hospital, police said. But as he drove the car onto a  freeway on-ramp, the car swerved, hit a truck and then went off the road and  flipped, police said.  </P> <P> Police had not yet determined if the shooting victim was being sought by  authorities, Eubank said.  </P></p>

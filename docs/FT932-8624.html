			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Finsbury Smaller in fund raising FINSBURY Smaller Companies Trust has announced that it is in discussion with S G Warburg Securities with a view to raising additional funds. The investment trust believes that, as recovery develops, small company shares are likely to show higher levels of capital gain and dividend growth than large company shares. The trust, formerly known as Lancashire &amp; London, was the subject of a hostile bid from Anglo-Scandinavian in 1991. After beating off the bid, the trust, along with others associated with the empire of the late Sir Walter Salomon, was renamed. Cross-holdings in the group were also reduced. Finsbury Smaller no longer has holdings in any of the rest of the group; however, Finsbury Trust and Ocean Wilsons retain holdings in Finsbury Smaller Companies, of 15.9 per cent and 9.4 per cent respectively.</p>

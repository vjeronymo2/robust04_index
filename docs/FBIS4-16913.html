			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Koretskiy report in the "Russian-Ukrainian </F> Agreement on the Black Sea Fleet" column: "What Is This  Agreement All About? Nothing, Actually"]    [Text] On the evening of 15 April the presidents of Russia  and Ukraine signed an agreement on a phased settlement of Black  Sea Fleet problems. Moscow's and Kiev's subsequent  "explanations," however, suggest that Boris Yeltsin and Leonid  Kravchuk not only spoke different languages but also signed  something quite different.    The agreement has left more questions than answers. For  instance, the decision to divide the basing of the Ukrainian  Navy and the Black Sea Fleet does not even approximately define  the location of Russia's naval base in Ukraine. Kiev maintains  that this is a subject of future negotiations. The statement by  Ukraine Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk that the base may  be leased to Russia to a term of up to five years appears  puzzling. There is no answer to the logical question: What  next? The fleet's redeployment to bases in the Pacific or the  Arctic Ocean, or its sinking, the third in its history?  Kravchuk's "promising" judgment about the need for the  Ukrainian parliament to ratify the leasing agreement renders any  accords senseless. The deputies will "sink" them anyway.    Kravchuk assures that he and Yeltsin have "defined the  parameters and percentage ratio of the Black Sea Fleet division"  and that all that remains to be done is to work out mechanisms  to implement the accords. Yeltsin's press secretary Vyacheslav  Kostikov is somewhat more specific on this question: According  to him, Kiev is to have 15 to 20 percent of the Black Sea Fleet.  The Ukrainian side has its own interpretation of the accords:  According to Ukraine Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, the  Black Sea Fleet is to be split in half, and from its half  Ukraine will sell Russia the 30 to 35 percent it does not need.  Which is not at all identical to what Moscow understands as a  "percentage ratio:" Pavel Grachev completely rejects his  Ukrainian counterpart's approach. Now Kostikov has not only  accused Kiev of a "unilateral interpretation" but also recalled  that in talking about such a "nationally sacred thing" as the  Black Sea Fleet, there is no room for bargaining.    The presidents have given their governments 10 days to  finalize the division agreement. During this time the Black Sea  Fleet is to be fully inventoried. And this involves 390  battleships and a still unknown number of coastal installations,  from Izmamil to Kerch. Yet it appears that even these "10 days"  are understood differently in Moscow and in Kiev. Kravchuk  links coordination of the Black Sea Fleet division not with a  term of 10 days but with "a full-scale treaty on friendship and  cooperation." This will take two to three months at the very  least. Furthermore, coordination of "friendship" conditions is  likely to proceed in a strained situation. Kravchuk makes no  secret of his discontent with Black Sea Fleet Commander Admiral  Eduard Baltin. According to Leonid Makarovich, he is ready to  recall his signature under his appointment and will do so if  "the negotiating process drags out." He does not specify the  meaning of "dragging out."    Admiral Aleksey Kalinin, former Black Sea Fleet commander,  who is not bound by diplomatic etiquette, assessed the agreement  as "a palliative option, preserving tension in the south of  Ukraine and in Crimea" and beneficial to Kravchuk. Judging by  first reactions from Black Sea Fleet representatives (in  conversation with KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondents), there is a  restrained attitude to the "strange agreement" in the fleet, and  no one there believes in the success of negotiations between  Moscow and Kiev officials. The impression is that many Black  Sea Fleet servicemen today are inclined to cut the "Gordian  marine knot" military-style. That is to say, on the spur of the  moment [splecha].</p>

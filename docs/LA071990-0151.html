			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE APPROVES CIVIL RIGHTS BILL;  </P> <P> CONGRESS: THE MEASURE TO REVERSE SUPREME COURT DECISIONS PASSES AFTER ATTEMPTS  AT COMPROMISE FAIL. BUSH HAS THREATENED A VETO. QUESTION OF QUOTAS AT ISSUE.  </P> <P> The Senate, setting Congress on a collision course with the White House after  one of the most divisive and politically bruising debates this year, passed a  major new civil rights bill Wednesday night that President Bush has said he  will veto.  </P> <P> Despite Bush's personal intervention in a last-minute attempt to negotiate a  compromise, the Senate set aside objections by conservative Republicans and  passed the Civil Rights Act of 1990 by a vote of 65 to 34.  </P> <P> White House officials already have said that Bush will veto the legislation in  its current form because of his belief that the bill would force companies to  resort to minority quotas in their hiring practices.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, traveling with President Bush in  Anaheim, said Wednesday night that the Administration was disappointed by the  vote.  </P> <P> "We'll work to change it in the House. We still want a bill we can sign,"  Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> In a written statement later, Fitzwater also said: "The President wants a bill  that ends discrimination, not one that starts a quota system."  </P> <P> Civil rights advocates, for whom passage of the job discrimination bill is a  major victory, denied that it would impose a quota system on employers and  predicted that Bush will be persuaded to drop his veto threat and support the  bill by the time it reaches his desk later this year.  </P> <P> "Tonight's vote means we are going to get a strong civil rights bill this year,  one that we still hope the President can be persuaded to support," said Ralph  Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the main  lobbying arm of the civil rights movement. "My guess is the discussions will  continue as the bill moves through the House and we think there is a good  chance that the President can be brought on board."  </P> <P> The bill, sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), seeks to reverse  several recent Supreme Court rulings that civil rights advocates said severely  blunt the impact of existing federal laws against job discrimination.  </P> <P> Its provisions include bans on discrimination in the workplace and legal  reforms that make it easier for employees to prove allegations of  discrimination and seek punitive damages for them. It would also, for the first  time, allow women to sue their employers and collect damages for sexual  harassment.  </P> <P> Rejecting arguments by conservative Republicans that his changes amounted to a  sweeping and ill-conceived revision of the nation's civil rights laws, Kennedy  and other Democratic supporters of the bill said the intent was simply to  restore the force of laws that, prior to their modification by the Supreme  Court, worked well for nearly two decades.  </P> <P> "It's time to end the unequal treatment of minorities and women in the  workplace," Kennedy said. ". . . The party of Lincoln should be the party for  civil rights."  </P> <P> While not disputing the Democrats' contention that the Supreme Court rulings  necessitated a revision of job discrimination laws, the Bush Administration  took sharp issue with two provisions in the bill that it argued would go beyond  current law and impose unreasonable costs on employers.  </P> <P> One deals with the ability of employees to challenge and seek damages for  business practices that effectively exclude minorities from job opportunities  even if they are not intended to be discriminatory. Under a law in effect since  1971, such practices were justified only if a company could prove they were  necessary to the performance of its business. The court, however, weakened that  ruling in 1989 by relaxing the definition of what constituted a "business  necessity" and by shifting the burden of proving that the practice was not  necessary to the plaintiff.  </P> <P> The Kennedy bill sought to reverse that decision, taken in the case of Wards  Cove vs. Antonio, and restore the effect of the original ruling in the 1971  case of Griggs vs. Duke Power Co.  </P> <P> However, Republicans said that the standards of proof companies would have to  meet to defend themselves under the Kennedy bill were much too strict and would  have the effect of forcing employers to hire minorities by quotas to turn back  what could become a tidal wave of discrimination suits.  </P> <P> "This is clearly a quota bill . . . and quotas are inescapably unfair," said  Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), explaining his decision to oppose the bill. "You  do not cure old wrongs by imposing new ones. You do not cure old discrimination  by imposing new discrimination." California's other senator, Democrat Alan  Cranston, voted for the bill.  </P> <P> The other provision that the Bush Administration opposed dealt with the  monetary awards that plaintiffs could receive if the court finds that they have  been victims of intentional discrimination. Those awards, opponents said, could  increase the incentive to file law suits and lead to a "legal bonanza" for  lawyers.  </P> <P> Clearly not wishing to pay the political price of vetoing a civil rights bill  in an election year, the Bush Administration sought to negotiate a compromise  with Senate Democrats. However, in large measure because of what civil rights  advocates and even some Administration insiders said was a deep split within  the White House, the negotiations eventually collapsed.  </P> <P> "There was obviously a split in the White House," said one supporter of the  bill who was close to the negotiations. "There were a number of occasions where  we added language to meet their objections and where we thought we had an  agreement, only to find out the next day that we didn't."  </P> <P> "Since these negotiations began eight weeks ago, a battle has been under way in  the White House for the heart and soul of the President on the issue of civil  rights and it is a battle that, so far, the right-wing of the White House has  been winning," Neas said.  </P> <P> On the other side, Republicans were left deeply embittered by what they charged  was an unwillingness by Kennedy to compromise and negotiate in good faith in  the belief that he had enough votes to "cram this legislation down our  throats," in the words of Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.).  </P> <P> "We went as far as we could go, we went a long way, but nothing seemed to  please the other side," complained Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah). "They were not  interested in civil rights. They were interested in playing politics with civil  rights," he charged.  </P> <P> Kennedy angrily rejected those charges, saying that it was the White House that  refused to negotiate in good faith.  </P> <P> "I regret that we have been unable to reach an agreement in these negotiations.  But I make no apology . . . for refusing to accept so-called compromises that  would undermine basic principles of civil rights," the senator said.  </P> <P> Saying that the law specifically bars quotas, Kennedy accused the White House  of manufacturing the quota controversy to disguise its opposition to civil  rights legislation.  </P> <P> "Quotas, schmotas. Quotas are not the issue. Job discrimination is the issue,"  he said.  </P> <P> Although the battle over the bill left a bitter taste on both sides of the  Senate's political aisle, Democrats and Republicans alike sought to keep the  door open to further negotiations as the legislation moves through the House,  where the bill is expected to be taken up shortly.  </P> <P> Several senators noted that, in an election year especially, both sides have an  incentive to continue those talks -- Republicans because they don't want to  bear the onus of appearing to be against civil rights and Democrats because  they may not have enough support to muster the 67 votes they will need to  override a veto should Bush cast one.  </P> <P> "We're confident that we have the votes to sustain the veto," Hatch said,  adding that "we would then go back and draft a new bill that meets the  President's objections by protecting civil rights rather than playing politics  with them."  </P></p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: US futures exchanges poised to compete with swaps markets US FUTURES exchanges could soon be competing with the over-the-counter swaps markets, following a long-awaited decision last week on the regulation of US futures markets. A US House and Senate conference committee approved legislation stating swaps fall outside the remit of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the futures regulator. The resolution, expected to be approved by the full House and Senate this week, is part of a bill defining the powers of the CFTC and toughening US futures industry regulation. The regulatory exemption removes a significant threat to the OTC swaps markets, as well as creating opportunities for futures exchanges. Mr William O'Connor, Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) chairman, said his exchange was poised to begin trading swaps electronically on an in-house daytime trading system: Project A. The system, which goes on line in mid-October, is a testbed for products which might not otherwise attract enough interest to warrant pit trading. Other exchanges are satisfied that OTC trading contributes substantial volume to their futures contracts, and are not anxious to enter competitive products. 'We have no plans to begin swap trading,' the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) said. Nymex extended delivery periods for its crude oil futures contracts to 36 months to meet demand from hedgers. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) says billions of dollars of currency and interest rate swaps are priced in the CME Eurodollar futures pit every year. Like the Nymex, the CME has extended Eurodollar futures delivery, although to five years to accommodate the swap industry. Meanwhile, last week's decision removed a potential problem for the burgeoning swaps industry. US futures exchanges had argued swaps were a type of future, and should be subject to CFTC regulation. Under current rules, futures traded outside US futures exchanges are illegal and unenforceable. Swaps comprise a market in excess of Dollars 4,000bn a year according to the International Swap Dealers Association. The business has exploded since 1987, when companies discovered they could exchange interest rate and currency risks through long-term contracts and trading firms found a niche as market makers.</p>

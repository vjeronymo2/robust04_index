To Romania, the proper handling of national minority issues  is important because this is a key issue of European  integration, the AFD's prime minister candidate Gabor Kuncze and  the party's foreign affairs expert Istvan Szent-Ivanyi told  journalists on Thursday.    They also said problems forestalling smooth cooperation had  come up at their talks with leading Romanian politicians.    The AFD believes that efforts to improve bilateral relations  should be linked together with the cause of the minorities.    The Romanian negotiating party promised to open two border  posts at Battonya and Mehkerek by the end of June. In accord  with an earlier agreement between the two countries, Hungary has  made all necessary arrangements for the new crossings, while  Romania has done little so far.    The delegation also held talks with representatives of  Romania's Democratic Hungarian Union (RDHU), county leaders from  Harghita and Covasna (which have substantial Hungarian  populations), Calvinist Bishop Laszlo Tokes and Catholic Bishop  Jozsef Tempfli. The AFD delegates stated that should they be  elected to government in May, they would retain all forms of  support granted to Romanian Hungarians today.    The AFD agrees with the RDHU's position that Romania's  efforts to achieve European integration are likely to  necessitate the expansion of human and minority rights.</p>

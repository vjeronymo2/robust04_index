Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Manufacturers seeking approval of respiratory protective devices would continue to be required to submit applications for approval, including related drawings, drawing lists, specifications, and descriptions. The paperwork burden for this application process is identical to that included in existing 30 CFR 11.10, previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, those sections containing information collections are being submitted to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Other organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collections should direct them to the NIOSH Docket Office and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs; OMB, New Exectutive Office Building (Room 3208), Washington, DC 20503, ATTN: Desk Officer for HHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The existing rules and procedures in 30 CFR Part 11 for approval of respiratory-protective devices, or respirators, evolved from rules and procedures developed by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines (BOM). Until 1972, the BOM was solely responsible for testing and approving respirators. In 1972, Part 11 was published jointly by the BOM and NIOSH. This regulation replaced the BOM's rules and procedures, and delineated the responsibilities of the two agencies. Under this regulation, the BOM evaluated respirator performance, and NIOSH was responsible for administration of the quality control provisions. The BOM also tested the safety of electrical components of respirators for use in potentially explosive atmospheres in underground-gassy mines (intrinsic safety) under the requirements of 30 CFR part 18.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Memorandum of Understanding, dated May 30, 1972, between the two agencies refined their respective roles, and part 11 was amended in 1973. Under this arrangement, NIOSH undertook primary responsibility for performance testing of respirators. Although all approvals continued to be issued jointly, the BOM primarily retained only the responsibility to test for intrinsic safety on the small number of respirators that had electrical components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration, MSHA's predecessor agency, was created in 1974, and the responsibilities of the BOM under part 11 were transferred to that agency. Since MSHA was created in 1978, it has continued to test electrical components of respirators for intrinsic safety. MSHA has issued separate approvals for respirators meeting the requirements of 30 CFR part 18. While MSHA currently reviews applications for respirator certifications and has conducted some product evaluations, laboratory testing, quality assurance, and product audit for certain respirators, the principal testing and approval activities specified by part 11 are primarily conducted by NIOSH. NIOSH is proposing to redesignate the requirements for the certification of respiratory-protective devices of part 11 to part 84 of Title 42 (42 CFR part 84) under this action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following promulgation of 30 CFR part 11 in 1972, NIOSH began conducting research in several areas of respiratory protection. Concurrently, NIOSH began to receive public input concerning the respirator-certification program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In December 1977, NIOSH conducted a public meeting to obtain comments on changes needed in 30 CFR part 11. In 1979, a group of outside consultants conducted a thorough review of the program. The report received from those consultants was published by NIOSH for further consideration by other interested persons, and a public meeting was held in July 1980 to obtain their comments on the program. In December 1981, the American National Standards Institute Z88 Committee on Respiratory Protection commented on 30 CFR part 11. In January 1982, the Mine Health Research Advisory Committee transmitted its recommendations to NIOSH for further changes to the program. Since 1982, NIOSH has solicited and investigated reports of problems with NIOSH/MSHA-certified respirators with the purpose of obtaining direct public input into the approval program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Investigations, research, comments, and analyses were considered by NIOSH and MSHA in preparation of a proposed comprehensive revision to the approval requirements. These changes to existing requirements and tests were proposed as a new 42 CFR part 84, which was published on August 27, 1987 (52 FR 32402). Two public meetings were held to obtain comments on the proposal (in San Francisco, CA on January 20, 1988, and in Washington, D.C. on January 27&hyph;28, 1988). Two extensions of the public comment period were issued (52 FR 37639 and 53 FR 5595), with it ending on March 28, 1988. Concurrent with the publication of the proposed part 84, MSHA published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (52 FR 32313) proposing the withdrawal of 30 CFR part 11 upon final publication of 42 CFR part 84. Under that proposal, MSHA would have retained a consultative role in the approval of respirators used in mining in order to protect the health and safety of miners, particularly concerning mine rescue and mine emergency respirators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the 7-month comment period following the publication of the proposed part 84, NIOSH received 271 comments on this comprehensive proposal. Since receiving these comments, NIOSH has been conducting investigations and research to consider the technical issues addressed in these comments. Delays have been experienced in finalizing a revised part 84 draft as a result of the number and diversity of the comments received. NIOSH determined that at least four major, and more than one hundred minor technical and administrative changes to the first comprehensive proposal would be required to adequately address all the areas of concern. Consequently, NIOSH has reevaluated its intent to develop and implement a single, comprehensive revision to the existing regulation of part 11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Instead, NIOSH intends to promulgate modifications to the existing requirements of 30 CFR part 11 in a series of modules. There are numerous benefits to utilizing a modular approach to promulgate the anticipated changes to the existing requirements. Among these are the following considerations:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Improvements can be implemented on a priority basis, assuring that those expected to contribute most to improving worker protection are implemented first,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Incremental promulgation of improvements should facilitate adaptation to new requirements by the respirator manufacturer and user communities, minimizing the potential for any disruption in the supply of certified respirators, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Public participation in the rulemaking process will be facilitated by proposing important regulatory changes in individual segments of separate rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

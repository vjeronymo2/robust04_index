			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Where an applicant's business plan does not adequately address how transaction proceeds will help meet the credit and lending needs of its community, the OTS may deny the application or impose appropriate conditions of approval designed to ensure that the applicant will address these concerns. The OTS generally will not view commitments included in a savings association's business plan as remedying pre-existing CRA-related deficiencies. However, commitments may be appropriate in addressing CRA performance in the context of the conversion of a troubled savings associations. The OTS intends to give substantial weight to an applicant's previous CRA record, consistent with long-standing policy of the OTS. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 38 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 38 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  54 FR 13742 (April 5, 1989) (joint CRA policy statement of the federal financial supervisory agencies).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated above, applicants must submit business plans to OTS staff for their review prior to filing a formal application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> L. Other Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Subscription Rights  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The conversion regulations require that prior to the completion of a conversion, no person may transfer, or enter into any agreement or understanding to transfer, the legal or beneficial ownership of conversion subscription rights, or the underlying securities to the account of another. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 39 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The OTS did not propose any change to the prohibition in the OTS conversion regulations on the transfer or sale of subscription rights or similar ``free distribution'' schemes, but did request comment on whether subscription rights should continue to be nontransferable, or if transferability is recommended, the reasons for, and the manner in which to allow for, such transfer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 39 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 CFR 563b.3(i)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Almost all of the commenters who commented on this issue stated that subscription rights should continue to be nontransferable. The commenters that opposed transferability asserted that transferability would place undue pressure on mutuals to convert; would place emphasis on ownership by depositors, a concept that is theoretical; would make the conversion process overly complex; would be dangerous to the long-term health of the industry; would be unworkable and not in the public interest; would increase the chances of fraud and abuse; would be difficult and costly in allocation of rights; would enable sophisticated and professional investors to take advantage of members; and would create a destabilizing effect on mutuals. One commenter suggested an alternative that would allow members to cause associations to redeem rights for a certain period of time, for payment of a special dividend, provided there is adequate capital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three commenters endorsed transferability of subscription rights, although one of the three stated that account holders should be allowed to transfer rights to another individual, but not a group of investors or another institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OTS notes that the FDIC and others have suggested that it may be appropriate for depositors to be able to receive a gift of cash or stock or to transfer and sell their subscription rights so that any ``windfall'' value can be distributed directly to the depositors. The current OTS regulatory regimen specifically rejects any type of free distribution schemes as unsafe and unsound practice. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 40 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The OTS continues to believe that this type of change to the current conversion regulations would raise a number of complex legal and policy issues, many of which were taken into account previously by the FHLBB in determining to prohibit transferability. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 41 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These issues, as noted in the preamble to the interim final rule, include the possibility of adverse federal tax consequences to depositors receiving such rights, undue pressure on mutual associations to convert that may evolve from significant shifts of savings funds by depositors into such associations, difficulties in equitably allocating such subscription rights among depositors, potential manipulation of the process by sophisticated third parties to the detriment of the depositors, incentives for manipulation by insiders, the continued need for establishment and maintenance of a liquidation account and significantly increased conversion costs due to compliance with securities law requirements for registering subscription rights for public distribution. For these reasons, the OTS conversion regulations continue in effect without any change relative to free distribution of stock or transfer of subscription rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 40 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  39 FR 9142 (March 7, 1974).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 41 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  footnote 17 above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Availability of Conversion Documents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OTS rules now permit the public to have ready access to all relevant non-confidential materials regarding proposed conversion transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of five commenters addressing the issue of whether OTS should permit access to non-confidential preliminary conversion materials, three supported the revision allowing access, one opposed, claiming access to such materials would confuse members whose focus should be on the accuracy and adequacy of the final information disclosed to the public, and one stated that the prospectus and plan of conversion, as approved by the board of directors, provide adequate disclosure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OTS continues to believe that even though this information is preliminary in nature, it may be useful for account holders and the public to access it earlier in the conversion process, and therefore, the provision in the interim final rule will continue in effect without change. As noted above, business plans filed with, or in contemplation of, a conversion will continue to be treated confidentially so long as the applicant follows the procedures set forth in 12 CFR 563b.4(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Conforming Changes to Mutual Holding Company Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The mutual holding company regulations, 12 CFR part 575, generally incorporate the substantive and procedural standards for conversion contained in the conversion regulation. To the extent the final rule addresses conversion standards, those same standards apply to mutual holding company reorganizations and minority stock issuances. The OTS is also revising 12 CFR part 575 to make clarifying and conforming changes to the mutual-to-stock conversion regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Survey of Relaunching the Ruhr (8): An exclusive club - Pressures on regional power suppliers THE RUHR region boasts the headquarters of two leading electricity utilities, RWE Energie in Essen and VEW in Dortmund. Both companies belong to an exclusive club for utilities owning the high voltage grid, the Deutsche Verbundgesellschaft. RWE Energie is the most powerful of the nine club members, with a high voltage grid four times the length of VEW's. RWE was founded in Essen in the heart of the Ruhr region in 1898 by Hugo Stinnes, the famous industrialist known to competitors as 'the black-bearded Assyrian,' who emerged after World War I as Germany's 'Business Kaiser,' controlling coal mines, steel mills, banks, newspapers, hotels, shipping lines - and electrical plants. RWE, partially communally-owned, steadily expanded and evolved over the decades to become Germany's largest electricity utility. In 1990, the company was restructured to form the RWE Holding in which utility RWE Energie constitutes just one of six sectors. The other big electricity utility in the Ruhr was set up in the 1920s: the Vereinigte Elektrizitaetswerke Westfalen (VEW), based in Dortmund. VEW was formed by the fusion of several communally owned regional supply companies. Shortly afterwards, VEW and RWE signed an 'electro-peace treaty' - a demarcation contract - agreeing not to trespass upon each others' territory. Such contracts, allowed as exceptions under German competition law, now exist between all nine 'Verbund' utilities. Today, VEW is west Germany's fourth largest utility in terms of electricity sales. It has rapidly expanding gas distribution and waste disposal sectors. Both RWE and VEW are partly publicly owned, with anachronistic multiple voting rights giving the communal shareholders an influence disproportionately large in view of their minority capital shares. With electricity sales falling - VEW sales were down 1.6 oer cent in 1992, RWE-Energie sales down by 3 per cent in 1992-93 - the utilities have a growth problem. Potential in east Germany and eastern Europe exists, but it is developing very slowly. Strong talk by the European Commission and the German Federal Cartel Office (FCO) over the introduction of more competition in the electricity sector have added impetus to a trend in which smaller utilities seek to hitch themselves up with larger ones. The 'minnows' hope that if and when the free-for-all for electricity customers begins, this overlapping of interests will prevent the large utilities from snapping up all their lucrative customers. The pattern does not stop here - even the larger utilities are consolidating their positions. And the FCO in Berlin appears to have only limited power to stop this trend. A warning came from the chairman of RWE, Dr. Friedhelm Gieske this April: 'Competition within the energy sectors, bound by cable or pipeline transmission, will inevitably lead to concentration so that the large companies will become ever bigger. This would ultimately help us, but would be a political mistake and therefore is not something we want.' Recent developments in the Ruhr illustrate the creeping concentration in the electricity sector. The city of Dortmund has a concession contract, expiring in 1994, under which VEW is its exclusive electricity supplier. Initially, the Dortmund municipal Stadtwerke dreamed of taking over the city electricity supply. However, sobered by VEW's demands for a payment of around DM1bn for the Dortmund transmission grid, the Stadtwerke agreed to a compromise. VEW and the Stadtwerke will found a joint supply company, Dortmunder Energie und Wasserverorgung (DEW) for the electricity, gas, district heating and water supply to the city. The FCO has approved the deal but imposed two conditions. First, the contract is valid for only 20 years. Second, VEW is not allowed to use its minority voting rights to influence Stadtwerke Dortmund decisions over the source of DEW electricity supplies. In fact, the choice of supplier is very limited anyway. The only alternative to VEW is the regional utility Elektromark, in Hagen. And the Stadtwerke has already decided to continue taking electricity from VEW. The FCO's attempt to preserve an element of competition is weak. Observers wonder if Dortmund is likely to change suppliers after 20 years of co-operating with VEW - and if Elektromark still be around in 20 years, in any case. Elektromark's supervisory and executive boards have strongly recommended linking up with RWE Energie and VEW by selling each of them a 10 per cent block of shares. The link with RWE-Energie is designed to intensify co-operation in the electricity sector, the connection with VEW serving links in the waste disposal sector. Elektromark is also selling its 300MW share in the Emsland nuclear power station in equal shares to RWE-Energie and second largest German utility, Preussenelektra, to the discomfort of VEW which owns the other 75 per cent. Such manoeuvres are by no means limited to the Ruhr. Elsewhere in Germany the larger utilities are also consolidating their positions. The Bavarian Bayernwerk is moving rapidly closer to a merger with the Viag Group. IN Baden-Wuerttemberg, utilities Badenwerk and Energie-Versorgung Schwaben have been permitted by the FCO to merge on the grounds that there was no competition between the two anyway. Other smaller electricity companies want to join, too. They fear that if the electricity sector were liberalised there would otherwise be little to stop Badenwerk/EVS taking their best customers. Hannover has decided to sell 40 per cent of its municipal utility. Twenty per cent goes to German gas giant, Ruhrgas, also based in Essen. Thuega, a subsidiary of the giant Veba which also owns utility Preussenelektra, is taking the other 20 per cent. The link with Thuega could help stave off potential future threats from Preussenelektra to win the Hannover utility's big customers, such as Volkswagen and Continental. In the Ruhr, the FCO would undoubtedly fight hard to prevent a VEW merger with another utility. But as VEW slips down the pecking order of 'Verbund' companies and is sandwiched between the supply areas of RWE and Preussenelektra, observers wonder how long will it be before it, too, decides the electricity business is best carried out 'in co-operation' with a stronger partner.</p>

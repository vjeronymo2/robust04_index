			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Unlike the currencies in which it is traded, wool is maintaining steady price levels in the primary markets. There have been good clearances in Australia this week, with Japan the leading buyer. The relative firmness does not, however, indicate buoyancy in user industries or consumer markets. Price changes in the UK market for tops are again due more to currency movements than to any shift in market conditions. Business is very quiet and the only signs of real improvement are on the export front.</p>

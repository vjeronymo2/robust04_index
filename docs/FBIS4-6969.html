			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News" </F> program"]    [Text] Masayoshi Takemura, head of Sakigake [Harbinger],  which has indicated an intention to not take posts in the Hata  administration but to support it, criticized the political  techniques of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and other parties,  which have moved to form a new parliamentary group.    [Begin Takemura recording] I saw [Social Democratic Party of  Japan] Chairman Murayama conveying the tragic resolution on a TV  program last night. Frankly speaking, I felt sympathy for him.  Unless they pursue politics in a faithful or trustworthy manner,  or more simply, in a good manner, they will lose the people's  trust in politics. [end recording]    Now, the reaction of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP].    [Begin recording] [LDP President Yohei Kono] I think  Sakigake  as well as the SDPJ have felt that this political technique is  wrong. But because this is a matter of political methods, they  will naturally reach an agreement on political techniques. I  mean they will agree on the techniques they should not adopt.    [LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori] The current situation  amounts to a state of anarchy. We are angry about this  situation, rather than anxious. [end recording]    Also, LDP's Michio Watanabe said:    [Begin recording] [NHK Reporter] The SDPJ perceives the move  as a betrayal to the party.    [Watanabe] I do not understand why they think so. Is that  move not a plot to form a single parliamentary group among the  ruling parties? Usually, the notice of forming a parliamentary  group is submitted before the prime ministerial election. It  was unusual that they submitted the notice after the election.    [NHK Reporter] How do you think things will develop from now  on?    [Watanabe] I do not know. If the ruling coalition decides to  urgently form the new cabinet, they may leave posts to be filled  by SDPJ members unoccupied and persuade the SDPJ to return to  the coalition during the Golden Week holiday season. Or, they  may try to entice some SDPJ members or LDP members who have  adopted the same political stance into the coalition. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Arts: Sensuous sculpture - The sexuality of Victorian and contemporary sculpture Pandora is the pivotal figure in two complementary sculpture shows in Stoke on Trent. According to Hesiod, Zeus created Pandora, the first woman, as a punishment for man's theft of fire. Hephaestus fashioned her out of clay, Athena breathed life into her, and the other gods were invited to endow her with every charm: hence Pandora or 'all-gifted'. Hermes, however, gave her flattery and guile; and she was given a jar - not a box - which she was forbidden to open. Curiosity apparently overcame her and the vessel was opened, releasing all the evils and diseases of the world from which man had hitherto been free. Only Hope was left crouching inside the lid. Harry Bates' marble Pandora represents the quintessence of late Victorian art. The kneeling Pandora is indeed physical perfection, the gentle curves of her bare flesh seem soft and yielding; her thigh voluptuously dimples under the weight of the fateful casket. She is the paradox of the 'beautiful evil' or 'deadly delight' of Greek myth and early Christian writing - and here she is in like company. The siren Circe and the temptress Eve also find a place in Reverie, Myth, Sensuality: Sculpture in Britain 1880-1910, and with them the charge of sexual frisson jumps up a volt. In Mackennal's bronze statuette Circe stands erect, her arms and fingers outstretched, exercising her power to turn men into swine, a metaphor for lust. So shocking were the cavortings of the enslaved men depicted around the base that the sculpture was partially swathed in red baize during its exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1894. Sir Thomas Brock's monumental marble Eve is not the triumphant temptress, but the sinner burdened with shame. Her head hangs low and she is too wretched to even hide her nakedness. She stands exposed and vulnerable - and every inch as invitingly tactile as Bates' Pandora. The other side of the Victorian obsession with the virtuous and wicked woman emerges in Reynolds-Stephens' Guinevere, showing the disgraced queen's redemption through prayer and good works. The pervasive mood of these pieces is contemplative, with the idealised human figure the most expressive metaphor of mood and feeling. This handsome survey reveals various aspects of the radical 'New Sculpture' which emerged in Britain during the 1870s, a subject unjustly neglected until a decade or so ago. These sculptures can be seen as three-dimensional manifestations of the art of Rossetti, William Morris, Burne-Jones, Albert Moore, Lord Leighton and GF Watts. Indeed Leighton and Watts were painters-cum-sculptors, and Alfred Stevens was architect and designer too. The movement's leading lights, Alfred Gilbert and George Frampton, pioneered the use of polychromy in sculpture. One of the primary aspirations of the New Sculptor was to expand the domain of sculpture. Efforts were made to improve standards and to bring sculpture back into the home. Gilbert produced numerous editions of bronzes in various reduced sizes. Revealingly, the considerable succes d'estime enjoyed by the New Sculptors did not guarantee financial security. Sir Alfred Gilbert was bankrupted. The plaster model of Sir George Frampton's 'Mysteriarch' serves as telling evidence of the difficulty sculptors faced in persuading a patron to translate a model into expensive marble or bronze. The Pandora myth provided the point of departure for a series of sculptures and videos by the contemporary artist Rose Garrard which mark a neat transition to the second show at Stoke, Traces of the Figure. All nine contemporary artists make reference to the human body, albeit obliquely. Subjectmatter is similarly ambiguous and unspecific, but the sexuality implicit in the earlier work is now defiantly overt. This sexuality, however, tends to be stripped of any eroticism. Deacon's 'The eye has it' seems like a giant, trouser-tailed spermatozoa embarking on its journey; Helen Chadwick similarly presents in triptych form a pair of fried eggs flanked by barely visible organisms. Cathy de Monchaux both encases and lines lead and steel tubes in lusciously soft red velvet. More disturbingly, nature is relentlessly red in tooth and claw. Hermione Wiltshire adds a cross-section to the hosier's dummy leg that shows the blood, bone and muscles inside the real thing. Helen Chadwick's blown-up images of the human scalp and a seething crown of worms that are horribly suggestive of suppurating wounds, unsavoury bodily fluids and of mortality. Of greatest presence is Alison Wilding's imperious construction draped with black cloth. In this context, it stands like a funeral bier awaiting a body. Stoke on Trent City Museum and Art Gallery until November 29; then to Cartwright Hall, Bradford, from December 12-March 7, 1993.</p>

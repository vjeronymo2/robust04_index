			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Labour's swinging spirits - Ballot Box What accounted for the brightening of mood in the Labour camp yesterday afternoon? A few minutes prior to the scheduled press conference on London, the atmosphere was tense: the battle of Jennifer's ear appeared to have taken its toll. Shortly afterwards, all was sweetness and light. Messrs Cunningham and Gould seemed to have all the time in the world to field additional questions. One factor might be credible rumours circulating that a London poll very much to the party's liking is to appear later today. Labour would need a swing of getting on for 8 per cent compared with 1987 to win enough seats in the capital to send Mr Neil Kinnock to 10 Downing Street. According to the rumours, the poll, by Harris for London Weekend Television, indicates such a swing is within the party's grasp. If the swing were replicated capital-wide, the Putney seat of chief Treasury secretary David Mellor would be among those put in danger - a thought that is guaranteed to cheer up any Labour gathering. But then again, it might just have been something that they put in the mineral water.</p>

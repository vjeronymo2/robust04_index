			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Euroclear study aims to cut the cost of settlement RESEARCH aimed at tackling the huge international investment losses caused by time delays and national regulatory inconsistencies in securities settlement has been published by Euroclear, the international clearing house. Euroclear's two-year study concentrates on the costs and risks of cross-border securities trading and was backed by market research carried out by Price Waterhouse. Its recommendations are: To ensure that holders of securities have title at each stage of the transfer and update ownership and transfer laws; To streamline the system which enables international investors to avoid paying taxes in both countries; To cut back on regulations surrounding wholesale investors; To allow for two settlement periods each day at each central securities depository to smooth over the delays created by international time differences; To enable investors to settle before the settlement deadline; To set up an international information system covering the corporate announcements in each country; It is lobbying for the recommendations to be taken up within five to seven years and believes that their adoption by national regulators could save billions of dollars. Mr John Olds, general manager of Euroclear in Brussels, would not quantify the potential savings for the group's 2,700 members and shareholders who, with clients of Cedel, its rival clearing house, made cross-border transactions in domestic and international securities worth Dollars 15,000bn in 1992. 'We took as a benchmark an active broker/dealer clearing Dollars 500m a day. We estimate that firm would save Dollars 25m a year,' he said. The in-depth analysis of cross-border securities dealing seeks to push forward the impact of a 1989 report by the Group of 30, a Washington-based 'think-tank'. That report established the principle of three-day settlement but was mainly influential in domestic markets.</p>

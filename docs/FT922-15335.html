			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Kashmir killings promptMoslem revulsion MOSLEM mourners crowded round a Hindu cremation ground in central Srinagar yesterday to express their revulsion at the murder of a Hindu family yesterday by Kashmiri Moslem terrorists. Mr Sohan Lal, a 45-year-old driver, his wife Bimla and their 20-year-old daughter Archina were killed by two militants who visited their house asking for food and shelter for the night. Senior police officials confirmed yesterday that both women had been raped. The incident is the first in more than nine months in which Moslem militants have apparently deliberately chosen a Hindu family as their target and it could provoke a further Hindu exodus from the Kashmir valley. It is also bound to revive charges that Moslem extremists are deliberately trying to drive Hindus from the valley. Moslem mourners at the cremation service yesterday expressed disgust at the killings and an increasingly commonly heard weariness with the two-and-a-half year insurgency. 'People are fed up with militants,' said a Moslem neighbour who knew the family well. Moslem neighbours felt particularly upset by the triple murder, having long pressed the family to remain in the valley when other Hindu families were leaving. The killing comes at a time when the government is seeking to revive political activity in the state by releasing detained opposition political leaders. The five leaders, most of whom have been detained for two years for supporting Kashmiri separatism, are expected to return to Srinagar today. The Hizbol Muhajideen, the main pro-Pakistan Islamic militants group, strongly condemned yesterday's killings. Mr Maqbool Elani, the group's commander in the Srinagar region, said in an interview yesterday: 'We are totally against this. They are our Hindu brothers.' He spoke at an interview on the outskirts of Srinagar with a dozen of his followers, all carrying automatic weapons.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chechnya has appealed to all countries to denounce  the actions by the Russian leadership aimed, as it believes, at  destabilizing the political situation in the Chechen Republic.  The statement by the Chechen Foreign Ministry spread in Groznyy  on Friday describes as a flagrant interference into the affairs  of an independent state the Russian Federal Assembly's decision  "On the Political Settlement of Relations between the Federal  Bodies of Power and the authorities in the Chechen Republic."    The decision envisages the holding of free elections to the  top power bodies of the Chechen Republic as a condition for the  continuation of the talks aimed at signing a Russian-Chechen  Treaty.    The actions of different power bodies of the Russian  Federation point to a new stage in aggravating the situation  around the Chechen Republic, says the statement. It expresses  readiness to continue the talks aimed at settling the relations  with Russia on a civilized basis and in accordance with the  principles of international law.</p>

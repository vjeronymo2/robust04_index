			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Mobile phone newcomers fail to impress business The newcomers to the UK mobile telephone market, Mercury One2One and Hutchison Telecoms' Orange, are failing to make an impact in the business sector, which continues to be dominated by the traditional operators, Vodafone and Cellnet. A survey among members of the Telecommunications Managers Association, representing the UK's big telephone users, confirms that Vodafone remains the principal mobile phone operator with a 46 per cent share. Cellnet has 38 per cent. Mercury One2One, launched last year, has a 2 per cent share and Orange, launched about six months ago, has 1 per cent. Orange is expected to overtake One2One in the business community soon, however. Asked which operators would most likely meet business needs over the next two years, 31 per cent of respondents chose Vodafone, 21 per cent Cellnet, 14 per cent Orange and 1 per cent One2One. The survey, published at the annual telecommunications managers' conference in Brighton yesterday, confirms anecdotal evidence that Vodafone and Cellnet are taking the lion's share of the portable phone sales boom because their analogue systems are mature, well-tested and provide extensive coverage. The newcomers, which offer digital services exclusively, are still developing their technical infrastructures. Both are limited in coverage - One2One has only just started to extend beyond the few miles around London. The survey shows that most business customers rate quality of service ahead of price - as competition drives prices down, the implication is that buyers will be prepared to pay a premium for quality.</p>

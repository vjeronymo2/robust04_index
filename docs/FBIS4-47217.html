			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Taumush Dzhumagaliyev, State Prize Laureate of </F> the Republic of Kazakhstan, candidate of  geological-mineralogical sciences, "honored" oil worker: "Oil  and Gas Industry of the Republic Is Dormant, Although It Has  Absolute Grounds for Independent Existence"]    [Text]  <H5>  Oil </H5>   The principal scope of geological prospecting for oil and  gas  in the Caspian depression was oriented until recently on the  search and prospecting for fields in subsalt deposits. This  direction justified itself with the discovery in the 10th  Five-Year Plan of very large gas and oil fields, which made it  possible to create a powerful base for the country's oil and gas  production. But the oil and gas condensates that emerged, unique  in their reserves, and the fields contain a substantial  concentration of aggressive components, which impeded their  processing, because of the unresolved aspects of many  technological and technical problems. It is enough to recall  that the USSR lagged behind the West for almost 20 years in the  level of development of production technologies.    All of this made it compelling to sign an agreement with the  Chevron Corporation. Difficult negotiations were conducted in  the course of several years, and a contract was signed as a  result within the framework of the USSR. According to the new  contract (1992), the period of validity was set at 40 years.  This transaction will be appropriate, although the contract has  not been subject to expert ecological examination as yet.    Analysis of the results of geological prospecting work in  the  12th Five-Year Plan showed that their effectiveness in the  Caspian gas and oil bearing province is one of the highest in  the former Union. The five-year task for increasing the reserves  of oil and condensate in the republic as a whole and in West  Kazakhstan was fully implemented owing to the exploration of  previously discovered productive sites (Karashagana, Zhanazhol,  Tengiz, and Korolevskoye).    Active prospecting in the subsalt deposits that was  undertaken in the last 15 years was not crowned with success, at  least at depths up to 5-5.5 kilometers in a number of areas that  were studied in detail from a geophysical standpoint and drilled  intensively, and with which a high promise of gas and oil  presence was associated. And this will create a tense situation  in increasing the raw materials base of the republic, although  today, as never before, there is a need for highly profitable  oil and gas fields that are accessible for quick and highly  efficient development.    The main reason for the difficult situation that has  developed, in my opinion, is the elimination in 1982 of the  Kazneftegazrazvedka administration, which was formed over the  decades and which explored very large oil and gas condensate  fields. Also having a negative influence is the disunity of the  geophysical service in West Kazakhstan and its inadequate  resolution capability in the preparation of deep drilling  structures.    The necessity for combining the geophysical organizations of  the former Nefteprom and the Ministry of Geology, which will  make it possible to reduce administrative expenditures, urgently  suggests itself. Moreover, the demarcation of territories of  West Kazakhstan between departmental organizations will be  removed, which will make it possible to concentrate prospecting  geophysical research in the most promising directions.    In the meantime, the scientific organizations of the branch  are not very concerned about the development of methods of  qualitative evaluations of fields in the early stages of  prospecting work. This leads to delays in the dates for  prospecting and exploration and also to an unjustified increase  in their costs. The oil and gas prospecting areas of Tortay,  Elemes, and others, where several dozen subsalt deep wells were  drilled almost without results serve as an example here.    As for the academic scientific organizations, in my opinion,  they are still engaged in unspecific research, such as: "The  study of the sedimentary basin evolution to evaluate their oil  and gas bearing potential and determine the priority directions  in the development of the Republic of Kazakhstan fuel-energy  complex," or the "compilation of a prediction map of gas and oil  in the Caspian Depression."    The main task of the geological prospectors always remained  to shift predicted reserves to a proven reserve category; that  is, industrial. All efforts should be directed at exactly this.    There are no new discoveries, and the old ones have already  been sold at a loss, including Kenbay (Moldabek-Kotyrtas), the  largest super saline oil field, now named the Munay SP [joint  enterprise]. Its reserves were successfully protected by  KazNIGRI in 1990, and the field has been readied for  exploitation. Unfortunately, it remains to this day a subject of  discussion between Kh. Biderman, an American businessman, and  the administration of Kazakhstan's Atyrau Oblast.    The conservation of reserves, instead of their accelerated  involvement in processing, is at the least an impermissible  luxury, bordering on crime, for the economy of the state. It is  paradoxical that no one bears any kind of responsibility for  such mistakes. It would be proper, in accordance with the 5  April 1994 Kazakhstan presidential edict "On Additional Measures  for Regulating the Use of Mineral Resources for Geological Study  and the Mining of Minerals," to accelerate the conduct of strict  order in the use of mineral resources."    The situation is no better with the development of marginal  [zabalansovy] or suspended oil fields. For example, Zholdybay  and Akhmeshet were transferred with the approval of the oblast  administration to the Atyrau trading house. The latter, having a  vague idea about the oil business, is creating the Sanako firm,  which plans to invite Western partners as contractors, in order  to take their equipment and technology. Moreover, they want to  settle with them with money, and they are again taking credit  from the state.    It turns out to be more profitable in such cases to rely on  foreign investments than on credits and loans, inasmuch as they  ensure direct access to modern technologies, etc. The main thing  is that a heavy burden is not assumed by an already depleted  budget and, to the contrary, this promotes its increase. It is  not without reason that world practice recommends that investors  should be involved primarily for the development of already  explored fields.    Kazakhstan is blindly imitating Russia in many aspects,  forgetting that since 1992 it has been the law there that the  one who finds and produces oil is the one who trades in it. But  in our republic, as before, it does not serve the workers. As a  result of which the oblast that is the richest in an industrial  sense was transformed into an impoverished and backward kray. As  is known, 94.3 percent of the explored reserves of oil and gas  and more than 90 percent of the potential resources of  hydrocarbons are located in West Kazakhstan, and its  significance as the main region of the republic for producing  oil and gas will not change even in the long run, which should  be made the basis of the strategy for the development of the  fuel-energy complex. All of these arguments are intensified many  times over, if the unsold predicted resources on the land and  especially in the water area of the Caspian Sea are taken into  account. Kazakhstan unquestionably will become a second Kuwait  to the extent that the Caspian shelf is developed while  observing clean geological protection.    It should be added to what has been said that 149 of the 160  oil and gas fields, and five of the six oil and gas producing  associations, are situated in this kray, and the Yuzhkazneft PO  [Production Association] acquires its development through the  organization of the Caspian oil and gas-bearing complex. This  connection must be maintained permanently.    The total of the aforementioned facts dictates the need for  moving the headquarters of the Kazakhstanmunaygaz to West  Kazakhstan. With time it will be necessary to examine the  question concerning the location of the Kazakhstankaspiy shelf.  It must be assumed that the industrial development of the  continental shelf will start in the northeast of the Caspian,  and not on the "Trans-Il Alatau shelves."    The degree of exploration of resources in Kazakhstan is  relatively low. This means that a significant and stable  increase in oil production in the republic depends not only on  the development of known fields, but also on the results of  prospecting-exploratory work. Their level in recent years is  sharply lowered, while, given the existing geological potential,  it should grow steadily.    There is an extremely difficult situation in the geological  industry today. At the present time, geological exploratory work  has been stopped in many organizations. For example, in the  former Atyrauneftegazgeologiya PGO [expansion not identified],  now the Akbota holding company, 65 percent of the oil and gas  exploration enterprises this year are functioning thanks to the  Kazakhstanturkmunay, and out of the remaining staff, a majority  has been cut, and the rest are on indefinite leave. In the  advanced North-Emba oil and gas exploration expedition, out of  10 drilling brigades, three remain today that maintain  themselves on state budgetary infusions of the Ministry of  Geology. Field geologists do not receive their wages for months.    Recently, after conversion to joint-stock companies, the  Embaneft PO became the Embamunaygaz Joint-Stock Company and the  Tengizneftegaz PO in Kulsary became the Tengizmunaygaz  Joint-Stock Company. The sum of their annual oil production  totals not more than 2.3 million tonnes, of which 823,000 tonnes  is the share of the latter. I think it would be advisable to  combine them into one under the aegis of the Embamunaygaz  Joint-Stock Company. The common process in oil and gas  production is artificially divided into indicators that are not  related to each other, which consist of: an increase in  reserves, preparation in linear kilometers, meters gone through  or drilled wells, tonnes of produced raw materials, kilometers  of laid pipelines, etc.</p>

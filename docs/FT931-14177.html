			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / New machinery orders fall 16% JAPANESE corporate investment in new plant and equipment is still depressed according to official figures published yesterday. They show that orders for new machinery in November were 16 per cent down on the year before. The Economic Planning Agency, which released the figures, said it was the eighth consecutive year-on-year fall in orders from manufacturing industry, excluding the shipbuilding and electric power industries. The value of orders in November was Y919.2bn, (Pounds 4.9bn), about 15 per cent up on the previous month largely because of a surge in orders from the coal and oil industries which distorted the figures. Mr Yoshior Hayashi, the finance minister said he was not yet considering plans to front load public works spending into the first half of the 1993 fiscal year as the Japanese parliament has not yet approved the budget for 1993. However, it is widely expected that once the budget is approved the ministry will bring forward public spending plans, as it did last year, to help maintain the momentum of spending on public works.</p>

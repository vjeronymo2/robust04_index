			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 29 (XINHUA)--Vice-Premier and Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen said today that resumption of Chinese  sovereignty over Hong Kong to protect national interests will be  conducive to the maintenance of long-term stability and  prosperity in Hong Kong.    Qian made the remark at a meeting with a delegation from the  Hong Kong Travel Industry Council.    No matter what the British side does, the Chinese Government  will not change its set goal, Qian said.    After hearing a briefing from the delegation on the  development of tourism in Hong Kong, Qian said the mainland  hopes for a continuing development of the tourism industry in  Hong Kong while the industry on the mainland should also be  promoted. A boost of tourism on the mainland will surely help  promote the prosperity of the industry in Hong Kong, he added.    Qian wished the Hong Kong International Tourism Fair, to be  held next month, success so as to ensure common prosperity in  tourism in Hong Kong and on the mainland.</p>

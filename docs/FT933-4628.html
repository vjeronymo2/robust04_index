			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / The grand design: Europe needs to plan a wider union that is able to look after itself The shape of Europe has been irrevocably changed by the collapse of communism. That was already so obvious at the time that it has become a cliche. But it may be only in 1993 that political leaders have begun to absorb that change. American leaders have stopped behaving as though Europe were their top priority. West European leaders have accepted, at last June's Copenhagen summit, that 'the associated countries in central and eastern Europe that so desire shall become members of the European union'. The importance of the successful transformation of central and eastern Europe for western Europe's security is also a cliche. But its economic importance has been less emphasised of late, as the difficulties and risks of the process have come to be better understood. It is good therefore to be reminded, by the director of the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels, Mr Peter Ludlow, that 'there is no other single source of hope for western Europeans as important as the rapid growth of central and eastern Europe'. Mr Ludlow makes the point in a paper entitled Beyond Maastricht (CEPS working document no 79, July 1993), which attempts to set the EC agenda for the next few years. It was finished a few days before the climax of the crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism. That will certainly provide fodder for the 'revised and extended version' promised for October, but is unlikely to affect the main conclusions. The essence of Mr Ludlow's reaction can be divined from the following sentence: 'If, despite everything, instability becomes the norm and the prospect of hanging on until 1997 or 1999 in a system such as the present one becomes unsustainable, an accelerated timetable towards a core monetary union would be preferable to a new era of floating . . .' By itself, that would be little more than a desperate reiteration of Euro-orthodoxy. The originality of Mr Ludlow's approach lies elsewhere, in that he has not only grasped the new strategic context but integrated it into his vision of the EC/European Union's future. This means that short-term planning has to be dominated by the timetable of enlargement negotiations with the Efta countries, while long-term planning must be undertaken both for and by (a crucial point) a wider Europe stretching eastward to the frontier of the former Soviet Union. Mr Ludlow correctly identifies access of central and eastern European producers to the western market as the most important issue, and 'the real and imaginary fears' of EC member states about competition from the east as the main constraint. He suggests that this be tackled head on: the two sides should work together to develop common strategies in the 'sensitive sectors', including 'a new common agricultural policy'. Strong stuff, but as he says, 'both sides are going to have to take far-reaching decisions about agriculture anyway. Why not, as prospective partners, prepare the ground together?' As if that were not enough, Mr Ludlow goes on to point out the financial implications. 'It is clearly unacceptable,' he writes, 'that the associate states which have now been accepted as prospective members should continue to receive financial assistance from the EC worth less than 10 per cent of the structural funds allocated to the four poorest member states.' He urges an investigation of 'the benefits for the EC if it began sooner rather than later to treat the associate states according to the same criteria and on the same footing as it has already agreed to treat its own poorer regions'. Mr Ludlow anticipates the 'response of hardened budget experts within the EC . . . that increases in the EC budget of the order needed are inconceivable', but brushes it aside as 'a superficial and short-sighted judgment of the kind which opponents of the Marshall Plan . . . advanced in the United States after the second world war'. The prosperity of eastern Europe, he concludes firmly, 'is in western Europe's interest and the costs should be rapidly offset by the benefits'. In the shorter term, Mr Ludlow argues that the Maastricht revision conference scheduled for 1996 should be brought forward to 1995, as soon as possible after the French presidential election; and that the Efta candidate countries should be included in it, as Spain and Portugal were in the conference that negotiated the Single European Act in 1985. They, with whichever existing member states feel the need to do so, could then hold more or less simultaneous referendums on their accession treaties, including whatever amendments to Maastricht have been agreed, rather than subjecting us to another series of cliffhangers like those of 1992-93. Mr Ludlow is too hard-headed to adopt my proposal that the conference be replaced by an elected constituent assembly. But he does suggest that it should be preceded by a strategic review, to identify the threats or risks to European security in the new situation and the instruments (both military and economic) available to meet them. Those instruments include Nato, but arguments about the competence and value of Nato can no longer be a substitute for the development of a European capacity to deal with European problems. As Mr Ludlow puts it: 'Europe's leaders cannot at one and the same time bemoan the demoralisation which their failures in the former Yugoslavia have caused and run away from trying to develop a collective framework in which to deal with this and future problems.' The review, he suggests, should be set in motion by the special EC summit planned for late October. That will not be a moment too soon.</p>

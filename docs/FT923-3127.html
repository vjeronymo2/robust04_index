			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Warning on Bosnia peace strategy UNITED Nations and European Community officials will this week start implementing a three-pronged strategy aimed at ending the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina, officials in Belgrade said at the weekend, write Judy Dempsey in Belgrade and Lionel Barber in Hatfield. But they warned that the process will be slow. The strategy involves linking political talks at the Geneva conference on the former Yugoslavia, with a massive humanitarian aid operation in Bosnia, and an extended monitoring mission to stem fighting. It follows discussions over the past few days between Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, joint chairmen of the Geneva conference, and Croatian, Bosnian and Serbian leaders. The EC yesterday expressed guarded optimism about the peace efforts and agreed to refrain from introducing tougher diplomatic and economic sanctions. Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, said at a meeting of Community foreign ministers in Hatfield in the UK that the EC and UN would continue to press the warring parties to place their heavy weapons under international control and close down detention camps in Bosnia in compliance with the London peace conference accords. Accordingly, Mr John Major, British premier, is to write to the presidents of Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia reminding them of their obligations. Ministers agreed to support a US proposal to impose a a 'no fly' zone over Bosnia-Hercegovina and said Serbia should be denied the former Yugoslavia's seat at the UN. The proposed ban would not be imposed in the air, as in Iraq, but by stationing observers at airports.</p>

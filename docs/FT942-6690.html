			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Markets: The third demon has reared its head - Wall Street Here we go again. Just when investors thought the demons which had plagued US financial markets throughout the spring had been exorcised, an unexpected upward revision in first quarter economic growth sparks a sell-off in bonds and revives fears that the Federal Reserve might have to reassess its decision to place monetary policy on hold. The double demons of rising inflation and rising interest rates are back, or so it seemed to investors early yesterday, when they lowered the benchmark 30-year bond three quarters of a point, pushing the yield above 7.4 per cent, and took 10 points off the Dow Jones industrial average in the opening minutes of trading. Investors were selling stocks and bonds on the heels of an upward revision in the first quarter gross domestic product data, which the Commerce department changed from originally estimated growth of 2.6 per cent to growth of 3.0 per cent. Just as worrying, the fixed weight deflator, a closely-watched inflation measure, was also revised upwards, from 2.9 per cent to 3.1 per cent. Stronger economic growth and higher inflation was just what Wall Street did not want to hear about, especially coming so soon after the markets had staged an impressive rally in the wake of the Fed's fourth interest rate increase in as many months. The only reason why that rate increase had been so well received was because traders and investors judged that it would be the last in a round of monetary tightenings that began on February 4. The economic revisions, however, suggested that this judgment may have been premature. Yet, yesterday's declines might have been a lot worse. It was the markets' good fortune that within hours of the first quarter GDP revision being announced, Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, was up before Congress at a pre-arranged hearing explaining the thinking behind the central bank's recent policy manoeuvres. Rarely can Wall Street have enjoyed such an immediate opportunity to listen to what the Fed chairman thought of some troubling economic figures. Unfortunately, Greenspan was less than forthcoming and did nothing to assuage investors' fears. If anything, he only made their mood worse by reintroducing the third demon that has been plaguing the markets this year: uncertainty about the direction of Fed policy. The next meeting of the Fed's open market committee is not until July 5, so the markets have a stretch of more than five weeks ahead of them in which to sweat about the possibility of another rate increase. (The Fed, of course, could tighten policy again before the FOMC meets, but analysts believe the central bank is most likely to wait until July 5 before making another policy move.) Renewed uncertainty can only mean more volatility for securities prices in the month ahead, with investors likely to react sharply to every piece of economic news they believe might have a bearing on monetary policy. A week ago it looked as if the markets had turned a corner; bond yields had dropped decisively below 7.6 per cent and the Dow was climbing steadily from 3,650. Now, no one is quite so sure, and with many buyers likely to stay on the sidelines, at least until the May FOMC meeting, both bond and stock markets could be in for further declines. A renewal of uncertainty was also troubling investors in Philip Morris this week. Trading in the stock was suspended for Wednesday while the Phillip Morris board discussed the pros and cons of separating the company's food and tobacco interests. In recent months speculation that the company would split in half has been providing Philip Morris' shares with much-needed support at a time when cigarette manufacturers were under fierce fire from anti-smoking forces in Congress and across the US. The speculation, however, proved off-the-mark, because after the board meeting, Philip Morris announced that a decision on whether to split the company's two main businesses would not be taken 'for the foreseeable future.' Disappointment at the move sent Philip Morris shares tumbling when trading in the stock reopened on Thursday. Investors were unhappy because the company started the speculation earlier this year when it revealed a break-up was being considered. Many analysts, however, believe the board's decision was primarily intended to buy some time, and that a division of the businesses is still the only way Philip Morris can protect its food operations from the problems afflicting the company's tobacco interests.  --------------------------- Monday      3742.41   -23.94 Tuesday     3745.17   +02.76 Wednesday   3755.30   +10.13 Thursday    3753.46   -01.84 Friday      3757.14    +3.68  ---------------------------</p>

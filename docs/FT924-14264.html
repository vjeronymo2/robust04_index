			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Mulcahy's Pounds 1m - Directors' transactions ONE TRANSACTION stands out above all others this week. Geoffrey Mulcahy, the chairman and chief executive of the stores group Kingfisher, exercised an option of 374,475 shares and sold the resulting holding. In the process, he made a gross profit of just over Pounds 1m by taking advantage of a sharp rise in the share price following sterling's devaluation. Three directors in CRT Group, formerly Smallshaw Knitwear, have been selling stock just below a pound. Now quoted under business services and operating in consultancy and recruitment services, the company's earnings record has proved more consistent in recent times. All three of the directors selling shares retain close to 500,000 each. Evidence of further support for the media group WPP will cheer those who see the stock as a classic recovery play. Martin Sorrell, the chief executive, has bought a further 100,000 shares at 34.5p, having purchased 100,000 at 39p in mid-August. Earlier this summer, the company completed a complex capital restructuring.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           No of Company                   Sector      Shares    Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Astec (BSR)               Elec       100,000      27         1 Bradford Property         Prop        25,000      34         1 Bradstock                 InsB       115,000     131         2 CRT                       BusS       119,000     115         3 Haggas                    Text        12,500      14         1 Kingfisher                Stor       374,475   2,060         1* Portals                   PP&amp;P         3,500      14         1 Sainsbury (J)             FdRe        14,817      68         4 Telemetrix                Elec        25,300      12         1 Tomkins                   OthI        28,542      72         1 Unilever                  FdMa         1,780      19         2 Willis Corroon            InsB         6,676      14         1 Wolv'pton &amp; Dudley        Brew         2,000      11         1 Yule Catto                Chem        15,000      35         1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES Antogasta                 Mine         4,800      30         1 Apollo Metals             MetF        31,500      29         2 British Fittings          BdMt        32,500      19         4 Chubb Securities                      10,000      20         1 Electric &amp; General        InvT        50,000      64         1 Hillsdown Holding         FdMa        35,000      31         1 Mucklow                   Prop        30,000      34         1 Protean                   EngG        50,000      57         1 Ouiligotti                BdMt       750,000      26         1 Rutland Trust             OthF       500,000      40         2 Tarmac                    BdMt        20,000      14         1 Wembley                   Hotl        50,000      11         1 WPP                       Medi       100,000      35         1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

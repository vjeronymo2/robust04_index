			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only when the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, sealed bids or competitive proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and one of the following circumstances applies:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The item is available only from a single source;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) After solicitation of a number of sources,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competition is determined inadequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data, the projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs and profit, is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Grantees and subgrantees may be required to submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed procurement to the awarding agency for pre-award  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Contracting with small and minority firms, women's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business enterprise and labor surplus area firms.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grantee and subgrantee will take all necessary affirmative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steps to assure that minority firms, women's business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Affirmative steps shall include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> women's business enterprises on solicitation lists;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> women's business enterprises are solicited whenever they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential sources;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Dividing total requirements, when economically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasible, into smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation by small and minority business, and women's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business enterprises;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement permits, which encourage participation by small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and minority business, and women's business enterprises;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Using the services and assistance of the Small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Business Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Commerce; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be let, to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)(2) (i) through (v) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Contract cost and price.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Grantees and subgrantees must perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action including contract modifications. The method and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree of analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular procurement situation, but as a starting point, grantees must make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost analysis must be performed when the offeror is required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to submit the elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional, consulting, and architectural engineering services contracts. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost analysis will be necessary when adequate price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competition is lacking, and for sole source procurements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including contract modifications or change orders, unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price reasonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog or market price of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial product sold in substantial quantities to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general public or based on prices set by law or regulation. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price analysis will be used in all other instances to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the reasonableness of the proposed contract price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Grantees and subgrantees will negotiate profit as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate element of the price for each contract in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is no price competition and in all cases where cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis is performed. To establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subcontracting, the quality of its record of past  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance, and industry profit rates in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts under grants will be allowable only to the extent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that costs incurred or cost estimates included in negotiated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices are consistent with Federal cost principles (see &sect;2541.220). Grantees may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference their own cost principles that comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable Federal cost principles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction cost methods of contracting shall not be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Awarding agency review.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Grantees and subgrantees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must make available, upon request of the awarding agency,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical specifications on proposed procurements where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> awarding agency believes such review is needed to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the item and/or service specified is the one being proposed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase. This review generally will take place prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document. However, if the grantee or subgrantee desires to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have the review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> awarding agency may still review the specifications, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such review usually limited to the technical aspects of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed purchase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available for awarding agency pre-award review procurement documents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as requests for proposals or invitations for bids,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independent cost estimates, etc., when_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A grantee's or subgrantee's procurement procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this section; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The procurement is expected to exceed $25,000 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is received in response to a solicitation; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $25,000, specifies a ``brand name'' product; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The proposed award over $25,000 is to be awarded to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procurement; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than $25,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

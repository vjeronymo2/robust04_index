			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Nokia launches digital hand-held phone today NOKIA, the Finnish electronics group, today launches a digital hand-portable phone based on the European GSM standard. The move is expected to take Europe closer to its goal of a pan-European digital mobile communications system, allowing the phones to be used in any of the 15 European countries which have agreed to adopt the standard. The launch comes as countries in Europe have been investing in their GSM infrastructure; Nokia expects to have handsets available within a few weeks. As Europe's largest cellular phone maker, it sees the GSM network in Europe sufficiently widespread by next summer for the system to take off. Digital phones are costlier to develop and therefore more costly to consumers, but reception quality is much higher than analog systems, with greater security against intrusion. The market is expected to grow to Pounds 400m by 1995.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                        OECD EXPORT CREDIT RATES  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Minimum interest rates for officially supported export credits (%)  -------------------------------------------------------------------                                Sept 15-        Aug 15-                                 Oct 14         Sept 14 DMark                             9.45            9.54 Ecu                               9.47            9.89 French franc                     10.54           10.30 Guilder*                          9.60            9.55 Guilder****                       9.45            9.50 Guilder**                         9.30            9.35 Italian lira                     13.48           13.49 Yen                               5.50            5.90 Peseta                           13.73           13.26 Sterling                         10.56           10.16 Swiss franc                       8.08            8.09 US dollar*                        5.72            5.91 US dollar****                     6.60            6.84 US dollar**                       7.12            7.36  ------------------------------------------------------------------- *Up to 5 years. ****Five to 8 1/2 years. **More than 8 1/2 years.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- These rates are published monthly by the Financial Times, normally around the middle of each month.

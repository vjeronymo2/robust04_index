			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpt] As was customary, the provincial government held  a cocktail party yesterday in Taichung to commemorate the Taiwan  Recovery Day. When non-Taiwanese Provincial Governor Sung  Ch'u-yu [1345 2806 2404, James Soong] delivered his remarks, he  spoke quite a bit of Taiwanese. When President Li, who also  attended the cocktail party made his remarks, he emphasized the  unconquerable spirit born of the special circumstances and the  vitality shaped by the "Taiwan experience." He expressed the  hope that all Taiwanese will further develop this spirit, and  strive for even more glorious achievements.    On the same day, the "Taiwan People's Federation" was  established in Taipei. Invited to deliver remarks at that  meeting, professor P'eng Ming-min [1756 2494 2404], noting that  Taiwan had relations with Mainland China in only four out the  past 100 years, called upon all Taiwanese to sever any emotional  ties to China and strive to achieve the dream of a Taiwan that  is stable, prosperous, and democratic, with freedom and respect  for human rights.    Also on the same day, a "Republic of Taiwan National  Assembly" jointly sponsored by four organizations -- the  "Foundation for Establishing Taiwan as a State," the "Taiwan  Sung-Chu Association," the "Association for Supporting Taiwan in  the United Nations," and the "Taiwan Cultural Advancement  Association" -- held its first meeting outside the west gate of  the Taipei Railway Station. The members demanded that Li  Teng-hui dissolve the Republic of China and the Kuomintang  [KMT], transfer the KMT properties into a fund for establishing  Taiwan as a nation, and truly recover or liberate Taiwan.    In the past, commemoration of the Taiwan Recovery Day was  never quite so enthusiastic. In observing the Taiwan Recovery  Day this year, one can sense there were different connotations  in the commemorations held at different quarters.    Why is it that for the first time in 21 years a  non-Taiwanese  was appointed Governor? Why is it that this non-native Governor  spoke in Taiwanese? This is because the KMT may possibly be  trying to promote harmony among the peoples and groups. To use  President Li Teng-hui's own phrase, the KMT is "re-opening an  old store."    Why is it that P'eng Ming-min once again emphasized the  "sovereignty of Taiwan?" This is because a large number of  people have spontaneously reacted adversely to what they  perceived to be covetous designs of the Chinese Communists.    Why is it that in establishing the "Taiwan People's  Federation," no attempt was made to sort out the non-Taiwanese  from among the sponsors and supporters? This is because the  concept of Taiwan as a "living community" for every one is  gaining widely popular, though still complex responses.    The issue of reunification versus independence is still to  be  fully debated, but on Taiwanese soil, the cries of "Taiwan,  Taiwan!" are becoming louder and louder. [passage omitted]</p>

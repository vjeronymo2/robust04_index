			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: World seeks to break a spell of recession - Leading economist Peter Oppenheimer forsees a difficult 1992 for financial markets A YEAR AGO recession was an Anglo-Saxon phenomenon. The North American, British and Australian economies had ground to a halt but expansion was still vigorous in Japan, in south east Asia and in much of continental Europe, especially Germany. For the first time since the 1960s, the business cycle appeared to be de-synchronised across countries - a welcome development since de-synchronisation had been a big help to world economic stability in that decade. The deepening gloom at the onset of 1992 stems from a perception that the magic formula of the 1960s has not been re-discovered. Japan and continental Europe have slowed down, without expansion resuming in America and Britain. The Anglo-Saxon economies remain plagued by weak external competitiveness and by the aftermath of financial mis-management on the grand scale in the later 1980s - ill-judged deregulation, wild lending policies, absence of prudential restraints. In the US, the Fed has responded belatedly by bringing down interest rates to a reasonably low level, and the strength of equity prices is a good omen. Japan is following suit on interest rates; but its equity market still looks fragile and remains over-dependent on foreigners for business. Nonetheless, investors who like to swim against the tide should be taking (or have taken) profits on Wall Street, while maintaining or enlarging their stake in the Far East. Europe is demonstrating more clearly than ever that fixed exchange parities in the ERM in the absence of a European Federal Reserve System means subservience to the Bundesbank. France, Italy and the rest of the EC have to swallow additional unemployment in order that German trade unions moderate their wage claims. Not that Germany is especially to blame. German abhorrence of even moderate inflation is hardly news and it has been clear for some time that re-unification would impose particular strains on the German economy. A dose of unwanted deflation is the price which the French are now paying for having successfully opposed the Bundesbank's wish to up-value the D-mark within the ERM two and three years ago. A precisely analogous mistake was committed by Britain when it joined the ERM in the autumn of 1990 at a central rate at least 10 per cent too high from the point of view of external competitiveness. To be sure, ERM membership has helped to subdue inflationary psychology in Britain. But so it would have done if the parity chosen had been 10 per cent lower - and so it will do, even if the government decides, either before or after the election, that a lower parity is appropriate. Increasingly frantic Tory politicians are urging the Chancellor to follow-up on the emergency package for the housing market with income tax cuts in the Budget. Given the myopia and gullibility of the British electorate, such measures are tempting - even though a boost to domestic demand without regard to the country's external trade position would be economic folly. By contrast, devaluation would be economically respectable and probably better for the stock market. Another area of uncertainty for international business relations is commercial policy, including the continued failure to bring the Uruguay Round of Gatt negotiations to a successful conclusion. The difficulty is to decide how seriously to take this. There have been numerous chicken wars and other trans-Atlantic trade squabbles in the past 20 years. The proliferation over that time of voluntary export restraints and other protectionist devices contrary to the spirit and sometimes to the letter of Gatt has not prevented world trade from continuing to expand at a healthy rate, certainly faster than world output. And the spread of multinationals provides an on-going counter-force to industrial protectionism. Talk of 'fortress Europe' inspired by the Single European Act helped to attract additional Japanese and US investment to the EC - perhaps the most conspicuous benefit of the 1992 programme. On the other hand, US exasperation at its bilateral trade deficits with whichever Far Eastern country is currently in major surplus seems to be growing. The US deficit is quintessentially home-made, a reflection of low domestic saving and of the budget deficits established by President Reagan's tax cuts a decade ago. Yet the US Congress is once again spawning absurd legislative proposals, for example requiring the Japanese to reduce their bilateral surplus with the US by 20 per cent a year for the next five years or face a trade war. Even more important is the question of eastern Europe and Russia. Free access to western export markets is vitally necessary if economic reforms in these countries are to have a chance of making rapid headway. Political revolution in the east should have been matched by radical commercial measures in the European Community. Instead, protectionist lobbies in Brussels and elsewhere have manoeuvred to delay and limit market access for the eastern countries through much of the 1990s. If economic discontent aggravates political instability and encourages the emergence of new forms of authoritarianism in eastern Europe, Brussels will have its share of responsibility; and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange will not be the only loser.</p>

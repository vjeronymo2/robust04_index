			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Assad's speech lifts Israeli peace hopes: Signs of progress on Golan Heights Israel yesterday hailed a statement by Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, saying it was aimed at preparing the Syrian public for peace. At the same time there was growing optimism in the Jewish state of an imminent breakthrough in stalled peace negotiations. In a speech to the newly elected Syrian parliament on Saturday Mr Assad said peace with Israel was a strategic option and he was willing to work towards peace and 'meet the objective requirements that are agreed upon'. Mr Itamar Rabinovich, chief Israeli negotiator with Syria, said: 'It's first and foremost a speech preparing public opinion in Syria.' Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said Mr Assad had 'declared he has a strategy of peace. . . and there were more than hints that he understands that peace truly means peace, that is to say normalisation of relations'. Israeli officials say privately that significant progress has been made in US-brokered negotiations over the return of the occupied Golan Heights in return for full peace, and both governments have now entered a period of preparing their publics for a deal. Mr Uri Savir, Foreign Ministry director-general, said yesterday that US secretary of state Warren Christopher would return to the region this month or next and that US officials were optimistic about a substantial breakthrough. However, Israeli optimism has yet to be matched in public in Damascus, and Mr Assad reiterated Syria's unconditional demand for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Heights - a demand unacceptable, so far, to Israel and the traditional stumbling block in talks. Last week Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, presented for the first time a plan for a partial withdrawal from the Golan, backed by US military assistance, followed by a three-year trial period marked by normalisation, including setting up embassies. Mr Rabin said that only after the normalisation period would Israel negotiate the line of its final withdrawal from the Heights. The move was immediately rejected by Syria as unacceptable but Israeli officials say the Rabin plan was an opening gambit meant partly to test Israeli public opinion. They said that by comparing the deal to Israel's phased 26-month withdrawal from the Egyptian Sinai between 1980 and 1982 Mr Rabin was also hinting that a similar deal with Damascus would culminate in full withdrawal. Mr Rabin's plan opened a fierce public debate in Israel between proponents and opponents on territorial withdrawal from the Golan. On Saturday thousands of Jewish settlers on the Golan held a mass rally to kick off a campaign of uncompromising but non-violent civil disobedience they say will be 'the battle for the Golan'. In Mr Rabin's governing Labour party eight parliamentarians have demanded that any territorial compromise secure a 70-vote majority in the 120-member parliament. The dovish wing of the party has called for a reform of Labour's platform by erasing clauses which support Israeli sovereignty of the Golan. Mr Rabin has met both initiatives with stern warnings against breaking party discipline. Ultimately Mr Rabin hopes to deflate the public and party battle by not dismantling any Jewish settlements in the meantime and by putting any substantial withdrawal to a national referendum after elections in 1996. A recent opinion poll conducted by Haifa University showed at least 64 per cent of Israelis support at least a partial withdrawal in exchange for full peace with Syria. The poll showed that 27 per cent supported full withdrawal and that many people had become more favourable to territorial compromise over the past year.</p>

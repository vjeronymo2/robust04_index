			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 U.S. FIRMS MAY TEAM UP TO MAKE COMPUTER SCREENS  </P> <P> Several U.S. electronics companies are considering forming a cooperative  venture to develop and produce advanced display screens for portable computers  and, potentially, high-definition television sets.  </P> <P> The discussions, which reportedly include such giants as Sun Microsystems,  Compaq Computer and Apple Computer, represent the most recent attempt by U.S.  high-technology companies to band together to reduce their reliance on Japanese  suppliers of key components needed in products ranging from new commercial  computer systems to everyday home electronics.  </P> <P> The latest proposal centers on liquid crystal displays, a technology commonly  used in wrist watches, radios and a variety of electronic gear, including the  latest miniature television sets and most advanced laptop computers made in  Japan.  </P> <P> Early plans call for the proposed cooperative to create "computer and other  commercial products" from liquid crystal display research developed at the  David Sarnoff Research Center, the Princeton, N.J., laboratory that pioneered  the technology in 1968. Japanese companies have long since taken over  development of the market, now running at $3.8 billion per year, and are the  dominant suppliers of LCD screens.  </P> <P> Although such a venture could reduce dependence of U.S. companies on Japanese  suppliers, participants in the talks labeled them "early stage" and cautioned  that the proposed venture is still quite "tentative." Those Japanese suppliers  in many cases are direct rivals to U.S. computer firms in such emerging fields  as high-definition television and portable computers.  </P> <P> News of the latest talks comes less than six weeks after seven U.S. computer  companies were unable to win sufficient support from other high-tech firms to  back a similar cooperative venture, called U.S. Memories, that would have  produced key computer memory chips. That market is also dominated by the  Japanese.  </P> <P> None of the U.S. companies reportedly interested in joining the display screen  venture would comment on the discussions. However, representatives of the  Sarnoff Center confirmed that talks are under way in the hopes of creating the  cooperative by year-end. Sources familiar with the discussions said the venture  could require $30 million to get off the ground and $100 million to begin  full-scale production.  </P> <P> Liquid crystal displays are considered superior screens because they offer  great clarity with low power. In addition, the screens, made by sandwiching  liquid crystal between two sheets of glass that have been coated with  transparent electrodes, are flat and lighter than the cathode ray tubes used in  current television and computer models.  </P> <P> In addition to seeking an immediate commercial application for its liquid  crystal display technology, the Sarnoff Center is pursuing two other  independent research programs involving high-definition television and high  definition computers.  </P> <P> The laboratory, once the research arm of RCA, is a partner with National  Broadcasting Co., N. V. Phillips and Thompson Consumer Electronics in a project  to develop standards for high-definition television transmission and reception  in the United States. And, late last year, Sarnoff was teamed with Sun  Microsystems and Texas Instruments to develop a high-definition computer  workstation by the Defense Department's research and development office.  </P></p>

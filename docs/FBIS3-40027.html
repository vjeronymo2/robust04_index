			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Guido Passalacqua report: "Bossi Versus His Ally: </F> `Silvio, I Will Beat You'"]    [Excerpt] Milan -- [passage omitted] Addressing about a  thousand shivering people, [Northern League leader] Bossi did  not beat about the bush when speaking of his ally, [Forza Italia  leader] Berlusconi: "Within the freedom alignment it is  necessary to begin the struggle for hegemony. And hegemony  cannot belong to Forza Italia, which was created to destroy the  League. It belongs to the League." Was this a trick move  designed to reassure the grassroots or an open declaration of  war?    In his interview on "Mixer" [television program] Berlusconi  described Bossi as a "paradoxical and coarse" politician, so  Bossi replied by saying that Forza Italia was created months ago  in order to attack the League. That was all the audience wanted  to hear, and at the end they overwhelmed him with requests for  autographs, but also with pressing questions such as, "Umberto,  why did you ally with Berlusconi?"    Bossi, who is well acquainted with his supporters' feelings  and sympathies, was combative and talked about past months when  the League was in difficulties: "Another operation was in  progress -- that of Forza Italia. We realized that it would be  a factor which, in the hands of a businessman of the north,  could steal votes from the League and add them to those of the  DC [Christian Democratic Party] and of that other Christian  democrat, Segni. That was the plan -- to hit the League, to  smash it." It was the theory of the grand conspiracy against  the League, in which Forza Italia was supposedly involved, at  least at the start. Bossi described it clearly for the first  time. The bombshell was sparked off by the "gift" of the 200  million lire. "It was [investigating magistrate] Di Pietro who  caused it to explode, prompted by Sama, the man connected with  the great and mysterious authority that stands above politics in  this country." His reference was to big finance, to Mediobanca  [Financial Credit Bank], to those who do not want "any of the  alignments to win, because they want to remain in command." If  Forza Italia was involved in this "conspiracy," how does Bossi  explain his subsequent alliance with Berlusconi? "The plan did  not succeed," the League withstood it, and so, "against its will  -- since it was formed in order to steal votes from the League  -- Forza Italia found itself trapped in our net and will serve  to destroy the DC."    This was a veritable mortal triple jump, and to make it more  comprehensible to his voters, Bossi raised his tone: "At one  point we were in great difficulties. We had arrayed against us  all of the television stations, which were in the hands of the  party system and of the sons of the party dictatorship." And,  Bossi implied, these television stations included those of  Berlusconi.    Bossi recounted to the audience, in a loud voice, the story  of a marriage not for love but of convenience, a marriage with  someone who until recently was conspiring against the League,  and in which the marriage contract will have to be revised after  the elections. He drew applause when he said: "I say that the  League will govern this country and that there will be a  struggle within the Pole for Freedom and that we will grant  hegemony to the League."    While Berlusconi has expressed his esteem for [former  Italian  Socialist Party Secretary] Craxi, Bossi shouted: "I claim that  the League destroyed Bettino Craxi." While Berlusconi is  suspicious of public spending, Bossi repeated that "Craxi and  [former Christian Democrat Prime Minister] Andreotti, like South  American dictators, wanted inflation in order to destroy the  public debt; it is a shame that they destroyed the economy." At  the end of the rally, asked whether his speech should be  interpreted as a declaration of war within the freedom  alignment, he replied tersely: "The truth is the truth, even if  it is uncomfortable." He added: "Things will not turn out as  the opinion polls say. Berlusconi will not be the winner in the  elections; it will be the League. We will be dominant.  Berlusconi -- born of the DC in order to destroy the League --  has become involved in a mechanism that will destroy the DC."</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Kurds face winter hardship, relief mission warns AT least 1.5m people could be at risk from hunger and cold this winter in the Kurdish-controlled areas of north Iraq, according to the findings of a joint US-EC relief mission to the region. The conclusions, published yesterday, are considerably more gloomy than assessments by the United Nations in June, when it was still assumed the aid could be trans-shipped through Baghdad. The report coincides with talks in Baghdad where the UN has still to extend the current aid memorandum, the legal basis for its relief operation since the end of the Gulf War. According to the UN's original calculations, the winter shelter programme for North Iraq was to cost Dollars 85m. The US-EC mission puts the figure at Dollars 185m. Turkish officials confirm the US has already approached Turkey to allow the aid to be transported through Turkey, in the event that talks with Baghdad break down. 'It was difficult enough last year, with the government's consent. If Baghdad does not agree soon, there will be no time to stockpile supplies,' said a UN official. The UN said yesterday that approval had been given 'in principle'. However, agreement had still to be found on both procurement and exchange rate policy, with the UN keen to avoid using the unrealistic official rate for procurement of one dinar to Dollars 3. EC officials warned yesterday relief agencies had between eight and 10 weeks to pre-position supplies before the onset of winter. Without Baghdad's agreement, relief trucks will have to use the much longer route in Kurdish areas, limiting the freight tonnages. An economic embargo has halted traffic on the Iraqi-Turkish border at Harbur Bridge, where Turkish Kurdish rebels have been fighting against Iraqi Kurdish forces.</p>

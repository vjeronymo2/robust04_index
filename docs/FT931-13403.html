			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: US move seen by Sainsbury GROWING speculation that J. Sainsbury is looking to make a substantial acquisition in the UK is likely to prove wide of the mark, according to London analysts. The supermarket group is now believed to be targeting a large US food store business. Such a purchase, which could cost Sainsbury about Pounds 400m, would complement its Shaw's supermarkets division of 75 stores based in New England. It could also cause Sainsbury to seek further funds from its shareholders. The shares gained a penny to 559p. Names touted nearer home yesterday included the loss-making Do It All chain owned by WH Smith and Boots. Analysts said there would be some synergy with Sainsbury's Homebase DIY business, with suggestions also that patience is wearing thin among Do It All's present owners. WH Smith 'A' shares advanced 8 to 453p, helped by a Nomura buy note. Boots edged forward to 518p. Another candidate under scrutiny was Asda. Yesterday saw 22m shares traded and the equivalent of another 10m in the options market. The shares added 2 at 68 1/2 p. However, analysts were dismissive of a bid for Asda, arguing that the financial and strategic advantages were not compelling. ICI sold Shares in ICI fell 12 to 1,111p with several traders pinpointing US investment bank Goldman Sachs. Dealers said Goldman had finally managed to offload in New York the 10m shares still on its books after Hanson sold its 2.8 per cent stake in May last year. Goldman would not comment but informed sources said there had been heavy selling to US institutional clients. The shares were also weak following press comment pointing out the relatively small positive impact of the business swap with BASF of Germany, announced on Thursday compared with the subsequent sharp rise in the share price. C &amp; W active A late flurry of selling caused by broker downgrades, drove Cable &amp; Wireless shares sharply lower in the last hour of trading. The stock ended the session down 18 at 703p with turnover expanding rapidly to a hefty 5.5m. The profit downgrades were initiated, specialists said, by Cazenove, Cable's own broker, which reduced its profits forecast for the year to end-March 1994 to around Pounds 900m. Other brokers were said to have followed in cutting their numbers. Previous estimates were around Pounds 970m-80m. Analysts said Mercury, C &amp; W's 80 per cent-owned telecoms business, has been hit by the recession while Hong Kong Telecom, where C &amp; W has a 58 per cent stake, could be facing reductions in call charges. C &amp; W's preliminary figures for the year are expected in May. Strong demand for British Airways (BA) saw turnover rise to 15m, and the shares close 8 up at 273p, as the market took on board Thursday's announcement of a strategic alliance with USAir. That news came shortly after Thursday's market close so yesterday was the UK stock market's first reaction to the US deal which came at the end of a week of bad publicity for BA over its dispute with Virgin Atlantic. US houses were particularly keen buyers with Salomon International on the bid for most of the morning, and Lehman Brothers a strong buyer during the afternoon. Messages from a US trade union to UK institutional shareholders of Tate &amp; Lyle highlighting an industrial dispute unsettled the shares which retreated 4 to 395p. While specialists downplayed the financial significance of the dispute, which involves negotiations over labour contracts at a large US refinery, it struck a nerve with investors ahead of the group's agm next week. A modest rally in crude oil prices helped the exploration and production sub-sector register further good gains. Enterprise Oil rose 8 more to 419p on relatively keen turnover of 1.5m shares after some strong demand said to have been generated by Lehman Brothers, the US broker. Mr Peter Hitchens, oil analyst at Lehman said the company 'still has the potential for good growth and remains the quality play in the exploration stocks.' Banks maintained their strong showing, renewed buying driven by recovery hopes and takeover speculation. Standard Chartered capped a week of big gains by a further 17 gain to 653p, having touched a 1992/3 high of 655p, after profits upgrades and renewed takeover speculation. During the week Standard shares have risen 68. NatWest gained 9 to 435p, on 9.1m traded, but Lloyds, widely regarded as a potential bidder for one of the UK banks, closed unchanged at 499p,with 4.9m traded. Volatility continued in Glaxo on the two-way view about imminent economic recovery. An announcement by Glaxo's Japanese arm of a co-development deal to sell Zantac, the prescription ulcer treatment, as an over-the-counter drug was interpreted by one analyst as highlighting the company's concern about its concentration on prescription drugs. The shares closed 5 lower at 712p. Gases group BOC rose 3 to 746p following a buy note from Kleinwort Benson. Vague bid talk, coupled with a buy note from James Capel, the UK institutional broker, helped Cadbury-Schweppes, up 10 at 482p. Reuters Holdings failed to benefit from the market's recovery as the stock drifted a further 20 to 1310p ahead of results in February. BZW has voiced caution over the rating and James Capel has reinforced its negative stance. Shares in Midlands Radio were suspended at 112p pending announcement of a recommended offer by Capital Radio. Capital bid 130p a share, valuing Midland at Pounds 17.7m. Profit-taking prompted London television franchise holder Carlton to fall 8 to 798p. Anglia Television was held down at 202p as NatWest Securities moved the stock to a hold from a buy,arguing that the shares were fairly valued at present levels. Reports that aircraft leasing company GPA was to cancel a large number of aircraft orders hurt several suppliers to the aircraft manufacturers Among those to suffer were TI, 5 lower at 296p, and Smiths Industries which also gave up 5 to 367p. British Aerospace moved 5 ahead to 215p, on talk that the long awaited Al-Yamamah 2 defence order was about to be announced. Regional broker Wise Speke placed 25 per cent of shoe sellers Stylo at around 96p. The shares fell 4 to 108p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992/93 NEW HIGHS (140).

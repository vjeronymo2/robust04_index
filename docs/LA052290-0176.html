			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ZSA ZSA'S ROLLS -- NO GLAMOUR  </P> <P> Zsa Zsa Gabor's Rolls-Royce had no star appeal for bidders at the annual  Bennett Investor Auction, who offered less than half the value.  </P> <P> "Perhaps the right-wing audience didn't respond to it," Terry Cooper, spokesman  for the auction, said Monday.  </P> <P> Auctioneers said the actress was driving the Rolls when she had her renowned  run-in with a Beverly Hills motorcycle policeman. A California jury convicted  her of charges alleging that she slapped the officer after he stopped her.  </P> <P> The Rolls drew a $23,000 bid, Cooper said. Appraisers estimated that the Rolls  was worth more than twice that, he said.  </P></p>

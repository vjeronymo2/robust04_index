			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Housing cash plan 'no solution' Abolition of restrictions on how cash raised through the sale of council houses can be used to build new homes for rent will provide no long-term solution to the housing shortage, according to a report published today. The release of local authority capital receipts has been at the centre of Labour party policies to increase the supply of council homes and create jobs in the construction industry. A report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation, says that the receipts are concentrated in areas where there are high council house sales, not in areas with the greatest housing need. The report says the only realistic way to increase investment in low-cost housing for rent without increasing government borrowing is for council housing to be transferred to local housing companies. These would be outside the public sector and able to borrow against the security of the existing stock to finance repairs and new homes. An analysis of how local authorities spent the Pounds 900m released in the 'capital receipts holiday' after the 1992 autumn statement shows that local authorities are often tempted to use the money for other purposes. The report says about Pounds 200m of the receipts released were diverted to investments such as leisure centres and town hall projects. Investment in Social Housing, Housing Research Findings 112.

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment: Nordic Countries (2): Deep-rooted troubles - Sweden: Nordbanken is beset with bad debts NORDBANKEN, Sweden's loss-making state-controlled bank, has been more badly hit over the past year by credit losses than any of its main competitors and it is unlikely it will make a full recovery until 1994 at the earliest. 'We have had a turbulent 12 months, admits Mr Jacob Palmstierna, vice-chairman. In 1990 the bank's bad debts soared to about SKr10bn and Nordbanken believes they will 'continue abnormally high' in 1992 and that 1993 will also be a difficult year. Sweden's centre-right government would like to privatise the state's 70.6 per cent stake in Nordbanken but the bank's leadership will need to resolve its troubles before such a move seems possible. Nordbanken's overall financial target is to maintain over one business cycle 'a return on adjusted shareholders' equity of 17 per cent after standard tax' and ensure a capital adequacy of 'well over 8 per cent'. The current leadership was installed at Nordbanken in January 1991 when the then Social Democratic minority government appointed the deputy chief executive at Skandia insurance company, Mr Hans Dalborg, as chief executive with Mr Bjorn Wahlstrom, head of Svensk Stal AB, the state-owned steel company, as its chairman. The dramatic changes at the top of Nordbanken followed the revelation that it expected to suffer SKr3bn of credit losses in 1990. In fact, the losses turned out to be much higher at SKr4.2bn and ensured a sharp fall in the bank's profits for that year to a mere SKr1m - down from SKr3.2bn in 1989. The Dalborg-Wahlstrom regime appeared to make an impressive start in the early part of 1991. A cost-saving programme was launched and jobs were cut through a rationalisation of the bank's structure. An intensive care unit was created to recover outstanding loans. And in a move decided to show just how seriously the bank was taking its difficulties, it was decided not to pay a dividend. As a result, during the first four months, Nordbanken saw its operating profits climb by 59 per cent to SKr471m. But this proved to be a false dawn. Indeed, the bank was already warning at that stage about the remorseless rise in its credit losses which it said could reach SKr3.6bn for the whole of 1991. The magnitude of the troubles was highlighted last August with a crisis at Nobel Industries, the chemicals and defence group. Nordbanken intervened to save Nobel and agreed to inject SKr2bn of equity - and 13 other banks also chipped in with SKr2.7bn in preference capital. But last month Nobel's board said it was seeking repayments of SKr1.92bn - made to help the bank consortium in its rescure operation - and Nobel's owner claimed SKr3.8bn in damages from the banks over the affair. Last autumn, the Nobel crisis took its toll at Nordbanken. At the end of September it reported a SKr4.6bn deficit in its first eight-month financial results, with credit losses soaring to SKr8bn. It became the first Swedish commercial bank to go into deficit and it predicted that credit losses for the year as a whole would amount to SKr9.5bn. This was the largest in the country's banking history and amounted to 3.5 per cent of total lending volume. The bank also said it had SKr15bn worth of non-performing loans on its books for credits granted between 1988 and 1990 to finance, property and investment companies. The Swedish government agreed last October to help out the bank by subscribing and guaranteeing SKr5.2bn in a new share issue at SKr20 per share, enabling it to meet the 8 per cent capital adequacy requirement made by the Bank of International Settlements for the end of this year. The troubles at Nordbanken have proved to be much more deep-rooted than at first realised; a painful legacy from the period of frenetic competition for customers that followed Sweden's deregulation in the second half of the 1980s. The bank itself was only formed in June 1990 as a merger between state-controlled PKbanken and its smaller provincial competitor Nordbanken. This followed a period of aggressive expansion by PKbanken as it tried to boost its profitability by widening its business beyond its traditional base of small savers and lending to local government authorities to cover real estate and high finance. PKbanken harboured dreams of competing alongside SE Banken and Svenska Handelsbanken for business volumes, but its credit growth proved to be excessive. 'With hindsight you can say the bank grew too rapidly', says Mr Palmstierna. He also believes that while PKbanken's SKr6bn purchase of Nordbanken was 'structurally and strategically correct, the price was exorbitant'. Despite its current travails, Nordbanken believes it can reach its financial targets by 1994. In its prospectus for last year's new share offer it emphasised a number of its underlying strengths. The bank argued that it was now following a restrictive credit policy; that its earnings capacity was good and stable before credit losses; and that its cost-cutting measures had improved efficiency. Nordbanken does have a unique distribution network with not only 230 branch offices in Sweden but also the use of 2,000 post offices in co-operation with Swedish Post. 'As many as 4m Swedes are our customers', says Mr Palmstierna. The bank also believes that the fact that the state is majority owner will affect favourably the creditworthiness of the bank. But there are also a number of imponderables that cast a shadow over Nordbanken. Not least is the duration of Sweden's current recession and the impact this is having on the bank's customers. Despite the general sense of crisis in Swedish banking at the moment, it is also possible that the bank may lose its present dominant position in the country's large public sector as its rivals compete for business in a more bracing financial climate. What Nordbanken really needs is three years of quiet consolidation and back to basics like so many other banks in the Nordic region. But the hang-over period could well last longer at Nordbanken than perhaps with the others. 'The balloon that was blown up during the carnival years of the 1980s has burst', declared Mr Dalborg, the bank's chairman, last autumn when announcing the bank's unexpectedly large deficit for the first eight months of 1991. It looks like taking plenty more blood, sweat and tears to restore its credibility. However at least we will know when Nordbanken has returned to good health: that will be the moment when the Swedish state decides to privatise it.</p>

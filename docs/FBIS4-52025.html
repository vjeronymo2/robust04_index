			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yomei Tsuji] </F>   [Text] Khafji (Saudi Arabia), 27 Apr -- On 27 April, a  Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations]  delegation, the first ever to visit Saudi Arabia, completed its  visit. In addition to expressing dissatisfaction that Japanese  companies are making only limited investment which are directly  linked to employment, Saudi Arabia criticized Japan for  withdrawing from a planned joint venture to refine Saudi crude  oil in Japan, calling for resumption of negotiations on the  project. Saudi Arabia is a leading figure in the Middle East,  and Japan relies on it for half of its oil. Since Saudi Arabia  is important to Japan in terms of securing energy, it seems  Japan needs to take strategic steps in dealing with Saudi Arabia  during ordinary times to strengthen mutual ties.  <H5>  Unusual Meeting With King </H5>   Keidanren Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa met with King Fahd, who  has  absolute power in Saudi Arabia, at 2230 on the evening of 25  April. After waiting several hours after receiving an  unexpected call, Hiraiwa was led to a meeting room in al-Yamamah  Palace in Riyadh. It is unusual for the king to meet an  ordinary citizen.    The king took up the issue of refining crude oil in Japan as  the only concrete subject for discussions at the meeting,  saying: "Although the withdrawal might have been an inevitable  decision made by specialists, I hope Japan will study it again  at an appropriate time."    Saudi Arabia, which attaches importance to the subsidiary  sectors of petroleum projects, worked with Nippon Oil Co. Ltd.,  Japan Energy Company, Arabian Oil Co. Ltd., and other Japanese  oil companies for two years to study the possibility of refining  crude oil in Japan. It was part of Saudi Arabia's Asian  strategy. Because of this, Saudi Arabia's irritation is strong.    Moreover, since an agreement which gives Arabian Oil Co.  Ltd.  the right to produce oil in the Khafji oil field in eastern  Saudi Arabia will expire in 2000, Hiraiwa asked the king to  extend the terms of the agreement, saying: "I hope we will be  able to keep the agreement as a symbol of friendship between the  two countries." In response, the king gave a blunt answer,  saying: "We will study it."    We could feel in the king's response the possibility that  Saudi Arabia may use the issue of extending the term of the  agreement for resumption of negotiations on the oil refinery  project.    On the other hand, during his meeting with Hiraiwa, Industry  and Electricity Minister Abd al-Aziz Abdallah al-Zamil  criticized Japan, saying Japan made only five investments in  Saudi Arabia before 1985. He then gave Hiraiwa a booklet  containing a list of 120 Saudi Arabian joint ventures with  foreign companies. The booklet also contains a list of Saudi  Arabian companies which are seeking joint venture partners in  different areas, including food and chemical projects. At the  end of the meeting, Minister Zamil said: "I am sure this  booklet will help Japanese companies save about five years of  research time."  <H5>  Growing Population and Financial Difficulties </H5>   Saudi Arabia is seeking joint ventures at home because of  its  rapidly increasing population and financial difficulty.    After the oil crisis of the 1970's, which created huge  income  for oil-producing countries, Saudi Arabia emphasized the need to  improve social capital, and the level of medical services  improved significantly. Because of this, the infant mortality  rate sharply decreased and the population increased rapidly.  About 20 percent of the Saudi population is less than 20 years  old; difficulty in finding jobs has become a problem.    Unlike before, government-affiliated organizations are no  longer employing people. While national revenue continues to  decrease due to low oil prices, expenditures--including  expenditure for the Gulf war, weapons cost, and subsidies for  daily goods--are continuing to grow. Saudi Arabia continues to  suffer a deficit. The budget for this fiscal year was cut by  about 20 percent from that of the previous year.    Nevertheless, apprehensions in Islamic society will grow  if the unemployment rate of young people increases. Eventually,  it may weaken the foundation of the royal government.    Foreign Minister Saud, who is a member of the royal family,  asked Hiraiwa to understand Saudi Arabia's difficult position,  saying: "Iraq is still a difficult country to deal with. The  Khomeyni line continues in Iran. Middle East peace with Israel  is not progressing either. I hope Japan will fulfill its  political role as well."  <H5>  More Important Than Rice </H5>   It seems Saudi Arabia is not as attractive as East Asia to  those Japanese companies asked to invest in Saudi Arabia. Many  Japanese businessmen stress the difficulty of investing in Saudi  Arabia, saying: "The Saudi market is small, and we do not feel  comfortable with Islamic rules."    Hiraiwa states: "The Japanese economy's weakest point is  energy. We have to be prepared for a tight oil supply and  demand, which will come sooner or later. It is more important  than rice." After his recent trip to Saudi Arabia, Hiraiwa  said: "I would like to ask Keidanren's member companies and the  government to map out measures to promote investment in and  provide technological cooperation to Saudi Arabia. We will  reexamine the possibility of refining Saudi oil in Japan."    Hiraiwa, who will step down as Keidanren chairman in May,  stated: "I will not be able to free myself from energy and  electricity projects for the rest of my life. I would like to  hand over to my successor (Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota  Motor Corporation) issues like the projects with Saudi Arabia."  He is willing to remain active as one of the "people concerned  with resources" in the financial world.</p>

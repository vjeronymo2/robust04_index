			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, 28 May (INA)--Iraq has protested the  continued violations of Iraqi airspace by a U.S. U-2 spy plane  on the pretext of conducting air surveys for the Special  Commission.    In a message to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali from  Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf, Iraq stressed that  this plane, having flown from its base in Saudi Arabia, violated  Iraqi airspace on 25 April and 11 and 24 May. After overflying  vast areas of the country, it flew back to Saudi territory.    The message restates that this plane is used for purposes  other than those specified by the UN Security Council and that  its activity harms Iraq's sovereignty and security.</p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Viacom to take over Paramount for Dollars 8bn VIACOM International, the fast-expanding US cable television group, is to buy Paramount Communications, the entertainment and publishing company, for Dollars 8.2bn (Pounds 5.32bn) in the biggest US media takeover since the 1989 marriage of Time and Warner Communications. The two New York-based companies announced the agreed cash-and-shares deal yesterday after several days of market speculation. Viacom is a diversified media company best known for its cable television channels, which include MTV, the pioneering pop music video channel, and Nickelodeon, which runs programmes for children. It also owns cable television distribution systems. The substantially larger Paramount is best known for its Paramount Pictures film studio and its Paramount theme parks. Its assets also include the book publishers Prentice Hall and Simon &amp; Schuster, and Madison Square Garden, the New York sports arena. The deal is part of a merger trend among US media companies as the industry tries to take advantage of the convergence of television and film entertainment, publishing, telecommunications and computers. The deal should allow the new company, to be called Paramount Viacom International, to compete more effectively around the globe with giants such as America's Time Warner and Capital Cities/ABC and Japan's Sony. Paramount's film production, for example, can be distributed over Viacom's cable network. Mr Sumner Redstone, Viacom chairman, will become chairman of the new company, and Mr Martin Davis, chairman of Paramount, will be chief executive. Mr Frank Biondi, chief executive of Viacom, and Mr Stanley Jaffe, president of Paramount, will join them in leading a transition team 'to manage the combined operations'. The deal is expected to be completed in late 1993 or early 1994. The merger terms call for Viacom to pay Paramount shareholders Dollars 69.14 a share. Paramount shares closed on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange at Dollars 61 1/8, up Dollars 4 1/4. Viacom's class A voting stock closed at Dollars 66 and its non-voting B stock at Dollars 59 3/8 on the American Stock Exchange.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to the privacy issue, HUD has determined that the project owner, like HUD, should bear no obligation to control what an agency (to which the project owner or HUD was required to release evidence of eligible immigration status) does with this evidence. Therefore, the 1994 proposed rule provides that neither HUD nor the responsible entity is responsible for the further use or transmission of the information released in accordance to applicable law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Security of INS Data Base <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters mentioned that there is a serious potential for misuse of the INS data base, particularly when the data base is being accessed by private entities. They suggested that HUD include ``enhanced protections'' in the rule to safeguard the confidentiality of information obtained from the data base. Similarly, another commenter urged that authorized names or approval numbers for INS document verification be provided to owners and HAs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With regard to the first comment, HUD points out that the INS already has protections built into the SAVE system to maintain the confidentiality of system information, particularly when information is being accessed by private individuals. In addition, HUD will provide the INS with the names and approval numbers of project owners or HA representatives who are authorized to access the SAVE system. The project owners and HA representatives may use information obtained from the INS and the applicant only in accordance with the verification consent form. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> D. Documents of Eligible Status <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters advocated recognition of an immigration judge's decision granting a suspension of deportation as evidence of lawful admission for permanent residence. Their reasoning was that the Form I&hyph;551, which ordinarily evidences lawful admission for permanent residence, is issued after the decision and backdated to the date of the decision but may not be available when an applicant or tenant needs to establish eligible immigration status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The INS has informed HUD that the decision of an immigration judge to suspend deportation is not final when issued. The INS may review such a decision and reverse it. If the INS decides not to reverse the decision, or is unable to act within the required review period, a Form I&hyph;551 is issued and the decision becomes final. Therefore, while a copy of the decision itself is not evidence of final INS action conferring eligible status, the Form I&hyph;551 is. The 1994 proposed rule does not include a decision to suspend deportation in the list of acceptable documentation of eligible immigration status, since it is not evidence of final INS action. However, if an applicant or tenant has only the judge's order suspending deportation at the time of application or recertification of income, he or she can appeal to the INS to obtain a final determination of immigration status and a Form I&hyph;551. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Agriculture contacted HUD about its inclusion of Form I&hyph;688A in the list of documents evidencing eligible immigration status. Since the housing programs operated by the Department of Agriculture are to follow the same strictures concerning eligible noncitizens (with the exception of farm workers' housing) as apply to HUD programs, the inquiry was whether Form I&hyph;688A is evidence of a grant of eligible status under HUD programs, or whether it is merely evidence that an individual has applied for eligible status. After consulting with the INS, HUD determined that it is the latter. Therefore, the I&hyph;688A has been removed from the list of documents that evidence eligible immigration status in the 1994 proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the 1994 proposed rule, other changes were made to the list of immigration documents that appeared in the 1988 proposed rule. These changes were made in response to a 1993 letter from the INS, which provided information concerning the current status of various identification documents (i.e., current form numbers, the annotation on cards, etc.), and HUD will further consult the INS on applicable immigration documents before issuance of the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Verification of Eligible Immigration Status <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked HUD to specifically state in the rule that eligibility determinations by HAs may not be relied upon by third persons as evidence of citizenship or immigration status. HUD has not included the requested language in this 1994 proposed rule because HUD has no authority to either require or prohibit persons to rely on HA eligibility determinations as evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Verification Based Solely on INS Documents <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters objected to the requirement in the 1988 proposed rule that the responsible entity obtain from the applicant or tenant either an INS document that contains a photograph, or an additional document with a photograph, to ensure the alien's identity. These commenters noted that neither IRCA nor the 1987 Housing Act requires an individual to submit a photograph when the INS document submitted does not contain one. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1994 proposed rule requires only the submission of the INS immigration document in whatever form that document may be in (i.e., whether it contains a photograph or does not contain a photograph). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. No Denial or Termination of Assistance Pending Verification Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three commenters asserted that the 1988 proposed rule would have implemented section 121 of IRCA ``*&blank;*&blank;* in a manner that violates many of section 121's protections for the public, and without a well-developed plan with the INS for processing verification requests and for reimbursement.'' The commenters expressed concern that INS records may be unreliable, verification could take several months and produce erroneous results, and the consequences would be that eligible persons would have assistance denied or terminated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

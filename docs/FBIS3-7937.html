			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, March 2 (AFP) -- Besieging Serb forces  refused Wednesday to give a UN humanitarian aid convoy  permission to travel to the northern Moslem town of Maglaj, a UN  spokesman said. UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  spokesman Kris Janowski said the convoy was due to leave  Wednesday but that Serbs in Pale, the Bosnian Serb headquarters,  said there were no officials there who could authorize the  convoy. Janowski said the delay could be at least two or three  days.    The UNHCR has had repeated problems in Bosnia's 22-month-old  in getting convoys into besieged zones. [sentence as received]  Serb troops have intensified attacks on Maglaj over the past  two weeks. The last convoy to Maglaj, where 16,000 people live,  was in October, Janowski said. He has described conditions  there as the worst in Bosnia. He said a report he received "a  month ago said the people there look like skin and bones."    In addition, a 12-truck Danish aid convoy remained blocked  trying to get into Sarajevo. The convoy, which is stuck in  Hadzici, 15 kilometres (nine miles) outside Sarajevo, was being  blocked by Serb women demonstrating for their husbands to be  released from a nearby Bosnian prison.    The UNHCR moves from 20-30 land convoys a day in Bosnia and  flies from 15-20 planes a day into Sarajevo airport. It feeds  some three million people in central Bosnia. In addition, NATO  planes carry out nightly air drops of food to areas like Maglaj  where convoys are denied access.</p>

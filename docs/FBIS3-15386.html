Its senior executives said  that the decision of the Gazprom joint stock company on reducing  gas deliveries "can hardly be described as groundless," because  Belarusian enterprises are consuming gas, but are in no hurry to  pay for it.    The Belarusian council of ministers "outlined various  measures for paying the debts, Belinform was told at  Beltransgaz. Some 30 billion roubles have already been  transferred to the account of Gazprom. The money was raised  with the help of the Ministry of Finance, the National Bank and  auctions at stock exchanges," the Beltransgaz spokesman said.</p>

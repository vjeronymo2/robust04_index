			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Central skills that most teaching neglects: Jobs - Request to readers generates more heat than light over question of the value of formal education THE meaning of the crudely drawn chicken would be clear enough even without the date beneath showing precisely where the charge of cowardice is aimed. Whoever sent the drawing was referring to the Jobs column's failure to fulfil its promise to report on the response to a request it put to readers 16 weeks ago. The focus of the request was education, and my hope in making it was that readers would shed light on a question I was unable to resolve during my 20 years as the FT's education correspondent up to 1988. The question is what practical use is the process, except as a source of the academic examination passes often arbitrarily deemed necessary for entry into well paid lines of career? So I asked you to think of the teachers you had in your formal education, and identify those who taught you something of actual use to you now. The response was 23 letters, which made up for their modest numbers by being sometimes several thousand words long. And what probably accounts for the chicken is that a good quarter of those who wrote were contentious if not downright bellicose in tone - including one signing himself just 'Joe Soap' who, for all I know, may fancy his skill as a cartoonist to boot. The nub of the warlike eight letters was that the only proper response to anybody who poses such queries about education, is the one reputedly given by Fats Waller to a woman who asked him what rhythm was: 'If you has to ask, you ain't got it.' In their view, it seems, the benefits of education are such that no one who has gained them needs to question them, and anyone who hasn't would not understand the answer anyway. Well, perhaps so . . . but it strikes me, at least, as a claim which shrouds education in the sort of mystery it supposedly exists to dispel. Indeed, folk taking that line of argument seem to be speaking of education just as God was spoken of by a church poster I once saw, which read: 'A God small enough for everybody's understanding would not be big enough for everyone's needs'. While that may be true of the Almighty, it can scarcely apply to education which, after all, is a process both made and carried on by fallible human beings. Moreover, one of its professed purposes is to enable mere humans to understand such things. Fortunately, from my viewpoint, the holier-than-thou ripostes were in the minority. The other 15 who wrote reflected on their experience of teachers, as I had asked. Most of them also accepted that, although the aims of education go beyond the practical, including spiritual and other civilising development, the process ought to teach us something specifically useful too. The most depressing reply was from a man who had built up his own international consultancy, thereby earning enough money to retire at an age to enjoy his leisure. He'd looked back on his years at school and university, he said, but could recall little of positive note. 'One or two teachers showed moments of kindness, and one even liked the fact that I was intelligent and knowledgable, but mostly as I try to remember I just feel time-calmed revulsion.' By contrast, the remaining 14 could all identify teachers - albeit not always by name - who had taught them something still of practical help. The only trouble was that, far from shedding fresh light on the question I failed to resolve in two decades as an education correspondent, they just duplicated what I had found from putting the same request to some hundreds of people during those years. As before, none of the people who replied identified more than four teachers who had equipped them with something of actual use now, and the majority recalled at best three. Those cited usually included one or two at the primary stage who had imparted the basic skills of reading, writing and numbering. In the case of those at later stages, the useful thing that had been taught often had little if any direct connection with the academic subject the teacher was employed to teach. For example, one reply cited 'the chemistry master who introduced me to Plato', as well as the head of a school who led a weekly current-affairs seminar in which he insisted on his pupils' developing public-speaking skills. So despite readers' efforts, I am stuck with the same impressions that I had before they made them. One in particular is that, since people who have had as many as 40 teachers seem unable to cite more than four who taught something still useful, the teaching process is of dubious efficiency. A second, more general, is that education is at best dimly understood. But the fact that the original question remains unresolved does not make it any the less important. The truth is quite the reverse. One reason is that the foremost benefit of education to at least some of its recipients - that of awarding them exam passes which serve as a passport into well paid lines of career - has been devalued by the latest recession. In Britain at any rate, even honours degrees are now a drug on the jobs market unless they are seen as directly applicable to productive work. Hence education's effectiveness in teaching things of actual use is more central now than before. And it is especially so in Britain with the onset of a general election in which all main parties are pledged to maintain if not increase the amounts of taxpayers' money spent on educational processes. Given their apparently low efficiency in equipping people with practical abilities, how can a country on its uppers be confident the investment will have a worthwhile return? If anyone is being chicken about the topic, it is surely those who advocate high spending without being prepared to explain how the expected pay-off will be achieved. Accordingly, I rest my case. N OW to a couple of jobs of which the first, being handled by John McManus of the John Courtis and Partners consultancy, is somewhat ironically with the trustees of the UK Universities Superannuation Scheme. The trustee company U S S, limited by guarantee and located in Liverpool, is in need of a new pensions manager for its scheme which has over 90,000 members and investments of more than Pounds 6bn. As one of the senior management team, the recruit will have strategic responsibilities ranging beyond the job's technical duties. So besides being successful at pensions management, candidates must have general management skills. The salary indicator is Pounds 50,000. Perks include a car. Inquiries to Mr McManus at 104 Marylebone Lane, London W1M 5FU; telephone 071-486 6849, fax 071-487 4600. The other opening is with an international bank in the City of London, and offered by recruiter Dudley Edmunds of Westminster Associates International (1-4 Warwick St, London W1R 5WB; tel 071-287 5788, fax 071-287 9986). As he may not name the employer, he promises to abide by applicant's requests not to be identified to his client at this stage. The job is primarily for an expert spot trader in US dollars and D-marks. But Mr Edmunds says candidates must also be skilled at taking short-term positions, and at trading in other currencies. Moreover they'll need 'the intellect to use derivative products to hedge their position when required.' Salary around Pounds 90,000, plus bonus on results. Rest negotiable.</p>

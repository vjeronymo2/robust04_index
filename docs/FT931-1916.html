			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / BAT plans to pay 33.9p scrip dividend BAT Industries, the UK-based tobacco and financial services group, plans to pay a scrip dividend worth 50 per cent more than the 22.6p final cash dividend announced recently. The group does not intend to repeat the offer, worth 33.9p per share, for future dividend payments. Shareholders who want cash can sell the new ordinary shares through Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities for 32.2p, free of dealing costs - a 5 per cent discount to cover the joint broker's risk in underwriting the deal. BAT has taken this step partly because its large overseas earnings give it a big problem with unrelieved Advance Corporation Tax. But the group denied that this step was inspired by last week's Budget moves to deal with ACT. Mr Amir Eilon, of BZW, said: 'We had been working on this for 18 months and would have done it anyway if the Budget had not come along. The government has in fact cut this short by promising to deal with unrelieved ACT.' The scheme will need to be approved by a 75 per cent majority of shareholders voting at BAT's annual meeting in May. City institutions do not normally take scrip issues, but BZW said it was confident that most large shareholders would approve the deal. Other large companies might be tempted to follow BAT. To do so without diluting earnings or net assets, they will need to have unrelieved ACT and be confident that they can employ the money released at a sufficiently high rate of return. BAT could save up to Pounds 97m of ACT and up to Pounds 330m of dividends by issuing the scrip, assuming full take-up. The group said its net asset value could increase by as much as 6.2 per cent and earnings per share would be enhanced. Gearing could fall from 54.6 per cent to as low as 41 per cent, depending on take-up. Sir Patrick Sheey, chairman, said: 'Shareholders will benefit from the higher value and the group will benefit from being even better placed to take advantage of the extensive opportunities for organic growth within our existing businesses.' BAT is investing heavily in cigarette factories at Southampton in the UK, Georgia in the US, and in new technology for Farmers, the group's US insurance subsidiary. Details, Page 24 Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PET FOOD CANNERY TO BE DEMOLISHED  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Harbor Commission has approved demolition of the Heinz pet food  cannery in Wilmington amid complaints that the building's most historically  valued equipment was not passed on to the community.  </P> <P> Three weeks ago, the Los Angeles City Council abandoned plans to designate the  cannery, on South Fries Avenue, as a historical and cultural monument. Instead,  at the urging of Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, city lawmakers called for the  port to provide Wilmington with a new waterfront museum or plaza.  </P> <P> Several residents had complained that some of the cannery's equipment was sold  to a salvage company before residents were able to tour the plant.  </P></p>

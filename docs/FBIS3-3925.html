The symposium, sponsored by the Pacific Economic Cooperation  Council (PECK), closed here Friday [18 March] in Beijing.    During the two-day meeting, Chinese energy officials  introduced the state plans to develop the country's energy and  minerals industries.    They noted that the demand for energy and minerals will soar  by the end of the century.    They said the government encourages domestic enterprises to  tap foreign funds, technology and management to ease current and  predicted shortages.    In China, the annual demand for coal in 1995 is estimated to  reach 1.23 billion tons and hit 1.4 billion tons by the year  2000.    To meet the burgeoning demand, China will pump 200 billion  yuan in the coming years to build 20 energy bases and 15 key  mines, said Fan Weitang, vice minister of coal industry.    About 19 major projects, including 14 mine-mouth power  plants  and three coal mines, are being offered for development with  foreign investment.    The ministry also is considering the construction of a  300-km  pipeline for transporting coal from Yuxian County in Shanxi  Province to Weifang, Shandong Province.    Some U.S. firms have shown interest in investing in this  project.    Also, China is planning to produce 100 to 120 million tons  of  steel by the turn of the century.</p>

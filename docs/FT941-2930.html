			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / People: Dawson goes Dutch Peter Dawson (right), who over the past six years has built up the commercial vehicle hire and distribution company Dawsongroup to a market capitalisation of Pounds 172m, is going Dutch. Today Dawson, who still owns almost 65 per cent of the shares, resigns as executive chairman to become chairman and managing director of the two-week-old Dawsongroup International in Rotterdam. Dawson's caution and conservatism have allowed him to prosper in a field that has seen many casualties during the recession. He felt that the group needed to expand internationally, but was unable to find any better way than to do it himself. Rotterdam is the ideal place to start, he thinks, since not only is it a good centre for transport but also an outlet for the Dutch dairy and market garden industries. By the end of the year he hopes the Dutch division will have 25 portable cold storage units and 25 trailers. As with every other development at Dawsongroup, of which he remains a director, he likes to start small and grow. Michael Williams, a veteran of 18 years with Dawsongroup, took over as chief executive last November. The new chairman is Tony Frendo, 46, who was until recently with Argyll as managing director, finance and administration, at Safeway Stores.</p>

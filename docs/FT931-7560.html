			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / When trust is at a premium: Criticisms of how the insurance sector tackles fraud BRITAIN'S insurers, slowly emerging from two years of the worst trading conditions in their history, were attacked yesterday for failing to address properly the problem of insurance fraud. The criticism by Mr Julian Farrand, the industry's ombudsman, has highlighted the difficulties of dealing with what has become a growing problem during the recession. In his annual report for 1992 Mr Farrand said: 'It does seem that insurers may carry a measure of responsibility for encouraging fraudsters to believe that insurance fraud is easy to get away with.' Last year the Association of British Insurers, the industry trade body, launched an advertising campaign in an attempt to reduce fraudulent claims, which it said cost the industry more than Pounds 400m in 1991. When the campaign was launched last June the association estimated that 12 per cent of claims were fraudulent. Ten per cent of claims were inflated while 2 per cent were completely fraudulent. Subsequently the Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters said that at least one in four household claims is inflated fraudulently, and advised insurance companies to strengthen procedures for investigating claims. Last month Mr Bev Fitzgerald, of the institute, said: 'There is a feeling among the public that 'I'd be daft not to'.' While acknowledging the association campaign Mr Farrand said that actions spoke louder than words and that insurers did not always seem to 'help themselves or their honest policyholders as much as they should'. He said that because of the difficulty in proving fraud, many insurers were inclined to find something 'in the small print' as a basis to reject a claim. Mr Farrand said that it was 'negative' simply to repudiate a claim. Without positive action by insurers, fraudsters would simply 'move on to the next unsuspecting insurer', he said. Insurers should not 'pass the buck' to the bureau but should investigate a case properly before allowing it to come to the insurance ombudsman. The bureau 'cannot be expected to support unsubstantiated accusations against policyholders', said Mr Farrand, 'by for instance 'reading between the lines' as some insurers put it'. Yesterday the association said the situation was changing as a result of its campaign and insurance companies were showing an increased determination to prosecute for fraud. The association said too many people did not appreciate that a successful fraudulent claim would eventually be paid for by policyholders through increased premiums. It said, however, insurers faced a number of practical diffi-culties. 'Proving fraud is difficult when you are relying on trust as the basis of the contract.' Companies meanwhile responded to the ombudsman's accusations by stressing the practical difficulties of proving fraud. Royal Insurance said: 'It is true that too many people regard insurance companies as fair game. We're aware of it but the problem is that the burden of proof rests with us. You have to have evidence and that can be difficult to get hold of.' Mr Bob Scott, general manager of General Accident UK, rejected Mr Farrand's comments and insisted that his company was making progress in tackling fraud.</p>

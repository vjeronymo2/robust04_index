			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Rise in imports widens non-EC trade gap HIGHER demand for manufactured imports as the economy recovered was behind a rise in the trade deficit in the third quarter for countries outside the European Community. The non-EC trade gap increased last month to its highest level since February, underlining concern that with an increasing deficit on trade within the EC, the gap between imports and exports on a whole-world basis is likely to worsen. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that for trade outside the EC, UK manufacturers increased prices 14 per cent in the third quarter of this year compared with the same period last year. This was in an effort to rebuild profit margins, and came in spite of the depreciation in sterling of about 12 per cent over the same period. In theory, the drop in the pound should have enabled many companies to cut prices of exported goods to increase market share. A government official said the increase in export prices was 'surprising', although he pointed out that it came after a long period in which exporters' profits had been under pressure. In the year to the third quarter, prices of imported manufactured goods increased by 12 per cent. In the third quarter the non-EC trade deficit, adjusted for seasonal variations, came to Pounds 2.56bn, compared with Pounds 2.22bn in the second quarter. For the first nine months of the year the trade deficit reached Pounds 7.9bn after a Pounds 9.75bn deficit for all of last year. Last month the difference between imports and exports for non-EC nations was Pounds 1.09bn, after a Pounds 729m deficit in August. Much of the change was explained by reduced exports of gems and higher imports of ships, aircraft and oil platforms. Excluding these so-called erratic items, the deficit increased to Pounds 662m last month from Pounds 541m in August. The non-EC trade deficit on manufactured items rose from Pounds 283m in August to Pounds 665m in September, the highest figure since December last year. In the third quarter manufactured imports rose 7 per cent in value on the previous quarter, compared with a 4.5 per cent rise in exports over the same period. Imports of semi-finished manufactured goods - including some classes of factory components and chemical materials - saw a 9.5 per cent rise in volume terms between the second and third quarters. The UK recorded an Pounds 88m deficit on trade with the US and Canada last month, after five months of small surpluses. Figures for trade with other EC nations, available up to July, indicate that the deficit is increasing mainly due to faltering exports. In the first half of this year, the whole-world deficit was Pounds 7.1bn, after a deficit of Pounds 13.4bn last year. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, described the latest figures as 'deeply worrying'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------              VALUE OF TRADE WITH NON-EC COUNTRIES     Balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted (Pounds m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------                                             Ex oil and erratics*            Exports  Imports  Balance  Exports  Imports  Balance  ---------------------------------------------------------------- 1991       44,477    53,883  -9,406    38,289  45,250   -6,961 1992       46,682    56,431  -9,749    40,624  48,097   -7,473 1992 Q2    11,665    13,856  -2,191    10,128  11,776   -1,648 Q3         11,577    13,675  -2,098    10,069  11,667   -1,598 Q4         12,134    15,295  -3,161    10,574  13,119   -2,545 1993 Q1    13,670    16,765  -3,095    11,762  14,066   -2,304 Q2         14,205    16,421  -2,216    12,026  14,131   -2,105 Q3         14,518    17,081  -2,563    12,496  14,374   -1,878 Apr         4,677     5,545    -868     3,971   4,725     -754 May         4,665     5,408    -743     3,922   4,746     -824 June        4,863     5,468    -605     4,133   4,660     -527 July        4,811     5,555    -744     4,137   4,812     -675 August      4,870     5,599    -729     4,169   4,710     -541 September   4,837     5,927  -1,090     4,190   4,852     -662  ---------------------------------------------------------------- *Defined as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA TIGHTENS SECURITY, SHUTS TIAN AN MEN;  </P> <P> BEIJING: TROOPS RING THE CENTRAL SQUARE ON THE EVE OF THE ANNIVERSARY OF LAST  JUNE'S MASSACRE.  </P> <P> China's hard-line Communist authorities tightened security in the capital  Saturday and closed Tian An Men Square in an effort to head off any  commemoration of last year's June 3-4 army attack that crushed a student-led  democracy movement.  </P> <P> One student in Beijing was seen wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the  pro-democracy movement's V-for-victory symbol. But there were no other signs  outwardly marking the anniversary.  </P> <P> "The Chinese are very practical. They're not going to do anything that clearly  will fail," said a student at Beijing Normal University, which was one of the  protest centers.  </P> <P> The state-controlled media said the square, the political heart of Beijing and  the heart of last spring's demonstrations, would remain sealed today and  Monday. Beijing residents said they had been warned about possible "terrorist"  attacks.  </P> <P> Apart from the tightened security, activity on Beijing's streets and at several  universities appeared normal Saturday night. The largest crowd near Tian An Men  Square was a long line of shoppers outside the Kentucky Fried Chicken  restaurant south of the square.  </P> <P> The government warned foreign radio stations against broadcasting a taped  program made by exiled Chinese dissidents.  </P> <P> Security guards patrolled Beijing campuses, and armed sentries were posted at a  major intersection next to the main foreign residential compound in Beijing.  </P> <P> Tian An Men Square, where last year's protesters had their headquarters, was  turned into a carnival ground for selected elementary school children as part  of celebrations for International Children's Day.  </P> <P> Large numbers of troops and police ringed the vast central square, which was  otherwise decked in festive regalia, with giant balloons swaying in a torrid  breeze.  </P> <P> Paramilitary police stood guard and soldiers exercised noisily while thousands  of children played games on the vast square.  </P> <P> Today, authorities plan a ceremony in the square to commemorate the 1840 Opium  War against Britain, which official histories describe as an example of foreign  imperialist aggression against China. The war was triggered by British trade in  opium bought in India and sold in China, where it became a major social  problem.  </P> <P> * GODDESS RETURNS  </P> <P> A replica of China's Goddess of Democracy statue reappears at a Westwood rally.

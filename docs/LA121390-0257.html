			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> PLAYWRIGHT SEES AUDIENCE ROLE  </P> <P> Playwright John Guare says the burden of good theater rests not only with  actors, directors and writers. Audiences need to shoulder their share of the  load, too.  </P> <P> "The audience should demand that the truth be told," Guare said Wednesday at a  convention of the American Council for the Arts. "Not the TV truth of diapers  and cat food, which has to be nice and likable or else you turn it off."  </P> <P> Theater buffs must demand the kind of truth that makes one say, "I've been  prepared for the great moments in my life -- birth, love and death. I've been  there before because I've been prepared by art," he said.  </P> <P> Guare wrote the screenplay for "Atlantic City," the Tony-winning play "The  House of Blue Leaves" and the play "Six Degrees of Separation."  </P></p>

Since the Party Congress held in the fall of 1992, reshuffling  has been conducted off and on. However, nearly 100  general-class senior officers were reshuffled at a time at the  end of last year, and the majority of top leaders at both the  military headquarters and seven military regions have been  relieved over the past year. Compared with past years, the  age-limit system is now being implemented in a more strict way.  At the same time, efforts are now being made to avoid abrupt  promotions in leadership rejuvenation so that personnel affairs  can be dealt with in a normal way. In view of the post-Deng  Xiaoping age, efforts have been made to make a shift from the  "rule of man" to the "rule of law" so as to strengthen the  civilian leadership of Jiang Zemin, CPC general secretary who is  concurrently chairman of the Central Military Commission.    In the reshuffling in late 1993, three leaders of the major  military regions retired. They are: Wang Chengbin, commander  of the Beijing Military Region; Song Keda, political commissar  of the Shenyang Military Region, and Liu Anyuan, political  commissar of the Nanjing Military Region. As a result,  commanders and political commissars born before 1928 were all  eliminated. The People's Liberation Army [PLA] enacted a  regulation setting the retirement age of cadres of the major  military regions at 65 in principle. The recent personnel  actions applied this principle strictly.    On the other hand, 58-year-old Li Xinliang, political  commissar of the Shenyang Military Region, is the youngest among  those recently promoted. Compared with General Liu Jingsong's  promotion to commander of the Shenyang Military Region in 1985,  when he was 52 years old, efforts at rejuvenation seem to have  slowed down. The recent moves seem aimed at shortening the  period cadres stay at one post, and "preventing specific cadres  from gaining strong power in a specific locality or  organization." (according to a military source)    However, there has been active promotion of younger men to  the no. 2 positions, and below. According to the military  source, a typical example is the case of He Pengfei, son of the  late Marshal He Long, who assumed the post of deputy commander  of the Navy in late 1992, when he was still 48 years old.    PLA observers regard the transfer of Major General Zhang  Gong, who served as the spokesman of the martial law forces  during the Tiananmen indicent in 1989, from the position of  political commissar of the Chengdu Military Region to that of  political commissar of the Academy of Military Sciences as most  noteworthy. Zhang had just moved from the Beijing Military  Region in late 1992. He has been "demoted" (according to the  military source) twice during a period of more than one year.    Zhang has been known to be close to Yang Baibing, member of  the CPC Political Bureau (formerly secretary general of the CPC  Central Military Commission). Yang became very powerful after  the Tiananmen incident, but fell from grace in the PLA in late  1992. Zhang's transfer is regarded as a symbolic personnel  action to do away with memories of the Tiananmen incident and  Yang's influence. However, the prevailing view is: the fact  that Zhang is still nominally kept in a senior position shows  that overtly factional appointments are still being avoided.    Many also see these recent personnel changes as a major  attempt to strengthen discipline in the military. A concerned  source cites the following as the basis for this view: 1)  Lieutenant General Wang Ruilin, a close confidant of paramount  leader Deng Xiaoping and incumbent secretary of the Commission  for Discipline Inspection, also took up the position of deputy  director of the General Political Department in early 1993; 2)  the chief procurator of the Military Procuratorate was changed  in late 1992; and 3) JIEFANGJUN BAO carries many articles  warning against commercial activities of military personnel.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Recent Personnel  |                  |                  |                  |  |Changes in Major  |                  |                  |                  |  |PRC Military Regi-|                  |                  |                  |  |ons               |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Jan 1992          |Jan 1993          |Jan 1994          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Beijing Military  |                  |                  |&gt;

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Not yet on board for the ride: David Gardner on the likely delays to enlargement of the EU Enlargement - extending the European Union north to the Arctic Circle and the borders of Russia, and east to the Hungarian frontier - was supposed to be a breeze. The new members - Finland, Sweden, Norway and Austria - are rich market economies, with per capita incomes higher than the EU average. Moreover, these four, plus Iceland, had already assented to more than 1,400 laws governing freedom of movement for capital, labour, goods and services when they set up the joint free trade zone with the Union known as the European Economic Area. This 13,000-page treaty, which came into force this year, surely exhausted most of what there was to negotiate on full membership of the Union. There would no doubt be hiccups over the obsolete tradition of neutrality of all the applicants except Nato member Norway, it was generally thought. But then in a post-cold war world - releasing the east and central Europeans into the queue to join the EU - surely nobody could afford to resist the magnetic pull of the single European market? As batteries of ministers from the 12 existing and four would-be members assembled in Brussels last night for what is billed as the final, marathon round of the enlargement negotiations, there are serious worries. Both sides doubt whether the deadline for concluding the talks at midnight on February 28 will be met, and whether all four applicants will ever make it into the EU. The difficulties have been underestimated: in timing, in the substance of the negotiations, and in what might be described as cultural differences between the Union and the Nordic countries. The Union's self-imposed deadline was set to permit the four to enter by January 1 1995. The EU goal was to demonstrate the dynamism of the new Union to the public, whose enthusiasm for Euro-integration is ebbing fast. But Euro MPs, up for re-election in June, must approve the accession treaty between March 10 and May 4. There is no certainty they will get either a text to examine or - with election campaigning likely to reduce normally poor attendance at the European Parliament even further  - a quorum to ratify it. Failure by Strasbourg to ratify would upset plans in all four applicant countries for the referendums essential to sell the charms of EU membership to sharply divided voters. Opinion in Finland and Austria has been more or less evenly split, with a slight advantage for the Yes camp. More Swedes want to stay out than go in, but the opposition Social Democrats could change that if they win September's elections. In Norway, however, where voters rejected membership in 1972, there is a solid majority against the EU, even though the pro-entry cause is inching forward. If entry terms are agreed, then much could depend on arranging a 'virtuous sequence' of referendums in likely order of winnability. Many Norwegian officials see little chance of their people voting yes unless the Union absorbs the rest of the Nordic region and fear of isolation grows. In Scandinavia, as one EU diplomat puts it, entry depends on voting 'following the sun, from east to west' - Finland first, then Sweden, and hopefully by then, a rather cold-feeling Norway. But Norway and the others insist they must get saleable terms, which it is not clear the EU can deliver. The European Commission's enlargement 'task force', led by Mr Steffen Smidt, a Dane with an acute feel for Nordic sensibility and political psychology, has tried to arrange the arcana of the negotiations into packages which look as if the EU is adapting to the newcomers' concerns in areas such as the environment and social policy. A deal agreed in December on the environment and safety standards, hailed as a victory by all four candidates, was imaginatively crafted. 'It'snot unintentional,' one lead Brussels negotiator remarked archly, 'that it sounds like they're pulling us up to their standards.' But as negotiations reach the crunch point, there are clear signs of a backlash among the 12 member states about who is supposed to be joining whom. 'If they want to come in they must accept our rules,' a senior Spanish official says. A Dutch diplomat explains: 'Both sides see the other side as the demandeur.' It should just be possible to settle the three linked issues of agriculture and regional subsidies in Arctic and Alpine areas, and the still sensitive budgetary conundrum of who pays for what. At the moment, the rich newcomers are being asked to make net contributions to the Ecu70bn (Pounds 53bn) EU budget of about Ecu1.7bn a year - less than half original expectations - but to align their higher farm prices at EU levels immediately and pay the difference themselves to their farmers. But as Mr Carlos Westendorp, Spanish European affairs minister, puts it: 'The problem of Ecus is easy to solve in the end; it's the problems of philosophy that are difficult.' He should know. Spain wants the right to catch 14,000 tonnes of Norwegian fish. Spain got a bad deal on fisheries in its 1986 accession treaty. Madrid is determined that Norway is not going to come in on better terms than it achieved, and a French-led group will not allow Norwegian fish free access to the EU market. Spain is prepared to negotiate, but wants some restitution of the fish it lost when it was barred from Norwegian waters in 1981. Oslo's position is simple and unswerving: not a single fish for Spain. 'We do not negotiate with Spain; we negotiate with the Union,' Ms Grete Knudsen, Norway's external trade minister said tartly this week. This is 'a real crunch issue', a UK negotiator says. 'I think I know where their (the Norwegians') bottom line is, and it's very hard.' Austria, too, has an emotive environmental 'crunch' issue: the volume of EU lorries transiting its Alpine passes. Swiss voters last Sunday chose to ban all EU trucks through their passes within 10 years (see accompanying report). Vienna therefore wants its restrictions on Union traffic, set to last until 2004, stapled to the back of its accession treaty. The EU is offering to keep the transit deal for only three years. Yet both sides now fear this could scupper Austria's referendum on entry. Even if all this can be settled, the 'cultural' differences will be thrown into sharp relief by the referendum campaigns. Many in Finland and among its Nordic neighbours, though worried about the rise of ultra-nationalism in Russia, are unimpressed by the EU and its putative security policy. 'There will still be two competing power centres in Europe, the EU and Russia, and Russia is our immediate neighbour,' says Professor Jan-Magnus Jansson, a former Finnish trade minister and anti-EU leader. Bosnia, he adds, 'is not a very convincing argument for depending on the EU for our security'. The 'Zhirinovsky factor', the Finnish polls show, is frightening voters into the EU camp but stampeding almost as many back to the tried policy of neutrality. Less tangibly, the Nordics (like the Euro-sceptical Danes from inside the EU) dislike what many see as a grouping likely to sacrifice environment and welfare standards for raw commercial gain, which moreover they believe benefits the centre more than the periphery of Europe. Used to open government, they see the EU as secretive and centralised. The protestants in the north are also used to lots of women in senior jobs; Nordic women in particular look down at the predominantly Catholic EU, and are set to vote heavily against it. The negotiating deadline is almost certainly, therefore, going to have to be stretched. 'My view is that this could be quite a long February. In fact it could turn out to be a leap year,' says a senior UK official. But even if that works for the negotiations, it is going to be hard to sell the results.</p>

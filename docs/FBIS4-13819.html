			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by party affairs correspondent Sefi Handler] </F>   [Excerpt] With about a 24-hour delay, Knesset Members  [MK's] Hayim Ramon, 'Amir Peretz, and Shmu'el Avital today  received letters expelling them from the Labor party. The  letters, sent by the Labor headquarters, advised them that under  the party constitution, they are no longer Labor members. The  other Labor members included in Ramon's Histadrut elections list  will receive similar letters after the headquarters check the  matter with each of them. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at  1600 GMT on 21 April cites the Labor spokesman as saying that  "the Ramon list includes 25 Labor members, and they will receive  expulsion letters tonight and tomorrow. MK Ramon has said that  the list he had submitted to the election committee includes 300  to 400 Labor members."]    Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin again attacked the  Ramon list which, he said, is liable to harm the peace process.  Addressing the United Kibbutzim Movement convention in Ramat  Ef'al today, the prime minister again warned: Ramon and his  list will harm the government operation. [passage omitted]</p>

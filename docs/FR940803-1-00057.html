			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Brake adjuster lifespan generally depends upon the number of brake applications and the number of brake service cycles of the CMV. The NHTSA fleet study noted that most ABAs observed performed for the duration of the study without mechanical failure. The researchers did observe some mechanical failures, and some apparent failures that were actually due to other problems in the brake system, such as wear in the foundation brakes. A number of the failures were caused by wear to specific parts. The manufacturers reported that they have implemented design changes to remedy those problems. The NHTSA's supplemental fleet data collected in 1988&hyph;1990 on newer ABAs indicated high levels of reliability. The reported average replacement rates for ABAs were 0.06 replacements per million tractor miles and 0.3 per million trailer miles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NHTSA research report emphasized that ABAs must be installed in accordance with manufacturer specifications to maintain efficient adjustments. In most cases, no special adjustments in brake component geometry are required. Manufacturers of these devices provide drawings, templates, and similar aids to facilitate installation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The figures for CMVs placed out of service appear to indicate that there are considerable difficulties in monitoring brake adjustment status. The findings of the NHTSA research demonstrate that BAIs, especially when used in concert with ABAs, can make a significant contribution to resolving the brake adjustment problem. Aside from the clear safety benefits of maintaining proper brake adjustment, ABAs can have a positive benefit on motor carrier productivity by preventing CMVs from being placed out of service, reducing roadside service calls and the resulting delays to transportation operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A BAI conforming to the NHTSA requirements (49 CFR 571.121) can significantly reduce the time needed to assess brake adjustment status. As their name implies, BAIs provide a visible indication of pushrod stroke. There are several varieties: some BAIs consist of color-coded or scribed marks on the pushrod, others raise a plastic or metal ``flag'' when the pushrod stroke reaches the prescribed adjustment limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ABAs do not eliminate the need for periodic inspection and maintenance of the brake system, but they do reduce the need for brake adjustment. Recommended Practice RP&hyph;609 of The Maintenance Council of the American Trucking Associations states that ``[a]n automatic slack adjuster should not have to be manually adjusted except for initial installation and at brake reline *&blank;*&blank;*.'' If adjustment is needed, it could be a sign that the ABA is not working or that there is a problem with the [foundation] brake system. Brake actuator strokes must still be monitored, of course.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Like their manual counterparts, ABAs and BAIs require regular maintenance. They operate in the same hostile and exposed environment as manual systems. The NHTSA notes that their performance is affected by failures and wear in other parts of the foundation brake system, and, like other components, their life expectancy can be less than that of the tractor or trailer on which they are installed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA believes that the information presented in the reports cited above indicates that both motor carriers and the travelling public may derive substantial operational and safety benefits from the use of automatic brake adjusters and brake adjustment indicators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA proposes to amend the FMCSRs by adding a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;393.53, Automatic Brake Adjusters and Brake Adjustment Indicators. This section would be added to Subpart C, Brakes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) would require that automatic brake adjusters and brake adjustment indicators installed on newly manufactured CMVs to comply with the requirements of FMVSS 105 and 121 be maintained by the motor carriers operating those CMVs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Questions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA believes there are also opportunities for improvements to operational safety of CMVs manufactured prior to the effective dates of the recent amendments to FMVSS 105 and 121. The FHWA therefore requests information regarding the potential impacts of requiring CMVs subject to the FMCSRs to be retrofitted with ABAs, and for requiring air-braked CMVs with external adjustment mechanisms to be retrofitted with brake adjustment indicators. The FHWA specifically requests comments on the following questions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Should air-braked CMVs manufactured before the effective date of NHTSA's rule be required to be retrofitted with ABAs?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Should all air-braked CMVs with external brake adjustment mechanisms be required to be retrofitted with brake adjustment indicators?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. If certain CMVs are to be retrofitted, how much time should be allowed for installation of the new equipment?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Are there certain types or configurations of air-braked vehicles that cannot be equipped with ABAs because of space limitations around the axles and wheels?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Should different periods be specified for retrofitting single-unit trucks, tractors, converter dollies, and trailers?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

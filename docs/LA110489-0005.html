			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RONALD REAGAN'S $2-MILLION SPEAKING FEE  </P> <P> Your editorial on the travesty of Ronald Reagan hiring himself out for PR work  in Japan will, hopefully, call a halt to this tacky, tasteless behavior by our  former President. The Japanese, and the rest of the world too, must be  laughing, sniggering and chortling over this gambit, buying the President of  the U.S., and for only $2 million!  </P> <P> It highlights the avarice and the money-grubbing aspect of U.S. politics. We  have no honor, no decency and everything is for sale -- the land, companies,  the Congress, and now the former President. What must our uniformed servicemen  and women think, seeing the spectacle of their former commander-in-chief doing  day work for the Japanese empire.  </P> <P> Reagan disgraces himself and our country with his hustling.  </P> <P> PATRICK F. FLYNN  </P> <P> Yorba Linda  </P></p>

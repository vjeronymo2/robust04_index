			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE VALLEY BY SEBASTIAN ROTELLA : HER AIM IS TO ARM WOMEN  </P> <P> There are monsters out there.  </P> <P> That's why Paxton Quigley bought a gun.  </P> <P> That's why Quigley wrote a book titled "Armed and Female. Twelve Million  American Women Own Guns. Should You?"  </P> <P> Quigley, a firearms expert, self-defense instructor, mother of two, part-time  bodyguard, writer and lecturer brought her crusade to the Desert Inn in  Lancaster this week.  </P> <P> Arm yourselves against the night, Quigley told a spellbound audience at a  seminar sponsored by The Gunshop Inc. in Lancaster. She brings a message  well-grounded in statistics, news stories, garish true-crime programs and  hysterical voices on the 911 line: For women in the United States in 1990, the  night lasts 24 hours a day. The troops are in the Persian Gulf, but the war --  with daily body counts and 2-year-old-victims -- is right here.  </P> <P> "Women have finally realized that the police can't protect them, their husbands  can't protect them, their boyfriends can't protect them," Quigley said. "There  is more and more crime. There is a change in attitude."  </P> <P> Quigley has built a one-woman industry on this theme. Her presentation is  slick. The cover of her book shows her in a fashionable V-neck blue dress, red  ear protectors and gold bracelets as she holds a revolver at the ready.  </P> <P> Like her press clippings, the 38-year-old with big, startled eyes and a  master's degree in anthropology describes herself as "petite and attractive."  She says you would not expect her to own a 9mm Lady Smith semiautomatic pistol  or to speak the arcane language of recoil and isosceles firing stances.  </P> <P> That's the point. At the heart of her pitch lies a personal conversion.  </P> <P> "I hated guns," Quigley told the Antelope Valley crowd, which hails from an  area where people grow up around guns, own lots of them and often announce  their allegiance to them on bumper stickers. "I feared guns. I was actually  anti-gun."  </P> <P> Quigley's views grew out of a liberal political upbringing and solidified after  the assassination of Sen. Robert Kennedy in 1968, while she worked in Kennedy's  presidential campaign, she said.  </P> <P> But her gun control activism faltered, she said, after her house was  burglarized, her car was stolen as she watched and two friends were raped. She  learned to shoot. She embarked on a research project that took her around the  country to hear the stories of victims, cops, self-defense experts, inmates at  San Quentin staring from the other side of the glass.  </P> <P> Now Quigley teaches self-defense, charging $125 for two-hour lessons at gun  ranges in Van Nuys and Orange County. She recommends the .38-caliber special  revolver with a three-inch barrel for beginners because of its "excellent  intimidation value" and moderate weight.  </P> <P> "I teach them to shoot from the prone position, I teach them to shoot  weak-handed," she said, absently tearing at the edge of a newspaper as she  talked. She jumped up to demonstrate how she instructs her students to "walk  and shoot, they love the assertiveness of that."  </P> <P> Quigley, a National Rifle Assn. member and promoter, told the crowd that  carrying a gun without a permit is illegal and carries awesome  responsibilities. But she said 250,000 "law-abiding" Californians break the law  daily, and there are modified purses and "fanny packs" to help them do it. Fear  transcends ideology when it comes to the broadening spectrum of gun owners, she  said.  </P> <P> "I could never understand why it ended up being a conservative issue," she  said. "Liberals are always pushing for the First Amendment. I don't see why  they fall down when it comes to the Second Amendment," which defines the right  to bear arms.  </P> <P> The women in the audience, some with husbands in tow, listened intently to the  pros and cons of Mace, stun guns, knives and Ku-batons, plastic sticks attached  to key rings that enable the holder to slash and stab with the keys.  </P> <P> The woman laughed, some of them a bit nervously, at scenes in a video of women  using combat techniques to rip and stomp mock assailants in protective padding.  They joined in enthusiastically when Quigley asked them to practice a  resounding, angry "No!" of the type to be shouted at would-be "perpetrators."  </P> <P> "As middle-class people we are bought up to be nice," she said, stressing that  attitude is the foundation of self-defense. "Women are brought up to be  especially nice. . . . It's hard for them to practice for something that could  be horrible."  </P> <P> The audience was silent during an audiotape of a frantic phone call to police  from a Kansas City woman as a man broke into her house, an example of how the  students should not be -- defenseless, no gun, no "safe room" with reinforced  door, no recourse. A teen-age blonde, who had been sitting next to her sister,  got up and left.  </P> <P> The discussion veered from political denunciations -- tough restrictions on  concealed-weapon permits leave gun owners "defenseless," a man exclaimed -- to  legal questions about when it is permissible to shoot an intruder. The law  looks favorably on a woman who uses deadly force, Quigley said, but you are not  supposed to shoot them in the back.  </P> <P> A thin, dark-haired woman in a business suit announced calmly that two years  ago she had been abducted from a coin-operated laundry and raped. She referred  to the color-coded hierarchy of mental states that Quigley had outlined: white  for a comfortable, unalert state, with awareness increasing through yellow and  orange. Finally comes the red zone in which you make decisions, run, attack.  </P> <P> "I was in the white zone," the woman said. "I wasn't ready. I was in my own  world."  </P> <P> She thanked Quigley and the others and left.  </P> <P> At a table staffed by employees of the gun shop, a line of women formed to sign  up for shooting lessons: New arrivals in the red zone.  </P></p>

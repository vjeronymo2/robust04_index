Are a certain people  at fault if they take their own side, trench, and active  weapons? Our people from all walks of life and across the  political spectrum took a worthy stand throughout the Mother of  Battles. Our people tilted toward truth and that continues to  be the case. They continue to be in truth's fighting trenches,  in the battalions of the camp of justice and the faithful led by  the mujahid leader President Saddam Husayn.    Anyone who wants to speak on behalf of the Palestinian  people  must utter only that which truly represents their position and  militant march on the road of freedom and the Arab character of  the homeland.    The Saudi Arabian regime -- mired in treason, ignominy, and  subordination, and, having leased Arab territory and tradition  in the Arabian Peninsula to invaders -- is not a custodian of  our people. Nor is it the right party to issue certificates of  good conduct and inflict punishment.    Anyone who will apologize for our people's distinguished  stand during the Mother of battles and their taking Iraq's side  only speaks for his own ignominiousness. Such a person has no  right to claim he is speaking in the name of or representing our  people. Our militant people, who were unanimous in their  support for Iraq in the Mother of Battles, knew then and are  still convinced that the position they took was the right one.  Our people will take the same position and sit in the same  trench in all the Arab nation's battles and honorable pages of  glory. All Saudi Arabia's money that has been withheld from our  people, revolutionaries, and our valiant intifadah, and diverted  to foot the bills of aggression on the Arab nation, cannot buy  the consciences of the Palestinian people and their decisive,  historic stands. This is because our people are too good to be  bribed with ill-gotten money that has hurt and bankrolled  aggression on the Arab nation. Our people will not stand for an  apology. Our people will never apologize for taking their own  side and trench and honorable history.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOW EASTERN EUROPEANS WHICH SIDE WE ARE ON  </P> <P> American policy toward Eastern Europe seems either so befuddled by the pace of  events that it cannot react or so pessimistic about prospects that it feels  little need to do anything. Confusion is understandable and pessimism is  warranted, but neither is the right guide to policy.  </P> <P> Certainly, the pace of events is dizzying. Yesterday's impossibility becomes  today's conventional wisdom and tomorrow's old hat. Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev himself has pushed the pace: By publicizing his telephone call to  Polish Communists to tell them the time had come for a non-communist  government, he toppled dominoes that will fall at least in Hungary; opposition  leaders there who had been prepared to settle for half a loaf now say, "Why  settle for less than Solidarity?"  </P> <P> The most credible argument for American inaction is that with so much  uncertainty, anything the United States did would be as likely to boomerang as  to help. In particular, any action might cross the line for Moscow and look  like meddling. Thus, the argument runs, better to do nothing than to risk  giving Moscow or its local allies the pretext for a crackdown.  </P> <P> The concern is fair, but we do not seem close to the line. Gorbachev may be  confused but does not appear worried. His government seems almost to welcome  Western economic assistance to Eastern Europe; it hardly has much choice. So,  too, it cannot object to technical assistance to develop managers or economic  policy-makers. Helping train journalists or opposition party organizers  probably skates closer to whatever line there is, but however attractive  America remains in Eastern Europe, journalists and parties have their own good  reasons to avoid the "made in the USA" label.  </P> <P> It is reasonable to believe that, however confused Moscow may be, defections  from the Warsaw Pact would still ring alarm bells. Plainly, the United States  should make sure that it cannot be accused of angling for those defections.  When the question of military alliances arises -- and it will, pushed, for  instance, by the younger hotheads in Solidarity whom Lech Walesa strives to  control -- Washington can say that it is a matter for the Warsaw Pact itself.  What we care about are the political openings and economic restructuring; we  are negotiating elsewhere to draw down the military confrontation in Europe.  </P> <P> The other explanation for Washington's inaction is pessimism: Gorbachev's  experiment is destined to be still-born and Eastern Europe's economic plight is  all but hopeless. Both may be true. But for Washington to make policy as though  it is only waiting for Gorbachev's successors is more than a little strange --  to America's allies and to its citizens, not to mention the Eastern Europeans  themselves.  </P> <P> More immediately, doing more for Poland meets with the analogy to the  mid-1970s. Then, Washington encouraged lending to what looked like a reformist  Communist government, only to have the lenders find that the reforms were  elusive and the money only disappeared down a rat hole of consumerism.  </P> <P> The analogy is mistaken, however, and having made a mistake then does not  justify making another now. This Polish government is led by non-communists,  not Communists, even if Communist apparatchiks still weigh it down. This  government's reforms may not succeed, but the attempt will be serious.  </P> <P> And while much of what has happened in Eastern Europe is reversible, this much  is not: If the Tadeusz Mazowiecki government in Poland fails, it will not --  short of the arrival of Soviet tanks -- be replaced by Poland's old Communist  masters. If it is thrown out, another non-communist government will follow.  Poland's Communists are -- again save for the arrival of tanks -- gone forever.  </P> <P> Hence, helping Poland is now more political than economic. It is help to the  process of non-communist governance, not a bet on a particular government.  Whether CIA analysts conclude this government's anti-inflation plan workable is  relevant but not decisive. Poland has become the first non-communist government  in Eastern Europe since World War II, and the United States has offered it $119  million in assistance, plus another $50 million in food aid. Surely, democracy  in Poland is worth more than one-fourth of a B-2 bomber.  </P> <P> American aid is not in any case going to make Poland's economic future. But the  political case for doing more is compelling. It should not be beyond our wits  -- or even our budgets -- to come up with a billion-dollar package and so to  push our European allies, who are coordinating aid to Poland through the Common  Market, to do likewise.  </P> <P> Forty years of American hopes for Eastern Europe are coming true. It is time to  bet our hopes, not our fears, and to demonstrate to those who have succeeded in  Eastern Europe that we are on their side.  </P></p>

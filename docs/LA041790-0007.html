			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCOFFLAW-ISM AS A GROWTH INDUSTRY  </P> <P> When it comes to unpaid parking tickets in Los Angeles, scofflaw-ism has become  a growth industry. The last five years have seen a quarter of a billion dollars  of unpaid penalties and fines accumulate as tens of thousands of drivers  ignored millions of tickets. About one-third of that debt may be uncollectable  for a number of reasons, high among them is a disturbing lack of information in  Department of Motor Vehicles records about where the legal owners of the  vehicles can be found. That still leaves more than $162 million in debt that  probably could be captured. In the last year, though, only $4 million in  delinquent fees were in fact collected. The city's failure to do better than  that has meant an enormous revenue loss, the effect of which has been to  deprive every resident of needed services -- for improved policing, say, or  more adequate street repairs.  </P> <P> Interestingly, as reporter Penelope McMillan found, high officials seemed  largely unaware of the magnitude of the problem until The Times began asking  questions. Over the last five years, since parking enforcement passed from the  Police Department to the city Department of Transportation, parking-ticket  revenues quintupled to $90 million. A most satisfying increase, no doubt. But  also, perhaps, an inducement to complacency.  </P> <P> The problem, as Parking Administrator Bob Yates acknowledges, is that "the  system has been a bit archaic for many years." In truth, methods for tracking  and collecting from violators -- a job now contracted by the city to a private  firm -- are wholly inadequate. Part of the problem lies in Sacramento. The DMV  is supposed to ensure payment of delinquent fines as a condition of vehicle  registration renewal. But many vehicles owned by violators aren't registered.  In other cases, owners' addresses prove to be out of date or even nonexistent.  </P> <P> With a little will and effort there are, of course, other ways to trace law  breakers, just as there are ways to encourage greater compliance with parking  laws. Right now, for example, the city makes no effort to prosecute serious  violators, some of whom are responsible for more than 100 unpaid tickets. Yet  it's obvious that the costs of more tenaciously pursuing parking-ticket  scofflaws would be recouped many times over. The flaws in the system now stand  revealed. What are city officials going to do about fixing them?  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION AND BIOLOGY  </P> <P> Julian P. Donahue's Aug. 20 letter defending a pro-abortion cartoon by Jules  Feiffer must be correct because he is a biologist and curator of insects,  right?  </P> <P> It would be interesting to see Mr. Donahue's face the day it is decided that,  like his "genetically unfit individuals," curators of insects "aren't making a  meaningful contribution to society" and are "just taking up space." Should they  then be eliminated, as individuals are eliminated in abortion and euthanasia?  </P> <P> Donahue says it's a matter of "just good biology." I think not. Just bad  philosophy.  </P> <P> MARK RITTER  </P> <P> Ontario  </P></p>

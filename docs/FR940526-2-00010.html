As one of the proposals selected under Round IV of the Clean Coal Technology Program, the Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power Project would demonstrate an innovative air-blown, Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle technology. This technology, when compared to conventional coal burning technologies, would result in a cost effective reduction in emissions of sulfur, oxides of nitrogen, and particles from a 104-Megawatt-electric coal-fired (800-ton-per-day) power plant. The proposed action is the cost-shared Federal funding of the project by the Department of approximately $135 million (about 50 percent of the total cost of approximately $270 million). The document assesses the long-term reliability, maintainability, and environmental impacts of the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle technology at a utility scale and setting. The technologies to be demonstrated include a KRW Energy Systems Inc., pressurized, fluidized-bed gasifier with in-bed limestone desulfurization and hot-gas clean-up processes, including an external regenerable desulfurization system using zinc-based sorbents and fine particle filters. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department invites comments on the Draft Statement from all interested parties.

The Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power Project was proposed by Sierra Pacific Power Company and selected by the Department for negotiation of a Cooperative Agreement for Federal assistance by the Clean Coal Technology program. The Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power Project, when compared to conventional coal-fired power plant technologies, would demonstrate the cost effective reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulate matter from a 104-Megawatt-electric coal-fired power plant using innovative Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle and hot gas cleanup technology. Following a 42-month demonstration period anticipated to conclude in August 2000, the facility would enter commercial operation. The proposed Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power Project would be located at Sierra Pacific Power Company's existing Tracy Power Station, a natural gas- and oil-fired 411-Megawatt-electric (estimate based on June 1994 projections) power generation facility located on a rural 724-acre plot approximately 17 miles east of Reno, Nevada. The proposed new facility would be built adjacent to these facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 23, 1989, Public Law No. 101&hyph;121, ``Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1990,'' was signed into law. This Act, among other things, appropriated funds for the design, construction, and operation of cost-shared, clean coal projects to demonstrate the feasibility of future commercial applications of technologies capable of replacing, retrofitting or repowering existing facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

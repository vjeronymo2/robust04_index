			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng called for boosting vegetable and foodstuffs production to  alleviate inflationary pressure here today.    "There are 23 kinds of goods that are most closely related  to  people's livelihood," Li said. "The most important of them are  what people would like to fill in their 'vegetable baskets'."    In China, "vegetable basket" refers to fresh vegetables and  foodstuffs such as eggs, fish and meat.    The premier made the remark at a group discussion by  deputies  from Hebei Province to the National People's Congress (NPC) now  in session in the Chinese capital. The deputies were discussing  his government work report he delivered at an NPC session last  Thursday [10 March].    Li praised Hebei Provincial authorities for doing a good job  of developing "vegetable basket projects" in recent years and  facilitating supplies of vegetables and foodstuffs to urban  residents.    In response to Hebei party chief's comment that low prices  and drought were factors affecting cotton production, the  premier said that the government has decided to raise purchasing  prices for cotton by a proper margin.    "However, if purchasing prices are raised too high, I'm  afraid the textile industry won't be able to bear," he said.    The problem will have to be solved gradually, in the process  of establishing a market economic structure and carrying out  price reform, he said.    The premier proposed expanding the acreage of sprinkling  irrigation and improving cotton varieties to combat drought.    Li Peng also talked about enterprise reform, water diversion  from the south, and development of water-saving farming.</p>

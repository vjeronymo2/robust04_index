The meeting studied the issue of granting Hong Kong SAR  permanent resident status to returned emigrants who have become  foreign nationals. Members tended to favor the application of  the stipulations of Clause 4 under Article 24 of the Hong Kong  SAR Basic Law to settle this issue. Considering the close  relations between returned emigrants and Hong Kong, members held  that prior to obtaining a fresh permanent resident status,  returned emigrants may enjoy the rights to enter and stay in  Hong Kong without restrictive conditions. The meeting also  discussed the retirement security issue in Hong Kong as well as  reviewed the issue's development and current situation in Hong  Kong's history. Members unanimously felt that great importance  should be attached to retirement security, a major issue that  concerns the people's lives and is closely linked to the overall  Hong Kong society. Members pointed out that retirement security  should be treated separately from social welfare. The system  should be considered on the basis of Hong Kong's actual  conditions, and the principle conducive to Hong Kong's social  stability and economic prosperity should be upheld.</p>

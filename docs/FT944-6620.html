			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Ulster to renew electricity link with republic The power link between Ulster and the Irish Republic is to be restored, Northern Ireland Electricity, the privatised power utility, announced yesterday. It was damaged by IRA bombs in the early 1970s. The North-South Interconnector is one of a number of cross-border initiatives dusted off in the wake of the paramilitary ceasefires. The move will result in savings for both NIE and the Electricity Supply Board, the republic's power utility. The link will improve load management efficiencies, allowing both companies to cover temporary power shortfalls. It will also provide trading opportunities for NIE to sell to the republic. NIE said it was 'still talking about contracts'. ESB estimated that the project could result in savings of IPounds 500,000 (Pounds 495,000) a year. The restoration would increase the viability of NIE's proposed Pounds 175m power link with Scotland, which is the subject of a public inquiry that should be completed by February. An NIE official said yesterday that the two projects were 'perfectly complementary and in line with European energy policy'. If the link with ScottishPower is approved both Irish grids will be integrated into the European network for the first time - there is already a link between England and France. The European Union has backed the Ulster-Scotland link with a Pounds 61m grant. Mr Geoffrey Horton, the Northern Ireland electricity regulator, is reviewing the NIE/ScottishPower link after a request from the province's consumer committee. As part of his review Mr Horton is looking at alternative proposals, including one from Meekatharra Minerals, the loss-making Australian mining company, to build a lignite power plant near Ballymoney in County Antrim.</p>

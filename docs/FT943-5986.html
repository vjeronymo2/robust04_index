			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Teacher unions warn on ill-health Figures showing a 19 per cent increase in the number of teachers retiring on grounds of ill health over the past two years today led unions to claim that schools faced a teacher shortage. Statistics for England and Wales from the Teachers Pensions Agency, published by the National Association of Head Teachers, also showed a 350 per cent increase in the number of heads and deputy heads being made redundant since the 1990-91 academic year. They include a 10-fold increase in redundancies for deputy heads, from 29 to 316 over the four-year period. Mr David Hart, the association's general secretary, said: 'The considerable increase in ill-health retirements for teachers should serve as a warning about stress levels throughout the profession.' He added that deputy heads were often needed to take on the extra administrative tasks created by recent government reforms, but that in many large secondary schools heads were working with one or two, rather than three or four deputies. He said: 'There could be good reasons for reorganising the hierarchy of a school. But it is often being done instead for budgetary reasons, adding nothing to efficient management and putting more pressure on the head.' There was also concern over Department for Education statistics showing that the numbers passing the Postgraduate Certificate of Education teacher training qualification last year rose by only 1 per cent, with a drop of 4 per cent in the number of men qualifying. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said the high numbers leaving the profession meant a 1 per cent rise was 'not enough to cope with the expected increase in primary school pupil numbers'.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / American Express to spin off Lehman American Express is to pump Dollars 1.25bn into its Lehman Brothers investment banking subsidiary to enable it to become a free-standing firm, marking the credit card group's final withdrawal from the securities and investment banking arenas. The recapitalisation signals a decision by American Express not to float Lehman, as had been expected. Instead, it is to issue shares in the company to existing American Express shareholders, and will receive a share of future Lehman profits of up to Dollars 550m. The spin-off of Lehman, shares in which will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange, will create an investment bank which had post-tax income last year of Dollars 376m and which would be valued at around Dollars 3.5bn, if the stock market values it in a similar way to its rivals. Explaining the reason not to float Lehman, Mr Harvey Golub, chairman and chief executive of American Express, said the deal announced yesterday would give the greatest value to the group's shareholders. A flotation of Lehman, raising additional capital, would have attracted a tax charge on the spin-off, he said. Also, American Express has the cash resources to recapitalise the company without needing to tap the public markets, Mr Golub said. Under the terms of the deal, American Express is to put in Dollars 890m to buy common stock in Lehman, as well as preference share capital of Dollars 200m. All the shares in the group will be distributed to American Express shareholders, leaving the credit card group with only an interest in Lehman's profits, if they exceed a set level in future years.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Don't overdo the UK deficit hysteria One advantage - some may say disadvantage - of an undergraduate education in economics some years ago is that one is unlikely to tremble with rage at a budget deficit, a supposedly low level of savings or similar examples of national fecklessness. The effects of budget deficits depend on the circumstances; and they cannot just be compared with a person with too much debt. To illustrate my theme I shall be citing material from rival City analysts, who - for all my occasional strictures - do useful research, which should not be spurned because of the quotes extracted from them by the media on one month's figures. I shall start with the reliable Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers. He estimates that the UK Public Sector Borrowing Requirement this financial year is more likely to be Pounds 32bn than the Pounds 28bn published at the time of the Budget, because of revenue shortfalls from a slower recovery. But you haven't heard anything yet. The deficit for the following year, 1993-94, admitted to be Pounds 32bn by the Treasury, will be more like Pounds 41bn according to Salomon. If Salomon is right, this will be due to slower economic growth than forecast and also because the company has a more pessimistic view of the tax yield of a given gross domestic product than the Treasury has. Salomon puts the 1993-94 deficit at 6.3 per cent of GDP - more than twice the Maastricht guidelines, although the latter are probably meant to apply over a cycle as a whole. Adding back privatisation proceeds gives Pounds 46.5bn or more than 7 per cent of GDP. It comes as an anti-climax after these horror stories that Salomon should be expecting public spending cuts of just Pounds 1bn to take effect next year. The cuts would carry through to later years, but there would be nothing further. Phillips &amp; Drew, never to be outdone, talks about spending cuts plus tax increases totalling Pounds 9 1/2 bn per annum. The interesting thing about the Salomon projections is that after pages on the gloomy fiscal outlook, we are told that the rise in public sector borrowing will be matched by higher private savings and lower credit demand. In addition a fall in the underlying rate of inflation to just over 3 per cent is expected next year. It does not quite say that gilt yields are bound to rise, but comes very close to doing so. Another set of analysts, Mark Cliffe and Chris Dillow of the Nomura Research Institute explain why they are not worried about the financing of the deficit. Their view is that when economic activity is depressed the private sector will save more and that this will finance the budget deficit. To my mind the most interesting chart in the Nomura paper is the historical one reproduced above. This shows that, for all its short-term fluctuation the gross UK savings ratio in the past three decades has been more than twice what it was before the first world war when gilt-edged yields were below 3 per cent. The relevance of this to budget deficits is that the latter make an extra call on domestic savings over and above the claims of business investment. It is instructive to recall that the low 19th-century savings ratio did not inhibit economic growth. Nor did it prevent a current payments surplus from arising. The share of investment in those years was even smaller than the share of savings. In view of the growth record, this suggests that the productivity of capital has shown a long-term tendency to fall and this may be more worrying than any supposed savings shortage. The problem with the analysis of historical statistics is that there is never a savings shortage or excess after the event. For the world as a whole savings have to be equal to investment - rather large statistical errors apart. For an individual country they can only differ through cross-border investment flows. The question is how any prospective gap is eliminated. There is certainly no automatic tendency for higher budget deficits to drive up nominal interest rates. During the period since 1990 that large budget deficits have emerged as a problem, UK long term bond yields have fallen from nearly 12 per cent to about 9 per cent. Even in Germany where the swing of the budget into deficit has been very large and reflects medium term unification costs rather than recession, long term nominal rates have fallen slightly. The problem is tackled from another angle by Tim Congdon in the April issue of the Gerrard &amp; National Economic Review. Congdon was associated with the theory that deficits crowded out private investment. But the moral that Congdon draws today is not that a budget deficit is without impact, but that its impact depends on how it is financed. If it is all fully funded - that is, met by the sale of gilts - he would not expect it to boost, or even sustain, activity. When full funding applies, the home or overseas public have to take up government securities, so that their holdings of cash and bank deposits remain the same. Congdon argues, that for the deficit to be effective in sustaining activity, some parts must be met by the creation of money - or deliberate underfunding. In practical terms this means that the government would borrow stated and limited sums from the banking system through Treasury bills. The net effect depends on what happens to the whole structure of interest rates. I cannot pretend to have worked out what would happen if the government were deliberately underfunding to boost the money supply, but also tried to limit any fall in short term interest rates to avoid weakening the ERM parity. As no-one has a satisfactory model of how the monetary system works I cannot see that there would be any harm in reinstating some broad money supply guideline, which would be consistent with non-inflationary growth. Whatever it is, it would be higher than the 5 per cent recorded in the past 12 months. I have in mind a presumptive rule to be followed unless there are good reasons why not, rather than an iron rule to be followed in all circumstances. The expert group advising the EC Central Bankers Committee is hard at work on broad money trends. So the UK would be in good company. The worst that can happen is that the money would pile up on deposit - that is velocity of circulation would fall - or that the rule would be overridden by the needs of exchange rate policy or other events. Economic policy has suffered from the belief in known truths. It is time to move to a more sensitive analysis in terms of risks and opportunities. Of any economic claim we should ask: what is the worst that could happen if the holder is wrong? And what opportunities might we be missing if some rival theory is right after all? I am not advocating short-termism or that anything goes, but merely avoiding a pretence to knowledge that we do not have.</p>

Ltd.    Chu made the remarks upon returning from a visit to Tokyo  Monday [21 March] to finalize plans for the Taiwan trade center.    Chu said the trade center will be housed in a 3,600 square  meter building located in downtown Tokyo and aims to gather the  strength of Taiwan businessmen in Japan.    The building was purchased last October by the Kuomintang  Business Management Committee for US$113 million. Space in the  building will be rented to Taiwan enterprises at lower than  market prices, Chu explained.    The center will replace the Far East Trade Center, which is  the current meeting place for Taiwan businessmen in Japan but is  too small, Chu added.    So far, a group of Taiwan enterprises have rented offices in  the nine-floor Taiwan Trade Center, including Kokuei, UMC, China  Airlines, and Eva Airways.</p>

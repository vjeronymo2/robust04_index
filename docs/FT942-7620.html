			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Japanese bank governor sees growth barriers Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, said yesterday several negative factors threatened to impede the country's economic recovery. Speaking to the house of representatives' budget committee, Mr Mieno cited trade frictions with the US, the accompanying rise in the value of the yen, corporate balance sheet adjustment and the pace of labour-shedding as factors that might weaken the upturn. But the governor said the foundations for economic recovery were being laid, largely as a result of stock adjustment, company restructuring and the effects of past fiscal and monetary policy. The strong performance in certain overseas markets, in particular the US, gave added grounds for optimism. He said the central bank would continue to monitor economic conditions closely to determine whether the small glimmers of recovery appeared to be spreading. The remarks did nothing to dispel growing market speculation that another cut in official interest rates is in the offing. In the last fortnight, the bank has allowed key money market rates to fall. Overnight interest rates have dropped by one fifth of a percentage point and now stand at a fraction over 2 per cent. But the bank has so far baulked at a cut in the more symbolically important official discount rate from its current all-time low of 1.75 per cent. Such a move would send a much clearer signal of a looser monetary policy to financial markets, something the bank has been anxious to avoid, opting instead for a policy of easing by stealth. Many analysts believe the markets have now discounted a cut in official interest rates, and this has helped relieve some of the upward pressure on the yen. If the bank fails to cut rates as expected, the pressure on the Japanese currency is likely to revive, threatening again to push it through the Y100 to the dollar level.</p>

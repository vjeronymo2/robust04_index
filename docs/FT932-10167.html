			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / EBRD committee proposes sweeping inquiry THE COMMITTEE which will look into allegations of overspending at the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development wants a sweeping inquiry which would examine most aspects of the bank's spending policies, including 'special flight arrangements'. The audit committee, which includes EBRD directors, has recommended that four firms of auditors be asked to tender for the role of adviser. The bank's own external auditors, Deloitte Touche and Tohmatsu, would not be among them. The proposed terms of reference, which were put to a meeting of the EBRD's board of directors yesterday, are rigorous. They include suggesting that there should be what is described as an 'arms length' relationship with the bank's management during the inquiry, given the sensitivity of the committee's work. This, says the document setting out the proposals, requires 'strict adherence to confidentiality and independence'. Mr Claes de Neergaard, chairman of the audit committee, has said that, in addition to external auditors, outside quantity surveyors and architects should be appointed 'to ensure the appearance of absolute independence and objectivity'. The committee, which was charged by EBRD directors on April 19 with carrying out the inquiry, has asked for between Pounds 200,000 and Pounds 300,000 for the task. It plans to deliver its report by July 15 although there is scope for it to take longer. The bank yesterday declined to comment on the audit committee's proposals. However Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's founder and president, is understood to have told the board that the audit committee will get all the support it needs. Mr Attali is also believed to have accepted that the committee should look at the bank's use of private jets. The inquiry was set up after widespread calls from the bank's international shareholders following revelations in the Financial Times of expenditure of Pounds 55.5m by the bank on its London headquarters. The committee's remit on expenses at the EBRD's headquarters will include, but not be limited to, a review of: The adequacy of the procedures for tendering and procurement to ensure that services and goods were processed and payments were made in a regular and proper fashion so as to obtain proper value for money. The cost effectiveness of the specification for the project. The adequacy of the arrangements for reporting progress on the project to the directors. The adequacy of the arrangements for managing the project, within the bank and between the main contracting parties, taking account of best practice in the European Community. The bank's policy and procedures with respect to fitting out the temporary headquarters at Leadenhall Street.</p>

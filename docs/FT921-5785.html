			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Buying voters, 'prudently' IN JAPAN, politicians are bought retail; in Britain, voters are bought wholesale. Polite western circles regard such Japanese practices as, well, 'alien'. But, alien or not, they are a good deal less expensive. The Pounds 4bn in discretionary tax cuts that the British government is rumoured to be considering for the Budget due on March 10 is Pounds 300 for every likely Conservative voter. How might a prudent government, especially one dedicated to balanced budgets, justify borrowing to fund so handsome an electoral bribe? Political justifications are not hard to find. What is needed is a tax cut large enough to entice the electors but not so large that it frightens the foreign exchange markets. Unfortunately, too much prudence, like its opposite, might prove imprudent. If the foreign exchange markets were to decide that the electorate had not been bought, the resultant weakness of the pound might limit the scope for interest rate reductions. Nothing in recent experience suggests that the Treasury is likely to get such a calculation right. But what it would certainly need to do first is rethink its fiscal policy. The government's an-nounced policy is to balance the budget over the cycle. Cycles can be almost as long as pieces of string. Suppose, however, that this cycle started in 1988, the year of the most recent peak and, not coincidentally, when the present fiscal doctrine was enunciated. The forecasts of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, adjusted for deteriorating economic prospects, suggest that nominal net borrowing between 1988-89 and 1996-97 could easily be over Pounds 80bn. The government might run offsetting surpluses in the remaining years before the next cyclical peak, whenever that is. But the moon might also be made of green cheese. Debt ratio Discretionary tax cuts would throw the current budgetary rationale into the dustbin. A good thing, too, many will say. If one wants a rule, a more sensible one might be to hold the ratio of public sector debt to GDP constant at the current level of 38 per cent, which would imply a public sector borrowing requirement averaging about 2 per cent of GDP (Pounds 12bn). Alternatively, the public sector debt ratio could be targetted at 60 per cent, the ratio agreed at Maastricht, which would allow huge amounts of borrowing. Some argue that no fiscal rule makes sense, especially with monetary policy fixed in the ERM vice. Fiscal policy should be far more flexible than hitherto. The combination of a fixed exchange rate with fiscal fine-tuning would bring the UK most of the way back to the demand-managing 1960s. Fiscal boost In short, should the government wish to abandon its past policy to justify an expansionary Budget, it can easily find a rationale for doing so so. Nor would it be possible to condemn the result out of hand. Not only are any likely discretionary fiscal changes small against those that have already occurred in recent years, but demand is unquestionably depressed. Particularly if inflation were going to fall swiftly to the best European levels, a fiscal boost could be justified. Nevertheless, this does not look the right route, above all for this government. The cyclical timing of any demand-oriented fiscal manipulation would only be as good as the forecasting models. Worse, shorn of credible medium-term rationales, fiscal policy would dance to the tune of the moment. Since deficits are far easier to create than surpluses, the probable result would be inexorable pressure on public spending and a steady increase in the burden of public debt. The likely medium-term combination of a tight monetary policy with a deterioration in the structural fiscal position is frightening. It looks especially risky for a country with a substantial current account deficit in the midst of a deep recession, above all if the tax cuts were largely aimed at boosting consumption. Even politically it might be better for the government to stick to the hairshirt it has long made its own. To attempt to buy the election at this late stage would look like panic. The government can rightly argue that the recession is the necessary fruit of a disinflationary policy on which both parties are agreed, but that it alone has been prepared to do what was needed. This, not abandoning its well-established fiscal position, is now its only plausible defence.</p>

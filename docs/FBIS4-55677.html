			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, May 18 (AFP) -- Eleven French aid  workers detained for over a month by Bosnian Serbs for alleged  arms trafficking were freed and flown out of Sarajevo on  Wednesday [18 May] after payment of $44,000. In Paris, a  spokeswoman for the charity group Premiere Urgence (Emergency  Aid), which sent them into Bosnia-Hercegovina, denied that the  4,000 dollars a head paid by the organisation for their release  was a ransom.    The sum was "too small to be considered as a ransom," said  spokeswoman Pascale de Lomas. She said rather that the money  was "bail" which allowed the Bosnian Serbs to "save face." The  Serbs' demand for payment, which "resembles a racket," had  caused much heart-searching at the charity, she added. [passage  omitted]    A communique issued by the French Foreign Ministry said the  release came after "direct pressure from Paris and (Bosnia) on  the main parties concerned." French Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe had several contacts with the authorities of rump  Yugoslavia and sent the foreign ministry's general secretary,  Bertrand Dufourq, to Belgrade to negotiate a release.  Ambassador Jacolin had daily contacts with the group, the  statement added.    The Foreign Ministry said contacts had also been made with  France's main western partners as well as Russia, European Union  president Greece, and the cochairman of the peace conference on  the former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen, and UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali to help end the aid workers' 40-day ordeal.  France "thanks those who helped," the statement added. [passage  omitted]    On Tuesday, a day before the release, Patricia Ettouati, the  only woman in the group, wrote to the bishop of the Normandy  town of Evreux, Jacques Gaillot, that the Serbs were "champions  in psychological destruction."</p>

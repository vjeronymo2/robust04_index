			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / IMF and Kiev in reform link Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, yesterday announced plans for unprecedented co-operation between the new Ukrainian administration and the IMF in drawing up an economic reform programme for Ukraine. After meeting the recently elected President Leonid Kuchma in Kiev, Mr Camdessus said the IMF and the Ukrainian administration would 'put all of our energies' into the joint writing of the programme in the next two months. Close co-operation with the IMF could secure swift issue of the first tranche of a Dollars 700m (Pounds 451.6m) IMF loan, opening the door to the Dollars 4bn package promised to Ukraine at the Naples summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations earlier this month. Although an agreement is not guaranteed, IMF and Ukrainian officials are expected to develop a programme to keep monthly inflation below 10 per cent, reduce the budget deficit (estimated to run at 30 per cent of GDP this year), end excessive printing of money and liberalise prices. 'We're talking of a far-reaching programme,' Mr Camdessus said. But he cautioned that this kind of programme would require 'ambition' - an attempt to encourage Mr Kuchma in what is expected to be a bitter struggle with Ukraine's conservative parliament.</p>

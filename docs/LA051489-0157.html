			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> An investment group that includes two Ronald Reagan Administration officials  has entered the bidding for troubled Eastern Airlines, according to a newspaper  report. Former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci would temporarily be in  charge of Eastern and Joseph Wright Jr., a former director of the Office of  Management and Budget, would be involved, the New York Times said. Options  trader Joseph Ritchie, who now heads the bidding group, declined to reveal the  size of the offer but said it would give the troubled carrier's unions a bigger  stake in the airline than did a bid led by former baseball commissioner Peter  V. Ueberroth, the newspaper said. Eastern has been virtually grounded since its  machinists union went on strike in March.  </P></p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Hoover agents lifted Abta bond THE TWO travel agents handling Hoover's free flights offer increased their Association of British Travel Agents bonding at the turn of the year to enable them to boost sales of associated services such as accommodation and car hire. Free Flights Europe of Watford and Your Leisure of Warwick are members of Abta, which sets bonding levels to ensure that customers' money can be refunded if the company collapses. The free flights are not guaranteed by Abta because potential holidaymakers' contracts are with Hoover. However, Abta would be responsible for services such as accommodation bought directly from the travel agents. Mr William Brenchley, managing director of Brevis Marketing Services, Free Flights Europe's parent company, said he arranged a new bond to cover additional business generated by the Hoover offer after discussions with Abta. Mr Michael Dunkley, a director of Your Leisure, said his company also increased its bond. Mr Brenchley said he would investigate any specific allegations that his company gave preference to Hoover applicants who agreed to spend money on extra services such as accommodation, car hire and insurance. Mr Brenchley said if such incidents did occur, 'it was not the result of management instructions'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 9 (YONHAP) -- Over 30,000 defiant  protesters united nationwide Saturday to oppose South Korea's  signing of the Uruguay Round [UR] agreement on the eve of  delegation's departure to commit to the pact.    Collegians at Seoul universities had joined some 13,000  farmers' representatives, opposition lawmakers, activist  teachers and dissidents at Poramae Park in southern part of the  capital by 2:30 P.M. to launch the rally opened simultaneously  in 11 other cities.    Hundreds of ralliers in the southern city of Ulsan occupied  downtown streets chanting "renegotiate, renegotiate." Some 2,000  protesters in Chonju threatened to fight to bring down the  government if the agreement is not rebargained.    "No to UR," "Fight UR till death," shouted protesters in  Seoul as they tried to cut the police blockade to march to the  National Assembly hall. Fierce clashes are likely late into the  evening with hundreds of students vowing to reunite at Myongdong  Cathedral to go on a hunger strike until the trade agreement is  vetoed at the National Assembly.    Organizers said 197 groups participated in the rally that  turned out to be the largest this year to fight Seoul's  commitment to the global trade pact at the signing ceremony  starting next Tuesday. Controversy over South Korea's country  schedule never waned after the government retracted a  presidential promise and opened its rice market.    Government officials said they are going ahead to ink the  Uruguay Round final agreement despite the protest at home.  Trade, industry and resources minister leaves for the ceremony  in Morocco Sunday.    "The government could not possibly sign the agreement in  Morocco on April 12 if it sincerely cared for the people and the  country's future," opposition leader Yi Ki-taek said through a  blaring microphone. "We will never sit idly by if the government  tries to put its stamp on the agreement as is," he said.    Organizers read a statement demanding an immediate hearing  on  allegations of secret agreement with the United States on rice  market opening. The headquarters of the pan-national movement  for protection of farmers pleaded with the citizens to  participate in the fight against ratification and to keep  foreign products off the market shelves.</p>

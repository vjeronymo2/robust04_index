			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> EDUCATORS HOPE FOR PROP. 146 APPROVAL  </P> <P> South County school officials will be crossing their fingers on Election Day  for the passage of Proposition 146, an $800-million bond measure, which would  fund the construction of new schools in quickly developing areas such as Rancho  Santa Margarita and Trabuco Canyon.  </P> <P> Both the Saddleback Valley and Capistrano Unified school districts are waiting  for school construction funding from the state's "fast track" program, in which  the state Department of Education and school districts each fund 50% of high  priority schools.  </P> <P> But while the districts have come up with their share through property taxes  and developer fees, few state funds have been allocated. This has forced South  County school officials to put projects on hold, redraw boundary lines, hold  year-round classes and house students in portable classrooms or on other  campuses until new schools can be built.  </P> <P> But if voters approve Proposition 146, South County school districts could be  eligible for millions in state funding to build up to 12 schools in the area.  </P> <P> In Saddleback Valley, officials estimate they would receive $16 million to  build three schools: an intermediate school in Rancho Santa Margarita and  elementary schools in the Trabuco Highlands and Portola Hills areas.  </P> <P> Capistrano Unified officials speculated that the bonds could contribute to the  $160 million needed to build nine new schools currently on hold because of a  lack of state funds.  </P> <P> But even if the bond issue passes, South County could still be left in the cold  if state education officials decide to give the money to other districts, said  Jacqueline Cerra, Capistrano Unified spokeswoman.  </P> <P> "There's absolutely no guarantee we would get money, we are in competition with  a host of other school districts," Cerra said. "But if (Proposition 146)  passes, it would better our chances for receiving state funding in the future."  </P> <P> Capistrano officials estimate they will need to build 10 more schools by 1992  to meet enrollment projections in Aliso Viejo, Rancho Santa Margarita, San Juan  Capistrano, San Clemente, Laguna Niguel and Mission Viejo.

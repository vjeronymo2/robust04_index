			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Skosyrev report: "Islands Dispute Could Lead to </F> Moscow-Beijing Quarrel"]    [Text] Beijing -- Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin's  trip to Beijing, scheduled for late May, crowns the "Russian  spring" in the Celestial Empire, which has seen a series of  visits from high-ranking guests from Moscow.    It started with Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Army  General  Staff. He was followed to Beijing by State Duma Chairman Ivan  Rybkin, Deputy Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, and, finally, the  premier himself. In the opinion of a number of Chinese  observers, such a rapid expansion in mutual contacts shows that  a "new old love" has bloomed again between Moscow and Beijing.  Admittedly, the Beijing newspaper BEIJING QINNIAN RIBAO  provided a more prosaic explanation for Moscow's intentions. It  claims that, not having received the loans it was promised,  Russia is disenchanted with its Western partners and is now  banking on restoring its traditional ties with the East.    What do official Chinese circles think? A prominent Foreign  Ministry official diplomatically replied that he saw no shifts  in Russia's foreign policy. Talking about Russo-Chinese  relations, he did not refer to love or even friendship, but  talked about mutual interest -- primarily in the sphere of  economic cooperation.    Until this year trade between our countries had been rising  rapidly. Then suddenly, in the first quarter of 1994, the  volume of reciprocal shipments fell by 40 percent.    The leadership of Heilongjiang Province, which borders  Russia, attributes the slump to the fact that Moscow introduced  visa restrictions on Chinese "shuttles" and businessmen. But  our trade experts believe that the roots of the crisis go deeper  than that. The PRC authorities, striving to curb inflation, are  currently holding back the growth of capital investment --  particularly in construction. And this, in turn, has led to a  fall in demand for some of our traditional exports -- metals,  timber, and machinery. Russian exports are becoming less  competitive on the Chinese market as a result of rising prices  for raw materials and transportation.    Relations between neighbors may also be complicated by  differences about who owns what islands in the Amur and Argun  Rivers. Judging by the statement from the head of the  Khabarovsk Kray Administration printed in the Moscow newspaper  SEGODNYA, five Chinese warships attempted to penetrate the  border 40 km from Khabarovsk. Our border guards prevented this  from happening. Weapons were not used.    But, according to information received by IZVESTIYA from  Khabarovsk, there were no "five warships." The border guards  merely recorded a violation of sailing regulations by a single  Chinese cutter, and, according to them, such incidents often  occur, but do not constitute military provocations. As the  aforementioned PRC Foreign Ministry staffer put it, what  occurred were "not clashes, but disputes."    Disputes arise because the 1991 border agreement states that  sailing regulations along the Amur and Ussuri Rivers will be  further elaborated. But they do not yet exist. The Chinese are  insisting that their ships are entitled to sail down the main  channel of the river -- that is, between the center of  Khabarovsk and Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy and Tarabarov Islands. But  the Russian side is trying to prove that since the two islands,  which are part of the city, are our territory, Chinese ships  sailing through this stretch of the river are obliged to observe  the regulations existing in Russia's internal waters.    Whatever happens, we should not whip up feelings over these  incidents, much less call for the denunciation of the 1991  agreement -- as certain politicians in Khabarovsk are doing.  The stability of our Far Eastern borders, which was achieved  after long, hard negotiations with the PRC, is at stake.</p>

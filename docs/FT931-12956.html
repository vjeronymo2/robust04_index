			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / New coalition moves in Hungary THE reconfirmed moderate leadership of Hungary's ruling Democratic Forum (HDF) yesterday began the task of building a new conservative coalition capable of winning the 1994 general elections. 'We have to go for the moderate voters, it is the only chance,' an aide to Mr Jozsef Antall, the prime minister, said yesterday, after the weekend party congress rejected a right-wing attempt to shift the party towards a more nationalist and xenophobic position. 'Hungarians are 60-70 per cent moderate. If you want to win you have to go for them.' The campaign for the floating voter is likely to see Mr Antall's conservatives emphasise their edge in experience and challenge the opposition to say how they could have better managed the economically troubled years since the 1990 elections. 'We have to convince the voters that there is no alternative,' the aide added. 'Nobody else in the region has done any better than this government.' But opposition politicians yesterday doubted that the Forum had sufficiently healed its internal differences to rebound after the congress. Mr Viktor Orban, leader of the opposition Young Democrat party, praised the prime minister's tactical success in holding the party together and his verbal confrontation with Mr Istvan Csurka, leader of the ultra-nationalists. 'But the fact is that Csurka and Antall remain in the same party. 'It is as if Jacques Chirac, the French conservative leader, and Jean-Marie Le Pen, the French ultra-nationalist, were in government together,' Mr Orban added. Many believe the performance of the economy under the Forum's stewardship will prove more important for the elections than the outcome of the congress. 'People's feelings about their personal circumstances: that's what matters. That is where the election will be decided,' Mr Laszlo Medgyasszay, a Forum presidium member, said. The prime minister's success at the congress leaves the conservative coalition he formed in 1990 in a stronger position to continue to the end of its term and reinforce its position as eastern Europe's longest-lasting and most stable government. But The Forum, which languishes at a humiliating 8 per cent in the opinion polls, still faces an uphill struggle to attract new coalition partners and voters nervous about the ultra-nationalists who remain on the right wing of the party.</p>

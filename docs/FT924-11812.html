			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / The Property Market: Leipzig starts to rebuild itself - The east German city faces daunting tasks The confused and neglected state of the property market in the former East Germany is just one of the reasons why the wheels of economic reform are grinding slowly in that country. But some progress is evident in Leipzig, the east's second largest city, where the authorities are pressing ahead with modernising the property stock. The smoke-belching chimneys that dominate the Leipzig skyline have now been joined by cranes; the crumbling and blackened remains of baroque buildings have been shrouded with scaffolding; and the arcades and passages in the city centre are stacked with west German consumer goods. Change is in the air. This feeling is reflected in a survey by Jones Lang Wootton (JLW), the chartered surveyors, of 100 property companies, financiers and consultants. The respondents said Leipzig has more potential for property investors than any other east German city; while half the respondents said they planned projects in Berlin, 60 per cent said they intended to work in Leipzig. It is the considerable lack of office space in Leipzig that is attracting office developers. Leipzig's office stock currently totals between 1m sq ft and 1.3m sq ft, virtually all of which is obsolete by western standards. An additional 2m sq ft (2.6m sq m) of office space will be needed if Leipzig is to attain the same proportion of office stock to population as west German cities. For developers, there are numerous incentives, including grants, favourable tax treatment, European Community regional grants and subsidised lending rates. The shortage of space has driven rents up to unsustainable levels. Today rents are as high as DM60 a month, and some investment deals have been sealed on yields less than 2 per cent. But for all the apparent opportunities, Leipzig faces some daunting obstacles if it is to fulfil its ambitions. These include: Pollution. Before 1989, the region had the highest density of harmful emissions in the German Democratic Republic. The city's reliance on lignite is evident in the open cast mines that scar the countryside surrounding Leipzig and the layers of grime on the buildings. But emissions have halved with the closure of factories, briquette plants, and heating stations. Today, city residents say they can see the sky clearly for the first time in many years. The inadequacy of Leipzig's building stock, the result of heavy bombing during the second world war and four decades of communist neglect. Under the former communist regime, historical buildings were neglected and eventually demolished to make way for grey Stalinist-type buildings. Leipzig's lack of good housing is a forceful brake on development since it prevents the city from attracting skilled workers. The authorities hope that, over time, the barrack-like prefabricated blocks of flats littered around the city, will be demolished. The shortage of hotel rooms is another headache. The city has only 3,370 hotel beds, making it difficult to reserve a room at busy times, such as Leipzig's famous spring and autumn trade fairs which each attract up to 100,000 visitors. The city's planning office has received more than 100 enquiries about hotel projects. Poor transport infrastructure. Although Leipzig has good motorway connections by east German standards, the road system is poor compared with west Germany. Declining population. Leipzig's population has shrunk from 713,000 before 1939 to 511,000 today, due to a lack of jobs, decay, shortage of housing, poor recreation facilities and pollution. Since German reunification in 1990, more than 30,000 people - mainly young and relatively well-educated - have migrated from the city. Land ownership disputes. This is the city's biggest single problem. The government's decision to give anyone whose property was expropriated the right to reclaim their property has resulted in claims for 95 per cent of the city centre. 'The most important job of every developer in Leipzig is to get the ownership situation cleared,' says Mr Albrecht Wrede, lawyer for Erste Munchen-Leipziger Investitionsgesellschaft, a developer planning one of Leipzig's largest schemes. The poor state of the city's land registers has given the authorities an apparently insurmountable problem. It has just a few dozen staff to deal with 23,000 applications for property restitution, each of which can take 28 days to process. Last year, Leipzig settled just 130 land disputes; this was more than half the total land dispute settlements reached in all of eastern Germany last year. For developers, the result is mounting frustration. 'It is not that the staff at the city authority are not willing to work, they are not qualified,' says Mr Douglas Holoch, who heads JLW's Leipzig office. 'They (the city authorities) can work effectively on questions of property,' says Mr Michael Schimansky, head of the office for commercial development at Leipzig city council. The council copes with its own lack of cash by co-operating with developers. For example, developers are being asked to finance masterplans, build infrastructure and make land available at a low price for industrial uses. The city is anxious to attract industry, since the engineering, machine tools and light industrial sectors that have been the mainstay of its economy face rationalisation. Mr Schimansky underlines the city's hunger for investment. 'Leipzig is one of the new sites in western Europe where the population accepts chemical plants,' he says. Despite Leipzig's desire for rapid industrial growth, it is the trade and service sectors which are initially likely to see the greatest volume of activity. 'The service industries will experience over-proportional growth,' says a report by Zadelhoff Deutschland, a property adviser, and Arthur Andersen, a management consultancy. 'It is generally expected that Leipzig will become a centre for trade and banking,' says the report. Leipzig has drawn on its past in targeting the areas where it hopes to expand. The city's historical importance is based on its trade fair. The exhibition grounds are being moved to Mockau in the north of the city, part of ambitious plans to give Leipzig the most modern exhibition facilities in Europe. The city was also the centre of the book and publishing trade in the former communist state. The town planners have created a 'Media city Leipzig' project, which will cover a large part of eastern Leipzig. The project is being carried out by an association of public and private interests, which intends to build publishing houses, media centres and office buildings at a cost of between DM2,000m and DM3,000m. But change will be more apparent on the outskirts of the city, rather than the centre. Since the farmland surrounding the centre is not encumbered by disputes over land ownership, the area has been the target of much speculation. A total of 143 industrial areas and business parks, covering 10m sq m have been planned. However, in the view of JLW, only 10 per cent of these will be built. 'It will be necessary to make immense investments in the infrastructure for this purpose and this could be the death knell for some projects,' JLW says. Leipzig's reconstruction is being financed by institutional and private funds from western Germany. The transformation of the city testifies to the strength of Germany's commitment to its development.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL RETURN (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Retail    Office    Industrial    All Properties Year to Aug 92         7.2      -5.8           5.1               1.8 Quarter to Aug 92      1.2      -1.9          -0.4              -0.2 Month of Aug 92        0.1      -0.8          -0.2              -0.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Investment Property Databank  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Jarvis Porter makes Dutch purchase Jarvis Porter, the specialist label printer, yesterday announced plans to acquire three Dutch labelling companies for Fl 48.6m (Pounds 17.4m) from Nederlandse Grafische Groep. The deal came as the group reported a 43 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits, buoyed by earlier domestic acquisitions. Earnings increased by 28 per cent to 14.6p (11.4p) and the final dividend is raised to 3.55p making a total for the year of 5.2p (4.7p). The proposed acquisition will be funded by a rights issue of 7.56m shares at 230p and provides Jarvis Porter with an important foothold in the continental European label printing market. The shares closed 1p lower at 274p yesterday. The rights will be on the basis of one new ordinary share for every 4.24 shares held and is subject to shareholders' approval at an extraordinary meeting on May 31. NGG reported pre-tax profits of Fl 8.05m (Fl 7.81m) in 1993 on turnover of Fl 45.2m (Fl 43.9m). Of the three operating companies, Peha Etiketten makes high quality self-adhesive labels for the toiletry, cosmetics, food and household products sectors, Jeka Speciaaldrukkerij en-Uitgeverji supplies the fast turnround market for self-adhesive labels and Drukkerji Zwart specialises in the production of heat seal labels used to seal the outer wraps of vacuum packed coffee. Mr Paul Jarvis, chairman, commenting on the acquisition, said it would strengthen the group's position in the primary labels market and represents a further step in the international development of the group. 'It continues our strategy of augmenting growth in existing businesses by selected acquisitions in specific niche markets within the print and packaging sector,' he said. Jarvis's results for the year to February 28 highlighted the success of this strategy to date. Pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 4.78m to Pounds 6.83m. Turnover grew by 40 per cent to Pounds 55.6m (Pounds 39.7m) including Pounds 7.74m from the acquisition of Dolphin in Lewis and Irwin Packaging in Cardiff at the start of last year. The two acquisitions contributed Pounds 951,000 to operating profits which increased by 48 per cent to Pounds 7.05m (Pounds 4.76m) and operating margins improved to 12.7 per cent (12 per cent). Profits were slightly reduced by net interest costs of Pounds 217,000, compared with receipts of Pounds 24,000 a year earlier. COMMENT The NGG deal looks good. The self-adhesive label business is the fastest growing segment of a fragmented, but expanding market and the acquisition should enable Jarvis to supply an enlarged multinational customer base. Jarvis is buying growing businesses which operate on healthy margins and the price looks fair. With pre-tax profits of about Pounds 10.3m forecast for this year, producing earnings of 18p, the shares are trading on a reasonable forward multiple of 15.2. Although the rights offer is the third since 1991, it deserves support.</p>

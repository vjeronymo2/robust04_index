			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa drifts lower, golds steady Johannesburg drifted lower in dull trade as the market waited for further direction amid concern about prospects for bullion and world equities. The overall index slipped 19 to 5,863 and industrials dropped 39 to 6,547. Dealers said traders were cautious about a weak industrial sector and fears of inflation. New figures showed that the producer price index rose sharply in July to its highest annual rate in two years, heralding a possible return to double-digit inflation by the end of the year, and exceeding market expectations. The all-commodities index rose 1.7 per cent for the month to show a 9 per cent gain year-on-year, the highest since August 1992 when the rate was 9.5 per cent. The engineering conglomerate Barlows receded 50 cents to R31.75. Gold shares, meanwhile, managed to hold steady in spite of the softer metal price in largely technical trade. Golds edged up 7 to 2,417 and the bullion's afternoon fix was down below the Dollars 390 an ounce level to Dollars 389.60. Mr Emin Eyi from Baring Securities described the small gain, however, as 'the start of an underlying rise in gold shares'. He cited a weakening commercial rand, helping exporters, and prospects of a rise in interest rates as reasons why the market should pick up. Dries added 75 cents at R68.50.</p>

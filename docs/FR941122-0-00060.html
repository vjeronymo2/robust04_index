			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 6: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed rules' requirements that ``only adult wolves (greater than 50 pounds) can be harassed'' and then ``only for 15 minutes'' and ``only adult wolves that are witnessed attacking livestock on private land can be killed by private parties'' are overly restrictive. The provision that wolves can only be killed under a special permit when (1) seen attacking livestock for the third time on Federal lands, (2) six or more wolf packs are present in the experimental population, and (3) all agency control efforts have failed, does not address the issues in a timely or efficient manner. The implication that land-use restrictions may be employed on private lands when five or fewer wolf packs are present in the experimental area also needs clarification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Service agrees and has eliminated (1) the distinction between adult wolves and pups for both noninjurious harassment and take and (2) the length of time wolves may be harassed (as long as physical injury is not incurred). Permittees with grazing rights on public land can readily obtain a written take permit for wolves seen attacking livestock. However, issuance criteria still require that prior to issuing the 45-day take permit (1) six or more wolf packs must be present in the experimental population area, (2) authorized agencies must confirm that a wolf caused the livestock injury or death, and (3) other agency control actions have failed to resolve the problem. The final rule also clarifies that no land-use restrictions will be exercised by Federal agencies on private land at any time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 7: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Certain parts of the rule need to be more specific, so that potential management situations are individually described and addressed in the final rule. Commenters provided a variety of scenarios as examples.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Service added or clarified definitions and/or language in the final rule. However, the wolf reintroduction program is complex and has many unforeseen variables. It is impossible to imagine or describe in detail every situation that might arise during its implementation. Some situations can only be accurately addressed on a case-by-case basis and judged by their particular circumstances. It is the intent of the Service to use the experimental rule to aid the conservation, recovery, and eventual delisting of wolf populations in the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States. The Service in cooperation with other Federal, State, and tribal agencies will use the flexibility of the experimental rule to address local concerns and unforeseen situations. The professional expertise and experience of wildlife managers will facilitate the implementation and any modifications needed to improve the wolf reintroduction program. Additional language was added to the rule, clarifying that management flexibility is required as the program is implemented and refined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 8: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Service should make a clear commitment to fund all aspects of wolf reintroduction and management, including compensation to the States and tribes for their efforts. The Service should closely monitor the compliance of other agencies to the experimental population rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To date, the Federal government has funded the participation of affected States and tribes in regard to wolf restoration program. The Service plans to continue its funding commitment with Congressional appropriations until wolves are delisted. The public stated its concern over the use of taxpayer dollars and the need for government to wisely spend tax dollars. The Service, therefore, must keep expenses for wolf reintroduction as low as possible while maintaining an effective program. The Service will encourage the States and tribes to submit reasonable budgets for wolf management programs, as well as search for ways to pool and coordinate resources so that overall costs are reduced. It is the legal responsibility of the Service to monitor the progress and adherence of State and tribal agencies to their management plans. The Service will ensure and work cooperatively with others to meet the stated recovery goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 9: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The wolf reintroduction effort needs to have a federally funded livestock damage compensation program. Wolf reintroduction will result in the ``taking'' of constitutionally protected private property rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In Montana, the Defenders of Wildlife implemented a private livestock compensation program. Because the Defenders Program has been successful, it was expanded to include Idaho and Wyoming. The Service will not directly fund a livestock compensation program. The Service will encourage livestock producers to utilize private compensation programs when depredation occurs. The Service and USDA Animal Damage Control will aid livestock producers by maintaining an effective control program that minimizes livestock losses due to wolves. The rule addresses the concerns of private property owners by (1) providing an effective control program, (2) allowing landowners to take wolves on their private land when justified, and (3) invoking no land-use restrictions on private land. The Service has reviewed the constitutionality of this rule in regard to protected private property rights. The review concludes the Service's actions do not violate the private property rights of individuals (Service 1994a, Appendix 6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

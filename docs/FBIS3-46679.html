In other words, the indoctrination in the chuche  idea, including indoctrination in the principle of the chuche  idea, indoctrination in class character, indoctrination in the  revolutionary tradition, indoctrination in party policies, and  indoctrination in socialist patriotism, is an ideological  indoctrination to strengthen the main force of the revolution by  firmly arming our party members and working people with a  chuche-oriented revolutionary view of the world.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: The  basic  purpose of the indoctrination in the chuche idea is, in a  nutshell, to guarantee unity of ideological will in the  revolutionary ranks by arming the popular masses, who are the  main force of the revolution, with a revolutionary independence  ideology and to lead the popular masses to maintain the position  as masters and to play the role as masters in the revolution and  construction.    Now, let us discuss why the indoctrination in the chuche  idea  is an indoctrination to strengthen the main force of the  revolution. It is because the primary purpose of the  indoctrination in the chuche idea is to guarantee unity of  ideological will in the revolutionary ranks by arming the  popular masses with a revolutionary independence ideology. The  mission of the working class' party is to successfully push  ahead with the revolution and construction and, thus, to  completely realize independence of the working masses of people.  In order to do this, it is imperative not only to achieve the  cause of national liberation and class liberation, but also to  consummate the cause of socialism and communism. For this end,  it is necessary to have the inexhaustible strength capable of  pushing ahead with and consummating these causes. The source of  the inexhaustible strength lies in that all the people firmly  unite around the party and the leader [suryong] with one  ideological will. However, such unity does not come  spontaneously. To achieve firm unity in the revolutionary ranks  it is imperative to see to it that only one ideology prevails in  the ranks. Only by doing so can unity of ideological will be  achieved and great strength be displayed in the revolutionary  ranks.    However, even though one ideology prevails in the  revolutionary ranks, firm unity is not achieved spontaneously.  Only the revolutionary ideology of the working class' leader  [suryong], that is, the revolutionary ideology which most  thoroughly and correctly reflects the independent demands and  interests of the working masses of people, should prevail in the  revolutionary ranks. The chuche idea is a revolutionary  independence ideology, which most correctly and thoroughly  reflects and has codified the independent demands and interests  of the working masses of people. Therefore, there is no mightier  ideology than the chuche idea in realizing unity and cohesion of  the revolutionary ranks. The popular masses can firmly unite  around the party and the leader [suryong] and display mighty  strength only when they arm themselves with the chuche idea.  Accordingly, guaranteeing unity of ideological will of the  revolutionary ranks by firmly arming the popular masses with the  revolutionary independence ideology is the primary purpose of  our party's indoctrination in the chuche idea.    That the indoctrination in the chuche idea is an  indoctrination to strengthen the main force of the revolution is  also because the primary purpose of the indoctrination in the  chuche idea leads the popular masses to maintain the position as  masters of and to play the role as masters of the revolution and  construction. The revolution is carried out by the working  masses under the leadership of the party and the leader  [suryong]. Therefore, to properly carry out the revolution and  construction it is imperative for the popular masses to assume  the attitude of being masters of the revolution and  construction. The same may be said of the case of a household.  Only when all members of the household, not only the housewife,  manage household affairs with the position and attitude of being  the housewife of the household can the household affairs be  properly managed. Likewise, to successfully carry out the  revolution and construction it is imperative for the popular  masses, who are the people in charge of the revolution and  construction, to thoroughly adhere to the position as masters  and to smoothly play the role as masters.    To see to it that the popular masses maintain the position  as  masters in the revolution and construction and play the role as  masters, it is imperative to strengthen among them ideological  indoctrination work to enhance the awareness of being masters.  The chuche idea demands that the popular masses have the  attitude of being masters in the revolution and construction.  When people firmly arm themselves with the chuche idea they can  not only adhere to their independent and creative position, but  also maintain the position as masters and display the role as  masters in the revolution and construction.    In this way, leading the popular masses to have the attitude  of being the master in the revolution and construction is not  only the inherent demand of the revolutionary struggle itself,  but also the inherent demand of the chuche idea. Herein lies the  reason why the indoctrination in the chuche idea is an  indoctrination to lead the popular masses to maintain their  position as masters of and to play the role of masters of the  revolution and construction. In this way, the indoctrination in  the chuche idea, including indoctrination in the principles of  the chuche idea, indoctrination in party policies,  indoctrination in socialist patriotism, and indoctrination in  class character, is the indoctrination to strengthen the main  force of the revolution.    As the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has systematized  scientifically and theoretically that the indoctrination in the  chuche idea is an indoctrination to strengthen the main force of  the revolution and has clearly elucidated the overall task and  direction of ideological indoctrination work a guiding principle  which makes it possible to further strengthen and develop  ideological indoctrination work among party members and the  working people has been provided.</p>

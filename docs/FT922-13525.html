			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Champagne unmatched by retail fizz CHAMPAGNE flowed in the City of London yesterday to celebrate the election result. Many employees were given extended lunch hours, and one wine bar ran out of champagne. Mr Gilbert McClung, a City lawyer, had begun to celebrate as soon as the Tories looked set for victory. 'A Conservative government has given me Pounds 5,000 to spend and I am starting to spend it now.' The crowds in Oxford Street remained cautious, however, mainly confining themselves to window-shopping because of high interest rates and the possibility of losing their jobs. Mrs Helen Walker, whose husband is unemployed, said: 'We come here every week and we've never seen the shops so empty. It's still getting worse, and I can't see it improving very quickly.' Mr Pete Lucas, a jazz musician, was also cautious. 'People aren't going to start spending more money yet because they haven't got it to spend. I'm finding it very difficult to get any work and where I live there are shops closing every week.' Mr James Carpenter, a university student, was more optimistic, perhaps because he had just been offered a job as a financial consultant.</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: ITT plans to double 35% stake in Ciga ITT, the US conglomerate which owns Sheraton Hotels, is proposing to double its 35 per cent stake in Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group, with a public offer for a further 35.25 per cent of the company's ordinary shares. The US company is understood to have proposed an offer of about L1,100 a share to Consob, the Italian stock market watchdog which must now approve the terms of the bid. The formal offer could be launched on September 16, when the next Milan stock exchange trading account opens, six weeks after Consob first announced that ITT would have to launch a bid. Ciga's vociferous minority shareholders are already upset by the way in which the gradual takeover of the Italian group has been handled. The way in which the offer terms were disclosed last night could fuel their irritation. The terms of the offer appeared yesterday evening in news agency reports, quoting Consob sources, but there was no official communication from the watchdog. ITT has had little difficulty lifting its stake in Ciga to 35 per cent with recent purchases on the market. It has also installed three directors on the seven-strong board of the Italian group. Last night, the US company would say only that it was intending to comply with all Italian regulations, but it would not confirm that an offer had been made. If the new offer is successful, according to the terms which emerged last night, ITT will have spent a total of more than L800bn (Dollars 505m) acquiring a 70 per cent holding in Ciga, originally controlled by the Aga Khan. But some minority shareholders may not accept the bid, which is set at only a slight premium to yesterday's market price of L1,087. ITT was forced to take a roundabout route to control of Ciga when its original complex plan to acquire the hotels group from its creditor banks for about L900bn failed.</p>

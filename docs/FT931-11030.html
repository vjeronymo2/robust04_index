			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Goldstrike mine boosts American Barrick profit AMERICAN Barrick, defying the gloom in the gold-mining industry, announced a near-doubling in 1992 earnings, an accelerated production schedule at its flagship Goldstrike mine, and plans to broaden its horizons to Latin America. The Toronto-based company lifted net earnings to USDollars 174.9m, or Dollars 1.22 a share, in 1992, from Dollars 92.4m, or 68 cents, the previous year. Revenues from gold sales soared by 57 per cent to Dollars 540m. The strong improvement was almost entirely due to higher production and lower costs at the Goldstrike mine in Nevada. Goldstrike's output more than doubled to 1.11m ounces last year. Output from all five of the company's mines rose to 1.33m ounces from 790,000 ounces. Aggregate cash costs fell to Dollars 210 per ounce from Dollars 305. An active hedging programme held prices realised last year at an average Dollars 422 per ounce, well above prevailing market levels. Mr Greg Wilkins, chief financial officer, said yesterday output was fully hedged to the end of 1994 at prices above Dollars 400, and the company was now hedging between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of its output up to 2001. Thanks to a co-operation agreement signed late last year with Newmont Mining, which owns deposits adjoining Goldstrike, Barrick forecasts its total production will surpass 2m ounces by 1995, five years earlier than the original target. Barrick has also raised its estimate of ore reserves at Goldstrike's Betze-Post pit by 20 per cent, bringing the company's total reserves to 27.2m ounces. The estimated grade at Betze-Post has been revised upwards to 0.22 ounces per ton from 0.19 ounces. Exploration work at Goldstrike will continue this year. Mr Bob Smith, Barrick's president, expressed confidence yesterday that 'the final chapter on reserves at Goldstrike has yet to be written.' Yesterday's announcements pushed Barrick's share price up 37 cents to CDollars 38.75 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The company, which had its origins as a troubled oil and gas producer in the early 1980s, is ranked eighth in market value on the TSE, ahead of such traditional giants of Canadian business as Canadian Pacific and Alcan Aluminium.</p>

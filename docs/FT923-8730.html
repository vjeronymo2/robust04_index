			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / China's budding capitalists trigger chaos THERE was chaos in the streets of Shenzhen, southern China's most affluent city, over the weekend as hundreds of thousands of investors flocked there to apply for the right to buy shares. Chinese citizens - who have been told by the country's senior leaders, that it is 'a glorious thing to be rich' - travelled to the city, which borders Hong Kong, from as far away as Beijing and Sichuan in the hope of taking part in a lottery for warrants. Success will give them the right to participate in 14 company flotations later this year. Company shares are one of the few assets the Chinese are allowed to own, aside from household items such as televisions and refrigerators. To date there has been only a limited experimentation with home ownership. With an estimated Yn1,000bn (Pounds 94bn) of household savings - but with negative rates of interest - it is not surprising the Chinese turn to shares as a hedge against inflation. The market capitalisation of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange has increased elevenfold this year; turnover in the first six months of the year rose sixfold against the same period of 1991. The authorities yesterday began issuing 5m application forms, each costing Yn100 (Pounds 9.40). But only 500,000 applications - to be determined by a lottery - will be issued with warrants to participate in the 14 flotations forecast to raise Yn500m. On Saturday night city officials called in armed police to maintain order. One person was killed in the crush and another was reported to have died. The police used cattle prods and batons to keep order. A state-level foreign exchange dealing centre began operating in Beijing at the weekend, in a move to reform China's cumbersome foreign exchange trading system, Reuter reports from Beijing. The National Foreign Exchange Swap Market is part of government plans to unify exchange rates quoted on similar regional markets, official media said. The new centre will pave the way for trading in currency futures and a variety of foreign currencies.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Welsh nuclear plant to close NUCLEAR ELECTRIC is to close the Trawsfynydd power station in Snowdonia, north Wales, two years earlier than planned, Michael Smith writes. It says the price of resolving the concerns of health and safety inspectors could be too high. The station, which employs 490 people, will be the third of Britain's nuclear stations to close. Nuclear Electric said there were no implications for its other six operating Magnox stations, which are expected to continue for several years, some beyond the end of the century. Trawsfynydd stopped producing electricity in February 1991 because of cracks in its pressure vessels. Modifications have cost more than Pounds 6m and Nuclear Electric said it strongly believed in the safety plan it had put to the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate. However, satisfying the inspectorate's further questions would divert resources. Nuclear Electric said Trawsfynydd had in effect been losing about Pounds 50m a year income from electricity sales for the past two years. Decommissioning the plant would cost Pounds 230m at today's prices and would take 100 to 135 years.</p>

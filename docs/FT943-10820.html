			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Surveyors face tougher rules Surveyors will be subject to tougher rules on the way they conduct valuations, under draft guidelines unveiled yesterday by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. They will be obliged for the first time to state valuation instructions explicitly in writing and agree them with clients. If there are uncertainties in the valuation because of market conditions or other special circumstances, these must be flagged in the surveyor's report. Mr Adrian Britton, director of the general practice division of the institution, said: 'We are quite determined that we are not going to have valuations undertaken without both parties being clear about what the service is.' He said insurance companies had advised the institution that 45 per cent of professional indemnity claims against surveyors would not have arisen if the instructions had been written down. The new rules will be compulsory and will replace two existing sets of rules, only one of which was mandatory. The present mandatory rules cover how valuations should take place but only for a limited number of types of valuation. The other set of rules has information on producing and conducting valuations.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 25 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin and Acting Ukrainian Prime Minister Yefim  Zvyagilsky, heads of the Russian and Ukrainian official  delegations to the talks on the disputed Black Sea Fleet, will  not sign an agreement on the division of the fleet today, a  Russian Government official said.    The official said that the working groups will continue  discussion for another 30 minutes and may adopt a joint  communique.    Both delegations have contacted their presidents via the hot  line several times and Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin met with his Ukrainian counterpart Yefim Zvyagilsky  to discuss the issue.    The Ukrainian delegation agreed on Wednesday to return to  one  of the four variants of fleet division proposed by Russia and  rejected by Ukraine earlier.    The stumbling block at the talks which have been underway  for  three days is the disagreement over the location of the  Ukrainian and Russian navies.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Portman sells land bank to MJ Gleeson for Pounds 11.9m MJ Gleeson Group, the Surrey-based construction, housebuilding and property concern, has bought the residential development business of Portman Building Society for Pounds 11.9m cash. The principal assets of the land bank acquired are 413 plots of eight sites with planning permission, 1,300 plots held under option and 33 acres without planning permission. Portman Homes incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.4m in 1993, mainly reflecting a write-down of the value of its land bank and work in progress. Mr Colin McLellan, Gleeson finance director, said the company was taking a medium-term view of the housing market. 'The plots will take four years to sell, by which time we would hope there will have been a pick-up in the market.' The weak housing market has depressed Gleeson's profits during the last four years although the company has remained in the black. It reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 9.9m) in the year to June 1993 and in March it reported flat interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.1m, compared with Pounds 4.06m.</p>

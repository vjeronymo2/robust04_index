			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Mandela seeks to calm investors MR NELSON MANDELA made a determined effort yesterday to reassure the international business community about the economic policies of a post-apartheid South Africa. In an interview with the Financial Times, the president of the African National Congress served notice of a fundamental review of his organisation's stance on nationalising key industries, and urged foreign companies to visit South Africa to investigate investment opportunities. He also sought to clarify the ANC's attitude to South Africa's external debt and hinted that a new government might try to reschedule loan payments. 'Without the support of business we cannot solve our economic problems,' he said. 'Nationalisation is like a sword of Damocles hanging above those who want to invest. So long as nationalisation is our policy, we will not attract investors.' Mr Mandela's comprehensive review of economic policy came at the end of a week in which the ANC's credibility took a severe knock as a result of apparently conflicting signals on the economy. While the 73-year-old nationalist leader held a series of meetings in Europe with senior businessmen and politicians, including talks with Mr John Major in London yesterday, his assurances about foreign investment and loans were contradicted by statements from ANC headquarters in Johannesburg. Yesterday, however, speaking at Heathrow airport before his return to Johannesburg - and days before the second anniversary of his release from 27 years of imprisonment - Mr Mandela sought to assert his authority over ANC policy. He denied there was any discrepancy between his statements and those issued at headquarters. In a formal statement, which had apparently been cleared with other ANC leaders, he said the ANC accepted 'that a future democratic South Africa had an obligation to service the debts which were incurred by the present regime . . . before financial sanctions were imposed by the international community.' But the statement added: 'The terms of repayment of such loans may be renegotiated to ensure that a democratic government is not unduly burdened by foreign debts incurred by an illegitimate regime.' Mr Mandela did, however, criticise efforts by Pretoria to raise capital through international bond issues, saying they amounted to sanctions busting. He also reiterated the ANC's plea for maintenance of economic sanctions, although most have already been dropped. Lending to South Africa by private-sector institutions is not prohibited. But banks cut off credit lines to South Africa in 1985 and Mr Mandela believes this hastened apartheid's collapse. He is trying to impede the government's access to international capital markets until an interim government is installed to oversee democratic elections. Foreign financial institutions arranging bond issues on behalf of South Africa, said Mr Mandela, singling out German banks, were 'undermining the negotiation process in South Africa. If they have a genuine interest in South Africa they would put pressure for the immediate installation of an interim government of national unity in South Africa'. Borrowing is a particularly sensitive issue in light of the current all-party negotiations on South Africa's future. The ANC believes that new loans will bolster the position of President F W de Klerk and reduce the pressure for reform. Mr Mandela's comments on nationalisation seemed designed to set the tone for a review of what has been a central and controversial plank of ANC thinking since 1955. This, he said, was likely to be discussed at a policy conference in April, though it is far from clear that this will resolve the matter. The ANC leader said he had concluded that a nationalisation programme was likely to alienate business after discussions with top executives in South Africa and abroad, and recent conversations with world leaders, includinging Li Peng, the Chinese prime minister, and President Francois Mitterrand of France. Tracy Corrigan writes: The Southern African Development Bank's debut issue of its DM200m (Pounds 70m) medium-term bond met strong demand yesterday from German retail investors despite ANC opposition.

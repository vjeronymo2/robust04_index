			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Inflation success translates into poll support for Cardoso: Architect of Brazil's economic plan is now front runner in Brazil's October presidential election race The outspoken governor of the Brazilian state of Amazonas, Mr Gilberto Mestrinho, has no doubt who will be his country's next president, even though he says he will vote for another candidate in the first round of the election on October 3. 'Brazil's president is already chosen and it is Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The trend in his favour is irreversible,' he says. For the first time last week, opinion polls confirmed a significant lead for Mr Cardoso, the former finance minister who fathered the country's popular anti-inflation plan. Two polls last week showed him seven points ahead of his main rival, Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers' Party (PT), with support for Mr Cardoso running at about 35 per cent of the electorate. If the gathering trend in favour of Mr Cardoso continues, a run-off ballot on November 15 of the two leading candidates may be unnecessary. Mr Paulo Calmon, a political scientist at the University of Brasilia, says: 'It's possible that Cardoso could win in the first round.' To do this he must win more votes than the other six candidates together. If there is a second ballot, Mr Calmon and others think Mr Cardoso stands to gain more votes from supporters of the most prominent losing candidates in the first round, probably Mr Orestes Quercia of the Democratic Movement party (PMDB) and Mr Leonel Brizola of the Democratic Workers party (PDT). Mr Cardoso's gathering support is based mainly on a single issue: the economic plan. In the six weeks after the introduction of the real, Brazil's new currency, inflation has dropped sharply. After price rises of 50 per cent in June, inflation fell to 6 per cent last month, and may be as low as 2 per cent this (though the forecast is highly uncertain). As a result, up to 70 per cent of Brazilians say they favour the plan. 'The only platform in this election is the economic plan,' says Mr Bolvar Lamounier, a Sao Paulo academic and supporter of Mr Cardoso. As a result, Mr Cardoso is vulnerable to reverses in the plan's early successes. Reversals could come from political pressure to raise the wages of the military and federal workers - a subject that President Itamar Franco frequently raises - or from a consumer boom. However, with his support falling away, Mr da Silva, widely known by his popular political name Lula, cannot sit back and hope the economic plan goes awry. He has already been forced to tone down his attacks on it to avoid accusations of being a friend of inflation. Instead, he has criticised it as being too narrow in conception and for not addressing Brazil's deep social ills - a so-far unsuccessful attempt to manoeuvre the campaign into areas where political analysts agree Mr da Silva is strong. He has also stepped up criticism of the alliances that Mr Cardoso has made with the traditional power brokers of Brazilian politics such as Mr Antonio Carlos Magalhaes who, from his base in the north-eastern state of Bahia, controls the powerful right-wing Liberal party (PFL) which had strong links with the pre-1985 military government. Mr da Silva's campaign is drawing strong parallels between the two Fernandos  -the disgraced former President Collor who beat him into second place in 1989 and Mr Cardoso. 'Collor is not a thing of the past, he's a reality of the present. His friends are still there in the Cardoso campaign,' he told foreign journalists in Sao Paulo at the weekend. Yet, a negative campaign carries risks for the PT too. For one thing, Brazilian voters have in the past not responded positively to such tactics. And, says Mr Lamounier, 'if the PT starts throwing mud around, it's potentially equally damaging for Lula'. For example, Mr da Silva may be vulnerable if the Cardoso campaign emphasises his links to the fractious parties of the extreme left in Brazil. Many political analysts reckon Mr da Silva's only answer would be to start building party alliances of his own. However, he is constrained by the likely criticism he would receive from within his own party ranks for practising traditional party politics. From Mr Cardoso's point of view, his political alliances deliver important campaign advantages. The amount of free television air time candidates have  -they are together allowed one hour a day four days a week - are linked to the number of supporters they have in the out-going congress. Mr Cardoso's campaign broadcast takes up more than a quarter of an hour against Mr da Silva's seven minutes. The alliances also deliver important backing in key parts of the country. Whether they will help Mr Cardoso should he come to office is another matter. Most economists agree that any candidate would need to push through important changes to the complex 1988 constitution to complete the fight against inflation, and that will require large scale support in congress, which also faces elections on October 3. 'Governability: that's what this campaign is all about,' say backers of Mr Cardoso such as Mr Lamounier. 'I don't think the PT is in a position to govern this country.' By contrast, he says, Mr Cardoso knows what must be done and will have the strong initial power of the presidency to push through necessary reform. On the other hand, the PT argues that Mr Cardoso has bitten off more than he can chew in building alliances with crafty machine politicians such as Mr Magalhaes. Some independent observers are sceptical too. Mr Jose Augusto Guilhon of the University of Sao Paulo is not optimistic that the coalition built by Mr Cardoso would stay together for long.</p>

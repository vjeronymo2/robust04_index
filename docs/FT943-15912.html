			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Council workers reject 3.9% Local authority employers yesterday increased their pay offer from 3.2 per cent to 3.9 per cent but it was rejected by unions representing the 1.5m employees. Privately, both sides say industrial conflict is highly unlikely. The employers hinted that a slightly improved final offer will be made on July 21, saying they were 'close to' their limit. The employers said the offer, which would be paid in two stages and last until April 1996, would increase the Pounds 14bn pay bill by more than Pounds 500m. As the government - which directly funds 85 per cent of local government spending - is assuming the same pay bill as last year, that means cutting jobs and services to finance the pay increase. Mr Charles Nolda, spokesman for the employers, said: 'The government has a pay bill freeze but it is not policing this pay negotiation in any way. We are free to do exactly what we want.' Last year the local authority pay bill did not rise - in spite of a 1.5 per cent pay increase - thanks to the departure of 50,000 employees. This year, however, Mr Nolda expects a smaller reduction in staff which means more services are likely to be cut. At the next negotiations on July 21 the employers may make further improvements to the non-pay elements of the deal. Already this year they have agreed to extend maternity leave arrangements to low-paid part-time staff, partly as a result of European Court rulings, and agreed five days paternity leave. The current offer would mean both blue-collar and white-collar workers receiving an average rise of 2.1 per cent this year and a further 1.8 per cent from August 1995. This means a 21-month settlement for white-collar staff and a 19-month offer for manual workers. Mr Mick Graham of the GMB general union said the deal would mean a pay cut for workers this year.</p>

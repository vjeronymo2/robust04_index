			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Doctors asked to list urgent conditions DOCTORS' leaders have been asked by the government to identify urgent medical conditions which should receive hospital treatment within about six weeks, Alan Pike writes. The move comes amid growing concern that funding pressures are already forcing hospitals to curtail non-emergency admissions for the rest of the financial year. The medical royal colleges are producing definitions of conditions that should be treated as a matter of urgency. The information will be passed to the Department of Health by the end of this month.</p>

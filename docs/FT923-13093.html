			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Producer price rise stabilises in June INFLATION as measured by prices of manufactured goods at the factory gate failed to show a decline last month, dashing hopes of a let up in cost pressures. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday the prices of products leaving factories rose 3.6 per cent in the year to June, the same as in May. This measure is often used as the underlying 'core' inflation indicator. Between May and June, the index of producer prices rose 0.1 per cent to 137.4. Year-on-year inflation at the factory gate remained at its lowest level since April 1987, a reminder of how demand pressures have been squeezed inthe recession. But added to evidence of continuing inflation was the 3 per cent price increase of goods excluding food, drink and tobacco in the 12 months to June, compared with 2.6 per cent in the previous month. The year-on-year increase for goods excluding edible items and tobacco - the prices of which can move erratically due to excise duty changes - was the biggest since January. Last month's higher-than-expected figures may have been affected by large price falls in specific manufactured items in June last year, distorting the year-on-year comparison. In June this year the price index of factory goods excluding food, drink and tobacco also rose 0.1 per cent. Prices of minerals rose 0.4 per cent, while those of scientific instruments and chemicals increased 0.3 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively. The prices of manufacturing raw materials and fuels rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent after a fall of 0.5 per cent in May.</p>

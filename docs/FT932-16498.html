			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / World Trade News: UK gives tied loan to Jakarta MR Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, yesterday signed a Pounds 65m concessional loan to Indonesia to fund a 65MW power station to be built by a UK company in Samarinda, East Kalimantan. The contract for the project has not been awarded but, under the terms of the loan, it must go to a British company. Mr Hurd rebutted suggestions that, by tying the aid, the UK government was undermining the principle of free trade. British exports to Indonesia grew 58 per cent to Pounds 312m last year, while Indonesian exports to the UK rose 29 per cent to Pounds 536m. Officials say the loan is a belated effort to promote UK companies in an Indonesian sector in which Dollars 30bn of investment is planned in the 1990s.</p>

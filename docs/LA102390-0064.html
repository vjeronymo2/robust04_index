			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL MAY END ACTION AGAINST 2 OF 'KEATING 5';  </P> <P> ETHICS: A SPECIAL COUNCIL'S STUDY REPORTEDLY CALLS FOR DROPPING PROCEEDINGS  AGAINST SENS. GLENN, MCCAIN STEMMING FROM THE S&amp;L SCANDAL.  </P> <P> The Senate Ethics Committee, responding to barbed Republican suggestions that  its "Keating Five" inquiry has become a Democratic coverup, may decide today  whether to dismiss charges against two senators, including the only Republican  under scrutiny.  </P> <P> The committee's Democratic chairman, Sen. Howell Heflin of Alabama, made the  announcement Monday after four Republican senators urged immediate action on a  six-week-old report by the panel's special counsel, Robert S. Bennett.  </P> <P> Bennett reportedly recommended a full-scale investigation of charges that Sens.  Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and Donald W. Riegle Jr.  (D-Mich.) improperly helped a major campaign contributor, savings and loan  executive Charles H. Keating Jr.  </P> <P> But Bennett, according to sources, also called for dropping proceedings against  Sens. John Glenn (D-Ohio) and John McCain (R-Ariz.).  </P> <P> In coordinated floor speeches, McCain, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.)  and two other GOP senators suggested that Democrats are delaying action on the  report to prevent the inquiry from focusing solely on Democratic senators just  before congressional elections Nov. 6.  </P> <P> They demanded a committee decision before Congress adjourns this week, as well  as public disclosure of Bennett's 354-page report. Later, Glenn joined in the  call with a press release.  </P> <P> "There's far more at stake than my reputation," McCain declared. "There's the  reputation of the United States Senate."  </P> <P> In response, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) condemned a  stream of "outrageous" leaks from the panel's investigation, suggesting that  Republicans are responsible for feeding the secret data to reporters because it  concerned only Cranston, DeConcini and Riegle.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Heflin defended the committee's deliberate pace, saying that the  panel was obligated to explore issues raised about McCain and Glenn by Common  Cause, the so-called citizens lobby, after Bennett turned in his report Sept.  10.  </P> <P> Heflin cited a brief filed Oct. 1 by Common Cause President Archibald Cox,  arguing that there was "no basis for removing Sens. Glenn and McCain from this  case."  </P> <P> The panel is investigating Common Cause charges that the five senators  improperly helped Keating battle federal regulators on behalf of Keating's  failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, after receiving a combined total of $1.3  million in political contributions.  </P> <P> McCain said that he was speaking out reluctantly because he did not wish to  "upset the very powerful Ethics Committee" or "jeopardize my political career."  </P> <P> But, he added, "my concern is about my honor, my integrity and my reputation. .  . . Not only am I personally frustrated by the failure of the committee to act  on its year-long Keating Five investigation, there are growing allegations in  the media of a coverup. . . . This system is incredibly and inexcusably  delayed."  </P> <P> McCain, while acknowledging that Keating had been a friend, a political  supporter and "a hot property around the state of Arizona," maintained that "I  never lifted a finger for him. When he asked for my help in an improper  fashion, I walked away."  </P> <P> Dole called for prompt committee action as a matter of fairness.  </P> <P> "Here we are the week of adjournment and two of our colleagues have sort of  been hung out to dry," he said, noting that the new Congress will not convene  until January. "There are all kinds of rumors floating around. Some say they  (the three Democrats on the six-member committee) do not want to make a  decision before the election, that it is politics."  </P> <P> Observing that McCain had once been held as a prisoner of war by the North  Vietnamese, Dole said: "Let us not keep him hostage here in the Senate."  </P> <P> Sens. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.) and Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) also joined in the  criticism of the committee.  </P> <P> In his press statement, Glenn asked that "the committee not allow the Senate to  adjourn and thus delay indefinitely a resolution of this matter. . . . For more  than a year, my honor and integrity have been called into question and my  conduct has been the subject of unending speculation."  </P> <P> Mitchell said: "I do not believe any fair conclusions can yet be reached about  the outcome of the committee's deliberations."  </P> <P> In assailing the leaks, he complained that they are "damaging the reputations  of members. . . . Equally importantly, these leaks are attempting to establish  a climate in which the judgment of the Ethics Committee will be immediately  discredited if it reaches a different conclusion."  </P></p>

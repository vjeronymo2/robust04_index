			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Tinplate takes the pressure - An important division for British Steel IN THE year since Mr Don Turner switched from running British Steel's narrow strip business to become managing director of the South Wales-based tinplate division, he has been putting his new colleagues' welcoming remarks to the test. 'When I came here they said this isn't a cyclical business,' he says. If anything it was viewed as anticyclical - because people are supposed to eat more canned food in a recession. That has not been demonstrated totally in the current recession, he says, but the cycle is much less pronounced than in the general steel industry. 'It's nothing like what you find in steel markets such as construction and automobile manufacture,' says Mr John May, marketing manager. The relative stability of the tinplate business is important for British Steel, whose other products have taken the full blast of the downturn. Tinplate - which is 99.75 per cent steel - accounts for about 10 per cent of the company's finished products and at about Pounds 500 a tonne generates annual revenues of some Pounds 400m. Overall, the European can market is showing 'static to slow growth,' says Mr May - not exciting, perhaps, but a contrast to some general steel markets which are in structural decline. In some ways, though, the tinplate business has problems similar to those of general steel. 'Prices are not what they should be, there is a continuing cost/price squeeze and there is overcapacity,' says Mr Turner. Demand in Europe is about 3.5m tonnes, compared with capacity of between 4.5m and 5m tonnes. Consequently, profitability is hardly sparkling, but is better than average for a steel business. Actual profits are not disclosed. And, just as in the general steel business, rationalisation within the industry has left its mark on British Steel Tinplate. A workforce of 14,000 in the early 1970s - including basic steelmaking at the old Ebbw Vale works in Gwent - fell to 5,000 three years ago. Then, the Velindre works near Swansea was closed, and employment is now about 3,200, most of whom are at the two remaining plants, Trostrey near Llanelli and Ebbw Vale. But there the similarity with the rest of British Steel ends. The tinplate business is really part of the packaging industry, says Mr May, and over the past decade has become much more European in outlook as the structure of its customer industries has changed. 'There has been pressure on the tinplate industry to concentrate. That has come from downstream where there has been great concentration in the packaging industry - and this has happened among the retailers too.' So the number of can-making customers is much smaller than the huge variety of customers for general steel. Unfortunately, though, direct customers are only part of the picture. Tinplate is also involved in a very public and occasionally acrimonious battle with the aluminium industry for the hearts and minds of the beverage industry and its customers - which ultimately means the shopper. The claims and counterclaims about the relative environmental friendliness, recyclability, and aesthetic qualities of steel versus aluminium put the marketing of tinplate on a different plane to that of, say, steel beams for the construction industry. The battle to persuade a brewer, for example, to switch from aluminium to steel cans could start with Mr May's marketing team convincing a London design house that the can design would work best in steel. Over the past four years, British Steel Tinplate has spent Pounds 100m to ensure it maintains its position against its big tinplate rivals and fight the materials battle effectively. The investment culminates in July with the opening of a new tinning line at Trostrey. The company is one of four big tinplate producers in Europe, along with Rasselstein - part of German group Thyssen - Hoogovens of the Netherlands and Sollac, part of France's Usinor Sacilor. Each hold a strong share of their home market, but are trying to boost sales elsewhere. There are nine other producers, but these lack the full product lines of the big four. Most of the investment at British Steel Tinplate has gone towards productivity improvements, maximising product quality and reducing cycle times in the manufacture of thousands of tinplate grades. The biggest single investment was a Pounds 50m continuous annealing plant, commissioned in 1988. A Pounds 38m line has also been introduced, allowing the company to offer tinplate strip up to 1200mm wide, initially for the beverage industry. Much smaller investments - although no less important in the long term  - have been made in a Packaging Steels Development Centre at British Steel's main Port Talbot site. This is the focus of efforts to capitalise on what Mr Turner sees as steel's USP (unique selling point) - its greater strength compared with aluminium, allowing the development of steel cans with ever-thinner walls. Developments such as the Ecotop, a dual button all-steel can end now being test marketed in Europe, are particularly important in areas such as the UK beverage sector, says Mr Turner. Overall, 12bn steel cans are used in the UK every year, but only 3bn go to beverage producers - and even those have aluminium tops. While steel is dominant in food cans, aluminium leads the 7bn-can beverage market. 'It is important to attack that market,' says Mr May. The most important development could come next year when British Steel unveils the all-steel Ultimate Can, made from a new steel allowing for a 30 per cent weight reduction on previous steel cans. The can is being developed jointly by British Steel Tinplate, Hoogovens and Rasselstein - a sign that the big groups are prepared to unite against a common enemy.</p>

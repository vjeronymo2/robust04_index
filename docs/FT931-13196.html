			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: AITC will admit offshore closed-end funds THE ASSOCIATION of Investment Trust Companies, the industry trade association, said it will admit as members offshore closed-end funds and is seeking tax changes to make them more attractive to investors. The rule change will allow 15 to 20 new firms to join immediately, increasing the AITC membership from its current level of 231 members. Many of these are single country funds which allow investors access to foreign stock markets which they would have difficulty accessing. Also, some of the funds are investing in bonds which UK investment trusts are currently barred from holding in significant quantities. The AITC said it had barred the firms - which are an increasingly significant portion of the investment trusts with London Stock Exchange listings - because the UK definition of a closed-end investment company is particularly narrow and stops companies from ever repurchasing their own shares. An increasing number of closed-end companies are being established offshore for fiscal or regulatory reasons and many do not entirely meet the UK definition, the AITC said. To be eligible for AITC membership, a company must have a London listing, must be marketable in the UK and will regard EC citizens as a 'substantial part' of their natural shareholders, the trade organisation said. Among the tax changes sought by the AITC on behalf of closed-end funds are an end to the distinction in the way capital gains on stocks and bonds held in investment trusts are taxed. While the capital gains on equities are untaxed, the capital gains on bonds are taxed. The AITC is also calling for the gains earned on futures, options and warrants held by investment trust to be treated as capital gains and therefore, untaxed.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SON ACCUSED OF KILLING ACTRESS TELLS COURT SHE ATTACKED HIM  </P> <P> Taking the witness stand in his own defense for the first time Thursday,  Timothy Scott Roman tearfully testified that his mother, actress Susan Cabot,  attacked him with a barbell and a scalpel the night she was found bludgeoned to  death in her Encino home.  </P> <P> Roman, dressed in a neat gray pinstripe suit, spoke softly as he described  finding his mother dead in her room. But, he said, he does not remember killing  her, as prosecutors allege.  </P> <P> Roman, a 25-year-old former art student, is charged with bludgeoning Cabot, a  1950s-era B-movie actress, to death with a barbell on Dec. 10, 1986. Roman  pleaded not guilty, and Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Darlene E. Schempp is  conducting his non-jury trial.  </P> <P> Roman portrayed his mother, who was 59 at the time of her death, as suffering  from increasing physical and mental deterioration, which led him to call her  doctor the day before her death. Cabot had severe asthma and seemed to be  having a nervous breakdown, Roman said softly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Call Precipitated Attack  </P> <P> Roman said his mother's doctor instructed him to call paramedics if her  condition worsened. His attempt to call them the next night precipitated  Cabot's attack, he said.  </P> <P> "I didn't know what was wrong with her. I'd never seen her this bad before,"  Roman said under questioning from Richard P. Lasting, one of his two lawyers.  </P> <P> "She was screaming. She was calling for her mother. She was talking to herself.  I thought I'd better get help for her."  </P> <P> But when Roman picked up the phone beside Cabot's bed, she started screaming at  him to put the phone down and leave her alone, Roman testified.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Didn't Know What to Do'  </P> <P> "Then she started saying, 'Who are you?' " Roman testified. "I just stood  there. I didn't know what to do. She got off the bed and picked up a weight  bar. She picked it up and started swinging it at me. She might have grazed me.  I'm not sure."  </P> <P> Roman, born a dwarf and treated with growth hormones, is 5 feet, 4 inches tall.  </P> <P> Roman then burst into tears and was unable to continue. After a short court  recess, he said Cabot attacked him with the scalpel, which he said she kept to  cut plants and flowers.  </P> <P> "I was trying to push her away from me, just to get out of that room," he said.  </P> <P> He said he does not remember what happened next until he realized that his  mother was dead.  </P> <P> Roman admitted that he lied to police, telling them that a burglar in a Ninja  mask had killed his mother, and that he hid the barbell and scalpel because he  was scared and "didn't think anyone would understand the circumstances."  </P> <P> In other testimony, Michael Carter, a tutor hired by Cabot to help Roman with  his schoolwork, testified that Cabot was prone to histrionics and frequently  shrieked at Roman during the about 100 tutoring sessions he conducted at the  Cabot home. Carter said Roman was protective of his mother and never grew angry  in return.  </P> <P> The Cabot home was dirty and unkempt, littered with food and newspapers that  were three to four years old, Carter said, adding: "It was difficult to find a  place to work with Tim because there was so much stuff around."  </P> <P> Roman, who has been free since June on $25,000 bail, faces a maximum sentence  of life in prison because prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty.  </P> <P> His first trial ended in a mistrial after his lawyer complained of  stress-induced heart problems.  </P></p>

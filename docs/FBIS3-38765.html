			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Netherlands Must Commit Troops To </F> Eurocorps"]    [Text] The Hague -- The Netherlands must make its troops  available for a second Eurocorps, to work alongside the  French-German Eurocorps. It must do this in order to play a  more active role in European security policy and improved  defense cooperation, said a working group from the Netherlands  European Movement.    The Netherlands did not agree to participate in the  French-German Eurocorps, but Minister Ter Beek did not rule out  joint exercises. In the long term, the Defense Ministry will be  appointed as an observer at the French-German Eurocorps.    The working group, which is led by the member of the  European  Parliament, CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] J. Penders, who  released the report today, wants troops from the yet to be  created German-Netherlands army corps and the already existing  British-Netherlands amphibious force to be brought together into  two new Eurocorps, which, in addition to their NATO duties,  would form a European force.    In the second half of next year, the Netherlands will take  over the presidency of the WEU, the Western European Union,  which is a political and military cooperative association of  nine European countries. According to the working group, that  would be a good time to table proposals for a large European  force, which would be the symbol of a more powerful European  security policy and military cooperation. The troops should be  at the disposal of the WEU, which, under the terms of the  Maastricht Treaty on a common foreign and defense policy for the  European Union, has the task of giving form to the new European  security identity.    According to the working group, it has become easier to  develop a European force now that the NATO summit agreed to its  own European security effort, in which there is talk of  individual but not of separate efforts.    The working group also devoted attention to the eastward  enlargement of NATO and indicated that the accession of new  members would be a long process. "In general it was  acknowledged that the West can only have a marginal influence on  the balance of power in Russia. Therefore, nobody can  accurately say whether a policy of supporting President Yeltsin  can be followed," says the report. The working group considers  to contact countries of the former Soviet Union and the other  members of the former Warsaw Pact.</p>

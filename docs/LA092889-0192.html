			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 U.S. MARSHALS FOUND GUILTY OF TRADING THEIR INFLUENCE FOR MONEY  </P> <P> Two U.S. marshals from Orange County, implicated in a cash-for-influence scheme  in the federal justice system, were convicted Wednesday of accepting thousands  of dollars in illegal payments from a government contractor.  </P> <P> "We felt this was just a horrendous conflict of interest, and we were all  definite on that," said juror Kerry Page of Riverside County. "There are  certain things you don't do in a business relationship, and they crossed the  line."  </P> <P> Joseph Gieniec, 43, of Santa Ana, convicted on all four criminal counts against  him, faces a maximum sentence of eight years in prison and $40,000 in fines.  Co-defendant Gordon Tornberg, 59, of Tustin, convicted on two of three illegal  gratuity charges, could get four years in prison and $20,000 in fines.  </P> <P> Their sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 6 before U.S. District Judge J. Spencer  Letts in the federal courthouse in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors had accused Gieniec and Tornberg of using their positions  as federal marshals in the Southland district to help a 200-employee security  firm in Orange County get and keep a $400,000 contract.  </P> <P> The firm helped seize and guard evidence in federal investigations and protect  government witnesses in the early 1980s. Federal officials said no such private  arrangement had been used in other districts around the country.  </P> <P> In exchange, prosecutors charged, the two defendants received more than $7,000  in direct payments and other financial favors -- such as house renovation  payments -- from Joseph Rydzewski, owner of Lyons Security International.  </P> <P> The 33-year-old Rydzewski emerged as the key witness against the two marshals  at their trial, testifying that he made repeated payments under some duress  from Gieniec so as not to "upset . . . the apple cart."  </P> <P> Rydzewski pleaded guilty to charges in the scheme and agreed to cooperate with  federal investigators. He is to be sentenced Oct. 6, and faces a maximum of six  years in prison and $270,000 in fines.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys tried to show jurors that Rydzewski was lying about his  relationship with the men to help his case and that, in fact, the money that  changed hands between the trio was simply a result of their friendship -- not  of influence peddling.  </P> <P> "We're obviously very disappointed in this result," said attorney James L.  Waltz, who defended Gieniec. "Mr. Rydzewski was untruthful, and that clearly  hurt us."  </P> <P> While the defendants were guilty of exercising poor judgement in their  financial dealings with Rydzewski, "their conduct never entered the realm of  the criminal," the defense attorney said.  </P> <P> He and attorney Wendy Park, who defended Tornberg, said they would appeal the  jury's verdict if it is upheld by Judge Letts. Gieniec and Tornberg, each  allowed to remain free on $10,000 bond, could not be reached for comment after  the verdict.  </P></p>

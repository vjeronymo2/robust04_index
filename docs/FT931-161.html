			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Peace hopes in Bosnia, again THERE HAVE been so many false dawns since the Bosnian conflict started a year ago that the latest favourable indicators must be viewed with caution. A cease-fire that has held for three days and the Bosnian president's signature on an agreement which has yet to be endorsed by those mainly responsible for the war in the first place, the Bosnian Serbs, do not add up to a peace settlement. But there are signs that the prospects for a negotiated peace agreement are no longer as hopeless as they were. The main reason for a more optimistic view is the growing evidence that international pressures are finally beginning to have an impact. The mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, have always acted on the assumption that Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, is the puppet master who must be persuaded to exert pressure on his Bosnian kinsmen if any progress towards a peace settlement is to be made. Last January, it was Mr Milosevic who twisted the arm of the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, to accept the first part of the Vance-Owen peace plan, the constitutional framework for Bosnia. Last week, it was again Mr Milosevic who masterminded the ceasefire talks in Belgrade between the warring factions and the UN commanders. The Serbian president did not seem to apply the same pressure to Mr Karadzic in the intervening period. But the tide turned when both the US, initially highly sceptical of the Vance-Owen plan for a decentralised Bosnia-Hercegovina of 10 semi-autonomous provinces, and Russia, appointed their own envoys to the peace talks and gave their full backing to the plan. That has had two main results. The US has been able to persuade an increasingly recalcitrant Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem Bosnian president, to sign the provincial map, in New York last week. Probably, the quid pro quo was an American undertaking to back the implementation of any peace agreement with ground troops. The mediators' strategy of isolating Mr Karadzic, so that the maximum international pressure could henceforth be focused on him, has thus been realised. The Russians, meanwhile, have been using their influence equally discreetly with their traditional allies, the Serbs, so that they, in turn, would exert pressure on the Bosnian Serbs. The meeting in Belgrade yesterday between Mr Milosevic and Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian envoy to the peace talks, was part of that process. It is possible, though by no means certain, that all this pressure will lead to the approval by the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament within the next two weeks of the Vance-Owen plan. That does not, of course, guarantee that it would be faithfully implemented or remain viable in the longer run. To have any chance of success, as the UN and Nato have realised, it would require the presence of 50,000 to 70,000 troops for many years to police its provisions. It is still far from certain that the international community is prepared to make such an effort, though the opposition of governments to participation in UN peace enforcement operations is less strong than it was. The decisive argument in favour of the Vance-Owen plan is that, with all its weaknesses, it remains the only game in town. Its strength, and advantage over all other schemes, is that it has the backing of all the big powers. A genuine attempt should therefore be made to make it work. The only alternative is to accept a military fait accompli.</p>

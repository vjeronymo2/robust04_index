			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Profit warnings After London International's 31 per cent fall on Thursday, yesterday it was Proudfoot's turn to fall 40 per cent on poor interim figures and a profit warning. Such violent reactions lend support to those who argue that the stricter climate on corporate disclosure is counter-productive. LIG, in particular, had become so tight-lipped since it was censured by the Stock Exchange in May that investors had no apparent inkling of what was going on. Yet it was clear when LIG issued its results in June that a wet summer would wreak further damage to its important photo-processing business. At least it issued a statement virtually as soon as that non-summer was over. Using formal statements to improve equality of access to information inevitably makes share prices more volatile in the short term. One mistake is to assume that this is to the detriment of small investors who are usually long-term holders. How the information comes out will make little difference to where the price finally settles. By contrast it is large institutions that benefit from private individual briefings designed to smooth the market. The bad news, when it comes, is less of a shock but they will have had a chance to take their profits first. The other mistake is for companies to assume that a greater focus on formal statements means their lips must be sealed at other times. The more information they put formally in the public domain, the less they have to fear from answering analysts' questions.</p>

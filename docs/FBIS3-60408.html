Some medical specialists suggest that central and local  governments include parasitic disease control in their social  and economic development programmes and increase budgets for  parasite eradication.    Ministry of Public Health experts, who recently completed a  nationwide survey exposing the problem, hoped that extensive  publicity and education could raise the public's awareness  regarding parasitic illnesses.    The survey found that of the 62&percnt; of Chinese infected  with  intestinal parasites, some 43&percnt; had two or more species of  parasites. Some persons had as many as nine species.    The rate of infection is even higher among farmers and  ethnic  people because of their agricultural activities and dietary  customs.    Most are infected with roundworm, pinworm, and whipworm.    It is estimated that some 531 million people in the country  have round-worms.    Each year, the central and local governments spend some 150  million yuan (about $26 million) treating people infected with  such soil transmitted parasites as roundworm, pinworm, whipworm,  and hookworm.    The national survey, the first and the largest of its kind  in  Chinese history, lasted for eight years from 1988 to 1992 [years  as published].    The Ministry of Public Health and local governments spent  more than 5.2 million yuan (over $900,000) for the survey which  involved about 8,000 technicians and medical specialists.    The survey selected 2,848 pilot sites in 726 counties, and  some 1.5 million persons were surveyed by fecal examination.    A total of 56 species of parasites were detected on the  mainland. Of those, three species of trematodes detected in  Anhui and Fujian provinces are the first recorded in humans on  the mainland. Another species, also found in Fujian Province,  is the first instance of infection in a human.    The highest infection rate--nearly 95&percnt;--was reported  in  South China's Hainan Province. The lowest--17.5&percnt;--was in  northeastern Heilongjiang Province.</p>

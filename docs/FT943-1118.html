			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Mr Howard's mistakes He - it has not yet been a she - who lives by headlines may perish by headlines. That is the danger facing Mr Michael Howard. It is partly of the home secretary's own making. He is aware, or should be, that the rise in crime that has aroused so much public anxiety is the product of complex causes, yet he has sought acclaim as the stern enforcer of criminal justice. He has presented himself as the scourge of criminals, while events have conspired to enable the media to picture his ministry as soft on prisoners and careless in its custody of terrorists. A year ago, at the Conservative conference, Mr Howard presented a '27-point plan' to tackle crime. He then made every administrative and political mistake in the book. He distressed his officials, by curtly rejecting their advice. One by one the client groups under his ministry  - police, magistrates, judges and all - were alienated. Then, under pressure, this 'tough' minister retreated, as in the case of a recently recommended package for the reform of police pay and conditions. The most spectacular defeats came in the House of Lords, where Mr Howard disdained to reach an understanding with Lord Whitelaw, and thus had to redraft key clauses of an important bill. This particular home secretary is not, however, solely to blame for the contents of the criminal justice bill or indeed the police and magistrate's courts bill. They were in draft form when his predecessor, now chancellor, left office. The first bill was designed to correct previous, poorly-drafted, Conservative legislation, the second to extend central control over the constabulary and the magistracy. Both had some merit, and many infelicities. Mr Howard's fault lay in his exuberant pursuit of partisan victories in an area of governance in which consensus is usually preferable. Political clumsiness The political clumsiness he thus displayed may have the serious consequence of clouding the debate over the merits of the governments' attempts to reform the management of the country's jails. In theory the Prison Service, the new agency brought in to do so, should be more than a match for the Prison Officers' Association, one of Britain's few remaining obstructive trade unions. Mr Derek Lewis, the director-general of the service, has made an energetic start. He has introduced clear administrative structures, and advanced plans for transferring the management of specified prisons to private contractors. Lax security On paper, this should enable the public to see who is to blame when things go wrong. In practice it does not always work that way, as the POA loses no opportunity to point out. Was the decision to move convicted IRA terrorists back to Ulster 'operational' and therefore Mr Lewis's to make or 'policy' and therefore Mr Howard's responsibility? Who is to blame for the lax security at Whitemoor prison, where IRA prisoners have received guns, Semtex, and detonators? Is it the new governor, for inattention to detail, Mr Lewis for his regulations, or the Home Office for its rules? The inquiry being conducted by Sir John Woodcock may provide a managerial answer to these questions, but it is the political reality that counts. The days when ministers might be expected to resign over any lapse in any corner of their departments are gone. Yet the creation of arm's-length agencies does not absolve the politician in charge from a duty of oversight. A good chairman leaves day-to-day control in the hands of a chief executive, but keeps antennae out at all times. If the agency system is to work with the requisite degree of transparency, this principle should be clarified. It is not axiomatic that the above history requires the sacrifice of Mr Howard. His presence in the cabinet is partly accounted for by his association with the Conservative right, and partly by his representation of Euroscepticism in one of the three high offices of state - the other two, the treasury and the foreign office, being filled by known pro-Europeans. Against that, he has presided over the loss of the Tories' advantage over Labour as the party of law and order. It is the prime minister's task to decide whether, on balance, Mr Howard's continuation in office is an asset to the government or a liability to his party.</p>

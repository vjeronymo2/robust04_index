			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 18. Where unaffiliated plans do not provide participants with the right to give voting instructions, Life of Virginia and the Accounts do not see any potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interests between variable contract owners and unaffiliated plan investors with respect to voting of Fund shares. Life of Virginia and the Accounts note that there is very little likelihood that any particular unaffiliated plan will hold a controlling interest in a portfolio of the Fund. However, even if an unaffiliated plan were to hold such a controlling interest, Life of Virginia and the Accounts do not believe that such control would disadvantage other investors in the Fund to any greater extent than would be the case were an institutional shareholder to hold a controlling interest. Life of Virginia and the Accounts submit that investment in the Fund by the unaffiliated plans will not create any of the voting complications occasioned by traditional mixed and shared funding, or by the Plan's proposed investment in the Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. Where unaffiliated plans provide participants with the right to give voting instructions, Life of Virginia and the Accounts do not believe that participants in unaffiliated plans_acting as a single group or in combination with participants in other unaffiliated plans_would vote in a manner that would disadvantage variable contract owners. As is the case with the Plan's proposed investment in the Fund, the purchase of Fund shares by the unaffiliated plans that provide voting rights does not present any complications not otherwise occasioned by traditional mixed and shared <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  funding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As used herein, the term ``shared funding'' shall refer to the use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for separate accounts of unaffiliated life insurance companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 20. In light of Treasury Regulation 1.817&hyph;5(f)(3)(iii) which specifically permits ``qualified pension or retirement plans'' and separate accounts to share the same underlying management investment company, Life of Virginia and the Accounts have concluded that neither the Code, nor other Treasury Regulations or revenue rulings thereunder, would create any inherent conflicts of interest between or among participants, VLI and variable contract owners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) Tax Treatment of Distributions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21. Although there are differences in the manner in which distribution from the Plan or the unaffiliated plans and distributions from variable contracts are taxed, Life of Virginia and the Accounts maintain that these differences will have no impact on the Fund. The Accounts, Account 4, the future accounts, the Plan, and the Unaffiliated plans each will purchase and redeem such shares at net asset value in conformity with Rule 22c&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act without the imposition of any sales charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (iv) Potential Future Conflicts Arising From Tax Law Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 22. Life of Virginia and the Accounts do not see any greater potential for material irreconcilable conflicts arising between the interests of plan investors and other Fund investors from possible future changes in the federal tax laws than that which already exists with regard to such conflicts arising between variable contract owners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (v) Conditions for Relief <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 23. Life of Virginia and the Accounts represent and agree that if the exemptions requested herein pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act are granted, they will rely on such exemptions to purchase and hold Fund shares only if the following conditions are met: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The board of directors of the Fund, including a majority of those directors who are not interested persons of the Fund or interested persons of such persons, shall: (i) adopt a resolution approving the sale of Fund shares to the Plan and the unaffiliated plans; and (ii) monitor the Fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflicts between or among the interests of variable contract owners, and qualified pension and retirement plan investors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Life of Virginia will monitor its operations and those of the Fund for the purpose of identifying any material conflicts or potential material conflicts between or among the interests of qualified retirement and pension plan investors and variable contract owners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Life of Virginia will report any such conflicts or potential conflicts to the Fund's board of directors and will provide the board with all information reasonably necessary for the board to consider any issues raised by such existing or potential conflicts. Life of Virginia will also assist the board in carrying out this obligation by, among other things, informing the board whenever it disregards voting instructions from variable contract owners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Life of Virginia will provide ``pass-through'' voting privileges to variable contract owners as long as the Commission interprets the 1940 Act to require such privileges. Life of Virginia will vote Fund shares held by it that are not attributable to variable contract reserves in the same proportion as instructions received in a timely fashion from variable contract owners, and shall be responsible for ensuring that the Accounts and Account 4 each calculate ``pass-through'' votes in a consistent manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) In the event that a conflict of interest arises between variable contract owners, and/or qualified retirement or pension plan investors, Life of Virginia will, at its own expense, take whatever action is necessary to remedy such conflict (as it adversely affects variable contract owners), up to and including: (1) establishing a new-registered management investment company; and (2) withdrawing assets attributable to reserves for the variable contracts subject to the conflict from the Fund and (A) reinvesting such assets in a different investment medium (including another portfolio of the Fund), or (B) submitting the question of whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected variable contract owners, and, as appropriate, segregating the assets supporting the contracts of any group of such owners that votes in favor of such segregation, or offering to such owners the option of making such a change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Life of Virginia will not be obligated to establish a new funding medium for any group of variable contracts if an offer to do so has been declined by a vote of a majority of the variable contract owners adversely affected by the conflict. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) The board meeting minutes of the Fund or other appropriate records shall record: (1) all reports sent by Life of Virginia, depositors of the future accounts, the Plan, or the unaffiliated plans to be the board of directors of the Fund; (2) notices sent by the Fund's board of directors to Life of Virginia, the depositors of the future accounts, the Plan, or the unaffiliated plans, notifying the recipient of the existence of or potential for a material conflict between the interests of variable contract owners and qualified retirement and pension plan investors; and (3) board deliberations regarding conflicts or potential conflicts. Such board meeting minutes or other records shall be made available to the Commission upon request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) The Fund's prospectus shall disclose that: (1) Fund shares are offered in connection with mixed funding and to 401(a) plans; (2) both mixed funding and investment by 401(a) plans in the Fund may present certain conflicts of interest between variable contract owners and qualified retirement and pension plan investors; and (3) the Fund's board of directors will monitor for the existence of any material conflict of interest. The Fund also shall notify the Plan and Life of Virginia that similar prospectus disclosure may be appropriate in separate account prospectuses or the Plan prospectus. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Life of Virginia and the Accounts will continue to rely on Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) and to comply with all of its conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

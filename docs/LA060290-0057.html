			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO TURNS FOR STEVENS THIS TIME;  </P> <P> LOS ALAMITOS: THE YEAR'S TOP THOROUGHBRED JOCKEY WILL RIDE LIGHTLY REGARDED  RAISED TOPERFECTION IN QUARTER HORSE RACE.  </P> <P> Gary Stevens, the year's leading thoroughbred jockey with purses of $5.7  million, will ride a quarter horse, Raised Toperfection, tonight in the  $233,000 Kindergarten Futurity at Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> Stevens, 27, got his start in racing by riding quarter horses in his native  Idaho, but it has been six years since his last appearance on a Los Alamitos  quarter horse program, when he rode Bunny Bidajett to a third-place finish in  the Thoroughbred Jockey Invitational.  </P> <P> Trainer Bob Baffert, who has doubled as a quarter horse and thoroughbred  trainer during the past year, asked Stevens to ride Raised Toperfection in the  350-yard race.  </P> <P> "Gary had always told me that if I ever needed a rider in one of the big races  at Los Alamitos, he'd love to come over and ride," Baffert said Friday. "He  told me he'd always wanted to win a big quarter horse race. I told him he'll  have his work cut out for him winning this race, but he said no problem."  </P> <P> Raised Toperfection will be a longshot. The favorites in the Grade I event  figure to be Bay Meadows Futurity winner Takin On the Cash, Leo Handicap winner  Miss Strikin Jet and fastest Kindergarten qualifier Jacks Special Gem.  </P> <P> The winner of the Kindergarten will earn $84,740 for about 18 seconds' work.  </P> <P> The complete Kindergarten field with jockeys, from the inside post:  Splitsville, Lute Proctor; Ramtac, Roman Figueroa; Femmes Flam, Steve Treasure;  Cash N Cara, Alvin Brosette; Resolutions, Kip Didericksen; Ms Bush Whacker,  John Creager; Takin On the Cash, Danny Cardoza; Miss Strikin Jet, Bruce  Pilkenton; Jacks Special Gem, Eddie Garcia, and Raised Toperfection, Gary  Stevens.  </P> <P> The Kindergarten will be the second ride of the night for Stevens. Baffert has  also named him on Kite in the Sky, a $5,000 claimer, in the seventh race.  </P> <P> "If he wants to ride in a $200,000 race (the Kindergarten), he has to ride the  claimer; that's the price he has to pay," Baffert joked.  </P> <P> The Kindergarten will be the ninth race on the 12-race program. First post is  7:25 p.m.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian government has drafted a number of  measures to lower foreign investors' risks in Russia, Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin announced on Monday.    He told the constituent conference of the Council for  Foreign  Investment that the Cabinet had developed legal norms providing  for major changes in the taxing regime for foreign investors.  For instance, enterprises with joint Russian-foreign capital  will be freed from taxes for five years following registration;  limitations on the movement of capital will be lifted, while  enterprises founded entirely with foreign capital will be given  the right to own the land on which they are located.    Chernomyrdin said that changes in the domestic scene allowed  President Yeltsin to use his enormous reform potential much more  efficiently. As an example he referred to the packages of  economic decrees, aimed at accelerating reform and putting  industrial production on a new footing.    Chernomyrdin also said that the Russian economy was fully  working on the basic laws of the market economy and that its  response to market fluctuations had become more predictable. He  said that the external situation was favorable for overcoming  the crisis and for stable economic development.    He spoke about the progress made during the talks with the  London and Paris clubs on the restructuring of Russia's foreign  debt inherited from the Soviet Union, and about the conclusion  of the agreement on partnership and cooperation with the  European Union. He announced that during his recent visit to the  U.S. the first step was made towards granting Russia  most-favored-nation status.    The conference is attended by the leaders of major world  companies, including BASF (Germany), Coca Cola, Ernst &amp;  Young,  Procter &amp; Gamble (the U.S.), representatives of Japanese,  French  and British firms, and Russian business people.</p>

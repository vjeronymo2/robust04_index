			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Bellwinch cuts deficit to Pounds 97,000 Bellwinch, the Wembley-based builder, incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 97,000 for the six months to December 31, against a loss of Pounds 385,000 last time. Turnover was down slightly, from Pounds 6.01m to Pounds 5.44m, reflecting the continuing lack of volume in the housebuilding market, with completions in the period amounting to just 60 units against 61 for the comparable period. Interest payable fell to Pounds 63,000 (Pounds 500,000). Losses per share came out at 0.6p (11.7p).</p>

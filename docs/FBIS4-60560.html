			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] An Egyptian diplomatic source in Cairo today  revealed that the United States has embarked on contacts with  Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, in an attempt  to end the fighting and start a dialogue between the two parties  to the conflict in Yemen. The same source added that the three  Arab states can ensure indirect dialogue between northern and  southern Yemenis and that they have played a mediatory role  since the beginning of the crisis in Yemen. The source said  this mediation aimed at safeguarding Yemen unity without using  force. The same source said these three Arab states will ask the  northerners to agree on a cease-fire in exchange for canceling  the southerners' unilateral declaration of independence.    Sanaa took this clear U.S. stand seriously. In the wake of  this U.S. stand, Yemeni Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim  al-Iryani announced that the government in Sanaa is holding  contacts with some Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders to agree  on holding a dialogue. Al-Iryani, who is close to President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, added that his government is ready for a  cease-fire in exchange for YSP's recognition of Yemen unity,  which was declared in May 1990 and which has been abandoned by  the southerners.    Al-Iryani said: Following the secession decision, we cannot  deal, hold a dialogue with, or find a place in politics for YSP  Secretary General 'Ali Salim al-Bid or Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas, who was charged with forming the government of the  new southern state.    The second factor which could have influenced the Sanaa  decision is Aden's reiteration today that the southern forces  have regained the combat initiative from northern forces that  had infiltrated over the past three weeks of the fighting.  [passage omitted]    'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, who reiterated the northern forces'  control over Abyan, Lahij, and Shabwah Governorates, today  admitted that the objective of entering Aden by all means, which  was announced by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, no longer exists. He  said: There might not be a need to enter Aden, as the political  solution could be reached before this. The northern minister  said the Sanaa forces are maintaining their positions on the  eastern front, adding that the northern forces are now preparing  supply bases before moving to the east toward Hadhramaut, where  al-Bid has moved.</p>

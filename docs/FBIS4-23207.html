			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A meeting between government forces and the  Rwandese Patriotic Army [RPA] took place yesterday at the UNAMIR  [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] headquarterss in Kigali. The  RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] delegation was led by Colonel  (Frank Mugambage), while the government forces were represented  by Brigadier General Marcel Gatsinzi. Brig.-Gen. Andoh, deputy  UNAMIR commander, chaired the meeting. The meeting was aimed at  cease-fire negotiations. This was the second time the two  antagonistic forces met since fighting resumed early last month.  After seven hours of discussion, the meeting ended with no hope  of a cease-fire agreement in the next few days. [passage omitted]    During yesterday's meeting, the two sides agreed to continue  the exercise of exchanging civilians who are caught behind  frontlines. A similar meeting between government forces and the  RPA is expected to take place on Thursday [2 June] this week.</p>

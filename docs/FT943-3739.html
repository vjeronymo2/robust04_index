			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Sino-Portuguese company gets Macau contract A Sino-Portuguese company, Administracao de Aeroportos, has been awarded the contract for operational services at the new Macau airport. The venture is unusual in that ANA will hold a 51 per cent stake until December 1999, when Macau reverts to China, when it will concede two percentage points of its stake to the Chinese partner to give it a controlling interest. The contract involves all non-commercial operational management services, including air traffic and ground control management.</p>

			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SUIT HINGES ON TENANT-SCREENING SERVICE'S ACCURACY  </P> <P> Information in a Van Nuys-based tenant-screening firm's computer that listed  someone with the same name as a defendant in an eviction lawsuit prevented  Quida F. Johnson of Lake View Terrace from renting an apartment on Hubbard  Street in Sylmar.  </P> <P> Despite her unusual first name, there was another Quida Johnson, who lived in  Lynwood and had been a defendant in two 1986 eviction actions. And when the  prospective landlord asked U.D. Registry -- a firm that keeps records on more  than 1 million renters -- to check Quida F. Johnson's rental history in  September of that year, those eviction cases popped up on the computer screen.  </P> <P> She became, in the firm's argot, a "bingo," meaning that she had been  positively linked to an eviction lawsuit. But the only connection was her name.  </P> <P> Johnson, who drives a school bus, complained. She told U.D. Registry that she  had never been evicted and that she had never lived in Lynwood. But the agency  refused to tell her exactly what the inquiring landlord had been told. And she  could not clear her record.  </P> <P> Even after Johnson's attorney sent U.D. Registry a copy of her lease for the  Lake View Terrace apartment where she lived when the eviction actions were  filed, the company demanded more proof that she was not the same person,  according to court records.  </P> <P> </P> <P> July 17 Trial  </P> <P> Soon after, Johnson became one of nine plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed against  U.D. Registry and its owner and president, Harvey Saltz of Sherman Oaks, that  is scheduled to go to trial July 17 in Los Angeles Superior Court.  </P> <P> The plaintiffs claim that they were denied apartments because of incorrect or  prejudicial information sold to landlords by the registry, one of only two  large tenant-screening agencies in the nation.  </P> <P> A jury will hear testimony from as many as 80 witnesses and review more than  250 exhibits during a trial that attorneys estimate may last more than five  weeks to determine whether the plaintiffs suffered damages from U.D. Registry's  practices.  </P> <P> During two years of litigation over the lawsuit filed by a coalition of  public-interest law firms, issues relating to the regulation of the $30-million  tenant-screening industry and its standards of accuracy and accessibility were  decided by Judge Jerry K. Fields.  </P> <P> Fields has ruled that U.D. Registry, which now keeps its location secret, must  maintain an office where renters can review their files. He ruled that the firm  should be as tightly regulated as other investigative agencies, meaning that it  must verify the accuracy of information that it collects from landlords and  must update its files every three months. And he barred U.D. Registry from  linking a renter in any way to an eviction lawsuit based solely on a matching  name.  </P> <P> "A major concern in this case for us is to clean up the U.D. Registry's act and  to make them comply with the law, and they don't want to do that," said lead  attorney David S. Pallack of San Fernando Neighborhood Legal Services. "If this  case is going to be settled, they're going to have to change their practices."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2-Year-Old Lawsuit  </P> <P> But Sumner Cotton, an attorney for U.D. Registry, said most of the issues that  have emerged in the 2-year-old lawsuit are unrelated to the plaintiffs' claims  that they have been harmed by his client's practices. He said the lawsuit is an  attempt by the plaintiffs' attorneys to rewrite through litigation the laws  that they have been unable to change through lobbying.  </P> <P> "It's not a question of whether this is fair or unfair," Cotton said, referring  to how U.D. Registry operates. "The question is, 'What is the law?' And you  don't come into a court . . . and try to change the law to fit what you think  it should be."  </P> <P> Saltz said his firm has not broken any laws. "We have been operating within the  law and always have been, and I would be shocked if somebody now interpreted  the law to mean that we had not been," he said recently.  </P> <P> Cotton said he plans to appeal several of Fields' rulings.  </P> <P> Tenant-screening firms such as U.D. Registry began operating about 12 years  ago. They gather information on evictions, known legally as unlawful detainer  cases, from municipal courts nationwide and sell the information to landlord  clients the same way credit reporting agencies sell retailers information about  how consumers pay their bills.  </P> <P> With a rent default rate in California of about 15% and annual losses from  unpaid rent exceeding $1 billion, Saltz found an eager market for the  information he was selling.  </P> <P> A competitor who recently entered the market, William Bower of Contemporary  Information Corp. in Santa Clarita, credits Saltz with teaching apartment  managers that they needed more information about prospective tenants.  </P> <P> "In Harvey's defense, he's done a lot for the industry," Bower said. Saltz has  shown apartment managers that "if they know about tenants beforehand . . . they  won't have to evict them later," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Misused Information  </P> <P> But Bower and other competitors, as well as critics among tenants' advocates  and the Legislature, say Saltz and U.D. Registry have misused the information  that the registry sells and have given too little attention to that  information's accuracy.  </P> <P> Soon after U.D. Registry and similar companies went into business, state  legislators began hearing that the firms routinely disseminated inaccurate, old  information that unfairly denied housing to renters. Allegations also surfaced  that U.D. Registry, then known as the Unlawful Detainer Register, was gathering  "life-style reports" about renters' political affiliations, sexual habits and  other activities.  </P> <P> In court depositions, Cotton and Saltz have denied that the firm ever gathered  such information. But several industry sources said it was widely known that,  at least in the past, the registry asked landlords for such information on  tenants.  </P> <P> "For years Harvey used to report life-style information about tenants'  political affiliations, who comes and goes, stuff that has nothing to do with  their performance as tenants and payment of rent," said Grady Robertson,  president of U.D. Registry's main competitor, the Robertson Co., based in San  Diego.  </P> <P> After several unsuccessful attempts to regulate tenant-screening agencies, the  Legislature in 1983 passed legislation amending the California Consumer Credit  Reporting Act and Investigative Consumer Reporting Act to include such  agencies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Illusory Protection'  </P> <P> But that bill, which was supported by the California Apartment Assn. and the  tenant-screening agencies, provided only "illusory protection" for tenants,  according to a staff analysis written for the state Senate Housing and  Community Development Committee.  </P> <P> Robertson said the lawsuit may succeed in strengthening the protections.  </P> <P> "This business has tremendous social obligations attached to it, and Harvey  doesn't uphold those social obligations," Robertson said. "We think tenants are  customers . . . and that means they have to be taken care of. The legitimacy  and accuracy of our information is tremendously important."  </P> <P> A key point on which Saltz and Robertson differ, and the issue that brought  Quida Johnson into the lawsuit, is how much matching information is necessary  to link a landlord's prospective tenant to a computer record of an eviction  action.  </P> <P> Robertson said his firm requires that the prospective tenant must list the  apartment involved in the eviction lawsuit as a previous address before  reporting that the person was evicted from it.  </P> <P> Because tenants are aware that past evictions can make it difficult for them to  rent an apartment, they are wary about listing those addresses on rental  applications. As a result, Robertson said, only about 2% of landlord inquiries  result in a positive link between a tenant and a past eviction case.  </P> <P> The lawsuit's plaintiffs contend that Saltz's firm tells landlords about  eviction cases that may or may not be linked to the person about whom the  landlord is seeking information. According to court records, Cotton and Saltz  have denied that they report these "possible" cases.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Have Made Mistake  </P> <P> Cotton acknowledged that U.D. Registry may have made a mistake in Johnson's  case. But he said the law requires that the firm only strive for accuracy. He  said it doesn't require perfection.  </P> <P> But they acknowledge that a U.D. Registry credit operator "would indicate that  there is a case that might apply to the prospective tenant" and urge the  landlord to investigate further.  </P> <P> In other testimony, Saltz acknowledged that he was aware that some landlords  refused to rent to prospective tenants based on such vague reports. Fields has  ruled that practice illegal, and Cotton has said U.D. Registry is complying  with that ruling.  </P> <P> Another dispute based on the 1983 legislation relates to what cases could be  reported to landlords.  </P> <P> The legislation prevents tenant-screening agencies from telling landlords about  eviction lawsuits that tenants win.  </P> <P> Saltz and others in the tenant-screening industry interpret that ruling to mean  that information about any case ending short of a trial can be reported. For  example, if a tenant and a landlord settle a rent dispute and the landlord  decides to withdraw the lawsuit, the lawsuit would still be reported to future  landlords.  </P> <P> The plaintiffs' attorneys have argued that such an approach is prejudicial to  tenants and that such lawsuits sometimes are filed to harass a tenant.  Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who authored unsuccessful legislation in  1982 that would have strengthened controls on tenant-screening agencies, said  it is unfair to allow such lawsuits to remain on a renter's record.  </P> <P> "In this kind of an arrangement, a tenant is presumed to be guilty of something  merely because the report is filed," Katz said. He said existing law is  analogous to keeping files on people who are merely arrested -- but not  convicted -- of crimes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clouds Picture  </P> <P> Robertson sides with Saltz on that issue. He said filing an eviction lawsuit is  sometimes the only way to force a renter to pay. If screening agencies are  barred from reporting such actions, he said, it means that such firms cannot  provide to their landlord clients an accurate picture of tenants.  </P> <P> Fields ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on that issue, but reversed himself  June 22, saying he had misinterpreted the law.  </P> <P> A third issue relates to the ease with which a renter can find out what is in  his file. Presently, the plaintiffs argue, it takes a tenant several weeks to  arrange to see the files.  </P> <P> In addition, Pallack said, renters are told only what is in their personal file  and not whether information from the files of renters with the same or similar  names has been reported to landlords. Fields also ruled that practice to be  illegal.  </P> <P> But Fields did rule that U.D. Registry was not required to reveal the contents  of tenants' files to their attorneys.  </P></p>

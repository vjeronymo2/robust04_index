			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Seagram in the black with Dollars 379m for year Seagram, one of the world's leading drinks groups, said the recession in several key markets hurt operating results for the year ended January 31, but its performance in the US, Germany, Asia and Latin America strengthened significantly. Net income was USDollars 379m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, against a loss of Dollars 900m, or Dollars 2.38, a year earlier, which included a special charge of Dollars 1.374bn, or Dollars 3.64, reflecting accounting changes stemming from its investment in Du Pont, the US chemical group. Excluding the accounting changes and other one-time charges by 24.5 per cent-held Du Pont, Seagram's net income was Dollars 1.75 a share, against Dollars 1.61. Seagram, controlled by the New York and Montreal Bronfmans, reported sales and other income from its drinks business of Dollars 6.04bn for the year, against Dollars 6.1bn last time. Its Tropicana juice subsidiary showed a 19 per cent gain in operating profit to Dollars 102m. Fourth-quarter net income from the drinks and dividends equalled 45 cents a share, against 46 cents, while sales were little changed at Dollars 2bn. Results from Absolut Vodka, for which Seagram recently bought marketing rights, were not included. Earlier this month, Seagram raised its holding in Time Warner, the US multimedia giant, to 13.2 per cent.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Secure Trust climbs to Pounds 7.3m SECURE TRUST, the financial services group, reported a 9 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.71m to Pounds 7.32m for the year to December 31. The group's profits come from three main sources: fee income, from the provision of cash management services to consumers; commission income, from general and motor insurance broking; and interest income, from investments and loans. Fee income rose from Pounds 6.67m to Pounds 7.42m despite the number of customers being static. A contribution from Arbuthnot Fund Managers and an increase in the annual fee were responsible for the gain. Commission income rose by 24 per cent, from Pounds 5.32m to Pounds 6.62m, helped by the inclusion of OBC Insurance Consultants for a full year. Interest income fell from Pounds 3.56m to Pounds 3.42m, with the effect of lower interest rates being partly offset by a bigger loan book. The company has recently purchased Peoples Bank for Pounds 4.8m. Mr Henry Angest, chairman, said that the acquisition would expand the range of products, which the group could offer. Gross income was Pounds 17.5m (Pounds 15.6m) and pre-tax profits were struck after administrative expenses of Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 8.84m). Earnings per share rose 8.9 per cent to 34.3p (31.5p). The final dividend is increased to 9p, making a total payment of 13.5p (12p). Mr Angest said he was confident the group would make sound progress in 1993.</p>

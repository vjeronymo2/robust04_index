			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / K-factors and their knock-on effects: Water prices over the next five years will be determined by today's announcement The water industry regulator will today unveil the rate at which he will allow the 31 water and sewerage companies of England and Wales to increase prices over the next 10 years. Most analysts are expecting Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of the Office of Water Services (Ofwat), to aim for an average annual weighted increase, between 1995 and 2000, of more than 1 per cent above inflation - the formula known as the K-factor. Such an outcome, says Mr Graeme Moyse, of stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson, would allow the 10 water and sewerage companies to maintain dividend growth at an attractive 3 per cent per annum above inflation for the next five years. It is almost certain Ofwat will re-examine price increases in 1999, rendering comments on the last five years of the period under review virtually irrelevant. While the K-factor has been the focus of publicity, Mr Byatt's decisions on the amount of capital spending to sanction for each company will be equally important. Just over a year ago, water companies submitted market plans to the regulator showing obligations believed to total between Pounds 20bn and Pounds 25bn for the sector as a whole. Talks between the Department of the Environment and Ofwat are thought to have reduced the number by at least a quarter. It will become clear today which companies are set to benefit most from those discussions. For individual companies, a high capital expenditure allowance would imply a high K-factor. However, Mr Byatt has said he intends to place more of the funding burden on the companies. So, a tough approach would be to sanction a large amount of capital spending, but be stingy with the price increase. Companies, already expecting flat earnings over the next five years, would be forced to eat further into their own resources to fund the spending. Such an approach from Ofwat would rely on harsh efficiency targets, also to be announced today. Those trying to determine a list of winners and losers in today's announcement are unlikely to get much guidance from the companies or from Ofwat. Individual companies were informed of their own K-factors yesterday, but they will be keenly interested to see how they have fared compared with others in the sector before they comment. If some feel hard done by, they have two months to appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Thus, the uncertainty which has plagued the sector for the last year is unlikely to evaporate overnight.

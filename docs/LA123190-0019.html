			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ALBANIANS STREAMING INTO GREECE IN MASSIVE EXODUS;  </P> <P> MIGRATION: AT LEAST 500 SEEK POLITICAL ASYLUM. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN  DECADES, JEWS ARE BEING ALLOWED TO EMIGRATE TO ISRAEL.  </P> <P> Hundreds of Albanians streamed across the Greek border Sunday in what may be  the biggest one-day exodus since Albania's Communist government promised  democratic reforms.  </P> <P> A police spokesman in the Greek border village of Filiates said it appeared  that the Albanian government had opened its mountainous frontier with Greece.  </P> <P> "There can be no other explanation," he said. "A mosquito couldn't get across  the border before."  </P> <P> At least 500 Albanians arrived on Sunday, and all were seeking political  asylum, he said.  </P> <P> "It looks like there are whole villages crossing -- it's a madhouse up here,"  the police spokesman said.  </P> <P> "Our police station has become a refugee center," he added. "We don't know what  to do with all these people."  </P> <P> In Albania, meanwhile, an official spokesman indicated that for the first time  in decades, Albanian Jews are being allowed to emigrate to Israel or elsewhere.  Vladimir Prela, head of the Albanian Foreign Ministry's press office, said: "If  they want to live in Israel, they can do so."  </P> <P> Prela, reached in the Albanian capital, Tirana, by telephone from Vienna, did  not confirm reports that a plan for the emigration of about 500 Albanian Jews  has been worked out by Jewish groups or governments in the West.  </P> <P> He suggested that Jews were being allowed to leave under a general easing of  restrictions on travel abroad for all Albanians. He estimated that there are  about 1,000 Jews in the tiny Balkan nation of 3.3 million.  </P> <P> So far this month, more than 1,000 people have fled into Greece along the  countries' frontier. Most have been ethnic Greeks, and they are automatically  granted political asylum.  </P> <P> Border police officers said they had reports that about 3,000 more Albanians  are expected to try to cross the 100-mile border area by tonight.  </P> <P> Refugees who are not ethnic Greeks and not eligible for immediate political  asylum were to be bused to the U.N. Lavrion refugee center, 40 miles southeast  of Athens.  </P> <P> Albania became a hard-line Stalinist state at the end of World War II, and it  has only recently started to adopt democratic reforms embraced by other Eastern  European countries last year.  </P></p>

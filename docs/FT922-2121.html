			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Backer sought to save London zoo LONDON ZOO, the world's oldest zoo and one of the capital's leading tourist attractions, is to close in September unless a private backer can be found. The zoo, which occupies 36 acres in the north part of Regent's Park, has been in financial difficulties for some time. Attendances so far this year have been up to 30 per cent below last year and the zoo has a deficit of Pounds 2m on annual running costs. Sir John Chapple, president of the Zoological Society of London, which runs the zoo, said closure was the only option 'that will ensure the survival of the society as a whole'. He said discussions were continuing with interested parties, but he refused to name them. A government bail-out is unlikely after it refused further grants last year and told the zoo to put its house in order. As part of a royal park, the zoo is technically the property of the Queen, but is managed by the Department of National Heritage and leased to the society for a peppercorn rent. It has nine listed buildings. They include the Mappin terraces, built for bears in the 1920s with a donation from jewellers Mappin &amp; Webb; and the penguin pool, designed in the 1930s by Berthold Lubetkin. The oldest listed buildings, dating from the first half of the last century, include the camel and giraffe houses, both by Decimus Burton. The listed buildings need repairs estimated at Pounds 15m. Under the terms of the lease the society is responsible for repairs, but last year the government agreed to assume responsibility if the zoo surrendered the site. The National Heritage Department is not legally bound by planning regulations, but it said it would seek planning permission in the normal way if it decided to demolish one or more of the buildings. Options for the site are limited by regulations for royal parks. The department said yesterday there was 'no question at all' of office or residential development, and it was 'most unlikely' that a commercial development such as a theme park would replace it. The most likely options appear to be reversion to general park use, or a scaled-down zoo. The zoo's likely demise was first announced last year, but after a cost-cutting programme it broke even in March and cancelled closure plans. It has cut jobs over the past few years, and the remaining 150 staff are likely to be made redundant. Dr Jo Gipps, zoo curator, estimated that it would take six months to find alternative homes for the animals so that the breeding programme could continue. He was confident none would have to be destroyed. Some larger animals may be moved to the society's other site at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park, Bedfordshire. London Tourist Board said the closure would not have a significant impact on tourism as few people went to London just to visit the zoo. In 1991 the zoo was the ninth most popular attraction in and around London, with 1.1m visitors.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: Sale masks profit fall at Goodman Fielder AN ABNORMAL profit from the sale of a UK-based financing company saved Goodman Fielder Wattie, Australia's biggest food group, from a fall in earnings for the first half to Decem-ber. The company yesterday declared a 14.8 per cent rise in earnings to ADollars 77.0m (USDollars 57.80m) from ADollars 67.1m on an advance in sales to ADollars 2.25bn from ADollars 2.16bn. The interim dividend is being held at 5 cents a share. However, the result masked a deterioration in the company's continuing businesses, reflecting the recession in the Australian economy. Operating profits fell by 9.5 per cent to ADollars 82.8m before an ADollars 22.1m abnormal profit, compared with ADollars 4.9m, resulting mainly from the sale of Benford, an inter-company financing vehicle used in Goodman's abortive 1989 raid on Britain's Ranks Hovis McDougall. The Benford sale was announced earlier this year; however, details of the transaction remain obscure. Mr Michael Nugent, chief executive, described the result as disappointing but in line with his prediction at last year's annual meeting. 'The directors believe that trading conditions will continue to be extremely difficult and that it is unlikely there will be a recovery in consumer demand of any substance in the current financial year,' he said. 'The directors believe that a modest improvement in operating profit before tax and abnormal items should be achieveable for the full year.' Only two of the company's six main operating divisions achieved increased pre-tax earnings in the half - European Foods and Ingredients. The baking and milling, poultry, grocery and frozen food divisions sustained earnings falls of between 5 per cent and 35 per cent. The result followed a tax credit of ADollars 2.9m compared with a ADollars 31.8m charge. Interest costs eased to ADollars 69.2m from ADollars 75.7m.</p>

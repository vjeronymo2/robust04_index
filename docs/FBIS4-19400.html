			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 18 (AFP) -- French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe on Monday [18 April] called for talks between the  United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations  to reach a common position on Bosnia.    Juppe urged that a study group be set up by the four in  Geneva in the next few days.    The French minister said the Moslem enclave of Gorazde,  which  was declared a safe haven by the United Nations, was now under  Serbian control. His statement came as the town was under  renewed heavy Serb shelling after tanks rolled into the enclave  on Sunday.    Juppe added that France favoured "neither abandonment nor  escalation."    He said the Geneva study group proposal aimed at defining a  common approach to apply pressure jointly to relaunch peace  negotiations.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Winter chills The UK stock market was always likely to pause for breath early this year after its Christmas sprint, but it has tired more quickly than some ex-pected. Yesterday's news of a 0.1 per cent rise in the underlying inflation rate in December was worse than predicted. Some dispiriting corporate news from normal stalwarts such as Guinness has unsettled sentiment. The market is beginning to twitch at the prospect of the much-rumoured wave of rights issues, to say nothing of concerns over the government's Pounds 1bn-a-week borrowing programme. As a result, the FT-SE 100 index has now shed 3 per cent since the beginning of the year. The outlook may be drab for a while to come. One development that might drive it higher is a cut in interest rates. But after yesterday's inflation figures the chancellor may not have the nerve to pre-empt any moves from the Bundesbank, especially since the pound has slipped to DM2.50. Any premature move could put pressure on his inflation targets in the second half of the year. The one consolation is that bottom-up earnings forecasts from industry sector analysts are more optimistic than the prevailing top-down projections from economists. If the corporate reporting season reveals that the former are right, the market might take heart. In the meantime, the best turnover may come from switching out of the highly-rated recovery stocks into defensive sectors.</p>

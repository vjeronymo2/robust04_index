ITAR-TASS correspondents learned this from sources in the  aforementioned ministries. The closely related problems of  health, ecology, and sanitary and epidemiological welfare, which  cannot be solved without constant cooperation, will thus be  divided into the spheres of influence of the different  supervisors.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Adia plans rights issue of SFr250m ADIA, the Swiss-based international employment services group, will have to dig deeply into shareholders' capital to finance an estimated 1992 loss of SFr203m (Dollars 139m) and intends to raise new capital through a rights issue, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. The group made sharply-reduced profits of SFr25m in 1991 on a turnover of SFr3.2bn. The company will propose a capital increase 'of at least SFr250m' through a rights issue. Most of this will come from the conversion into equity of a SFr200m loan made to Adia last year by its majority shareholders, Mr Klaus Jacobs, the Swiss industrialist, and Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus, the German retailing group.</p>

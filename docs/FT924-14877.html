			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Ford faces challenge FORD yesterday appeared to be facing a challenge by dealers to its rules preventing them from selling rival makes of car within 30 miles of any Ford outlets they operate. A potential showdown has been triggered by the decision of Currie Motors, a hitherto Ford-only London dealer group, to cut its ties with Ford rather than have its plans to develop into a multi-franchise group frustrated. Currie's move was being seen within the trade as offering encouragement to other groups to prepare their own challenges to the Ford restrictions. Meanwhile, Mr Peter Vardy, chairman of north-east dealer group Reg Vardy, whose operations include two Ford dealerships, has met Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, to urge that the Commission press on with moves to eradicate manufacturers' restrictions on dealer competition. Even though Ford has made clear that all agreements on Currie outlets would be terminated, Currie has served notice to Ford that it is switching six of its dealerships to selling other makes, starting on November 1.</p>

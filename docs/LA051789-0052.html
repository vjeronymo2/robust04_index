			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WITNESS DENIES WRIGHT PROMISED FAVOR TO S&amp;LS  </P> <P> A former savings association officer on trial for conspiracy on Tuesday  contradicted the earlier testimony of a colleague who had said that House  Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) once promised to block a key piece of legislation  in return for political contributions from Texas savings and loan executives.  </P> <P> "I never heard that. Jim Wright never told me that," John W. Harrell, former  chief executive officer of Commodore Savings Assn., told a federal court jury.  </P> <P> Harrell and two others are being tried on charges that they conspired to  violate campaign finance laws by funneling illegal corporate contributions to  the East Texas First Political Action Committee.  </P> <P> The testimony of Harrell and other witnesses at the two-week-old trial is of  interest to the House Ethics Committee, which has requested a transcript as  part of its investigation into Wright's conduct and his personal finances.  </P> <P> Harrell contradicted May 5 testimony by Donald R. Farmer, one-time chief  financial officer of Commodore, who had said that Wright pledged to block  legislation unfavorable to the Texas savings and loan industry in 1985 if  executives of 10 thrift associations would contribute a total of $250,000 to  help another Texas Democrat who was running in a special congressional  election.  </P> <P> Harrell's testimony, which supported statements by Wright himself, was  significant because Farmer had claimed that Harrell told him of Wright's  promise.  </P> <P> But Harrell said that Wright, at two meetings with thrift officials, merely had  expressed support for the beleaguered industry and had told executives that "he  was much aware of our problems."  </P> <P> "Did he ever guarantee that a piece of legislation would be tabled?" asked  Harrell's defense lawyer, William Hill, referring to a bill that died in  Congress that would have greatly restricted the investment powers of  state-chartered thrifts.  </P> <P> "I never heard that," Harrell replied.  </P> <P> Congressional ethics experts have said that such a promise by Wright would  clearly have violated congressional standards of conduct.  </P> <P> Harrell's account substantially agreed with testimony given Monday by Robert  Hopkins, a co-defendant who was Commodore's board chairman. The trial is  expected to conclude this week.  </P></p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Orange County aftermath hits bourses Reaction to the Orange County derivatives debacle in California led to a sharp sell-off at the long end of the US bond market; German bunds moved from consolidation into decline and Continental equity bourses from mundane to morose, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT traders mooted a switch from banks to automotive stocks as the Dax index rose 8.72 to 2,055.60 on the session, but a lot of heads were retracted as it eased to an Ibis-indicated 2,044.04 after hours. Turnover fell from DM5.3bn to DM5.1bn. Gains of over a percentage point for both Daimler and Volkswagen almost disappeared, with the former unchanged at DM747 by the end of the afternoon, and the latter only DM2 ahead at DM422. With BMW down DM5 to DM750, this left the automotive trio roughly parallel with the big three banks. Deutsche Bank fell DM3.30 to DM732.60 after its 10-month figures, Dresdner recovered a token 60 pfg to DM409.10 and Commerzbank, a touch oversold on Tuesday, rose DM2.10 to DM322.10. Mr James Cornish at NatWest Securities said it was not the time to get into auto stocks; and he did not agree with predictions of an early rise in German interest rates. 'Germany is two years behind the UK in the economic recovery process,' he said, 'and UK interest rates did not rise until last September.' ZURICH was unable to hold on to early gains after Wall Street's weak opening and the SMI index finished 4.8 lower at 2,584.3, off a high of 2,601.9. Banks remained under pressure, with investors still switching between the big three and into insurers, amid worries about sluggish 1994 earnings. Bank Vontobel downgraded its 1994 earnings forecasts for the three this week but raised its 1995 estimates. UBS bearers dropped SFr12 to SFr1,122, SBC gave up SFr8 to SFr362 and CS Holding ended SFr5 lower at SFr536. Swiss Re, recommended by a private Geneva bank, picked up SFr2 to SFr791. A SFr100 fall by Interdiscount to a low for the year of SFr1,640 was attributed to a bearish note on the electronics retailer by Credit Suisse. PARIS ended with a rise of just 0.89 at 1,969.84. Turnover was unexceptional at FFr3.2bn. In the automotive sector, Michelin slipped FFr2.70 to FFr197.20 on unconfirmed reports that the stock had been downgraded, while Valeo, which supplies parts to the industry, fell FFr10.70 or 4 per cent to FFr255.30. Valeo has fallen some 20 per cent since it reached a year's high in the middle of January, but has improved 8.5 per cent since its 1994 low in June. Nikko Europe, earlier this month, revised upwards its 1994 profits forecast for the company to FFr995m, and estimated profits at FFr1.15bn for 1995, based on an expected improvement in the European car market. MILAN had many absentees ahead of today's national holiday, as the Comit index gave up 1.76 to 613.60. Credito Romagnolo rose L491 or 2.8 per cent to L17,900 as speculation continued that the offer from Credito Italiano at L20,000 a share, approved yesterday by the Bank of Italy, still faced a challenge from Cariplo or IMI. Italiano slipped L13 to L1,581 and IMI was L10 lower at L9,621. Cariplo has made no public comment but IMI yesterday kept its options open, although it ruled out a lone bid for control. Telecom Italia declined L67 to L3,965 after a government committee postponed a decision on liberalising analogue mobile phone tariffs and lowering its licence fee. Autostrade preferred stock jumped L55 to L2,032 after the public works minister said ordinary shares in the state controlled motorways group could be listed next year. AMSTERDAM searched around to find direction and closed with the AEX index off 1.09 at 410.09. Hoogovens, down 90 cents at Fl 75.40, attracted further positive comment from Goldman Sachs, which remarked that, in spite of the stock's recent underperformance, the group remained one of the best in the sector, lifting its 1994 earnings forecast to Fl 6.55 per share from Fl 6.00. MADRID, in a week shortened by holidays on Tuesday and today, played construction stocks for gains as the general index eased 0.45 to 304.21. Turnover was Pta22.2bn, boosted by block trades. Dragados rose Pta50 or 2.4 per cent to Pta2,085. WARSAW blamed a delayed reaction to Monday's announcement of a new 0.2 per cent stock transaction tax from January 1 as the Wig index closed 343.7 or 4.3 per cent lower at 7,702.5. After the tax was accepted by parliament, the Wig index dropped to a 1994 low of 6,716 on November 16, but last week it pushed back to 8,177 on revived optimism.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cairo correspondent Shefi Gabay, Avino'am Bar- </F> Yosef, Hemi Shalev, Gad Shimron, Yo'av Limor, Amir Gilat, and  ITIM]    [Excerpt] Last night, we (a few Israeli journalists) asked  PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat: "What is your reaction to the  murderous attack perpetrated in Israel today?" 'Arafat bowed  his head for a second. Suddenly he turned his back and walked  out of the room without saying a word.    Senior sources in Jerusalem last night expressed serious  disappointment with the PLO's feeble reactions to the terrorist  attack in 'Afula and the fact that 'Arafat has not yet condemned  it.    Arab sources close to Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]  claim that 'Arafat relayed a positive message to Hamas in the  wake of the attack. According to these sources, in a talk with  various activists, the PLO leader voiced a certain measure of  support for the attack but noted that due to the negotiations  and the political situation, he could not say as much in public.  The message was relayed to Ibrahim Ghawshah, the Hamas  spokesman in Jordan, but was leaked in the process.    Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation to the  peace  talks with Israel, said that the lethal attack in 'Afula proves  the need to sign the agreement soon. "This is one of the  reasons we are pushing for the agreement to be signed: to put  an end to the killings." [passage omitted]</p>

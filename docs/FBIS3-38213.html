			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 28 (AFP) -- The German  Bundesbank is ready under certain conditions to lower its  official interest rates and still has some margin to reduce  long-term rates, a senior official said Friday [28 January].    Gerd Haller, German secretary of state for finance, said at  the World Economic Forum here that the Bundesbank's action  depends on the evolution of Germany's monetary supply and wage  negotiations.    "The Bundesbank is prepared to bring down short-term  interest  rates, but it depends on other factors," Haller said.    He said that although long-term rates are at an historic  low,  "there is still some room for long-term interest rates to go  down."    Germany is under pressure from its European partners to  lower  its interest rates, seen as a source of currency instability in  and a damper on efforts to stimulate economic growth on the  continent.    British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, whose  country jumped from the European Community currency grid in  September of 1992, said the European Community needs monetary  stability to make its single market work.    "What we need in the European Community is exchange-rate  stability if we are to get the best out of the single market,"  he said.    Clarke said the best means of assuring this is making  efforts  to bring the various economies closer, adding, "We need to make  sure we coordinate what we are doing."    "The challenge will be to keep, as we come out of the  recession, the stability of exchange rates that we have at the  moment," he said.</p>

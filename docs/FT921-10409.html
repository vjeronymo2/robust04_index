			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool After an uncertain start to this week's Australian wool sales, prices have moved steadily ahead. Strength is again most apparent in middle and broader categories. New Zealand wool was also dearer for practically all categories in the crossbred offering there, by around 5%. After a slow start to the second half of the selling season demand appears to be picking up and clearences to the trade have improved. The Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator reached 585 on February 5, some 4 cents higher than a week ago, after softening to 576 on February 3.</p>

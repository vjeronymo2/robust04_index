			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WITHOUT A TRACE;  </P> <P> SEARCH FOR LOST MARINE FLIERS FINDS FRUSTRATION  </P> <P> No movement could be seen on the baking desert sand Wednesday except for the  hulking shadows of two U.S. Marine helicopters, gliding in tandem like giant  green insects a scant 200 feet aloft.  </P> <P> All day long, the Tustin-based helicopters scoured a 500-square-mile area just  north of Lake Havasu, searching in vain for any sign of a lost Marine  observation plane and its two-man crew. The OV-10A Bronco, based at Camp  Pendleton, vanished without a trace last Thursday while on a routine practice  flight over the Southern California desert.  </P> <P> "I say UFOs kidnaped 'em," Capt. Mike Griggs, co-pilot of one of the  helicopters, said in exasperation as he maneuvered his olive-green CH-46 Sea  Knight back toward the Marine Corps Air Station at Tustin following Wednesday's  search, which yielded no fresh clues.  </P> <P> The question of what happened to the twin-engine Bronco, so far, is a mystery  to Marine Corps officials.  </P> <P> They know only that pilot Sergio Vivaldi, 29, of Port Chester, N.Y., and his  observer, 1st Lt. Joel Piehl, of Bismarck, N.D., departed Camp Pendleton at  11:30 a.m. last Thursday on what was to be a three-hour reconnaissance flight.  The plane never returned. The crew made no radio contact. Air-traffic-control  radar was unable to track them.  </P> <P> Since then, about 150 planes have spent more than 800 hours scouring every nook  and cranny over 324,000 square miles of Southern California desert between the  Mexican border and Nevada. They also have checked witnesses' reports of black  smoke, possibly from a plane, seen billowing in the towering mountains above  Palm Springs.  </P> <P> But, as of Wednesday, the Marines were no closer to finding the plane -- which  did not carry an emergency transmitter as most civilian planes do -- than they  were when the search first started.  </P> <P> "Your guess is as good as mine," Maj. Gen. Royal Moore Jr., commander of the  3rd Marine Air Wing based at El Toro, said in a briefing before more search  efforts continued Wednesday.  </P> <P> Although military aircraft disappear from time to time while on practice  flights, Marine officials say that most are located within a matter of days, if  not hours. With the OV-10A Bronco now missing for so long, Moore said the  disappearance has few precedents. He also said the Marines may be forced to  call off the search if something is not turned up soon.  </P> <P> "We can't keep this up forever," the general said, adding that neither he nor  any of the other Marines involved in the search want to give up. "Our real  concern is that we're leaving somebody in the battlefield. We have two Marines  that we can't find."  </P> <P> Moore said, however, that there was little more new ground to search. Marine  officials, working out of a command post at the El Toro Marine Corps Air  Station, already had divided the Southern California desert into  30-mile-by-30-mile quadrants, then arranged for individual military planes and  helicopters to canvass each tract.  </P> <P> This was done, first, by other OV-10 Bronco planes, which flew from north to  south at altitudes of 500 feet, beginning at the Arizona border and working  back, Moore said. The planes were followed by teams of slower-flying  helicopters, assigned to cruise from west to east at 200 feet, Moore said.  </P> <P> Wednesday marked the completion of the search through all the quadrants. The  two remaining quadrants -- located on both the California and Arizona sides of  the border north of Lake Havasu City -- were scoured by six Tustin-based  helicopters, flying in formations of two.  </P> <P> With that task completed, Moore said he intends to concentrate the search on  the San Bernardino and San Jacinto mountain ranges near Palm Springs. Military  planes, assisted by volunteers from the Civil Air Patrol, already have been  looking without success throughout those mountains.  </P> <P> Marine officials say it appears increasingly likely that the plane crashed and  the crew members either did not survive or were seriously injured. That  speculation is based on the fact that there have been no distress signals  picked up from the pocket-held emergency beepers that all Marine airmen are  required to wear in the event they go down. Moore said signals from the beepers  can be detected 150 miles away.  </P> <P> The task, then, has been to find where the plane may have crashed.  </P> <P> "The trouble with this area is it is extremely rough (terrain)," Moore said. "I  could lose probably 100 OV-10s in there."  </P> <P> Flying over the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains while en route to the  search area Wednesday, Maj. J.V. (Ace) McLain, public affairs director for the  3rd Wing, peered from his helicopter at brush-choked canyons and ravines below.  Neither he nor three other crew members aboard could pick out anything of  importance.  </P> <P> "This is like looking for a needle in a haystack; only we don't even know where  the haystack is," McLain said.  </P> <P> While it seemed unlikely that the missing plane had veered as far east as the  Arizona border -- more than 200 miles away from Camp Pendleton and at the outer  limits of the Bronco's three-hour flying range -- the helicopter crews left no  stone unturned in a grueling, six-hour search. Although the two target areas  were distinguished as "Echo" and "Zulu" by the Marines, the stark, sun-baked  terrain looked much the same.  </P> <P> The CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters piloted by Maj. Stan Wells and Maj. Mike  Minnehan were responsible for the far northern part of the "Echo" quadrant,  stretching from Needles on the south to Laughlin, Nev., on the north and 30  miles west from the Colorado River. Wells' crew, riding in "Knightrider 50,"  included co-pilot Griggs and the crew chief, Cpl. Paul Romano. Minnehan's crew,  riding in "Knightrider 53," included the co-pilot, Capt. Mike Griggs, and crew  chief, Cpl. Todd Hanna. The helicopters flew in formation -- five rotor-lengths  apart -- at speeds of about 65 m.p.h over flat desert lake beds dotted with  sagebrush and pocked by washes. At slower speeds, they followed the contour of  jagged mountain ranges. The helicopters cleared some peaks by a margin of less  than 50 feet.  </P> <P> "It really is pretty, and fun to fly in," Griggs remarked to Wells as their  helicopter glided precariously close up an Arizona mountainside studded with  saguaro cacti.  </P> <P> But the Marines weren't here on a sightseeing trip and they never let the  purpose of their mission get far from mind.  </P> <P> With so much terrain to scan, the search grew monotonous. The quadrants were  examined by the helicopters flying first in one direction, then in another and  another until their area was completed. It took a total of seven "passes," for  instance, to clear the "Echo" sector. For the Marines wearing stifling flying  suits, the search was also made more grueling by 109-degree temperatures, for  which the only relief came in two refueling breaks at the air-conditioned  airport at Lake Havasu City.  </P> <P> But even in their discomfort, the Marines were reluctant to call off the search  as daylight waned.  </P> <P> "These (missing airmen) are our brothers in arms," McLain said. "They would  have done the same for us."  </P></p>

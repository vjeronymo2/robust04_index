			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CREDENTIAL TEACHERS?'  </P> <P> As a potential nominee for becoming a member of the National Board of  Professional Teaching Standards, I applaud your editorial "Credential  Teachers?" (July 31). As a teacher for nearly 20 years, I personally face the  future everyday in my high school classroom. Thus your statement that teachers  hold one of the most important jobs in this country is not only indicative of  your continued support for education, but also increases the value of what we  teachers do for our society.  </P> <P> If the teaching profession is going to command the image and respect accorded  other professions, we must have a certification program that not only tests for  subject knowledge, but also for how effective we are in relating to students. I  have seen teachers with a limited subject knowledge imbue within their students  an intense desire for learning and understanding while, on the other hand,  there are some teachers with a profound understanding for their subject who  fail to impart that great knowledge upon their students. The trick is to find  individuals who can do both effectively . . . especially for the future of our  nation.  </P> <P> Last spring, Times' Sports Section columnist Jim Murray wrote that no wonder,  as a society, we find foreign goods and services better than those made in this  nation when we allow our educational systems to disintegrate. At least the  Carnegie Forum is taking steps to alleviate the severe future shortage of  qualified teachers so that our nation will enter the next century prepared to  meet those future scientific and technological challenges.  </P> <P> JOHN PAWSON  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

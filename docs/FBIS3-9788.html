Addressing a news conference at the university, Goncz  stressed that politically "Poland and Hungary want to become a  part of Europe," but culturally "the two countries have always  been its part."    "We will submit European Union full membership motions at  the  same time which proves that we are the two pillars of the  European stability," he said.    Speaking about a cooperation between Poland and Hungary,  Goncz stated that it has interesting prospects, as "future  Europe is not only the Europe of nations but also of regions."    The Hungarian head of state added that the Visegrad Group  states, including Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and  Slovakia, should go together on the road to a new Europe and  that this cooperation does not need to be institutionalized.</p>

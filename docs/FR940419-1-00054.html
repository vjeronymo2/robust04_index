			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The major changes in the proposed rule would allow for broader, more flexible programs aimed at increasing the capacity of resident entities to participate significantly in all aspects of public housing operations while simultaneously permitting further economic uplift opportunities, to the extent permitted under section 20 of the United States Housing Act of 1937. Section 20 requires that all activities funded under it be related to improved living conditions and public housing operations. (See &sect;&sect;905.967 and 964.205.) The Department is now proposing amendments to section 20 to permit funding of a broader range of tenant development activities to include activities that are not necessarily related to resident management or housing authority operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current regulation on the Tenant Participation and Resident Management Program is proposed to be renamed ``Tenant Participation and Tenant Opportunities in the Public Housing Program.'' The proposed regulations would include the Tenant Opportunities Program (TOP), which replaces the Resident Management Program under subpart C in the current regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised program was created in response to requests from resident councils/resident management corporations and HAs across the country for a more flexible program to address the needs in their communities related to encouraging increased resident management activities as a means of improved living conditions and public housing operations. The revised program is designed to prepare residents to experience the dignity of meaningful work; to own and operate resident businesses; to move toward financial independence; to enable them to choose where they want to live; and to assure meaningful participation in the management of their housing developments. The authority for the TOP program comes from section 20 of the 1937 Act, which discusses resident management of public housing. Section 20(f) authorizes technical assistance and training. Financial assistance in the form of technical assistance grants is provided by the Secretary to RCs/RMCs to prepare for management activities in their housing development (hereinafter referred to as TOP technical assistance grants). Technical assistance grants are available for ``the development of resident managed entities, including the formation of such entities, the development of the management capability of newly formed or existing entities, the identification of the social support needs of residents of public housing projects and the securing of such support.'' TOP technical assistance grants can enable residents to manage their developments or portions of their developments. The results are significant and multifaceted. For example, resident managed activities have resulted in economic development, resident self-sufficiency, improved living conditions, and enhanced social services for residents (e.g., child care and other youth programs). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Resident Management Program would continue to be an option to resident councils/resident management corporations who are interested in performing management functions in one or more projects of a HA. None of the requirements for the resident management program will be changed. However, some of the provisions are being moved to other regulations, or HUD documents. For example, the requirements under subpart C (&sect;964.39) governing the operating subsidy, budget, operating reserves, etc. are proposed to be moved to 24 CFR Part 990_Annual Contributions for Operating Subsidy. The Department believes these provisions of &sect;964.39 are more appropriately placed in that regulation. Also, the requirements for the RMC management contract contents are being removed from subpart C and are contained in HUD Notice PIH 93&hyph;56 (HA) which also includes a model management contract. This contract must be followed unless HUD approves a requested change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart A would be expanded to add policies on partnerships between HAs and residents. For example, HAs are required to provide a duly elected resident council office space and meeting facilities, free of charge, for the purposes of conducting resident activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, the section on definitions (&sect;964.7) would be amended by removing terms such as ``resident council'' and ``resident management corporation'' and expanding the definition of these terms to provide clarity on the eligibility of a voting member of the resident council and establish the frequency of elections for resident management corporations. The definitions for other terms such as ``project'' and ``tenant participation'' are eliminated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

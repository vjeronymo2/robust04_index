			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM will usher in 'classless' honours MR JOHN MAJOR is expected today to underline his commitment to a more meritocratic society with a Commons announcement on reform of the royal honours system, Philip Stephens writes. The changes will signal an end to the automatic and carefully graduated award to Whitehall officials of honours from the Order of the British Empire to a knighthood. The armed forces, meanwhile, are thought to have agreed that medals recognising gallantry by individual soldiers, sailors and airmen should no longer be differentiated according to the rank of the recipient. Generals, admirals and vice-marshals on the forces' active list may also have to give up their automatic knighthood. Mr Major plans also to merge the British Empire Medal - the traditional mark of royal recognition for service to the community by members of the working class - with the award of Member of the British Empire.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (6): Better times ahead - A look at the regional industry Over the past few years, the European regional aircraft manufacturing industry has been suffering from a severe shortfall in orders as a result of the recession which has bitten deeply into airline balance sheets. That, in turn, has led to curtailed aircraft re-equipment programmes, resulting in reduced aircraft production rates and labour layoffs as a means of survival. But while the market remains difficult, and highly competitive, there are signs of better times ahead. Airlines this year are expected to return to a collective profit, albeit a slim one of about Dollars 1bn world-wide, which by no means compensates for the Dollars 15.6bn losses on international scheduled services alone over the past four years. Moreover, the long-term forecasts indicate that as the recession fades, traffic growth is likely to be resumed at an average of around 5 per cent a year through the next 10 to 20 years. This, in turn, is likely to result in a renewed demand for regional aircraft of all types - jets ranging between about 50 and 120 seats, and turbo-propeller airliners up to about 70-80 seats. Avro International, the regional jet airliner manufacturing subsidiary of British Aerospace, is forecasting a demand world-wide for 3,000 jets in the 65-120 seat range over the next twenty years, to 2013. Smaller jets, such as the Canadair RJ of around 50-plus seats, will also have a share of the market. Such a market could be worth in excess of Dollars 60bn. This forecast is generally agreed by Boeing of the US, which builds the 737 series of short-range twin-engined jets (with more than 3,000 sold to date in nearly 30 years of service) and is now planning not only a new series of 737s but also a 'new small airplane', now being defined in detail. These forecasts are based on the fact that many current trends in the air transport industry provide opportunities for the growth of the regional aircraft market. Underneath the main medium-to-long-range trunk-line routes there is a vast network of complementary 'commuter and feeder' operations linking hundreds of smaller towns and cities with each other as well as with the major ''hub'' airports in capital cities. These are mostly short-haul flights, ranging from about 250-300 miles. The European Union's 'Third Package' of aviation liberalisation measures, introduced on January 1, 1993, including freedom of market entry and access to new routes, is still in its comparative infancy (unlimited 'cabotage' - the right to operate unfettered services in other countries than one's own - will not become effective until April 1, 1997), but it is clear that as the recession fades and traffic grows, the larger airlines operating from the main hub airports will require increasingly frequent regional services to feed them. In turn, short-haul regional routes are increasingly being seen as a specialist operation. Says Avro: 'There is already a significant move towards large airlines divesting the regional networks to affiliated carriers operating small regional jets, such as the RJ Avroliner family, which can provide more efficient and profitable services on the shorter, thinner routes. 'At the same time, congestion at the major hubs will stimulate traffic growth at the smaller airports. Hub by-passing services will increase, and this again will lead to greater demands for regional jet aircraft. 'Older aircraft types with significantly higher maintenance costs, lower productivity, and inability to meet increasingly stringent noise regulations will be phased out of the regional routes, even allowing for some re-engining and 'hush-kitting'. This will lead to an increasing demand for new and more efficient types.' Avro says that the largest market for regional jets will continue to be North America (42 per cent), followed by Europe (21 per cent), and Asia/Pacific (15 per cent). However, the big problem confronting all the regional jet and turbo-propeller aircraft manufacturers is that the supply of available types is already vast, and far more than the market can really absorb. This means that the already intense competition among manufacturers will become fiercer, with some builders perhaps being forced to quit the market, which no-one really wants to see - the airlines like to have a wide range of choice in their equipment purchases. The alternative is for a rationalisation of the manufacturing side, through new joint ventures supported by mergers or other forms of strategic alliances in the industry. Some have already occurred - for example, the 51 per cent stake in Fokker of Holland acquired by Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) of Germany - and over the immediate future there may well be further significant realignments in the industry's overall global structure. This past summer, Deutsche Aerospace suggested that British Aerospace, together with Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy, could be offered stakes in Fokker, as a step towards forming a European regional jet manufacturing consortium, particularly targeting new projects for the future. Such a move would safeguard the continued development of those existing companies' product lines - the Avro RJ series and the Fokker 100 and smaller Fokker 70, and the turbo-propeller ventures of BAe (through Jetstream) and of Aerospatiale and Alenia through Avions de Transport Regional (ATR). It would also seek to avoid conflict with Airbus (in which DASA, Aerospatiale and BAe are all partners), which is itself marketing vigorously its own 130-seat A-319, due to enter service in the spring of 1996. The prime objective of such a new European consortium, were it ever to materialise, would probably be a new small 110-seat aircraft, called the Future Advanced Small Airliner (FASA), which would be designed to compete directly with Boeing's own New Small Airplane (NSA) project. Boeing has begun detailed studies on the NSA, in co-operation with Japan Aero Industry (JAI) and China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation (CATIC), with a view to an eventual joint venture that could seize especially a significant slice of the rapidly expanding Asia/Pacific regional jet aircraft market. Also on the international front, Aerospatiale has offered to join Chinese and South Korean companies in developing a 100-seat regional jet for the Asia/Pacific market. At the same time, although earlier talks between Avro and Taiwan Aerospace on collaboration failed to get off the ground, both companies remain interested in the rapidly growing Asia Pacific market. But because of their already strong background in the regional aircraft markets, the possibility of a significant consortium of European companies emerging with global competitive capability should be taken seriously, especially if widened to include other European aircraft manufacturers, such as CASA of Spain and SAAB of Sweden. Linked in such a way, the European industry could prove a powerful competitor for Boeing. The Europeans already have immense experience - collectively they meet virtually every regional airline need from small 10-seat twin turbo-prop airliners up to 100-plus-seat twin-jet aircraft. There is no lack of innovation, and many of the companies involved are looking ahead with new ideas for either product improvements or entirely new aircraft models. The problem in setting up any new consortium would be determining not just the financial contributions, but also to what extent each partner would be prepared to sacrifice cherished individual concepts in favour of united ventures. Many in the European aerospace industry believe that putting together such a consortium is the only way ahead, and the abandonment of some concepts, however painful, is to be preferred to a continuation into the next century of the fragmented activities which could lead to negligible individual market shares and the likelihood of profits for no-one.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Former managers 'misled' group: Metallgesellschaft supervisory board claims it was misinformed The former management of Metallgesellschaft, one of Germany's biggest industrial groups, altered documents and gave misleading information to its supervisory board, the chairman told shareholders yesterday. Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank director who has been chairman of the Metallgesellschaft supervisory board since March last year, claimed that the former management had taken actions 'so patently harmful to the group' that they may face criminal charges. He was speaking to about 2,000 shareholders of the Frankfurt-based metals, mining and industrial conglomerate at a heated special meeting. The meeting, which continued until last night, finally approved a DM3.4bn (Pounds 1.32bn) rescue package negotiated by the group last month after it nearly collapsed. The crisis was triggered by speculative trading in oil futures by MG Corp, the group's US trading subsidiary, which gave rise to losses of DM2.3bn. The supervisory board was heavily criticised at the meeting by some shareholders who called for the resignation of Mr Schmitz and other members. It was the first time that Mr Schmitz had responded to widespread criticism of the supervisory board's role in failing to prevent the debacle. Mr Schmitz rebutted the charge that the supervisory board had failed properly to monitor Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the group's former chief executive who was dismissed on December 17 last year along with the group's finance director. Four other directors left at the same time. Mr Schmitz claimed that the level of supervision was constantly being raised in 1993. 'It was nonetheless during this time that that the company massively expanded its oil futures operations, which the management board had a duty to report,' Mr Schmitz said. 'It did not do this. Moreover the supervisory board was deceived with deliberately falsified information and was therefore prevented from intervening in time.' He said he then had no grounds to disbelieve Mr Schimmelbusch. It was now known that minutes of management board meetings, provided to Mr Schmitz from the end of May last year at his request, had been tampered with, he claimed. '(These documents) had been censored in important passages such that they did not correspond to the the actual course of the meetings or to the essential message of the original board meeting minutes,' Mr Schmitz explained. 'In the monthly reports, business developments at MG Corp were reported in passing and without any indication of peculiarities, such as the increasing commitment of funds for futures in the US.' Oil futures commitments increased eightfold to 160m barrels in the 1992-93 financial year. It was unclear when the oils business became a serious financial risk, Mr Schmitz said. Mr Schimmelbusch had not informed him of a liquidity squeeze until December 3 last year, he said. ICI profit rise, Page 25 On the defensive, Page 31</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> BUSINESSMAN MAY SUE OVER GAS STORAGE  </P> <P> A Santa Paula businessman may file a lawsuit in a bid to overturn approval by  the City Council of a neighbor's request to store propane tanks on his  property, a lawyer said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The council endorsed the request of Empire Gas Co., which operates in the  Lemonwood Industrial Park, at a meeting Monday.  </P> <P> Roger Atherton, who owns adjacent property, has claimed that a city ordinance  outlaws the storage of explosive materials and petroleum products -- which  include propane -- in the area. Atherton said Empire Gas' plans would  jeopardize his plans to develop his land.  </P> <P> Marc L. Charney, attorney for Empire, now based in Oxnard, minimized potential  hazards at a council meeting Monday. He said service stations have been  permitted in similar zones. Charney said propane is less dangerous than  gasoline.  </P> <P> "An explosion is unlikely because propane is heavy and disperses quickly,"  Charney said. He noted that the Empire Gas facility is "95% complete" and urged  the council to permit the company to proceed.  </P> <P> City Atty. Phillip H. Romney said Tuesday that propane storage violates no  ordinance because the council chose to allow the use through approval of a  conditional use permit.  </P> <P> The council, in endorsing earlier action by the city Planning Commission,  closed off any further possibility of appeals within the city.  </P> <P> Atherton's lawyer, W. Stephen Onstot, said his client is considering a lawsuit  to challenge the city action.  </P> <P> According to Onstot, the Empire Gas operation, which would store propane for RV  tanks and home delivery, originally applied for heavy manufacturing zoning. He  said the city was using a conditional use permit where a zone change from  manufacturing to heavy manufacturing was required.  </P> <P> "You don't have to be an expert," Onstot told council members, "just read the  ordinance."  </P> <P> Atherton, who hopes to build a facility on the adjacent property, said propane  storage next door would limit the sorts of businesses that could rent.  </P> <P> "We're not sure what we're going to do," Onstot said, "but the matter isn't  over yet."

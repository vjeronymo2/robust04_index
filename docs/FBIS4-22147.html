Andreyev] </F>   [Text] Radical changes in the military-political situation  in Europe, the result of deep socio-economic reforms in East  European countries and CIS states, have made adjustments to the  coalition military doctrine of NATO. The "new strategic concept"  adopted at a session of the North Atlantic alliance in Rome in  1991, which actually is the coalition military doctrine, defines  the basic requirements for the bloc's armed forces, taking into  account the changed situation in Europe. Its most important  guideline is revision of the priority directions of NATO  activities, and the emphasis is being shifted from the military  to the political area. The bloc leadership's approach to  defining a security threat has also changed, which is expressed  in the renunciation of the traditional interpretation of the  "threat from the East" as the main destabilizing factor. The  term threat has been replaced by the relatively neutral concept  of risk. This means primarily the military might of Russia and  the CIS, as well as the instability of the situation in  countries of Eastern Europe, crises and conflicts outside the  European continent, and the danger of the proliferation of  nuclear weapons. Therefore, one of the bloc's basic functions is  considered the monitoring of crises, including activities to  prevent them, which assumes a combination of measures of a  political and military nature.    The NATO leadership has planned by the year 2000 to conduct  a  radical reform in the area of organizational development of the  joint armed forces, which along with their technical  re-equipment will ensure optimal defense sufficiency for the  bloc. In doing so, main efforts are directed at creating small  mobile groupings of forces able to respond adequately to various  types of threats.    The substance of the planned military reform in NATO  essentially comes down to reducing the numerical and combat  strength of permanent readiness forces with a simultaneous  increase in the role of reserve components and improvement of  the system of mobilization deployment.    During the course of the force reorganization, three main  components of NATO's general-purpose forces are being formed:  Reaction forces, main defensive forces, and reinforcement  troops. In the estimate of the bloc's military experts, the  transition to such a three-component structure will make these  forces more flexible, which will ensure multiple variations of  their combat employment -- from autonomous use of limited troop  groupings in local conflicts to successive involvement of all  components when there is a threat of large-scale military  operations being unleashed.    The bloc leadership assigns an important role to NATO ground  forces in accomplishing those military-political and military  tasks which may arise in the future. This article devotes main  attention primarily to the development of this branch of the  armed forces.    Reaction forces are viewed as a combat-ready  component of the NATO Armed Forces intended for priority use in  the event of crisis situations. Structurally, the reaction  forces include "immediate reaction forces" [IRF] and "rapid  deployment forces" [RDF].    The "immediate reaction forces" will be created on the basis  of NATO's existing mobile forces, which includes eight  reinforced battalions (two from Germany and one each from  Belgium, Great Britain, Italy, Canada, the Netherlands, and the  United States) and one company (from Luxembourg). During a  threatening period and for the duration of exercises, the  headquarters of mobile ground forces is brought up to strength,  and an army aviation group and an engineer company (from the  United States), an artillery headquarters, an air support and  reconnaissance center, signals and electronic intelligence  battalions, logistic battalions, a military police subunit (from  Great Britain), a communications center (from Germany), and a  helicopter squadron (from Great Britain and Germany) are  deployed. Combat and logistic support subunits are attached to  mobile ground forces battalions. Two German airborne battalions  are reinforced by an artillery battery and two companies (signal  and medical). The total numerical strength of mobile ground  forces is about 10,000. Armament includes 125 guns and mortars  of various calibers, 198 ATGM's, and 56 antiaircraft weapons. In  the future, it is planned to transfer to them separate subunits  from Denmark, Spain, and Norway and thus bring the total  numerical strength to 14,000-15,000 people and the number of  battalions to 11.    It is believed that employment of the IRF will have two  aspects: Military-political and military. In the first instance,  they act as a deterrence factor; the multinational composition  makes it possible to view their participation in combat  operations as a joint reflection of an attack on the block  member countries. The military aspect involves using the IRF as  an advance guard to support the advance and deployment of the  "rapid deployment forces" on the threatened axis. The RDF must  be ready for combat operations in 72 hours.    The "rapid deployment forces" will become the basis of the  reaction forces and will consist of formations of all branches  of the NATO Armed Forces, which will provide them complete  independence when organizing and conducting combat operations.    The basis of the RDF ground forces is to be a allied army  corps [AAC], which includes 4-5 divisions. It may include an  armored division and mechanized division from Great Britain, and  an air-mobile division and mechanized division of mixed  composition. The experience of NATO Armed Forces exercises of  recent years shows that an RDF air-mobile division may include  one air-mobile brigade each from Belgium, Great Britain, and the  Netherlands and an airborne brigade from Germany (Exercise  Certain Shield-91). A mechanized division may include Greek,  Italian, and Turkish brigade. A fifth division (presumably a  tank division) is to be transferred from Germany's Bundeswehr.  The final composition of the AAC has not yet been determined.  The RDF can be additionally built up by 5-6 divisions from  European NATO countries. The composition of the assigned forces  will depend specifically on the situation taking shape and the  scale of the possible military conflict in the initial stage of  which it is planned to use the RDF. The readiness period of  large units and units included in these forces by the start of  combat employment in the intended areas of operation will be  7-14 days, depending on the remoteness of the predicted areas of  probable crisis situations.    The following requirements are imposed on large units and  units of RDF ground forces:    --High combat readiness as a most important indicator of  their capability for rapid assembly, advance (transfer) to  intended areas of operation, and successful accomplishment of  combat missions. To do this it is necessary to have a high level  of manning and training, as well as the conduct of intensive  training of staffs and troops with the practice of different  variations of combat employment of the RDF.    --High mobility is the main characteristic of the RDF which  provides the capability for advancing a considerable distance in  a short time period, rapid operational deployment, and conduct  of highly mobile combat operations regardless of the terrain  relief at any time of day and in various climate conditions.  This will be achieved by introducing into the RDF highly mobile  large units and units equipped with air-transportable armament,  providing them sufficiently with air and sea transport, and also  creating stockpiles of supplies.    The main defensive forces (regular and mobilized formations)  in the new structure will comprise the basis of the NATO Armed  Forces groupings. They are considered the first operational  echelon when conducting large-scale military operations. By the  year 2000 these forces may number 34-36 divisions.    In the assessment of NATO experts, decreasing the danger of  the sudden unleashing of war in Europe and also the formation of  a buffer zone with the CIS countries and Russia will enable  command authorities not only to reduce the number of large units  in the bloc's armed forces but also decrease the level of combat  readiness and the strength level of divisions and separate  brigades of the ground forces.    The basis of the main defensive forces will be  multinational allied army corps, which it is planned to  subordinate to the command authorities of the allied ground  forces. Deployment of the multinational formations is to be  accomplished as part of the RDF and the main defensive forces in  the European Theater of War. In peacetime, the headquarters of  the multinational large units and formations are to be manned  with personnel from the armed forces of the countries that are  participating in creating these units. Large units and units of  the allied army corps will be subordinate to the national  commands and may be transferred under the command of allied  headquarters just for the period of conducting measures of  operational and combat training, and also in crisis situations.    The interest demonstrated in NATO towards multinational  formations is explained more by political than military  considerations, which creates a firm basis for preserving the  permanent presence of foreign troops, including U.S. Armed  Forces, on the territory of Germany. In this regard, during the  majority of the fall exercises held in 1992, not only did they  practice variants of conducting combat operations, but they also  studied the structures and combat capabilities of the  multinational large units and formations being formed. Special  attention was given to organizing coordination both at the  operational echelon and the tactical level. In particular,  within the framework of the "Wekkerer Schwabe" command and staff  exercise of Germany's II Army Corps, the concept of combat  employment of an army corps of multinational composition was  studied. It was one of the largest measures of this nature in  the Central European Theater of Military Operations. In addition  to German troops, staffs of large units and units of the U.S.  and French armed forces participated in it.    The basic goals of the exercise involved testing and  updating  plans for combat employment of large units and units of the army  corps jointly with allied troops in operations of the initial  period of a war, practicing the principles of combat use of  multinational formations and large units, and also questions of  training staffs and command personnel for conducting offensive  and defensive combat operations.    According to preliminary assessments of the NATO allied  armed  forces command authorities, large units of a multinational  composition will have sufficiently broad combat capabilities.  Today, the bloc's leadership has begun practical implementation  of plans for creating multinational AAC's. Already this year two  AAC's will be formed (two divisions is each--from the U.S. and  German armies). In all, it is planned to deploy up to six allied  army corps in the Central European Theater of Military  Operations. They will include large units and units from the  ground forces of Belgium, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, and  the United States. However, full implementation of these plans  for creating AAC's requires a number of organizational-technical  measures aimed, in particular, at solving problems of  compatibility of communications systems, overcoming the language  barrier, and also differences on the level of training staffs  and troops of the participating countries.    Reinforcement forces will include regular and  mobilized formations in European NATO countries and those being  transferred from the United States and Canada, which are not  part of the main defensive forces. They are intended for  reinforcing the first operational echelon and also for creating  operational and strategic reserves in a theater of military  operations and a theater of war as a whole. In the assessment of  military experts, the reinforcement forces can number 18-20  divisions. Periods of mobilization and redeployment will be 30  days or more.    Questions of improving the command and control system occupy  an important place within the framework of the planned  reorganization of NATO Armed Forces in the immediate future.  Emphasis is placed on increasing centralization of command and  control at the operational level primarily by eliminating  intermediate command and control entities and creating new,  larger coalition commands and headquarters. In particular,  commands and headquarters of the Northern and Central army  groups have been disbanded this year, and a command and  headquarters of allied ground forces in the Central European  Theater of Military Operations have been created based on them.    NATO's military-technical policy for the next 10-15 years  calls for creating and improving new models of armament for the  ground forces and also upgrading existing types of weapons.    Fourth-generation tanks having great firepower and improved  armor protection are scheduled to enter service in the late  1990's. In addition, building up the defensive and fire  capabilities and increasing the maneuverability of large units  of the ground forces will be accomplished by equipping them with  new models of infantry fighting vehicle, artillery systems, MLRS  multiple-launch rocket systems, and third-generation ground- and  helicopter-based antitank guided missile systems with a firing  range of up to 5 km, which according to their characteristics  will be considerably more effective than existing ones.    On the whole, an analysis of the new concept adopted in NATO  shows that the bloc's leadership intends to conduct a radical  reform of the ground component of the NATO Armed Forces. This  reform, in addition to technical re-equipping of the forces with  new armament, will ensure the alliance an optimal defense  sufficiency. The main efforts are directed at creating small and  highly mobile force groupings capable of reacting adequately to  different types of threats (risk).

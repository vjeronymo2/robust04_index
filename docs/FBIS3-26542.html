[video shows close-up of a seated Chen Yun shaking hands  with Shanghai CPC Secretary Wu Bangguo and Shanghai Mayor Huang  Ju.]    Comrade Chen Yun happily received the comrades in Shanghai  and had cordial conversations with them.    Comrade Wu Bangguo briefed Comrade Chen Yun on what Shanghai  did in 1993 in launching reforms, opening up to the outside  world, developing the economy, and maintaining social stability;  as well as on what Shanghai will do this year.    Comrade Chen Yun was very satisfied with the information. He  said: The work Shanghai has accomplished is very good -- not  just good, but very good. [video shows medium close-ups of a  seated Chen Yun having talks with seated Wu, Huang, and other  Shanghai officials in what appears to be a guest room. Chen  Yun, dressed in a light gray Mao suit, looks frail but alert and  reasonably healthy with fair complexion. He occasionally  gesticulates with his right hand to emphasize a point and his  head moves about freely and naturally].    Comrade Chen Yun added: Since the Third Plenary Session of  the 11th CPC Central Committee in 1978, the nation's economic  development has been very fast, and the people's living  standards have improved significantly. This is a fact everybody  can see. Of course, there are still many difficulties and  problems. To deal with these difficulties and problems, we  must, first of all, safeguard and strengthen [wei hu he jia  qiang] the authority [quan wei] of the party Central Committee  with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. If the Central Committee  does not have the authority, nothing significant can be  accomplished, and social stability cannot be maintained.    Comrade Chen Yun said: The Central Committee has decided to  implement the revenue-sharing system this year so that central  authorities can gradually pool the financial resources they  need. Shanghai and other localities have supported this idea.  This shows that you have taken the interests of the whole into  consideration. I am very pleased about this.    Comrade Chen Yun said: The situation of the country shows  that today's economic work should pay special attention to one  issue, namely the size of our construction projects must be  compatible with the national strength. Moreover, there should  be some leeway to maneuver. Meanwhile, we must focus our  attention on achieving higher economic returns. [video  continues to show medium close-ups and close-ups of Chen Yun  speaking and Wu Bangguo nodding his head and smiling in apparent  agreement. While Chen speaks he gesticulates with one hand,  then the other, switching what appears to be a rubber ball when  changing the gesticulating hand. Chen's head moves quite  naturally both laterally and horizontally]    In conclusion, Comrade Chen Yun stressed: The current  central leading group is a strong and capable one. Its  performance is good. People throughout the country must work  with one heart and one mind, unite as one, and fully implement  the series of policies and measures which the party Central  Committee and the State Council have adopted for exercising  macroscopic regulation and control. When we do this, China is  very likely to boost its economic development, and socialist  China will have a bright future.    Other Shanghai party and government leaders who wished  Comrade Chen Yun a happy Spring Festival today were Chen Zhili,  Wang Liping, and Chen Liangyu, as well veteran comrades Chen  Guodong, Hu Lijiao, and Wang Daohan.</p>

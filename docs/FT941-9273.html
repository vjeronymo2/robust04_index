			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Taskforce set up to uncover abuse in equity market An organisation to detect equity market abuse was announced by the Securities and Investments Board yesterday, at the same time as it opened a debate on UK market regulation. The new Market Conduct Regulators Group will be charged with bringing coherence to varied regulations. The City believes its establishment, with the issuing of a discussion paper on control, may lead to radical changes in the way markets operate. The SIB, the chief regulatory body for the UK securities markets, said unified surveillance was needed of all markets where UK equities are traded, so that abuse - such as share price manipulation for profit - can be detected and punished. The SIB is concerned that users' confidence in the market has been shaken by reports of abuse and misconduct, while relatively few criminal prosecutions have succeeded. It wants to develop 'explicit standards of market integrity and investor protection'. Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, said it hoped first to tackle detection of market abuse. He said: 'It is realistic for us to address (market abuse) quickly. If the market can be seen to be taking it seriously, it will be to everyone's advantage.' The Market Conduct Regulators Group will have the task of making sure there are no gaps between regulations and that they define and deal with market misconduct. It will help to produce rapid responses to new market practices and consider their propriety, and aid criminal prosecutions. The taskforce is to be headed by the SIB and to include representatives of the various self-regulatory bodies. The SIB is also worried that the pace of change, such as the proliferation of marketplaces and the development of derivatives, such as futures and options, has overtaken regulations dating back to the Financial Services Act of 1986. In its discussion paper, the SIB posed questions to market practitioners and users on how they felt the secondary market in equities and derivatives should be controlled. It asked whether current practices, which allow some information about transactions to be kept secret, can lead to market manipulation, and whether investors' interests might be better served if more information was available. Those issues are far more complex than that of market abuse and will need much more discussion before answers can be formed. Mr Large acknowledged that significant commercial interests were at stake. Greater disclosure of information might deter people from Trading, reducing the liquidity of markets prized by most practitioners. One institutional investor favoured greater transparency, although admitting that it might work against his interests. 'As a large institution, we benefit from the lack of transparency because it means we can get rid of large blocks. But why have some trades reported and others not?' The London Stock Exchange welcomed the discussion paper. Mr Michael Lawrence, chief executive, said it provided 'a helpful forum for consultation'.

Should the prices at which market makers offer to buy and sell shares from each other through inter-dealer broker screens be made available to investors? 2. Should there be a single bulletin board for the display of all prices at which a given security is traded anywhere in the UK? 3. Should derivative transactions relating to 3 per cent or more of a UK company's listed shares be made public? 4. Should the current rules under which market makers can hide the prices at which large blocks of shares are traded for certain periods be changed or scrapped? 5. Should there be disclosure of short selling by investors in a particular stock in the run-up to a large placing of that stock in the markets?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

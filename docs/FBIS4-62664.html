			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Agafonov: "Karimov Also Decides To Visit </F> Japan"]    [Text] Tokyo -- Islam Karimov, president of sovereign  Uzbekistan, together with his wife Tatyana Akbarovna and  accompanying officials, has arrived in Tokyo on an official  visit. This is the first-ever top-level contact between Japan  and Uzbekistan -- previously this country simply did not exist.    He is the third president from the former Soviet expanses of  Central Asia to visit Japan in the last few months. The season  was opened by the visit to Tokyo by Kirghiz [Kyrgyz] President  Askar Akayev in April last year; this April saw the arrival of  Nursultan Nazarbayev.    The Uzbek leader's itinerary is one of sightseeing tours,  although it is also replete with the necessary and traditional  protocol events -- a reception and dinner with the emperor,  short talks, and lunch with the prime minister. There is a  meeting with business circles, and a long and varied tour of the  sights. In fact, the working part of Karimov's four-day visit  to Japan is essentially restricted to one event. Bilateral  contacts have so far been scanty, and there is virtually nothing  of substance to talk about.    The Japanese knew in advance that the guest would be asking  for money and other aid in various forms, while talking about  the Republic's potential wealth. Incidentally, everyone  willingly recognizes Uzbekistan's raw-materials potential, but  there seems to be some hesitation about providing material  confirmation of this in the form of investment, loans, and  participation in joint-venture projects. Several Japanese  business delegations have visited Uzbekistan of late, studying  market conditions and assessing Uzbekistan's potential to meet  Japanese requirements -- but no large-scale program for Japanese  participation in boosting Uzbekistan has yet been arranged. Of  course, the first-ever visit to Tokyo by an Uzbek president will  not go unmarked, and there will be some economic "souvenirs" to  take away, but people in the know believe that the  Japanese-Uzbek dialogue during the summit trip will probably not  go beyond symbolism. It is believed behind the scenes in Tokyo  that the phrases "it is important to start small and not rush"  and "a long journey begins with a single step" will be to the  fore in the upcoming Japanese-Uzbek talks.    The Japanese media are preparing their audience in their own  way for the important Uzbek guest's visit. Thus, for instance,  the newspaper ASAHI featured a long article by Yusuke Matsuzaki,  who is the senior and the only Japanese adviser to the Uzbek  Vneshekonombank [Foreign Economic Bank]. The adviser openly  notes that in the run-up to his pension he was looked upon as  "unnecessary garbage" in Japan, but in Uzbekistan he can still  show what he is capable of at age 60. The adviser talks about  the promising plan to produce teflon frying pans in Uzbekistan  with Turkish assistance, and writes about loans from the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, on whose  distribution the Uzbek Vneshekonombank is currently working.  Another newspaper -- MAINICHI -- published a leader to mark  Karimov's arrival, reporting on Uzbekistan's natural resources,  its proximity to Turkey, and the fact that it is important for  Japan to correctly develop relations with the former Soviet  Central Asia. And the newspaper noted that, although diplomacy  should be determined by cool calculation and proceed on the  basis of Japan's own interests, in the case of Central Asia in  general and Uzbekistan in particular they should make allowances  and permit a bit of romance to enter the equation. The romance,  in MAINICHI's opinion, lies in the fact that Uzbekistan lies  astride the old "Silk Road" -- so expanding the dialogue with it  will be romantic and touching.</p>

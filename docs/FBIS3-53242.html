Dr.  (Ibrahim Hasan Al-Bakr), the special envoy of the ICO secretary  general, had extensive talks with representatives of various  Afghan organizations in Peshawar today. They exchanged views on  all aspects of the ongoing war and new prospects for the  establishment of peace. The ICO special envoy urged rival  factions to stop the fighting immediately.    Meanwhile, reports from Afghanistan say that sporadic  clashes  have occurred between government forces and the Dostam militia  in the northern and southeastern areas of Kabul. It is reported  that the Dostam militia's jet planes bombed various places.    PPI says that Afghan President Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani  has declared that the current war in Afghanistan has entered a  decisive stage, which will continue until victory is achieved.  Talking by telephone from Kabul to a group of Lahore  journalists in Peshawar, Rabbani said that the war is not a war  to secure power, but a war between the religious and what he  called communist forces. The Afghan president claimed that the  Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], the Dostam  militia, and Mojaddedi are aligned with Hekmatyar, while all the  other big and small organizations are against them. He said  that the current war has been forced on the Afghan Government  and is harming the Afghan people.</p>

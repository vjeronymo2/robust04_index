			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The Spanish Blue Helmets are paying  close attention to the developments of the Bosnian crisis and  more specifically to the possibility of NATO air strikes on Serb  positions as our foreign minister, Javier Solana, is about to go  to Bosnia. On the eve of Solana's visit [2 February], our  correspondent Pedro Fernandez Cespedes is in Medjugorje.    [Cespedes] Good evening. The Spanish Blue Helmets stationed  in Bosnia-Herzegovina would find themselves in a tight corner if  the air strikes decided upon by the United Nations were to go  ahead. The head of the Madrid Group [Spanish UN contingent],  Colonel Luis Carvajal, makes no secret of his doubts about how  effective these air strikes would be in opening Tuzla Airport or  in allowing the replacement of Canadian Blue Helmets in  Srebrenica.    [Begin Carvajal recording] We have a defense capacity, that  is true. We have arms and we have the means, but they are  limited of course. We do not have air cover, other than that  provided by the planes themselves, we do not have antiaircraft  defenses. [end recording]    [Cespedes] This afternoon Col. Carvajal visited the city of  Mostar with General Cot, head of UNPROFOR in former Yugoslavia.  Both of them met the mayor of Mostar and there was not a single  reference made to the charges made 28 January against the  Spanish Blue Helmets. The problem is over.</p>

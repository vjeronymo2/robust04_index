			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yu Youxian (0060 0645 0341): "Adhere to the Set </F> Direction and Deepen Reforms To Achieve a Phased Change in Press  and Publication Work"]    [Text] The press and publication industry is a key sector  of spiritual production in our country. The press and  publication sector plays the role of organizing spiritual  production, synthesizing it into products, directing the  products into circulation, and making sure they achieve the  proper social and economic effects through the market and  exchange. One key trait of press and publication work is the  close and inseparable integration of spiritual and material  production and social and economic effects, the process itself  being subject to the laws of spiritual, as well as material,  production. This fundamentally determines that the development  of press and publication corresponds with reforms in economic  structures and stages of economic development, and that it is  identical with the requirements and progress of socialist  spiritual civilization. Development and changes in press and  publication are inevitably tied with development and changes in  the socialist cause as a whole.  <H5>  1. The Press and Publication Sector Faces Phased Changes. </H5>   Our country's press and publication sector has developed  rapidly over the last 10 years or so, along with the progress of  reform and opening up. Statistics compiled by UNESCO show that  China's publication has leaped to the world's forefront in scale  and variety. Unprecedented development in the press and  publication sector has profoundly influenced the spiritual state  of our country and played an important role in promoting reform  and opening up and economic construction. At the same time, the  press and publication sector, and especially publication, is  facing significant changes after decades of rapid development.  In terms of stages of development, the press and publication  sector is moving from a stage distinguished by actual increases  in total volume to that distinguished by high quality and  efficiency. In terms of means of management, the press and  publication sector is moving away from detailed  administrative-style management to law-guided and macroscopic  management. In terms of structural reforms, the press and  publication sector is changing from traditional nonprofit-making  management into industrial management on its way toward a modern  corporate system. Changes in these three directions are all  difficult and complicated processes moving at different paces  and with different focuses, while being all interconnected and  mutually constrained and interacting. At the center of these  three changes is the shift of the press and publication sector  away from gross growth in volume to high quality and efficiency.    Such a phased change is determined by the following two  factors: First, the pursuit of the two civilizations is making  higher demands on the press and publication sector, which cannot  strengthen its power and intensity in serving the two  civilizations without improving its quality and economic  efficiency. Second, the press and publication industry would  not be competitive enough to survive and develop if, now that  they are facing the market, they did not improve quality and  economic efficiency and rationalize their internal resources.  This phased change in the press and publication sector, which  has already happened and will continue in the future, has been  basically in step with the entire reform and opening up and with  the change in economic construction from total volume growth to  rising economic returns in our country. The development of the  press and publication sector has its own peculiarity and  complications and is not identical with similar situations  experienced in economic construction. But it is true that the  two are, on the whole, similar to the extent that both are  moving away from total volume growth toward high quality and  efficiency. Strategically speaking, this phased change is  further adjusting and strengthening the power of the press and  publication sector in preparation for greater breakthroughs to  come. We must be clearly aware of and value this ongoing change  in the press and publication sector, and create conditions to  promote it. There are wide-ranging problems and possibilities  in the press and publication sector, and there are many things  requiring our energy and attention. Overall and from a  macroscopic point of view, this is a strategically significant  matter.    To achieve an even greater change from total volume growth  to  high quality and efficiency, the press and publication sector  must, subjectively, make great effort and acquire the necessary  objective conditions.    The objective conditions we currently possess are: First,  the general background for such an important change is there. In  their "Decisions on Certain Problems Concerning the Creation of  a Socialist Market Economic System," the central authorities  specifically brought up the problems of overall balance,  structural optimization, and healthy development; and in  particular the fact that rural economic development should be  characterized by "structural adjustment and raising economic  returns." An increasingly popular economic concept over the  last two years has been the "awareness of the quality of the  national economy." There has been some change in the tendency  to pay too much attention to economic rates at the expense of  economic quality, to habitually expand the external scale  instead of tapping into internal resources, and to neglect  quality efficiency. The people, party, and state are all  demanding quality, and they have designated a year as "quality  year" and organized events such as a "long distance walk for  quality." All these indicate that the general background for  the change in economic construction from total volume growth to  high quality and efficiency is in place, providing an excellent  opportunity for promoting phased changes in the press and  publication sector. Second, there is a general appreciation of  the importance and urgency of improving the quality and  efficiency of the press and publication sector. Society is  calling for improvement in quality and an effort to overcome  ordinariness and shoddiness and sweep away junk culture. The  press and publication sector has realized the seriousness of the  problem and is working to solve it. One key Marxist viewpoint  is that when there is a general awareness of a problem, there  are already a popular forum and objective conditions for solving  this problem. Third, some units and localities have made some  fruitful explorations in moving toward and adapting to the  market, forming their own methods of operation and operating  mechanisms, and have accumulated some experiences in raising  quality and efficiency. Thanks to the effort of leading  departments to champion the idea and the work of all the news  workers and publishers, the change in the press and publication  sector from total volume growth to high quality and efficiency  is now underway. The only problem is that we have not  explicitly characterized the change, much less declared and  promoted it.    However, the conditions described above are far from enough  to effect a greater scope of change in the press and publication  sector from total volume growth to high quality and efficiency.  We need to make a greater and varied effort. Here we need  directional guidance, the assurance of law, and a deepening of  reform to find a way out; we need to employ more party and state  power and coordinate it with market forces to put in place a  management system and operating mechanism capable of being  adjusted to socialist economic development, meeting the demands  of the pursuit of spiritual civilization, and in line with the  law of development in the press and publication sector.  <H5>  2. Adhere to the Set Direction, Guide the Change, and Serve </H5> the People and Socialism With Higher Quality and Efficiency.    There is a problem of direction as well a problem of  ideological levels and cultural cultivation in trying to raise  quality and efficiency.    On the problem of political direction, the major thing in  the  current stage of politics in our country is upholding Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as the guiding thought, enforcing and carrying  out the party's basic line, and pursuing socialism with Chinese  characteristics. The most fundamental and important missions  for the press and publication sector are to provide spiritual  force, intellectual support, ideological guarantees, and a good  climate of public opinion for achieving the party's general task  and objectives. Convictions must not be shaken, the political  line must not be disrupted, and stability and unity must not be  undermined. There are many widely different tasks in serving  the people and socialism, but upholding a correct political  direction serves the people and socialism best. Only by sticking  to a correct political direction from beginning to end can we  raise the quality and efficiency of press and publication work  in a better manner. If things go wrong in the political sphere,  the resulting damage will be far greater than can be calculated  in terms of losses in quality and efficiency. This year has  seen the unveiling of the greatest number of reformist measures  and reforms of the greatest intensity. Press and publication  work must remain united, stable, and energetic, and maintain the  policy of positive propaganda in order create a relaxed and  harmonious environment for reform and opening up.    On the problem of ideological uprightness and integrity,  since the socialist press and publication sector is entrusted  with the important task of training and fostering a new  generation of idealistic, moral, and cultured socialists, it  must offer the most advanced, beautiful, and healthiest  ideological and cultural fruits. The development of reform and  opening up and a market economy has brought us opportunity and  vitality, but overseas influence and greed have also exposed  some people to epicureanism, the cult of money, and extreme  individualism. To further promote reform and opening up and  resist erosion toward an unhealthy climate, the press and  publication sector should provide more and better spiritual  products and a much stronger spiritual force goading people to  carry on the struggle. The broad mass of news and publishing  workers have contributed much in this respect. However, a small  number of units and individuals have put out publications  advocating money worship, epicureanism, and extreme  individualism for the sake of money. The lesson was profound.    Regarding cultural cultivation, we link cultural cultivation  with the problem of direction because without certain cultural  cultivation, it is simply not possible to achieve either  political or ideological orientation. The standards of  published cultural products impact directly the attempt by the  press and publication sector to raise its own status and  dimension and improve the quality of our people. In this  respect, it is extremely necessary to link standards of cultural  cultivation with the problem of direction.    In sum, the problem of direction for the press and  publication sector is not a simple political slogan, but a  synthesis of politics, ideology, integrity, and cultivation.  And solving the problem of direction relies not only on the  stance taken and becoming aware of it; an ability to combine  different qualities and operations is needed. Solving the  problem of direction requires us to handle well the relations  between economic effects and social effects, between the main  theme and its variations, between Marxist guidance and the  absorption of as much of mankind's advanced ideological  achievements as possible, and inheriting and developing the  positive cultural elements in the national tradition, and  between handling high-plane and sophisticated elitist things and  popularization. Only when political direction, ideological  orientation, and cultural cultivation are all upheld in dealing  with all the above relations can we say the direction has  genuinely been upheld.  <H5>  3. Manage According to Law, Protect the Change, and Create </H5> an Environment of Fair Competition and Healthy Order for  Achieving High Quality and Efficiency    The effort to achieve phased changes in the press and  publication sector under a new historical condition depends to a  very large extent on a strengthened legal system and a  law-guided management system. Through law-guided management,  the protection of healthy forces, and curbing and cracking down  on illegal behavior, conditions will be created for fair  competition leading to the survival of the fittest, which will  in turn create a healthy and orderly environment in which the  press and publication sector can develop in a high-quality and  efficient manner. Through law-guided management, concerned  departments will be gradually relieved of microscopic management  to concentrate on macromanagement.    In a certain sense, a market economy is a law-guided  economy.  Under a planned economy, management on the press and publication  sector is realized through direct management by leading party  and government departments. As the socialist market economy  unfolds, press and publication will evolve into common social  activities, with the value of law facilitating or constraining  ever more greatly their development, rendering pure party  discipline and specific administrative-style management  increasingly inadequate. Under a market economy, law-guided  management will play an increasingly larger role.    While there has been significant progress over these last  few  years in national and local legislation for press and  publication, work in this area remains lagging far behind the  real situation. This is because we do not have much experience  to start with, and on the other hand, we need practice in  legislation. From practice we can identify and shape our  legislation work. We cannot impose in advance a legal framework  on a developing and changing reality. At any rate, legislation  lagging behind the objective reality has created much trouble  and difficulty for us. The situation in the press and  publication sector has showed time and time again the lack of  law enforcement, a situation awaiting urgent rectification.  <H5>  4. Deepen Reforms, Speed Up the Change, Move Closer To </H5> Creating an Operating Mechanism of High Quality and Efficiency.    The main thrust of reforms in the press and publication  sector over the last decade or so has been removing the sector  from the dictates of the planned economy in advancing toward a  socialist market economic system. Reforms in press and  publication have unfolded along with the gestation, formation,  and development of a socialist market economic system. In  switching from the old to a new system, press and publication  work will run into many new situations, problems, and  contradictions.    (1) Change further the operating mechanisms of publication  units; nonprofitmaking units will be managed as an enterprise,  moreover such enterprise-style management will be given a  greater role later; operating mechanisms suited to the  development of the socialist market economic system will be  created in order to increase the adaptability, competitiveness,  the self-development ability, and scientific management of the  publication sector in a market economy. This is an important  task for the publication sector in deepening reforms.    Reforms in the publication sector must slowly put in place a  corporate publication system. Units in need of state subsidies  will be run as nonprofitmaking units, while the majority will be  managed as enterprises, but both will need a corporate system,  in which their responsibility will be strictly defined so that  they will have powers as well as official duties; and discipline  and law breakers will be severely punished and observers of law  and duties vigorously supported.    The switch of operating mechanisms in the publication sector  should start with personnel, labor, and distribution as the  points of breakthrough ushering in other reformist measures.  Through reform in these three systems, an incentive mechanism  will be formed in the publication sector prodding workers to  explore and create. The establishment of press and publication  groups is another exploration by some provinces and cities in  press and publication reforms. Such groups help consolidate and  expand the scale of production, concentrate all the energy on  big projects, and go into market competition as a group. As  such they will strengthen management and guide opinion. The  experiment in such groups should take account of practical  situations, work on the basis of voluntary participation by  press and publication units and the management- ownership  relationship, which will be one of mutual interests instead of  administrative subordination. As conditions in localities vary,  there cannot be uniformity. But as reforms in the press and  publication sector deepen, there will emerge a number of various  press and publication groups based on a management-ownership  relation playing a greater role in promoting production  structural adjustment and raising efficiency and quality.    (2) On fostering and developing the book market system:  At present, a great many contradictions in the publication  sector are found in the distribution area, so reforms in the  distribution system are the key to deepening publication  reforms. Right now the most important thing is to enliven  further distribution and create a market environment with fair  competition so as to form a unified, open, orderly, and  competitive national book market.    The focus of reforms in the distribution system is on  enlivening the operating mechanisms of XINHUA Bookstores.  XINHUA Bookstores are the main channels of book distribution in  our country and have made significant contributions over the  last several decades. However, as reform and opening up deepened  and the socialist market economic system developed, XINHUA  Bookstores began to run into difficulties and face new problems,  which they need to solve urgently through deepening reforms.  Reforms in XINHUA Bookstores must proceed in three directions.  One, the distribution agent experiment should be pursued to  enliven the wholesale area and widen wholesale channels so that  the main channels can play a real role in book circulation.  Two, reforms are needed in the forms of purchases and sales,  which allow different types of sales agents such as  distributors, sales on consignment, and sales agents. Three, we  should promote reforms in the management-ownership system of  XINHUA Bookstores in order to enliven their operating  mechanisms. Experiments in contracting, franchising, the  joint-stock system, and nongovernmental management of  government-owned units conducted by localities in recent years  are all good pursuits to enliven grass- roots bookstores. We  should actively promote cross-regional wholesale book markets  and pay great attention to establishing wholesale markets in  underdeveloped regions. At the same time, we must vigorously  develop book sales networks. The distribution of newspapers and  magazines, while supporting and perfecting this above-described  main channel, should be allowed to pursue alternative channels  of distribution. Management and guidance on individual-run  distribution must be strengthened with the purpose of  encouraging these individuals to maintain self-discipline  through industrial associations and urging them to play an  active role in enlivening book markets.    (3) Strengthen and improve macromanagement. Strengthening  and improving the macromanagement on press and publication  administrations is an important issue in press and publication  reforms. Under the new situation, press and publication  administrations urgently need to change their management  functions so that they may be relieved from busy and minor  administrative affairs to concentrate their energy on  macroregulation and control, and study intensively to deal with  the new situation and solve new problems cropping up in the  transition from the old to a new system. That way they can take  new steps in theory, policies, rules and regulations, and  systems, and ensure that press and publication reform progresses  smoothly from the stage of total volume growth to that of high  quality and efficiency. Strengthening theoretical study and  exploring the law of development in the press and publication  sector are an important link in the pursuit of strengthening  management. With such important spiritual production as the  press and publication sector and the complicated situation in  the press and publication sector brought about by economic  change, it will be very difficult to work without theoretical  guidance, an strategic insight into the overall situation, and  an ability to keep the overall situation under control.  However, it is precisely in these aspects that we lack  theoretical preparation. The absence of theoretical study in  the management of the press and publication sector and its  development, especially the law of development in the  publication sector, and in the "opportunities" and "problems"  brought to the press and publication sector by "development" and  "reforms," has in fact affected and impeded our work. We must  pay greater attention to investigations, studies, and  theoretical work in order to improve our ability to analyze the  situation and solve problems. We must step up investigations  and studies on practical problems related to press and  publication reforms. This can be done by making explorations  and experiments under the guidance of theory, and continuously  abstracting and elevating what we gained in exploration and  practice to a theoretical level. The focus for macroregulation  and control over press and publication work is coming to grips  with: Orientation, total volume, structure, and economic  returns. Under longstanding administrative management we have  accumulated a lot of experience, but it will not be nearly  enough under a socialist market economy. We need to learn to  use economic and legal means and public opinion, especially  legal means, in management in our effort to open a new dimension  in macromanagement.    (4) Rely on scientific and technological progress in  promoting the development of the press and publication sector.  As an key component in information industry, the press and  publication sector must make a great effort to modernize the  means of publication and business management. It must conduct  technological transformation, speed up editing, type-setting,  printing, and binding, and modernize management in order to  raise the status of its products, labor productivity, management  levels, quality, and economic returns. There should be different  priorities in technological transformation. Emphasis must be  placed on starting at high technological levels, and there must  be determined efforts at combining technological development,  imports, and transformation, with special emphasis on electronic  technology, in order to solve key technological problems in the  development of the press and publication sector.  <H5>  5. Promote Prosperity, Realize the Change, and Provide </H5> Society With Rich, Varied, High-Quality, and High-Class  Spiritual Products    The effort to achieve the change from total volume growth to  high quality and efficiency in the press and publication sector  is ultimately aimed at prosperity, which is chiefly marked by a  rough equilibrium between total supply by the press and  publication sector and total demand by the people and social  development, and an overall rationalized book and magazine  structure. Prosperity means more than growth in volume; it  requires also quality on a certain scale and at a certain level  of volume.    In promoting prosperity, we must focus on construction.  Both administrative departments and news units must take  construction as the point of departure and the basis. This is a  long-term and arduous mission and must be pursued  systematically. A long-term and general plan and a practical  current work program are both needed, and we will pursue both of  them in a down-to-earth fashion. Guiding thought on specific  operations must be clear, with focuses highlighted and work  objectives clearly defined, and there must be strong operability  and clear effect forecasts. The Press the Publication  Administration is implementing the Eighth Five-Year Plan and  will begin drafting the Ninth Five-Year Plan. They are great  events for spiritual production in our country and require all  the nation's energy; not only that from the press and  publication sector, but from the entire editors' and writers'  force, or even the whole array of spiritual production.    The working force remains the core problem in promoting  prosperity. The key to prosperity and progress toward high  quality and efficiency for the press and publication sector lies  in its working force. The sector has its special requirements  on its working force. They must all have special academic  training and, moreover, integrity and a sophisticated state of  mind. They must have the capability to work on spiritual  production and to organize spiritual production, appreciate the  fruits of domestic and foreign civilizations, and understand  domestic and overseas markets. The key to building up a working  force lies in the establishment of leadership groups, and one  important problem in establishing leadership groups is clean  government. On this we must work strictly according to relevant  central decrees.    The press and publication sector is an important sector in  our country's spiritual civilization. Central leading comrades  repeatedly stressed that work in this sector can only become  increasingly important and play an increasingly greater role,  and the sector can only be strengthened, not weakened. Given  the situation, it is all the more necessary for us to heighten  our sense of responsibility and mission and work cautiously and  in a down-to-earth manner. We are at a historical juncture  between the planned economy and socialist market economic system  reforms, and our news and publishing workers are at an important  link of spiritual civilization; they are at center stage now.  Faced with the phased change from the stage distinguished by  total volume growth to that by high quality and efficiency in  the press and publication sector, we feel, on the one hand, hard  pressed, and on the other hand, proud. We must treasure this  historic opportunity, value the trust and expectations of party  and people, emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, do our  best, and pursue creative work, and with it bring a new stage of  development to the press and publication sector.</p>

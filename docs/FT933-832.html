			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / International Company News: Aer Lingus restructuring conflict deepens CONFLICT OVER a restructuring plan at Aer Lingus, the Irish state airline, deepened over the weekend after last Friday's deadline expired for a voluntary redundancy scheme with only about half of the 1,280 voluntary redundancies being sought by management having been taken up by the airline's workforce. The company is not expected to give a final figure for the take-up until early this week, but it is widely believed to be no more than 750. The original 5pm deadline was stretched until late on Friday night to allow latecomers to get within the scheme. The company is currently losing some IPounds 1.2m (Pounds 1.1m) a week, and is seeking to cut IPounds 50m from its annual operating costs of about IPounds 600m. Some IPounds 34m is being sought in payroll cuts, through a combination of redundancies in the 5,500 workforce and cutbacks in wage scales if necessary for those that remain. The company has said it is prepared to consider alternative ways of achieving savings, as long as these can meet the target. SIPTU, the trade union representing most of the workforce, advised its members earlier in the week that the voluntary redundancy terms were the best they were likely to get. It has warned that it will fight compulsory redundancies, however, which could lead to a serious division within the coalition government. The Labour party, the junior partner in the coalition, made firm electoral pledges last year that there would be no compulsory redundancies at Aer Lingus in any restructuring plan and SIPTU now expects Labour to honour those pledges. The company has said that if it is forced to resort to compulsory redundancies, these are likely to be at statutory levels which would amount to only a tenth of what is offered under the voluntary scheme which offered up to two and half times an employee's annual salary in severance payments. The scheme is to be financed out of a IPounds 175m equity injection promised by the government, but which is itself conditional upon EC approval. A decision from Brussels is expected early in October. The government has made it clear that if a viable recovery plan was not forthcoming from the airline and its workforce, then the equity injection would not be forthcoming either. An October 31 deadline has been set by the Labour Relations Commission, which is mediating in the dispute, for a definitive restructuring plan to be agreed. The emphasis in negotiations between management and unions is now likely to shift to wage cuts to avoid compulsory redundancies, but SIPTU is insisting that any cuts should be matched by creating an equity stake for the workforce. This will mean that the government will also now be dragged into the negotiations, as it is the sole owner of the airline. An offer of a 5 per cent equity stake was rejected by SIPTU last week as being 'totally inadequate'.</p>

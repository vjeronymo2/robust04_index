			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> STARK SAYS HE REGRETS CALLING SULLIVAN 'A DISGRACE TO HIS RACE'  </P> <P> The chairman of a House health subcommittee said today that he should not have  called Louis W. Sullivan "a disgrace to his race" when he criticized the Health  and Human Services secretary.  </P> <P> "To the secretary, I have to say I blew it," Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland) told  the House.  </P> <P> But he reiterated criticism of Sullivan, who is black, for supporting  Administration policies that are "bankrupt" and damaging to minorities.  </P> <P> Sullivan had demanded an apology, responding to the original criticism with: "I  don't live on Pete Stark's plantation."  </P> <P> Stark, who is white, said his reference to race had obscured his central  complaint about Sullivan's positions on abortion, health care and civil rights.  Stark is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee's subcommittee on  health.  </P> <P> Republicans had strongly criticized Stark for his statement Thursday, and the  White House castigated what it called Stark's "bigoted assault."  </P> <P> Before Stark spoke, House Minority Leader Bob Michel (R-Ill.) led a series of  Republican critics on the House floor, charging that Stark had brought  "discredit on this institution" and demanding an apology. He called Stark's  attack "as bizarre as it is deplorable."  </P></p>

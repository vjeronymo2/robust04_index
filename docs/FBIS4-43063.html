			<p>BFN     [Text] The Socialist Party [PS] has won the elections for  the European Parliament in Portugal. The RTP/Catholic  University forecast says that the Socialist Party won between 35  and 39 percent of the vote, the Social Democratic Party [PSD]  has won between 28 and 32 percent, the Social Democratic Center  Party [CDS] has won between 12 and 14 percent of the vote, and  Communist-Greens coalition [CDU] has between 9.5 and 11 percent  of the vote.    This means that the PS has 11 MEP's [Member of European  Parliament], PSD has eight MEP's, CDU has three MEP's, and the  CDS has three MEP's. We will now compare these figures with  those of the last European elections in 1989: The PS had 28.5  percent, the PSD had 32.7 percent, the CDS had 14.2 percent, and  the CDU had 14.4 percent.</p>

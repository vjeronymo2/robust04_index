			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Observer: Springs eternal Inspired by the Weekend FT's article on 'cyberspace', the free-floating electronic community created by computer users all round the world, one colleague has made a nasty discovery. Electronic communication is even more cliche-ridden than the old-fashioned kind. Cyber-correspondents rejoice in turning their most frequently used cliches into acronyms. Messages are spattered with jargon like GMTA ('Great minds think alike'), IMHO ('in my humble opinion'), which must have them ROTFL ('rolling on the floor laughing'). There is even an electronic counterpart to the letter writer's SWALK ('sealed with a loving kiss') - NIFOC ('naked in front of computer').</p>

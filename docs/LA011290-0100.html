			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AQMD URGES BAN ON REFINERY USAGE OF TOXIC CHEMICAL;  </P> <P> SAFETY: STAFF MEMBERS SURPRISE AND PLEASE TORRANCE CITY OFFICIALS BY SUGGESTING  A BAN ON HYDROGEN FLUORIDE.  </P> <P> South Coast Air Quality Management District staff members disclosed Thursday  that they will propose a ban on refinery use of the highly toxic chemical  hydrogen fluoride.  </P> <P> The staff decision was contained in a brief memo to members of a hydrogen  fluoride task force, which was created to study the dangers that use of the  chemical poses to the public.  </P> <P> The proposal for a ban brought cheers from Torrance city officials, who had  been outraged by a draft report done for the task force. It had recommended  additional safety measures instead of a ban.  </P> <P> Startled refinery officials questioned why district staff would come to a  conclusion so different from the draft conclusions of the district's own task  force, which is composed of 45 government, industry and public safety  officials.  </P> <P> Citing the dangers of earthquakes, sabotage and human error, the memo by deputy  executive officer Edward Camarena said "the life-threatening consequences" of a  hydrogen fluoride spill led the staff to conclude that it would be "prudent  public policy to phase out the use of this acutely hazardous material where  viable" and less dangerous chemicals are available.  </P> <P> "Yeahhhh!" said Torrance City Councilman Dan Walker, who is sponsoring a March  ballot initiative that would force the Mobil Oil refinery in Torrance to stop  using hydrogen fluoride. "That's just great."  </P> <P> Hydrogen fluoride, known in its liquid state as hydrofluoric acid, is used at  four Los Angeles area refineries as a catalyst in the production of unleaded  gasoline. The chemical also is used at Allied-Signal Corp. in El Segundo to  manufacture refrigerants.  </P> <P> If spilled, the chemical creates a deadly gas cloud.  </P> <P> Refineries could use sulfuric acid instead, but they would have to spend  millions of dollars and several years building new equipment to make the  conversion. No other chemical could be substituted at Allied-Signal, said  officials of both the company and the air quality district.  </P> <P> The district staff's recommendation and the task force report, which will be  finalized in coming weeks, will be considered by the full AQMD board at a March  2 meeting. If the AQMD decides to limit hydrogen fluoride use, state  legislation implementing the ban would then have to be approved in Sacramento.  </P> <P> Camarena said the staff's decision was based largely on a computerized study --  not yet released to the public -- of how spills of hydrogen fluoride and its  alternative, sulfuric acid, would affect an urbanized area. Release of the  study is expected early next week, he said.  </P> <P> "The reality is that there cannot be absolute guarantees against certain events  -- earthquake, human error, things of that nature -- and one needs to then ask,  are there risks that we can avoid by seeking viable alternatives?" Camarena  said.  </P> <P> Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert said the computer study will provide valuable  scientific support for her city's pending lawsuit against Mobil, which seeks  additional power to regulate the refinery by having it declared a public  nuisance.  </P> <P> "We have been waiting for this. This is very good news," she said.  </P> <P> Refinery officials said they had assumed that the district's staff  recommendation would parallel the task force's draft report.  </P> <P> "It was kind of a surprise to me. I was not aware that they had undertaken any  (computer) modeling," said Mobil refinery general manager Wyman Robb, a  non-voting industry member of the task force. Mobil's own modeling studies  showed little danger of a fatality, he said.  </P> <P> "We spent months and months and months tuning the fairly sophisticated models  on hydrogen fluoride dispersion," Robb said. "I don't know how long they've  been working on this. . . . There's more information that I need to see before  I can make any comment about that conclusion."  </P> <P> Mobil uses an average of 459 gallons of hydrofluoric acid each day. Robb  estimated that it would cost more than $100 million and take three to four  years to convert to sulfuric acid.  </P> <P> Equally surprised by the decision were officials at two Santa Fe Springs  refineries -- Powerine Oil Company, which uses 73 gallons per day, and Golden  West Refinery, which uses 81 gallons.  </P> <P> Refinery manager Marshall A. (Bud) Bell of Ultramar Refinery in Wilmington,  which needs a daily supply of 283 gallons, said that the initial cost of  converting to sulfuric acid would be about $45 million. He said operating costs  would also be higher.  </P> <P> "It would be devastating," he said.  </P> <P> In a separate development Thursday, Ultramar, which has the region's second  largest alkylation unit using hydrofluoric acid, released a risk assessment  report that estimates that their use of the chemical would cause one death  every 100 years. The estimate is about the same as one that Mobil came up with  in a similar risk assessment report.  </P> <P> Ultramar's study, Bell said, proves that the firm's use of hydrogen fluoride is  safe.  </P> <P> At Allied-Signal, which leads usage in Los Angeles with 4,320 gallons consumed  each day, officials were generally not concerned.  </P> <P> "It shouldn't really impact us here because they're talking about viable  alternatives, and it's already been established that we don't have any," acting  plant manager John Haddad said.  </P> <P> Because Allied-Signal uses hydrogen fluoride to make refrigerants that are less  dangerous to the ozone layer than other types of refrigerants, Camarena said  air quality district staff members will have to balance that positive  consideration with the toxic dangers.  </P> <P> "One needs to crank all the considerations into coming up with a  recommendation," he said. "Where there aren't alternatives, then that pretty  well answers that."  </P> <P> RELATED STORY: B7  </P></p>

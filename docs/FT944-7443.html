			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: US bank settles derivatives lawsuit Bankers Trust reached agreement yesterday to settle the smaller of two lawsuits brought against it by corporate customers over derivatives losses. Under the out-of-court settlement, the bank in effect released Gibson Greetings, a Cincinnati-based greetings card company, from Dollars 14m it owed under two swap agreements. However, the company will pay Bankers Trust Dollars 6.2m, the balance of the losses it faced on the two contracts. The Gibson case is believed to have been the first brought against a bank by a corporate customer over a complex derivative transaction. It was seen by derivatives professionals as a test of whether corporate treasurers could be held wholly responsible for financial instruments they buy, or whether they could lay some of the blame on the banks they bought them from. Gibson had sued the New York-based bank in September, seeking to recover what at the time were paper losses of Dollars 23m, along with punitive damages of Dollars 50m. It claimed that Bankers Trust misinformed it about the true risks of the derivatives it bought. The instruments turned bad after February this year, when US interest rates started to rise. Bankers Trust refused to discuss its reasons for settling the suit, saying only that it was 'in the interest of both parties based on the unique facts of this case'. It is thought, however, that the bank believed Gibson, as a small company, stood a good chance of depicting itself in court as an innocent victim. Bankers Trust, meanwhile, said that it still intended to defend itself vigorously against the second lawsuit, under which Procter &amp; Gamble is seeking Dollars 130m and unspecified punitive damages over a single interest rate swap that went bad after US rates rose.</p>

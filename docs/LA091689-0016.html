			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COVERAGE OF ZSA ZSA'S DAY IN COURT  </P> <P> Please, as a mature woman who works, renews her car registration, keeps her  driver's license current, and does not drive with open liquor bottles in her  car, I must protest the ludicrous coverage given Zsa Zsa Gabor in your paper  ("Lights, Cameras, Zsa Zsa! Gabor's Heading for Court," Part I, Sept. 10). This  type of coverage belongs in the Star or National Enquirer.  </P> <P> Please, enough about this completely spoiled woman.  </P> <P> BARBARA BARON BLOOM  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

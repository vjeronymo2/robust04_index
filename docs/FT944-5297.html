			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / (CORRECTED) Food &amp; Drink: Good but not great - Wine, Burgundy's vintage Correction (published 17th December 1994) appended to this article. The annual auction of the Hospices de Beaune's new wines last month provided the first opportunity of assessing the quality of the latest vintage. The results showed the trend in prices, although in the market they tend to fluctuate less than at the auction where they are influenced by charity and publicity factors. For the last four years prices at the sale and the reputation of the wines have been falling: with total receipts from an unreasonably high FFr29m (Pounds 3.44m) to a disastrously low FFr10.9m last year. Something had to be done. So a new cuvier - costing FFr25m - was built in a suburb of Beaune, with stainless steel vats and an underground cellar that resembled the new ones in Bordeaux, such as Pichon Lalande's. No less important, Andrew Porcheret, the wine maker who used to supervise the vintage, was retrieved after six years at the Domaine de La Romanee-Conti. He organised this vintage much more strictly, discarding 15 per cent of the grapes and reducing the yield to around 25 hectolitres per hectare, compared with a normal 35 to 40. But even Porcheret could not control the weather and, as elsewhere in France, hopes of a great vintage were blasted by two weeks of rain in mid-September; but two fine weeks followed. The Hospices put up for sale only 558 casks (four-fifths red) compared with 759 last year and prices rose by 51.15 per cent for the reds and 40.25 per cent for the whites, making a sale total of FFr12.2m. The top red wine price, apart from an hors concours bid of FFr100,000, for a cask of Clos de la Roche Cuvee Georges Kriter, was FFr50,000 for Clos de la Roche Cuvee Cyrot Chaudron. For the whites FFr75,000 was paid for the Batard-Montrachet Cuvee Dames de Flandres. Overall, the new Hospices wines have good colour, are well-balanced and fairly light. After a prolonged fermentation, the reds had not undergone the second malolactic fermention that reduces the acidity, and so were difficult to assess. The whites were still cloudy with unfermented sugar. Generally, however, the '94 whites are considered better than the reds, whereas it was the other way round in 1993. One experienced merchant said that the '94 whites may turn out almost as well and similar to the outstanding '92s. Success for the reds will depend on severe pruning in the winter or pruning of the bunches in the summer, and strict selection at the vintage. As usual there has been a good deal of over-production. An indication of the care taken at the top level of the whites has been given by the two largest properties in the seven-hectare Montrachet vineyard: the Baron Thenard/ Remoissenet and the Marquis de La Drouchin Guiche. The former made only 24 casks compared with a normal 35, the latter 22 instead of 40. The good quality of the vintage is demonstrated by a lively market. For the '93s it barely started before Christmas but this year it began in September for the '94s, and is already half over. In the lower level white appellations, including the Cote de Beaune whites and Pouilly Fuisse, almost all have been sold. Consumers need not panic as there is no en primeur selling. Currently prices in the Cote de Beaune (predominantly white) are up 15 per cent, and in the Cote de Nuits (overwhelmingly red) are up 5-10 per cent. Fine burgundy cannot be cheap, for relatively there is little of it, but in constant franc terms the average price per cask has fallen from the 1989 peak of FFr44,475 for reds and FFr94,264 for whites to an estimated FFr21,151 and FFr28,691 respectively. Ridiculously, it is impossible now to ascertain demand for burgundy in the UK, for Brussels issues no separate figures for individual EC countries. The Comite Interprofessional in Beaune, and other associations elsewhere in France, are trying to change this. Meanwhile, the obvious vintages for consumers to buy from merchants who specialise in burgundies are '92 for whites and, next year, the excellent '93 reds and '93 whites that will turn out as attractive wines, probably for early drinking, while the more esteemed years are left to mature. It is hoped that the Burgundians have learnt the lessons of the recession for, as a leading Beaune merchant said to me: 'Low prices feed the recovery, high prices lead to disaster.' CORRECTION In my article of December 3, 'A good but not great vintage' I stated that M Andre Porcheret, wine-maker of the Hospices de Beaune, had previously been with the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, whereas he had been at Dom Leroy.</p>

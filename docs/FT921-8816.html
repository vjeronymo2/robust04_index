			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Letter (2): Women, child care and a tax anomaly Sir, As evidenced by your series of articles on nursery provision in the UK, it is clear that the current level of provision is inadequate to meet the needs of potential women returners and employers who wish to take advantage of their skills. Local authority nurseries have limited capacity, while the expense and scarcity of private provision precludes many families from using these facilities. The answer must be a more lenient taxation regime. Currently employers are required to play an active role in the management of nurseries in order for the relevant employees to qualify for tax relief. The majority of businesses are situated in urban areas where it is unrealistic to operate workplace nurseries; the number of employees benefiting from this measure is minimal and small and medium sized enterprises are particularly disadvantaged. The introduction of tax-free benefits in kind for employees for whom provision is bought by the employer from a third-party provider is a necessary step to encourage the establishment of adequate facilities. There are a number of Chambers of Commerce, and potentially many more, which operate nursery facilities on behalf of employers in their membership. Employees using these facilities are not eligible for tax relief. This anomaly must be removed. Fiona Johnson, policy executive, Association of British Chambers of Commerce, 9 Tufton Street, London SW1P 3QB</p>

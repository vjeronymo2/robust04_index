			<p>BFN     [Text] At their Saturday's talks in Tbilisi with a Russian  military delegation Eduard Shevardnadze and his Defence  Minister, Vardiko Nadibaidze, discussed the details of an  operation aimed at deploying Russian peace-keepers in Georgia.  The delegation was led by the Deputy Commander of Russia's  ground troops, Aleksey Sokolov. As Interfax learned from the  press service of the Georgian leader, the peace-keepers are to  be stationed in the safety areas set up in Zugdidi and Gali  Regions.    As Interfax learned from a well-informed source in Georgia's  Defence Ministry, the operation will involve about 3000  servicemen and begin in early June. The return of Georgian  refugees to Gali Region is to begin about June 10, he said. No  official source in Tbilisi agreed to comment on the course of  the talks.    In the meantime the Deputy Commander of the group of Russian  troops stationed in Trans-Caucasus, Major-General Vasiliy  Belchenko, told Interfax that the consultations on the  deployment of Russian peace-keepers in Georgia "are proceeding  with difficulty." "Even though an agreement on the deployment  of troops has been reached in principle, there are some  differences between the Georgian and Abkhaz sides," he said.    "Evidently the events should not be anticipated," Belchenko  said. "The results of talks must be divulged by the heads of  state." As for the participation of Russian troops stationed in  Trans-Caucasus in the upcoming operation, he said that "this  question has not been settled yet. The present plans provide  for moving troops from Russia." "If they prove to be  insufficient, units from the group of Russian troops stationed  in Trans-Caucasus will join in," the general said.</p>

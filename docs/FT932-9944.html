			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Ronson secures Pounds 4m deal MR Gerald Ronson (above), chairman and chief executive of Heron International, the property group finalising a Pounds 1.4bn refinancing which will save it from receivership, has agreed a Pounds 500,000 a year salary and a five-year contract with the group's creditors. The salary is index-linked and Mr Ronson will also get 75 per cent of his annual salary paid into his pension scheme. Without inflation, the deal is worth Pounds 4.375m over five years. It has also emerged that Heron helped Mr Ronson pay his Pounds 5m fine for his part in the Guinness affair. Heron gave him a bonus of Pounds 1.77m because he 'would otherwise be unable to pay the whole of the fine from his own resources', a Heron document said. Heron recovered the money from Mr Ronson's pension entitlement. One bondholder representative said yesterday that the salary package 'is on the high side, but who else would they get to do this job?' He said the decision by creditors to keep Mr Ronson showed a faith in his ability to sort out the group's problems. The representative said sacking top management 'is normally a pre-requisite to getting the refunding in place. Creditors decided they would rather have Ronson. He made a series of pretty poor judgments about the market, but as a dealer in property he is not equalled'. Heron aims to sell properties to reduce debt. The new salary package represents a pay cut from Mr Ronson's current salary of Pounds 1.3m a year. It will become effective when the restructuring is completed and Mr Ronson hands over the chairmanship of the group to Lord Boardman, a former chairman of National Westminster Bank. Details of the new contract were in a document sent to Heron's bondholders, who are being asked to convert each Pounds 100 of bonds into Pounds 29.80 of senior debt, Pounds 7.28 of junior debt and 6.7949 new shares.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Arts: Days of hope - Jackie Wullschlager on images of the post-war American dream It was the best known photographic exhibition of all time. From 1955, when it opened at New York's Museum of Modern Art, through the 1960s, when it toured the world, more than 9m people saw Edward Steichen's show The Family of Man. Its images shaped the consciousness of a generation: Eugene Smith's two children in 'The Walk to Paradise Garden', Andreas Feininger's crowd scene on Fifth Avenue, Robert Doisneau's kissing couple in Paris. Its message of peace during the cold war drew unprecedented queues of visitors in the US, Berlin, Tokyo. When, two weeks before he died in 1963, John F. Kennedy made a legendary speech on the family of man, he used the term given popular currency by Steichen's show. Now, in a bold and imaginative move, the exhibition has been recreated and set up in a permanent home at the centre of Europe. At Chateau de Clervaux, an airy castle near Steichen's birth place in Luxembourg, the monumental black and white prints are hung, as in 1955, around scenes which cross cultures and races. Steichen described the 503 images culled from more than 10,000 photographs as 'a mirror of the essential oneness of mankind throughout the world'. His selection shows a passion for vivid human involvement: the excitement of a first glance, a pair of clenched hands, a sprawl of legs at a dance, a boy spearing an antelope. Yet time has also proved his critical acumen, for every picture on the wall is a consummate work of art. Cartier-Bresson, Brassai, Bill Brandt, Diane Arbus - the names which moulded 20th-century photography are all here, making this show not just a historic reconstruction but the story of an art form. Forty years on, it is the emotion and optimism of the pictures that catches you breathless as you walk into the opening sequence of lovers: in an English meadow, in an Italian wood beside an abandoned bicycle, as part of a New Guinea tribe, at a Louisiana dance hall. Crowd scenes pull you in - swanky faces from five tiers of the Paris Opera, boastful children in a Brandt street scene. Exquisite compositions such as Doisneau's picture of a policeman watching a woman watch a couple embrace by the Seine, ask you to join a circle of voyeurs. All pure sentiment and familiarity hold sway - witness Eugene Smith's children in a brightly lit garden, an image of hope and love so emotive that at a recent trial run of the exhibition in Tokyo, many visitors wept openly over it. Steichen captioned Smith's picture 'a world to be born under your footsteps', and today it is a vision of the 1950s American dream that we respond to it. (It is no coincidence that the image made one of Ford's most successful motor car advertisements.) Like many works here, it is stamped with American icons - sports car, roller coaster, fast-food joint. Ralph Crane's shot of six teenagers speeding down a tree-lined avenue in a 1940s convertible, Robert Frank's line of college girls devouring 20-cent hamburgers, breathe that mix of exhilaration and banality which was mid-century US life. Cumulatively such pictures announce a faith in youth and progress, in New Deal prosperity and the pioneering American spirit. The beginnings of teen culture, Rock Around the Clock, Lolita, West Side Story, were the family of man's contemporaries and Steichen, like Humbert Humbert and Old World emigres in love with the New, was perfectly placed to celebrate the grandeur of young America. At the centre of his show, like an altar piece, he placed a giant Ansel Adams' California landscape. Surrounded by the bars and playgrounds on every day Main Street, it is a homage which recalls the vast journey from motel to motel that Humbert Humbert made across the country with Lolita. These comparisons crystallise how this show has dated in the best possible way. For the family of man is not a general balanced view from five continents but an artistic expression fixed in time and place. Its images unfold like the grand scenes of history, and what gives them the lasting quality of myth is that, like Rembrandt's portraits of Flemish burghers or the Velasquez's Spanish nobles, they distil an inescapable sense of their age, and yet out of that precision emerges something universal. All this is clear with hindsight, which also makes apparent what a splendid exercise in benign propaganda this exhibition must have been during the cold war. Symbolically, its first stop in Europe was Berlin, where it was greeted with fervour by a public not long liberated from the blockade. Even a quintessentially German artist like August Sander seems in Steichen's persuasive American context denationalised; his 'The Hod Carrier', an oppressed German worker resembles an entrepreneurial mid-westerner. In the same way, Brassai's famous duo the Members of Big Albert's Gang, plus d'Italie, here set among clean-living American teenyboppers, loses its Gallic menace and wit. This exhibition will come increasingly to resemble a mid-century US export. A key prop is a ballot box stuck over with photos of individuals voting in Turkey, Japan, France; behind it a huge frame features a United Nations meeting. In the groups of families from around the world, it is now easy to detect a sense of US superiority - Talcott Parson's influential essay 'The Normal American Family' appeared the year the exhibition opened. Yet Steichen's images are large enough for this not to matter. In his last sequence, a screen showing elderly couples - a gnarled pair from Canada, an impassive, identically-dressed Chinese couple, a fat, bourgeois yet uncertain German pair, a frail and stern couple of Sicilians - forms an entrance to a final room plastered with motifs of playing children. Of course, traditional American family values are here - respectability, monogamy, the safe social order of grandparents and grandchildren. But this intimate section also invites us to place ourselves between youth and age, to ponder our own family, society. Each viewer will take from it something different - which is what makes this exhibition so rewarding. The Family of Man, Chateau de Clervaux, Luxembourg. Tel:929656.</p>

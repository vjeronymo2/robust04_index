			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Margins squeezed as Morrison rises 5.5% - Food retailing shares dip on second half warning SHARES IN the food retailing sector took another downward lurch yesterday after Wm Morrison Supermarkets became the latest company to complain of falling margins. The shares closed 23p down at 106p after the Bradford-based retailer said it seemed unlikely that operating profit would rise in line with sales over the next year. The company increased pre-tax profits by 5.5 per cent from Pounds 36.2m to Pounds 38.2m in the six months to July 31 - below market expectations. Sales expanded 20 per cent to Pounds 746.5m (Pounds 623.5m), but the group said this had been achieved only at the expense of a reduction in gross margins. J Sainsbury shares yesterday fell 20p to 420p and Tesco's fell from 208 1/2 p to 197 1/2 p. Earlier this week Tesco said it would break ranks with other food retailers and fight the growing challenge of discount food retailers by cutting the price of basic products. Mr Ken Morrison, chairman, said: 'The current trading scene is one of ever-increasing price competition and therefore pressure on margins. Cost controls through good systems and firm management are the order of the day.' The group said increased labour costs had been incurred to improve service. Operating margins dropped from 5.8 to 5.2 per cent, leaving operating profit 8 per cent higher at Pounds 39.1m. Since the end of the half-year, sales had exceeded last year by 18 per cent, but due to competitive openings like-for-like growth had slipped to about 2 per cent. Mr Morrison said: 'A very significant factor at work here, of course is the preference which customers are showing for more economically-priced goods at the expense of many more expensive branded products.' He was confident, however, that real growth would come from new stores built on realistically-priced sites. During the half year, the group opened five new superstores and has since opened one at Harrogate, with another due at Bolton in November. Next year the group plans to open nine new superstores, and will continue to refurbish existing stores. To supplement the existing group warehouse at Wakefield, the group said it planned to invest Pounds 20m in a new distribution centre in Cheshire, which should be functioning for trading for Christmas 1994. Earnings per share rose to 3.38p (3.17p) and the interim dividend is increased to 0.2 (0.16p). See Lex</p>

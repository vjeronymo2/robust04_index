			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Israeli matchmaker sees Kazakhstan as next frontier - The beliefs that drive Shoul Eisenberg POLITICAL instability, backward infrastructure, extreme remoteness and lack of hard cash are just some of the reasons for not doing business in the central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union. But to Mr Shoul Eisenberg, Israel's - and one of the world's - most secretive businessmen, it is exactly the kind of place he likes to operate. Late last year the government of Kazakhstan signed a Dollars 160m (Pounds 105.2m) deal with the Eisenberg group in Tel Aviv to make and install advanced irrigation equipment in the south of the republic. It was one of a string of projects in which Eisenberg companies are involved in Kazakhstan and the other Moslem republics, spanning everything from agriculture and food production, to oil refining and telecommunications. From Kazakhstan alone the group holds letters of intent for contracts worth Dollars 2bn. Such deep commitment in such an uncertain corner of the world looks like commercial recklessness, or at least supreme optimism. Mr Eisenberg thinks otherwise. For him central Asia is the new and logical next frontier in a business career which began in Japan in the 1940s and moved through the Far East to China - where for the past decade he has been a ubiquitous, if barely visible, western commercial operator. In a rare interview in his Tel Aviv headquarters, Mr Eisenberg said that what he is doing in central Asia follows a pattern. 'It was the same when we started in Japan; who trusted the Japanese then? When we started in (South) Korea, its total assets were Dollars 50m. These are now miracle countries. In China, the Philippines, Taiwan - these were all difficult countries to operate in. But I believe when you help them in those times and later they become healthy, then you have friends who will help you.' Mr Eisenberg's role in all these places has been in essence as a matchmaker between governments anxious to develop their industrial infrastructure and western companies with the technology and ability to help them do it. His principal company, United Development Inc, has since 1978 arranged a string of deals in China, from energy plants to a Dollars 150m float glass plant in Shanghai involving Britain's Pilkington Glass. UDI now has 12 offices in China and has reaped the benefits of China's recent rapid economic growth. It has been estimated that Mr Eisenberg, 71, has amassed a personal fortune approaching Dollars 1.5bn. An impish man, he chuckles at this and declares: 'I don't know. Really, I don't know.' He also laughs at suggestions in the press that, commercially, he is the most powerful man in China. 'It is nonsense. They made a mystery out of me because I don't talk to them.' But he reacts sharply to the accusation that he has prospered simply by inserting himself as a middleman in international dealmaking. 'That is not true. I am not a commission agent. We do the business which people cannot do themselves. We create businesses and we invest ourselves. If anyone says I am Mr Five Per Cent it is a complete lie.' He holds up his venture into the central Asian republics as an example. In his search for financing - 'our biggest headache' - he has turned to European sovereign aid programmes and the EBRD, which require that Eisenberg companies also back projects with their own money. Then there is payment. 'We don't get paid in money, we get paid in goods,' Mr Eisenberg says. In two agreements to upgrade Kazakhstan's oil refining, Mr Eisenberg will seek a return from the added efficiency. 'Their yield of refined products from crude oil is about 62 to 65 per cent. We can bring it up to 95 per cent. We will get paid from the difference. That is our philosophy. You put in the money first and get it back later. It's not so quick.' Mr Eisenberg also carries a torch for Israel. Although he is an Austrian passport-holder, he has been an Israeli citizen since 1950. The Israeli government then enacted a law - known as the Eisenberg law  - granting tax exemptions for his overseas operations, to entice him to base the group's activities in Israel. He has since added to his private empire the Israel Corporation, a public holding company whose offshoots employ 8,000 people in Israel and turn over Dollars 2.5bn a year. He has built up a symbiotic relationship with successive Israeli governments, to the irritation of many other Israeli businessmen who feel he receives too many favours from the state. Most of the latest Kazakhstan deal, for example, will be guaranteed by the government. Senior officials such as Mr Moshe Arens, the former foreign minister, and Mr David Kimche, former director general of the Foreign Ministry, have over the years joined his companies. He says one of the reasons he has almost obsessively avoided personal publicity is the sensitivity of working as an Israeli with regimes such as China which have close ties with the Arab world. But throughout the 1980s, until Israel and China established diplomatic relations early this year, Mr Eisenberg was a conduit through which discreet relations were conducted. During that time Israel is reported to have sold significant quantities of arms to China, sometimes eliciting statements of concern from the US. According to Mr Eisenberg: 'If we are asked by the Israeli government to help them, then sometimes we will help them. But I am not a military trader. Only if the government asks for assistance we might make some introductions. But we have never sold one scrap of military equipment.' In central Asia Mr Eisenberg is again acting as a kind of grand commercial ambassador for Israel, which is anxious to cement relations with Moslem countries on the northern fringe of the Middle East. 'You cannot be friends and be enemies at the same time,' he says. He admits he cannot be certain whether those links will prove as successful as his previous ventures. In October he had to pull out of Tajikistan because of the civil war erupting there. 'We lost a few million dollars,' he says, almost casually, adding: 'I am sure one day we will go back.'</p>

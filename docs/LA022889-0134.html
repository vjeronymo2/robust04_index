			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION SOCCER PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> TODAY'S BOYS' GAMES;  </P> <P> EDISON FACES HAWTHORNE IN 4-A SEMIFINAL  </P> <P> When the boys' soccer semifinals kick off today, Orange County schools will  have one team in four of the five Southern Section playoff divisions.  </P> <P> Orange County will be without a representative in only the 1-A division. Troy  enjoyed the most success of any county 1-A team, advancing to the quarterfinals  before losing to top-seeded Agoura, 2-1, Friday.  </P> <P> In the 4-A, Edison (13-5-3) travels to Hawthorne (16-9-2). Edison advanced with  victories over Rolling Hills and Chino.  </P> <P> The Chargers had the good fortune of being in the bottom half of the bracket --  away from top-seeded Palos Verdes (31-0), which plays host to Newbury Park  (20-3-1) in the other 4-A semifinal.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Mission Viejo is the only county entry in the 3-A. Mission Viejo  (21-1-3) gets the home-field advantage against St. Francis (17-1-1).  </P> <P> The Diablos field a strong offensive unit that likes to spread out the scoring.  Fifteen of the team's 16 field players have scored at least once.  </P> <P> Midfielder Joe-Max Moore leads the way with 24 goals and 10 assists, followed  by Andy Wortrich with 13 goals and 14 assists.  </P> <P> The Diablos also have Jeff Jurgemeyer, last season's South Coast League  offensive player of the year. Jurgemeyer has been hampered by a foot injury  suffered during the football season and has only four goals and three assists.  But he may be coming around just in time for the playoffs. He ran without a  limp for the first time in the Diablos' quarterfinal victory over Cerritos,  Coach Cal Foster said.  </P> <P> In the 2-A, fourth-seeded Esperanza (15-3-2) faces Coachella Valley (22-5) at  Esperanza. The Aztecs advanced with victories over Laguna Hills, Paraclete and  Kennedy.  </P> <P> In the Small Schools division, top-seeded Whittier Christian (17-3-3) has a  200-mile plus trip to Morro Bay (19-3-2). All games start at 3 p.m.  </P></p>

A responsible source at the Interior  Ministry told AL-JUMHURIYAH that the president's order covers  citizens, party organizations, and Internal Security Forces  personnel who capture car thieves. The source urged police  departments and party organizations to submit the names of those  entitled to the award to the Presidential Council after the  crime of car theft is legally proved. He stressed that this  noble gesture will effectively contribute toward curbing the  phenomenon of car theft. He said the award provides an  incentive for the Internal Security Forces personnel to do  everything possible to remove this phenomenon.</p>

According to the same source, the Serb side has been  directly  contributing to the implementation of the cease-fire agreement.  However, the Muslim side has opened infantry fire on the Serb  side over the last 24 hours from positions in Dobrinja II and  Dobrinja III and has targeted Serb defense lines on Sanac hill  and residential areas near the Grbavica stadium.    Serb sources cited UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  representatives who had confirmed Muslim building of  fortifications in the Zuc and Mojmilo areas yesterday.    However, the Muslims have resumed reinforcing their  positions  in several areas in an attempt to approach Serb positions under  UNPROFOR protection, Serb military sources warned reporting that  positions were being reinforced in Dobrinja III, in the area  between Mojmilo and Sucur Kuce and in the Jewish cemetery.    Identical operations to reinforce positions have also been  registered between Golo Brdo and Ugorsko and between Radovica  Kuce and Dobrinja Potok, Nedjarici, and Aerodromsko Naselje.    The Serb side has informed the UNPROFOR command about this  and the UNPROFOR command's representatives already stated that  the building of trenches represented a cease-fire violation.</p>

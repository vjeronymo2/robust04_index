			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Resignation of whip 'won't harm Major' Conservative party managers insisted yesterday that the resignation of a government whip over allegations of a homo-sexual relationship would do little to harm Mr John Major's already beleaguered government. Mr Michael Brown, the Tory MP for Brigg and Cleethorpes, announced at the weekend that he would return to the back benches after a Sunday newspaper alleged that he had a homosexual relationship with a Tory student. An official at Conservative Central Office described the allegations, which appeared in the News of the World, as a 'storm in a teacup'. Members of the MP's constituency party also pledged to stand by him, indicating there would be no question of Mr Brown being asked to resign his seat. However, the MP is the latest in a long line of Tory ministers and MPs who have been forced to resign following the launch of the 'Back to Basics' drive. In the last six months, two ministers and one parliamentary private secretary have resigned in the wake of allegations about their private lives in British newspapers. Mr Brown is a leading member of the 'No Turning Back' group of Tory rightwingers. He was promoted to the whips' office last May with special responsibility for Northern Ireland, transport and the north west of England. Before that, in 1989, he was appointed parliamentary private secretary to Mr Douglas Hogg, then trade and industry minister, staying with him when he went to the Foreign Office. But although a loyal Thatcherite, he was not above rebelling against Lady Thatcher's government when he thought it was moving in the wrong direction - particularly over Europe. The revelations over his personal life - which he is disputing - could hardly have come at a worse time for the government, following the catastrophic result for the Conservatives in the local government elections and with the Euro-elections to be held next month.</p>

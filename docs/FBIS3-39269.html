			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS interview with Eric Giuily, president </F> of the General Maritime Company (CGM), the publicly-owned  "leading" French shipowner; place and date not given: "Finding  European Alliances"]    [Text] [LE QUOTIDIEN] What is your analysis of the status  quo that has been confirmed by the GATT accords?    [Giuily] The American and Japanese protectionist systems,  which work to the disadvantage of the European shipowners, have  indeed been retained. But the freeing up of the markets, to  which we are committed in order to reestablish a certain  balance, could have challenged certain market organization  principles (with the shipowners' associations) that we would  hope to maintain.    [LE QUOTIDIEN] What do you plan on doing with regard to the  foreign competition on your traditional markets?    [Giuily] We must improve our competitive capacity and reduce  our costs. Our strategy will also be based on alliances with the  European shipowners--the Bollore group's SDV, or others. But the  opening up of the American and Asiatic markets should in any  case be negotiated. The European Community should not propose  additional liberalization on a unilateral basis.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 22 Mar (EFE) -- Today, Juan  Maria Rendon, general manager of Colombian Petroleum Enterprise  (Ecopetrol), said Colombia will not sell crude oil to Cuba  unless the island pays with letters of credit as is customary in  international negotiations of this type. The official said  Ecopetrol "asks everyone who is interested in buying oil to  guarantee their purchase with a letter of credit. We do that  with all our customers." That "is what we have asked Cuba to do,  and it has proposed an alternate payment method that is still  unsatisfactory. Therefore, as long as they do not offer a letter  of credit, there will be no deal," Rendon emphasized.    Colombian Energy and Mines Minister Guido Nule Amin  announced  in early February the sale of approximately 20,000 barrels of  crude oil per day starting in June or July. According to the  Colombian minister, the sale would provide one-third of the  island's crude oil needs.    The general manager of Ecopetrol also explained that Cuba  "is  offering its main export product, sugar, as its guarantee  through a three-party transaction with the company that buys  from them. It offers to pay for the Colombian oil once it has  sold the sugar." Obviously, Rendon emphasized, "what we want is  a letter of credit and as of this moment we have not reached an  agreement."    The announcement about the sale of crude oil to Fidel  Castro's island caused Cuban exiles to protest in front of the  Colombian consulate in Miami as well as announcing that  Colombian products would be subject to sabotage and boycott.  Moreover, the Ecopetrol manager ruled out the possibility that  Colombia would refine crude oil in Cuba because, he said, the  refineries on the island are too old.</p>

Thus, the paper called for presenting the text to both the  Palestinian and Israeli leaderships, Ambassador Kamal told MENA.    Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat agreed that Taba  committee's  meetings would resume during next week, Ambassador Kamal further  said.    Such a meeting was essential to formulate many issues  regarding Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho and which  were agreed on during the past two months, he added.    The Palestinians and Israelis could continue contacts to  clear barriers which were still impeding the implementation of  Gaza-Jericho peace accord, he said.    He reiterated the importance of the efforts exerted by  President Husni Mubarak to surmount the difficulties impeding  the execution of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles.    The coming summit of 'Arafat and Israeli Premier Yitzhaq  Rabin would take place by mid January at most in the light of  the progress made by the negotiations, he said.</p>

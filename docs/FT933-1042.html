			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / The men of violins fight for the loot: The future of London's orchestras WHY DOES London need more symphony orchestras than New York, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin and Vienna? It is a question that has haunted London's musical world for decades, not least at the deliberations of the Arts Council which has been forced to stretch its subsidy around the London Philharmonic, the London Symphony, the Royal Philharmonic and the Philharmonia orchestras. The Council has tried threats, and bribes, and rumours in an effort to shift an orchestra out of London - or off its client list. It has gathered up all its nerve - and asked a High Court judge to do the deed on its behalf. Just before Christmas Mr Justice Hoffmann will announce that the committee he is chairing has selected two of the four orchestras for Arts Council funding. One orchestra, the London Symphony, which is resident at the Barbican Centre, has already been shooed into the winners' enclosure. The other three are competing for second place. The aim is to build a generously funded super-orchestra which, with the London Symphony, will be able to match the best that Vienna or Berlin can field. The two losers will be thrown to the market place. This is the dispiriting background against which the conductors of the orchestras picked up their batons this week at the start of the 1993-94 season, a season which threatens sudden relegation for two of them. What upsets the congenitally highly strung musicians is that the orchestras are hardly competing on a level playing field. No one objects to the privileges of the LSO. The orchestra has picked itself up from near oblivion and made a success of its status at the Barbican. It is financially sound, with the City of London matching pound for pound the Pounds 1.2m it receives from the Arts Council. It played to audiences of almost 90 per cent capacity in the Barbican last season and can enjoy a ringside view as its rivals slug it out. And the orchestras are rivals. The days when a second violinist might find himself, or herself, playing for the Royal Philharmonic one night and the Philharmonia the next, are over. The orchestras have developed into exclusive, self-governing, democracies jealous of their privileges and quite ready to rebel against imperious chief executives or insensitive conductors. This is what makes the Arts Council's preferred solution to the contest less and less likely. The Council loves the idea of a merger between the London Philharmonic and the Philharmonia, or, rather, since a merger among such quarrelsome musicians is unrealistic, it would like the London Philharmonic to absorb the Philharmonia. With its enlarged grant the new orchestra could expand from 80 to 120, finding jobs for at least half the Philharmonia's musicians. But neither orchestra favours this solution and tentative talks have foundered. A year ago the London Philharmonic took up a five year residency as the house orchestra at the South Bank. To ease its progress the Arts Council more than doubled its grant to an impressive Pounds 1.12m. this year. The London Philharmonic is the hot favourite to scoop the pool. Having booked conductors and soloists for a South Bank concert programme stretching well into 1996 it is in a strong position to sue the Council if Hoffmann decided to take away its funding. It is in no mood to compromise with the Philharmonia. But if Judge Hoffmann is as independent as his reputation it is just possible that the London Philharmonic could be in for a shock. By an ironic twist the much sought residency at the South Bank has unleashed a string of setbacks. It suddenly lost its chief executive John Willan; its new principal conductor Franz Welser-Most has come in for criticism and failed, through illness, to conduct the London Philharmonic at Thursday's opening Festival Hall concert; the residency has caused severe financial problems, in spite of its success in keeping audiences last season above 80 per cent. Even its appointment this week of Sir Harrison Birtwistle as its conductor in residence at the South Bank could look like an attempt to sway Hoffmann. If the London Philharmonic does not get the Arts Council's money its future is immediately threatened. The faltering at the London Philharmonic is encouraging for the Philharmonia, which is reserve resident orchestra on the South Bank with 40 odd concerts a year against the 50-plus played by the London Philharmonic. In spite of a seasonal residency in Paris the Philharmonia would find it difficult to survive without its Pounds 710,000 subsidy, but it is financially sound for now and has few enemies in the musical world. The fact that the Royal Philharmonic has even entered the contest reveals the changes in its approach since Paul Findlay joined as managing director from the Royal Opera House. The Royal Philharmonic has been out of favour with the Arts Council for years. Its subsidy has been reduced to Pounds 400,000 a year, a mere 7 per cent of its revenue. In retaliation the Royal Philharmonic embraced the joys of the market, playing concerts of popular classics, touring assiduously and pretending that there was life after subsidy. All that has changed under Findlay. There is less sponsorship money around; less funding for touring. He is trying to revive the Royal Philharmonic's noble tradition as the orchestra of Sir Thomas Beecham, playing British music with British musicians. The Royal Philharmonic will lose its Arts Council money but carry on regardless. Hoffmann has been asked to ignore politics and personalities and assess the artistic potential of the orchestras. This side of the question looks like a photo-finish, but taking a snapshot of which orchestra is playing the best, has the most exciting programmes, the most prestigious conductors, is hardly a fair way to proceed. Orchestras go up and down. The four London orchestras have snapped at each others' heels for the past 20 or 30 years. If this decision had been taken 10 years ago, few would have picked the London Symphony Orchestra as an automatic winner. The move to the Barbican had proved unpopular with audiences and musical standards were variable (the LSO was seen as the bruiser among London orchestras, always happy to play loud and fast). Now, after a series of successful festivals devoted to Britten, Stravinsky and others, it has won a reputation for being adventurous, the only British orchestra of unquestioned international status. Two years ago the London Philharmonic could claim to be its equal - but now? How quickly the tune changes. Almost from the moment the orchestra won its residency on the South Bank it has careered downhill. The public perception that the LSO has won the initiative rankles at London Philharmonic headquarters. By parading an array of the world's top conductors in London (an expensive policy) the administration believed that they occupied the high ground, while pointing out that they have to draw 2,900 to the Royal Festival Hall against 2,000 at the Barbican. Unfortunately, pampered modern maestros only want to tour the world with their favourite symphonies. The conductors' roster for the London Philharmonic's autumn season shows what happens when money is short and out-of-the-way music is added to the schedules. This looks like a sinking ship and there is every sign the orchestra knows it. Just this week it announced that it is taking on Birtwistle and Roger Norrington - two highly-regarded musicians who can hoist the flag for innovation - to bolster its case. Nothing symbolises more potently the London Philharmonic's malaise than the failure to sell its Music Director, Franz Welser-Most, as the dashing young counterpart to Simon Rattle. It did nothing for the orchestra's image when word leaked out that some of the players refer to him as 'Frankly Worse-than-Most'. Morale has slumped. Key players have their bags packed. The orchestra looks shipwrecked, but at least it has one lifeboat to cling to: it still plays well. That is the problem with the Philharmonia. It is so easy to make comparisons between the London orchestras. Within months of the Philharmonia assaulting music-lovers' sensibilities with its strained strings and ear-splitting brass in Mahler's massive Eighth Symphony under Giuseppe Sinopoli at the Royal Festival Hall, the London Philharmonic and Klaus Tennstedt turned up in the same piece and gave a grand and glorious performance. No comparison at all. Sensing which way the race was likely to go, the Philharmonia has not sat back. It has lured conductors such as James Levine and Christoph von Dohnanyi to London. It has forged a relationship with Boulez's Ensemble InterContemporain for 20th-century music. It has gone out to win a residency at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris, no doubt to pique the opposition back home. To those who complain that Sinopoli's long tenure as Music Director has seen standards eroded, we now have the Philharmonia's answer. Sinopoli will not be renewing his contract when it expires in 1995. The orchestra knows who it wants to replace him, but is not expected to make an announcement before the day of judgment. (Which conductor would want to find his opening concert featuring the orchestra's funeral march?) Pity the poor Royal Philharmonic. Nobody even seems to discuss what would happen if it wins the race. For many serious concert goers the Royal Philharmonic's annual programme sits on the shelf gathering dust and that, in essence, has been the orchestra's life story. Under Principal Conductors such as Walter Weller and Andre Previn, it marked time, filling its diary with revenue-earning business, recordings of film soundtracks or pops concerts. Regrettably, this has obscured one important point: the orchestra has kept up a remarkably high standard of performance and has a rich blend of sound all its own. To come upon the Royal Philharmonic unexpectedly, on one of those evenings when it has been hired by an outside organisation such as the Bach Choir, is to be struck afresh by the quality of its playing. Since Vladimir Ashkenazy took over as Music Director, its programmes have become more dynamic, but probably too late. Orchestra standards may vary almost monthly, but a reputation takes years to change. All three of these orchestras have put their bids forward, which suggests that they are resigned to nobody asking the obvious question. Is it in the country's interest, let alone that of the orchestras, for one or two of them to face extinction? It is instructive to look across the Channel. In 1967 France under Pompidou decided that Paris needed an international orchestra. In true French style the government mobilised musicians, finance, conductors (including Karajan and Solti) on a grand scale. But the Orchestre de Paris has been a flop from the start. Extraordinary, really, that a British Conservative Government should be heading down the same road. For years four more-or-less privatised orchestras have survived - some might say thrived - through cut-throat competition. Now there is to be less competition, less choice, fewer concerts. All the taxpayers' money is to go to the lucky two. Of course there could still be a last minute reprieve. In the summer the Arts Council announced that it was axing the grants of half a dozen popular regional theatres, such as the Bristol Old Vic and the Theatre Royal, Plymouth. There was an outcry and this week the theatres were reprieved. The Council's music panel could over-ride Hoffman's decision and the full Council could in its turn over-ride the music panel. Hoffmann could decide the case on the basis of the plans submitted by the three orchestras and ignore the London Philharmonic's South Bank residency, or the recent travails of the Royal Philharmonic. Or he could ignore his brief and decide that the South Bank needs its two orchestras, and suggest that they stay independent but work more closely together on programming, marketing, etc. Alternatively the whole issue could hang fire until the Council carries out its planned investigation, with the BBC, into the nation's regional orchestras, some of which, such as the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Halle and the Bournemouth Symphony, receive more subsidy than some of the London bands. The depressing thought is that whatever happens to Hoffmann the variety and quality of the musical life of London will not improve. Audiences at the Festival Hall have declined by 20 per cent over the last two decades, to 61 per cent last season. A marginal change in the funding of the symphony orchestras will not in itself change that.</p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Challenging the parental role Sir, Your newspaper should be congratulated for predicting Daimler Benz's problems as early as 1988 ('Lingering Doubts about Daimler', November 14, 1988). Christopher Lorenz's excellent analysis of Daimler Benz was based on examining the capability of the parent company to manage and create synergy out of the diverse businesses it had acquired in the previous three years. He concluded that success was unlikely, that Daimler would need to make significant divestments, and that even then the logic of the company 'remains doubtful'. This approach to understanding diversified companies is called parenting theory. It focuses on the skills of the parent. The logic for diversifications is then the fit between a business and the parent's skills. This way of thinking about diversified companies has become the established creed among top academics and consultants and in Lorenz's writing on other companies. Why is it absent from your leader, 'Diversify and Die' (January 4)? Vague discussions about the merits of specialisation versus balance or about the dangers of 'having all your eggs in one basket' are a poor substitute for rigorous analysis of parenting skills in order to understand why some conglomerates make sense and others do not.

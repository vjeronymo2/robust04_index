			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that the enhanced heavy-duty vehicle program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would be applicable to vehicles and engines in California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the proposed FIP would satisfy the section 209 waiver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria. Thus, California could undertake the enhanced vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program described below, and, therefore, EPA has authority under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 110(c) to undertake the proposed programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the protectiveness of the standards, all of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed standards are at least as protective as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise applicable federal standards (e.g., the generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and NMHC standards in the case of the vehicles and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines covered by the enhanced heavy-duty vehicle program).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indeed, these standards are at least as stringent as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparable standards that California has already adopted and for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which waivers have already been granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the need to meet compelling and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extraordinary conditions, EPA has repeatedly found that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California's air quality problems satisfy the need criterion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 209(b) (see, e.g., 49 FR 18887 and 18890 (May 3, 1984),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 58 FR 4144 (January 13, 1993)). Moreover, the magnitude of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions in emissions needed to reach attainment in the FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas, including mobile source emissions (discussed in Preamble  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section III.H), provides ample evidence of the need for more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent motor vehicle emission standards in California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, with respect to the criterion of consistency with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 202(a), EPA believes that its proposed enhanced vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program is consistent with both the technological feasibility and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification elements of that criterion. For the reasons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained below, EPA believes that the various elements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced vehicle program are technologically feasible within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leadtime provided, taking into account the cost of compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, no aspect of the enhanced vehicle program establishes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any new certification test procedures that are inconsistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either existing federal or California test procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. Consequently, EPA believes that its proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced vehicle programs satisfy this prong of section 209 as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also notes that its proposed rebuild requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heavy-duty vehicles and its use restrictions on heavy-duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles need not satisfy the section 209(b) criteria since those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, being in-use regulation of vehicles directed at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle owners, and not the original manufacturers, are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preempted by section 209(a). Thus, EPA has the authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgate those requirements just as any other requirements not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to preemption under section 209.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Emissions Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Oxides of Nitrogen Standard.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As mentioned earlier, heavy-duty engines are a major source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions in the FIP areas. Because of this, EPA proposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to establish lower exhaust emission standards for heavy-duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines in California vehicles beginning with the 1999 model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year. The emission standard for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is proposed to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.5 g/bhp-hr for all heavy-duty engines used in vehicles of GVWR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above 8,500 pounds, except those optionally certified to chassis- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based standards as discussed in previous sections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is proposing this standard because this level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control is necessary in order to meet the FIP air quality goals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and because this level represents a comparable reduction relative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to other vehicle classes. As discussed further below, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognizes that this standard presents a significant feasibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> challenge for diesel engines. However, other fuel technologies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as natural gas and alcohol fuels have demonstrated the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential to achieve these stringent levels, as well as other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine designs. Given this, the Agency believes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.5 g/bhp-hr standard is appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the same time, EPA recognizes that implementing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.5 g/bhp-hr standard may present limitations that may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unacceptable for some unique heavy-duty vehicle applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Agency is considering an additional, economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incentive program that allows the sale of higher emitting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines. The Agency solicits comments on a plan that would allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines to be sold at a relaxed level of 2.5 g/bhp-hr NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new vehicle emissions surcharge is paid. The program would begin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the 1999 model year and would apply to all engines subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the 1.5 g/bhp-hr standard and their associated vehicles. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surcharge would be assessed also for an engine bought separately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be installed in an existing chassis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Alexon requests suspension of shares SHARES IN Alexon Group, the women's wear retailer, were suspended at the company's request yesterday morning following press speculation about its refinancing plans, first announced last month. The shares were suspended at 78p, compared to the peak of 444p following the 1991 demerger from Claremont Garments (Holdings), the Marks and Spencer supplier. The group, which has seen bad news mount since the beginning of last year, said 'negotiations for the raising of new equity capital and for new bank facilities are nearing completion'. In April the chairman and two chief operating officers were removed following pressure from institutions. Alexon's largest institutions are thought to have refused to back a rights issue, needed to reduce borrowings of more than Pounds 20m, without the board changes. Alexon is later this week expected to restate its results for the 53 weeks to January 30. As previously reported, it incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 986,000. The company sought a suspension because it could be several days before the audited results and details of the new funding requirements are ready. In consultation with the Stock Exchange, it was decided a suspension would reduce uncertainty ahead of the announcement.</p>

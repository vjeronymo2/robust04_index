			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A reversal of fortune - East Germans have lost their insatiable appetite for all things western It seemed like a marketing dream come true in the early days of German unification. East German manufacturers and west German advertising agencies looked on in wonder as consumer-starved east Germans rushed out with their newly exchanged currency. East Germans packed their apartments and kitchens with west German video recorders and washing machines, stereos and food mixers. They sampled western brands ranging from washing powder and toothpaste to cigarettes, water, beer, confectionery and soap. You name it, they bought it. 'East Germany's local producers did not know how to respond to this avalanche of west German consumer goods,' says Sebastian Turner, manager of the Berlin-based Scholz &amp; Friends advertising and marketing firm, a subsidiary of the New York-based Bates Worldwide. 'They had no idea what competition meant. The pace at which west German goods entered the untapped east German market actually helped to destroy some east German products.' But not completely. Four years after German unification, east German consumer habits are shifting - and east German products are returning to the department stores' shelves. The first reason for this reversal in consumer spending is economic. The high rate of unemployment among east Germans - officially 16 per cent - and insecurity about future job prospects have encouraged east Germans to save. According to the Bundesbank, savings last year took 13 per cent of their disposable income compared with 14 per cent in west Germany. As a result west German advertisers could no longer rely on the east German consumer's insatiable demand for west German products, and they had to respond accordingly. Stephan Becker-Sonnenschein from the Munich-based Self Promotion Services, which markets Philip Morris cigarettes, explains the strategy his agency has adopted: 'When Philip Morris bought up large sections of east Germany's cigarette producers, it decided to keep its prices for east German brands below west German prices. This partly explains why east Germans are again buying f6 cigarettes, an old east German brand owned by Philip Morris. f6 cigarettes now have 30 per cent of the entire east German market.' But it is not only the price of a product which has caused the shift back from west to east German products. 'The east Germans were made to believe that every western product tasted better while everything eastern was pretty awful. Yet over the past few years, they have been going back to some of their own brands. We would not dare substitute that black tobacco of f6 with an American tobacco. It would not sell,' says BeckerSonnenschein. Responding to a return to traditional east German tastes, Philip Morris maintained the old style of the f6 cigarette box as well as the tobacco. 'We revamped the packaging for environmental reasons and introduced some more ranges, such as lighter cigarettes. But the old familiar pack  - and the smell of that black tobacco - remains the same.' As east Germans went back to their old products, west German advertising agencies had to reconsider their marketing strategies. They may find a lesson in the success of Henkel, one of Germany's largest washing powder manufacturers. It entered the east German market soon after unification by buying Spee, a household name among east German washing powders. Henkel could not rely on market research for the selection of its strategy because such processes had not been established in the former communist days. Anke Paech, head of production at Henkel, says that the company decided to stress the 'continuity' of Spee. Its first advertising slogan was 'The good Spee - we are from here (east Germany)'. It also kept the price competitive. More important, Henkel emphasised that the east German-manufactured washing powder was the 'first all-German washing powder', which was intended to show east Germans they could produce products appealing to the west. Henkel has now captured 28 per cent of the east German washing powder market, further evidence, perhaps, of a growing east German patriotism and confidence in their own products, even if many are backed by west German enterprises. Turner sees another trend evolving among east German consumers which is affecting the way west Germans market their products in the five eastern states. 'You can talk about the east Germans turning back to their own products. And this is true, but only up to a point. The reality is that 80 per cent of consumer goods in east Germany still consist of west German brands. 'However, if there is any long-term trend developing, it is this: the emergence of regionalism, the rebirth of the local product. That is exactly what had emerged in west Germany since the second world war. But in east Germany, because everything was state-owned and distributed through state channels, there was little scope for regionalism or regional products.' It is almost impossible to ignore the growing importance of regional products. The Saxons opt for Radeberger beer which is brewed in Dresden, the Thuringians indulge in their famous sausage, the Saxon-Anhalts consume Rotkappchen, a sparkling wine which has made a remarkable recovery in the past two years, the Brandenburgers favour their own dairy products. Supermarkets and food chains in east Germany and Berlin are responding to these trends. KaDeWe, Berlin's most fashionable department store and one of the first to tap the regional culinary strengths of east Germany, now stocks between 600 and 700 east German items out of the 3,000 products sold on its luxurious sixth-floor food hall. 'The Berliners want the local products,' says Norbert Kronacke, head of KaDeWe's fruit and vegetable division. 'For the first time since the second world war west Berliners have an Umland (surrounding countryside). The Berlin Wall cut them off from this. Since unification they have been able to buy locally produced food, game and fish. It is cheaper, does not have to be imported and the taste is fresher.' Turner believes that the east German market still offers potential for west Germans and outsiders. 'The east Germans will buy a product if there is a rational reason to do so. This amounts to offering a good price and quality. The east Germans are price-conscious and sensible about how they spend their money.' Turner says anyone still wanting to enter the east German market should keep their message direct and avoid being arrogant. Above all 'you have to know the local culture and traditions because regional products are playing an increasing role in the consumer habits of the east Germans. Just like in west Germany'.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Lower tax and interest prop Email EMAIL, the Australian domestic appliance maker, reports net profits little changed for the year ended March, thanks to a steep decline in interest costs and a lower tax bill. On sales 6 per cent higher at ADollars 1.47bn (USDollars 1bn), the company made profits after abnormal items of ADollars 55.5m, against ADollars 55.3m a year earlier. The dividend is going up from 17 to 17.5 cents a share. Email's interest costs fell from ADollars 15.7m to ADollars 6.5m as a result of reduced borrowings and lower interest rates. The year's result takes in a strong second half, during which net earnings rose 13.5 per cent after a weak start. Email predicts a profit improvement in the current year with betting trading. It said exports had continued to grow and margins were increasing despite strong competitive pressure.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / UN agrees new aid for Angola The United Nations yesterday agreed fresh aid for Angola, as the government reported that people were starving in the besieged city of Cuito, Reuter reports from Luanda. The UN World Food Programme said it would mount a six-month Dollars 56.7m (Pounds 38m) emergency operation for nearly 2m people in Angola. The WFP had suspended flights to many cities for several weeks, including Cuito, because of attacks on its aircraft by Unita rebels, but a WFP spokeswoman said aid flights had resumed this week and the agency was increasing overland deliveries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sao Tome, 24 Jun (AFP) -- The political crisis  between Sao Tomean President Miguel Trovoada and the government  of Norberto Costa Alegre worsened today with a call by the  opposition parties asking the head of state to sack the prime  minister and hold early legislative elections. This request, a  copy of which AFP received, also asked the head of state to  appoint international experts to look into the management of  public finances over the past three years and to bar government  members from leaving the country for as long as this inquiry  will last.    Yesterday, in a communique the government accused President  Trovoada and the opposition parties of "causing political  instability in the country" by trying "to convince the people  that the government had misused the national budget." "The  government is responsible for managing budget resources and it  is answerable in this regard to the National Assembly alone,"  the communique added. Up until now, the government had never  openly involved itself in this fray, leaving it to the majority  party, the Democratic Convergence Party [PCD].    This deterioration in relations between the two poles of  power has continued despite a series of meetings held early this  week between President Trovoada and the leaders of the various  political parties, from both the majority and the opposition.    The labor unions have in turn entered the fray by calling  for  a three-day general strike starting early July, to protest "the  economic degradation of the country, the misuse of the social  security budget, and the refusal of the government to negotiate  with workers' representatives." The government has asked  workers not to heed this strike call, which was launched by the  country's largest labor federation, the National Sao Tome and  Principe Workers Organization.    The PCD won the first multiparty legislative elections in  1991, defeating the former single party -- the Movement for the  Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe-Social Democratic Party --  which now constitutes the main opposition party. The following  year, Trovoada, contesting as an independent candidate, won the  presidential election. The mandate of the present National  Assembly will expire at the beginning of 1995.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Nikonov, chairman of the Subcommittee </F> for International Security and Arms Control of the State Duma of  the Russian Federation: "Partnership for Peace: Agenda for the  Federal Assembly"]    [Text] Deputies of both houses of the Federal Assembly  learned of the decision of Russia's executive authorities to  affiliate with NATO's Partnership for Peace (PFP) program from  the newspapers. This fact is a very graphic demonstration of the  present role of the supreme legislative body of the Russian  Federation in the foreign policy decisionmaking process.    An abnormal situation, to be blunt. And it is dictated not  only by the new constitution, which quite effectively sidelines  the legislators from the formulation of foreign policy. The  obvious short-sightedness of our foreign policy establishment  explained by the less than most felicitous experience of  interaction with the former Supreme Soviet and a certain  wariness in respect to the new corps of deputies may be traced  behind this trend also. The short-sightedness amounts to the  fact that even with the current constitution, the influence of  parliament is potentially quite considerable: adoption of the  budget, items geared to the foreign policy activity of the  Russian Federation included; ratification of international  treaties and agreements (more than 100 of them are to be  approved by the Federal Assembly); the adoption of laws, those  regulating the implementation of domestic and foreign policy  included; the possibility of a wide-ranging appeal to domestic  and world public opinion. Considering this, it has to be  concluded that the noninvolvement of the Federal Assembly in the  overall foreign policy mechanism could threaten the very  foundations of the policy of the Russian Federation in the world  arena, which, as we all know, begins at home. In addition,  foreign policy can only be consistent and effective when it is  based on a certain consensus within the country. And it is hard  to count on this when the representative authority is notified  post factum. Yes, the Federal Assembly is heterogeneous, and  forces with different views on international problems, differing  at times from those of the government, are represented in it.  But it is just as much a reality as the government, and it is  impossible to hope for a rapprochement of views while adopting  an ostrich-like position.    Parliament's isolation from the formulation of the  Partnership for Peace decision was a reason for the very  tumultuous debate on this problem in the State Duma, which  induced a number of experts to begin talking about the  conception of contradictions of the two authorities in the  foreign policy sphere. The PFP problem is, indeed, a complex  one. And the position of the members of parliament is dictated  by no means only by ideological predilections but also by the  obvious lack of knowledgeability, the lack of clarity on many  essential details (for me included), and the equivocal nature of  the assessments of the program in the news media.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has as of late repeatedly addressed,  directly or indirectly, the Partnership problem, having  published articles by V. Chernov, D. Yevstafyev, V. Katin, and  A. Migranyan (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA for 23 February, 25 February,  and 15 March 1994). They, as many other publications also,  contain entirely cogent criticism of the PFP and proof of its  unsuitability for Russia, which cannot simply be brushed aside.  On the other hand, official announcements of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defense of the Russian  Federation contain outright panegyrics to the program without  the least attempt to investigate the essence of the arguments of  its opponents or to respond to them. A debate, in which alone  can the truth be born, as, equally, a foreign policy course  acceptable to the majority, has not eventuated.    I shall try to fill in this gap somewhat, summarize and  weigh  the arguments "for" and "against," and offer the Federal  Assembly and the executive certain conclusions.  <H5>  I </H5>   For the opponents of the Partnership for Peace program the  starting point is the negative evaluation of NATO and its role  in the modern world. They see no satisfactory answers to the  question concerning the reasons for its preservation following  the end of the cold war. The opinion of NATO merely as an  instrument for securing an American military presence in Europe,  in which Russia is interested least of all, is widely held. NATO  was created as a global organization for containing communism,  and even recently, when it has been confronted mainly with tasks  of crisis management, it has, in fact, changed little in its  doctrines, focus of operational troop training, and so forth.  The distrust of NATO, which lurks far from just in the minds of  certain politicians and specialists, but which is also deeply  rooted in the public consciousness, is being carried over also  to the Partnership, which is, not without reason, being seen as  a form of the phased expansion of NATO.    Of course, we cannot hope to alter many people's suspicion  of  NATO overnight, especially since it is not based on sand. But  remaining in the soil of reality, not dreams beyond the clouds,  we cannot fail to note the strength of the arguments of the  supporters of the preservation of NATO, primarily in the West.  The North Atlantic bloc exists because the ruling circles of all  its constituent countries (and of many that are not such),  convinced of its usefulness on the basis of the experience of  postwar development, which has made it possible, in their  opinion, to secure the longest period of peaceful development in  Europe's history, have an interest in this. It may be argued  what NATO's actual role in this was, but political leaders and  the majority of the populace in the West are reluctant to take a  risk, destroying a structure of the need for which they are  certain. As we are unwilling to conclusively bring down the CIS,  whoever might desire this. NATO will exist and will have its own  interests, which do not in all things coincide with Russian  interests, and there is no getting away from this. Russia cannot  force NATO to dissolve itself, and the more stridently it seeks  this, flexing its muscles, the more arguments there will be for  the supporters of a strengthening of Atlantic solidarity.    But is it advisable for Russia to join the Partnership for  Peace, as a kind of NATO locker room, which would be seen as a  Russian "go-ahead" for the geographical expansion of its sphere  of influence? The opponents of the PFP rightly observe that the  arguments of the East European countries seeking via the  Partnership a strengthening of their security in an explosive  region and guarantees of their sovereignty and territorial  integrity are absolutely unacceptable to Russia. The Russian  Federation has no enemies from whom it could be protected by  NATO, as, equally, the problem of securing the country's  independence with the aid of outside forces is a non-issue. We  cannot seriously see as the point of the PFP Russia's protection  against the territorial claims of certain Baltic states. If, on  the other hand, what is meant is NATO's assistance in the  security of Russia's southern and Far East borders, the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization would never assume such  commitments. In addition, the affiliation of the Russian  Federation and the Central Asian republics to the Partnership  could be perceived by China as the approach of NATO right to its  borders and could signify a complication of relations with  Beijing. The PFP completely disregards the Chinese factor. The  interest in the Partnership on the part of NATO is  understandable also. In the opinion of some of our experts, this  is not only an argument for the geographical expansion of the  North Atlantic bloc but also an opportunity to wait out the  development of events in Russia and, depending on their outcome,  to create either a system opposed to it or a system  incorporating the Russian Federation.    There is also talk about a certain perfidy of the West,  which  is endeavoring with the aid of the PFP to fill the vacuum that  formed in East and Central Europe following Russia's abandonment  of the "Brezhnev doctrine," the withdrawal from there of Russian  troops, the disbandment of the Warsaw Pact, and the Russian  Federation's consent to the unification of Germany. The  nonexpansion of NATO was a condition of a number of unilateral  Russian steps.    But what does Russia need the Partnership for?    An answer to this question is, indeed, hard to find if we  proceed from the interests of the prevention of direct and  indirect threats to Russia's security. Although here also it may  be said that Russia has an interest in NATO responsibility for  the stability of borders in East Europe, where there are  potentially a multitude of destabilizing focal points capable of  creating a threat to the Russian Federation and its citizens.  The answer should, rather, be sought from the rule of  contraries: What would Russia get from nonparticipation in the  Partnership program from the viewpoint of its overall  geopolitical positions?    The idea of the PFP was born, as we know, as a result of the  insistent demands of a number of East European countries for  their direct membership of NATO. Not ready to receive them and  encountering the negative reaction of Russia, Western leaders  moved toward the formulation of a compromise, of which the  Partnership proposal was the result. That is, it remains a fact  that the question of the expansion of NATO was placed and  continues to be placed on the agenda, primarily by the  governments of East European states which have for this a stable  public consensus within their countries. Membership of NATO and  the PFP, as a step toward membership, is for them a symbol of  the return to Europe and a reflection of the deeply rooted fears  (it is pointless now saying to what extent they are justified)  in respect to their powerful eastern neighbor. And the degree of  attraction to NATO is not connected with the ideological  particularities of this government or the other, what is more:  The most assertiveness is being displayed by Lithuania and  Poland, where former communists, in fact, are in power. The  problems of NATO's expansion via the PFP will be resolved not by  a "vacuum" but by specific countries of East Europe, the  influence of Russia on which has diminished unswervingly in  recent years. Were the Russian Federation to refrain from  participation in the PFP, East Europe would not, for all that,  follow its example.    Thus whether the Partnership is realized or not will not  depend on Russia's position. It will be realized. Whether it  exists with Russia or without it will depend on us. If without,  it is highly likely that this will, indeed, be a partnership  against Russia. Participating in the program, we could influence  its realization. Not doing so, the Russian Federation would  forfeit every opportunity for this and would achieve nothing  other than splendid self-isolation from the rest of Europe.  Counting on a development of Russian policy on the southern and  eastern azimuths is unrealistic, to say the least, considering,  in particular, that countries of the European continent account  for half of Russia's foreign trade turnover and the lion's share  of the overseas capital investments coming to us.    At the same time, not affiliating with the Partnership, the  Russian Federation would be cutting off for itself the  possibility of the achievement of a number of geopolitical goals  of considerable importance:    postponing the question of the immediate expansion of the  NATO bloc and deciding on a compromise formula, influencing its  further realization;    strengthening military-political cooperation along East-West  lines;    enabling countries of West and East Europe to feel more  secure, which would help beat down the "post-Zhirinovskiy" wave  of anti-Russian sentiment there;    undertaking in earnest for the first time a surmounting of  the civilization barrier between East and West and contributing  to Russia's integration in the world community.  <H5>  II </H5>   A large place in the discussion of Partnership problems is  occupied by questions of the equality of the partners and of  Russia's participation in this program on a par with the leading  Western countries, not only with Lithuania or Romania. Truly,  the Partnership program specifies the equal status of the newly  admitted participants, but not the equality of the latter and  the NATO graybeards. Having let slip the initiative of the  creation of the PFP, Russia let through ahead of it several of  what are not the greatest East European states and has now found  itself standing in a long line for membership of this program.  If the Partnership is regarded as NATO's backup team, should  Russia be playing for it when, on the one hand, it is in terms  of its playing possibilities good enough for the main team and,  on the other, it is still not a fact that it will be accepted by  this main team. It should be agreed that there is a large  proportion of truth in all these arguments.    Russia, truly, is not an ordinary "partner." It is the sole  potential participant in the PFP which possesses nuclear weapons  and which has, in addition, most powerful army and naval forces  and immense scientific and technological potential. There is a  multitude of organizations in the world, from the United Nations  through the International Monetary Fund, which make provision  for the special status of the most influential states. Take if  only the UN Security Council. Unfortunately, Washington and  Brussels did not take Russia's concern at this problem into  account. Our diplomats also, most likely, were in too much of a  hurry to agree to the lack of special status for Russia,  particularly considering the information, which NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA has reported also (15 March 1994), concerning the  readiness of NATO Headquarters and the capitals of the bloc's  leading powers to make a curtsy in Moscow's direction on this  matter.    A serious opportunity for full-fledged partnership was also  let slip right at the outset, when the program was proposed on  behalf of NATO. Partnership as an initiative emanating jointly  from the United States and Russia and addressed simultaneously  to the countries of the North Atlantic bloc and East Europe  would undoubtedly have suited us.    The question of the prospect of Russia's membership of NATO  is far from having been decided. As Andranik Migranyan observed,  "were Russia to immediately become a full member of NATO, and  this organization became a universal structure ensuring security  in Europe, only a madman would not support such a development of  events." The West's consent to Russia's membership of NATO  cannot be ruled out, but this only in the long term. At hearings  in the Foreign Relations Committee in the U.S. Senate on 23  March, Assistant Secretary of State S. Talbott declared that  this could happen "when many other things have happened." Such  wording does not, I believe, need any translation from  diplomatic into normal language.    Problems of Russia's participation in the leadership of the  PFP and the mechanism of the formulation of decisions within its  framework still remain to be clarified. Will the decisions be  adopted by a consensus of all the participants or will this  prove to be the prerogative of NATO? It is perfectly obvious  that the latter would be simply unacceptable to Russia,  especially when we have before us the recent graphic example of  the NATO Bosnia bombing decision, which was not coordinated with  the Russian Federation and which was contrary to its position.    Experts cite one further problem in this  connection--peacekeeping operations within the Partnership  framework and joint maneuvers of the participants to perfect  them, in East Europe included. The uncertainties here are  connected with whether NATO intends to take account of Moscow's  opinion or not when planning the forms, timeframe, scale, and  geography of such maneuvers. If not, a threat to stability in  East Europe could arise.    But despite all the complexity of the questions concerning  the role, status, and influence of Russia in the PFP, the  possibility in principle of their relatively acceptable solution  cannot be ruled out either. As we know, a universal Partnership  formula does not exist. Each country will draw up an individual  plan of its participation, which should take account of its  interest in this aspect of cooperation or other and its actual  possibilities. The members of parliament did not have a chance  to familiarize themselves with the draft of this plan. But if  this document stipulates specific and particular forms of  Russia's participation not in the program itself but also in its  leadership and in joint planning, the problem of status could  largely be resolved. Ultimately Russia's actual role will be  determined by its actual military and economic power, which is  many times greater than the indicators of Lithuania or Ukraine  even.  <H5>  III </H5>   Pointing to the undesirability of NAT0's territorial  expansion as an instrument for securing primarily American  influence, the opponents of the Partnership propose that this be  counterposed by a strengthening of cooperation within the  framework of European and more neutral structures. In his  message to the Federal Assembly the president of the Russian  Federation proposed the use as a leading instrument of the  shaping of a new system of military-political partnership not of  NATO at all but of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council  (NACC), which could coordinate the activity of regional  organizations--NATO, the Western European Union (WEU), and the  CIS. Boris Yeltsin also noted the expediency of the countries of  Central Europe being accorded long-term guarantees on the part  of Russia and NATO, which would become utterly meaningless  following realization of the Partnership.    But counterposing European to transatlantic security  structures is not compulsory, in my view. A strict tie to NATO  is possible only in the event of the Partnership being the sole  program of military-political cooperation in Europe. But I do  not believe that such a formulation of the issue would suit  Russia or the majority of European countries either.  Consequently, the Partnership should be supplemented by efforts  for the creation of additional instruments of security and  cooperation in Europe--via a strengthening of Russian ties to  the WEU, a corresponding expansion of the mandate of the CSCE,  and so forth. The Partnership, which is not without problems for  us as the sole program, would prove more acceptable as one of  many contributing to the maintenance of peace and stability in  the Euro-Atlantic space.    Publications on the PFP have paid little attention to one  further problem which is, from my viewpoint, of considerable  significance in a solution of the question of Russia's  affiliation to it: What is the degree of consensus in respect to  the Partnership and the Russian Federation's participation in it  in the Western countries themselves? Is it not the expression of  the position of a certain stratum of elites which could change  with a change in political winds, which would altogether  undermine the program's prospects? It should be noted that the  PFP has, truly, very many opponents in the West. And criticism  is being heard from both the conservative and the liberal camps,  what is more. The position of the first is clearly formulated in  a recent article by Henry Kissinger in THE WASHINGTON POST, in  which he wrote, in part: "It (the PFP) equates the victims of  Soviet and Russian imperialism with the imperialists themselves  and accords the Central Asian republics bordering Afghanistan  the same status as Poland, which has been the victim of four  divisions with the participation of Russia and which has served  as a route via which Russia has historically invaded Europe."  Liberals, however, on the contrary, see no great value in the  existence of NATO under modern conditions and would prefer that  it operate in an unenlarged composition and that security in the  Old World be secured by way of a deepening of the all-European  process.    Agreement to Russia's participation in the PFP in Western  capitals is of a far from unconditional nature and reflects a  certain compromise in their ruling circles and is supported  grudgingly by the "silent majority" of politicians, who would  prefer to see the Russian Federation outside of NATO structures.  But does this mean that Russia should wait for the moment when  it ceases to be summoned to the Partnership (which could happen  quite soon) and the problem is resolved of its own accord? The  opposite, I am sure: Russia should not let slip the integrative  opportunity it has been afforded. When doors are slammed shut  for it in the Partnership, they will also close, I fear, in many  other European and international organizations which our country  would like to enter. Entering them would be far more difficult,  in any event.  <H5>  IV </H5>   The PFP evokes serious misgivings among the participants in  closer rapprochement of the CIS countries. The Partnership would  be realized on an individual basis with each state, regardless  of its membership in this organization or the other. Russia,  individually, Belarus, individually. The concern as to how in  this situation account would be taken of the interests of the  CIS as a separate organization and of the existence within its  framework of the collective security system is appropriate.  Crudely put, would the Partnership not pilfer the Commonwealth  of Independent States?    On the one hand the answer to this question will depend  primarily on the CIS countries themselves, on their desire to  move toward a closer alliance with one another. The individual  membership of NATO of some and the nonparticipation of others  did not, after all, prevent the states of West Europe from  creating the European Community, where the level and dynamics of  integrative processes are superior to the corresponding trends  in the CIS. On the other, the affiliation of countries of the  Commonwealth to the Partnership has already begun--Georgia and  Ukraine. If Russia has no real levers for influencing the  decision of this former Union republic or the other concerning  membership of the PFP (as would appear to be the case now), its  own nonparticipation would threaten it with self-isolation not  only from East Europe but from the CIS also, which would do the  CIS irreparable damage. If, on the other hand, we proceed from  the presence of such levers (the factors of economic, financial,  and energy dependence), preventing a negative development of  events for the CIS, having harmonized among all its members the  common principles of affiliation to the Partnership which do not  jeopardize the Commonwealth's system of collective security,  should constitute no difficulty for Russia.  <H5>  V </H5>   Finally, the last bloc of problems, connected with the  domestic political consequences of Russia's affiliation to the  Partnership.    Unfortunately, our country has never had a tradition of the  implementation of foreign policy with regard to the frame of  mind of society and the opinions of the opposition (which, for  the most part, has not existed either). And, following the  emergence of political pluralism, this tradition has had quite  an excruciating birth. I have no information about or sense of  the adoption of the decision on participation in the PFP having  been preceded by soundings of public opinion or evaluations of  the possible reaction of the main political groups and the  short-term and long-term influence of affiliation to the  Partnership on the alignment of political forces or of the  formulation of a set of measures to explain the essence of the  program to the public. At the same time, I fear that Russian  public opinion and the politicians are far from a consensus on  the question of the PFP and that a purely apical decision on  membership, on not the most advantageous terms particularly,  could add to the antireform forces' arguments in their charges  against the government of another national humiliation. If the  president, the Foreign Ministry, and Ministry of Defense really  consider the Partnership acceptable for Russia, they should be  devoting far more attention to a justification of their position  than they are at present. Otherwise this most important foreign  policy action could introduce a serious split in society and  weaken the positions of these state institutions themselves.    I am also unfamiliar with serious estimates of the cost of  Russia's participation in the PFP. Foreign policy is not free.  The Partnership specifies that the main expenditure shall be  borne by the countries that have signed the agreement  themselves. With the present strained situation as regards the  state budget, the question of the actual amounts would seem far  from idle, and the Federal Assembly could hardly formulate its  position without an answer to it.    Responses to the arguments of its opponents concerning the  negative impact of the PFP on the domestic military-industrial  complex as a result of realization of the demands that the  participants in the Partnership adapt to the military standards  of NATO would be of great significance for an evaluation of the  program. In this case, the former say, the markets of the East  European countries would be closed to Russia's arms  manufacturers, which would make the situation in our  military-industrial complex even worse.    Truly, "standardization" is a central problem. As far as I  know, it is a question of standards of military planning, not  official NATO standards regarding specific types of arms,  especially since in the North Atlantic bloc itself the  standardization of arms remains an unattainable goal. But, in  any event, the question of the future of Russian arms exports in  connection with affiliation to the Partnership should be  clarified unequivocally by the departments concerned. It would  be unacceptable to Russia were the PFP to force it to  restructure its own military production, to purchase arms in the  West even more.  <H5>  VI </H5>   Proceeding from all that has been said above, the following  basic conclusions may be drawn.    The Partnership for Peace is a far from impeccable program  and in many of its parameters it does not entirely correspond to  Russia's national interests. But our country does not have a  practical possibility of preventing its realization. The Russian  Federation's nonparticipation in the Partnership would threaten  it with serious isolation in the international arena and with a  narrowing of the possibilities of influencing the process of the  formation of a new Euro-Atlantic space. It is my belief that the  negative geopolitical consequences of Russia's estrangement from  the PFP are more appreciable than the consequences of its  affiliation to the program. It is from this, first and foremost,  that the chambers of the Federal Assembly should proceed when  formulating their approaches to the Partnership. The Federal  Assembly should, on the whole, support Russia's participation.    But the adoption of a final decision will be possible after  certain conditions have been met and a number of positions  explained:    1. The Federal Assembly should have an opportunity to  closely  study the draft program of the Russian Federation's  participation in the Partnership.    2. This program should make provision for questions of the  parties' specific obligations and Russia's participation in the  process of the formulation and adoption of decisions at the  level of the PFP leadership in respect to all its possible  actions, peacekeeping operations included. The adoption of  decisions within the Partnership framework via the NATO  mechanism is hardly acceptable for Russia. We are interested in  equal partnership with elements of special status.    3. The Partnership must not determine standards of the arms  of the participants.    4. Expenditure on Russia's participation in the PFP must be  entered as a separate line in the federal budget and approved by  the Federal Assembly.    5. In connection with possible affiliation to the  Partnership  the president and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of  Defense of the Russian Federation should take decisive steps to  harmonize questions of the participation therein of CIS  countries, stimulate efforts geared to a strengthening of ties  to the WEU and an expansion of military cooperation within the  CSCE framework, and increase contacts with the Asia-Pacific  region for the creation there of a separate system of collective  security. The Partnership for Peace should not be the sole  instrument of the assurance of military security in Europe and  throughout the Northern hemisphere.    6. An agreement on Russia's membership of the Partnership  must specify its ratification by the Federal Assembly.    There remains, of course, one further question: Will the  government take account of parliament's opinion?    Since it is of a mind to participate in the Partnership for  Peace, the executive has two main paths of advancing this idea.  The first is to subscribe to it, having ignored the  external legislative authority. Technically this is possible, if  the PFP is presented as an international program, not an  agreement requiring ratification. But such a path could hardly  be deemed correct politically, considering the need for  subsequent approval for the financing of the program and the  possibility of the legislators creating an extremely unfavorable  reputation for the Partnership in public opinion. The  second path--more complex, but more promising  also--is to attempt to persuade both the Federal Assembly and  the citizens of Russia of the correctness of one's position.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Letter: Elderly would be bigger NHS burden if private health tax relief removed Sir, Labour's announced intention to withdraw tax relief on private medical insurance for the elderly ('Cook seeks end to tax relief on private treatment', February 11) may well prove to be short-sighted and ill-advised. The 600,000 persons estimated by the Treasury to be benefiting from the tax relief are already facing significant premium increases because of rapidly rising claims costs. If tax relief were withdrawn by a future Labour government, the elderly would face an immediate further substantial price increase of several hundred pounds. This could well be followed by additional increases because of the extra marketing and administration costs which insurers would be forced to carry in reversing the recent tax relief concession. Implementation of the tax relief has itself already cost medical insurers several million pounds. The result of all this could easily be that many elderly people will no longer be able to afford medical insurance and will be forced once again to rely solely on the NHS for treatment. As well as lengthening the waiting list, this would result in a quite considerable extra financial burden on the NHS. Medical insurers pay out more than Pounds 1bn a year in claims to all subscribers. Even if only some of the 600,000 elderly people who currently have tax relief were forced to cancel their cover, the extra cost to the NHS for treating them could dwarf the Pounds 50m 'saved' revenue anticipated by Labour.

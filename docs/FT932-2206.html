			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Bond Funds and PIBs YIELDS ON UK onshore bond funds, have shown little change since we last published the table on May 15, but fund managers have differing views on performance outlook. Bond funds are unit trusts which invest primarily in a range of gilts and the fixed interest securities of large private companies to produce capital and income for investors. Theodora Zemek, fund manager of M &amp; G's gilt income fund, is bullish about gilts because she believes them to be very cheap, mainly because of market fears of an oversupply caused by the government's need for new issues to fund the Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement. The fund, which aims to give a high level of income rather than aiming at 'total return', has been investing in longer dated gilts such as those maturing in 2011 and in some corporate bonds, such as British Gas's 15-year bond. However, David Felder, head of fixed income at Kleinwort Benson, says that since the gilt market has performed strongly in recent years, aided by the drop in base rates, caution is needed. Nevertheless, 'there is room for further mileage because base rates may fall further and gilt yields can come down a little more, leading to an appreciation in the market.' He expects further capital gains, although these will be weak and modest. The initial charge on the fund is 5.5 per cent and the annual fee is 0.5 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000. The minimum investment in M &amp; G's fund is Pounds 500, there is no front-end charge and the annual fee is 0.75 per cent. Permanent Interest Bearing Shares. These are shares issued by a building society to raise capital. Pibs pay a fixed income twice a year net of basic-rate tax. Gains are exempt from CGT unless the Pibs are sold in a packaged unit trust. Pibs are deeply subordinated so that if the society collapsed, holders would be last in the line of creditors. These risks are reflected in the yields, which are higher than for bond funds. Prices have once again increased since the last table on May 15, with a corresponding drop in yields. Newcastle building society launched a second issue of Pibs this week. Simon Mozley, of Hoare Govett, said: 'The new issue came at 240 basis points over the gilt, which is somewhat tight compared to issues by larger societies but it represents a yield pick-up on the existing issue.' Dealers say that spreads on Pibs issues have tightened partly because of strong demand from retail investors.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   Largest 10 UK fixed interest funds  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Fund                             Size       Yield (%)     Perf*                               (poundsm)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Barclays Uni Gilt &amp; Fxd         138.8         8.6         45.6 Axa Eq &amp; Law Gilt &amp; Fxd          73.3         6.1         42.5 Midland Gilt &amp; Fixed             62.0         6.8         39.4 TSB Premier Income               49.6         6.2         38.7 M&amp;G Gilt Income                  38.7         7.7         35.8 CU Preference Share              38.4         7.3         42.5 Kleinwort Ben Gilt Yd            35.7         7.5         37.2 Manulife Gilt &amp; Fxd              32.3         7.5         42.2 Fidelity Gilt &amp; Fixed            25.0         7.7         44.7 Whittingdale Gilt Inc            22.3         7.8         31.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Sector average                   18.7         7.6         37.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Micropal. ????

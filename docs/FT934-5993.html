			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bad loans cloud banks' contrition / Examining another set of miserable figures When Japanese banks announced another set of miserable profits yesterday and took the unusual step of writing-off loan losses, the general intention was to convey the image of an industry that has admitted its weaknesses and is on the road to recovery. That impression was given by Sakura Bank, whose core banking profits slipped 37.9 per cent during the first half. Sakura, aware that banks are blamed by the public for pumping up the financial bubble of the late 1980s, made clear its contrition. 'In the wake of the economic bubble, financial institutions have reconsidered their role in society and have reaffirmed their commitment to fulfilling higher expectations in regard to their social responsibilities and public duties,' the bank humbly explained. But the difficulty in regarding this as a sign that the banks have weathered the worst of the bubble's consequences is that the depth of their bad loans remains unclear. Officially, problem loans rose by 9.6 per cent during the half to September, but the official measure hardly tells the full story of the banks' exposure to a still-weak property market. The failure earlier this month of Muramoto Construction, which had outstanding debts of as much as Y590bn (Dollars 5.51bn), indicated that the nasty surprises are not over. An executive at one Japanese financial company warned yesterday that the commercial property market is in distress, and that the country could face collapses of companies and confidence next year. There is still no accurate guide to the exposure of bank affiliates, which were aggressive lenders during the bubble days. In addition, as the Muramoto case shows, banks are unsure of the exposure of some leading corporate clients, which may have guaranteed loans themselves or used the same piece of property collateral many times over. Apart from coping with the ills of the property market, Japan's banks face a harsher trading environment over the next year. The favourable spreads created by the fall in interest rates over the past two years have shrunk, as was shown by the general 10.6 per cent decline in core business profits announced yesterday. Sumitomo Bank, whose business profits fell by the industry average, explained that its overall spread slipped from 0.39 per cent to 0.31 per cent during the six months from March. With the official discount rate at a record low of 1.75 per cent, there is little room for another interest rate cut over the next year. Another problem for the banks is their old foe, the Tokyo stock market, which has faltered since the end of the first half in September, eroding the banks' unrealised gains on their vast equity holdings. To cover loan losses, the banks have been selling stocks. Dai-Ichi Kangyo, the largest Japanese commercial bank, for example, took profits of Y52.2bn during the period. But the fall in stock prices means that the banks may face losses on some of their equity portfolios, which would need to be written off at the end of the year. Bank stocks have been weak recently, which is another bad sign, as the selling of bank stocks heralded a sharp fall in the market last year. Bond markets have been more sympathetic to the banks. The expectation of lower interest rates pushed bond prices higher, enabling the banks to report large dealing profits. Sumitomo reported profits of Y9.6bn from bond dealing, and Fuji Bank Y7.3bn. The difficult conditions have prompted the industry generally to reduce its exposure to international markets. Revenue from international business fell by an average 14.4 per cent, which was partly explained by the yen's appreciation, but there were falls of 42 per cent at Sakura and 27 per cent at Hokkaido Takushoku Bank. Doubts also remain over the banks' willingness to lend to companies other than their core corporate clients. The Bank of Japan, which has encouraged the write-offs of bad loans, has warned against the banks becoming too risk-averse, slowing the flow of loans needed to fuel economic recovery. But the banks remain committed to the domestic property market. Loans to the property industry at many of the leading 11 banks were steady or rose during the period. Mitsubishi Bank said there are still 'opportunities in the property market' which are not risky and a part of normal banking business. The banks have also been unable to cut their general and administration expenses deeply enough to lift their profits. These expenses rose at some banks, even though the same institutions claimed to be in the middle of a cost-cutting drive. This suggests that branch closures and staff reductions will be needed over the next couple of years.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       INTERIM RESULTS 1993-94 (Ybn)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          Non-performing               Business    Change        Net     Change   loans to total                profit    (percent)    profit   (Percent) loans (percent)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DKB             123.7         8.0       16.2       -44.3       4.12 Sakura          100.0       -37.9       17.4       -37.7       4.05 Sumitomo        157.3       -10.6       30.3       -19.9       3.38 Fuji            158.9        11.9       25.8        -0.5       3.94 Mitsubishi      139.2       -14.8       26.8       -17.8       1.90 Sanwa           176.0       -11.4       39.9        -0.9       2.72 Tokai            86.7       -14.6       11.4       -15.3       4.30 Asahi            72.3        -6.3       10.1       -11.4       2.68 Daiwa            36.6         5.6        8.5       -14.7       3.06 Takugin*         17.1       -25.4        4.4       -27.3       5.39 Tokyo            89.5       -13.1       30.1        28.0       3.03  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Hokkaido Takushoku Bank  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

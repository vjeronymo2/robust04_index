			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA COMES UP WITH O'BANNON ON THE REBOUND  </P> <P> Ed O'Bannon, one of the country's most coveted basketball recruits last season  at Artesia High School in Lakewood, announced Monday that he will enroll next  month at UCLA.  </P> <P> A 6-foot-8 forward, O'Bannon is the second recruit in the last week to spurn  Nevada Las Vegas in favor of the Bruins, joining Shon Tarver, a 6-5 guard from  Santa Clara High in Oxnard.  </P> <P> UNLV, the defending national champion, was banned by the NCAA from postseason  competition next year because of alleged recruiting violations of 13 years ago,  prompting O'Bannon and Tarver to change their minds about enrolling at the  school.  </P> <P> Neither O'Bannon nor Tarver signed letters of intent with UNLV at the  suggestion of Coach Jerry Tarkanian, giving them the option of changing their  minds if UNLV was penalized by the NCAA before the start of the fall semester.  </P> <P> UNLV is still awaiting word on possible sanctions stemming from alleged  improprieties in its recruitment of former New York City prep star Lloyd  Daniels.  </P> <P> O'Bannon is expected to have the greater immediate impact on the UCLA program,  possibly moving into the starting lineup as a freshman in place of Trevor  Wilson, who was drafted last June by the NBA's Atlanta Hawks.  </P> <P> Coach Bill Frieder of Arizona State, who wanted both players, said last winter  that the left-handed O'Bannon was the best player he has ever tried to recruit.  </P> <P> Among Frieder's former recruits are Roy Tarpley of the Dallas Mavericks, Glen  Rice of the Miami Heat and Gary Grant of the Clippers. Three of Frieder's  former recruits at Michigan -- Rumeal Robinson, Loy Vaught and Terry Mills --  were first-round NBA draft picks this year.  </P> <P> "O'Bannon will be a three-time All-American no matter where he goes," Tarkanian  said last week, when O'Bannon was still considering USC, Syracuse and Arizona  State. "If UCLA gets both (O'Bannon and Tarver), they could have the best team  in the country. They'll be so talented, it will be unbelievable."  </P> <P> Said Coach George Raveling of USC, which was said to be O'Bannon's second  choice last spring and again this summer: "My feelings are the same as when he  announced he was going to attend UNLV, except now it gives the Pac-10 two teams  this year with Final Four potential."  </P> <P> With the additions of Tarver and O'Bannon, UCLA is expected to challenge  Arizona next season for the Pac-10 championship.  </P> <P> Last season, the Bruins were 22-11 and reached the East Regional semifinals in  the NCAA tournament before losing to Duke.  </P> <P> "I hope that I can contribute in some small way to the great UCLA basketball  tradition," O'Bannon said in a statement read over the phone to reporters by  his high school coach, Wayne Merino.  </P> <P> O'Bannon and his family were unavailable for comment, referring all inquiries  to UCLA.  </P> <P> O'Bannon averaged 24.6 points, 9.7 rebounds and 3.4 assists a game last season,  leading Artesia to a 29-2 record, the Southern Section 4-A championship and the  state Division II championship.  </P> <P> He was named national high school player of the year by Basketball Times and  state player of the year by Cal-Hi Sports.  </P> <P> In postseason all-star games, he was named most valuable player of the West  team in the Dapper Dan Classic and scored 19 points in the McDonald's All-Star  game.  </P> <P> Last month, he helped the U.S. junior national team win the Championship of the  Americas tournament at Montevideo, Uruguay, averaging 11.5 points a game.  </P> <P> His roommate in Uruguay was Darrick Martin, UCLA's junior point guard and one  of fourreturning starters for the Bruins.  </P> <P> "Darrick is a great spokesman for UCLA basketball and UCLA in general," said  Bruin Coach Jim Harrick, giving credit to Martin for influencing O'Bannon's  decision.  </P> <P> "We feel fortunate," Harrick said. "We got (Tarver and O'Bannon) after some  bizarre things happened. Yeah, we feel very fortunate.  </P> <P> "(But) obviously, they weren't completely satisfied with their (original)  selections because they didn't sign letters of intent."  </P></p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Spain trims intervention rate The Bank of Spain shaved 0.25 per cent off the official intervention rate yesterday, prompting a modest easing of Spanish interest rates and a slight weakening of the peseta, the currency which currently marks the ceiling of the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism (ERM), writes Tom Burns in Madrid. The Bank's decision to lower the rate to 12.4 per cent was judged to be a cautious move by the Madrid market and one which would make life somewhat easier for sterling, the ERM's current floor currency.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The commission set up by the government to control  the implementation of the package of the Latvian-Russian  agreements signed in Moscow at the end of April on the army  withdrawal convened for its first session at the Latvian Cabinet  of Ministers today. At the session, the Latvian Ministry of  Environmental Protection and Regional Development was instructed  to submit to the government session on Tuesday a package of  documents that are necessary to begin the work of the fund for  Skrunda environmental rehabilitation and the repatriation of the  military.    The Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Internal Affairs,  and the Home Guard, for their part, must submit proposals to the  government as early as possible on the organization for guarding  the new building of the Skrunda radar station that will be taken  over.    According to the package of agreements, the Russian Army is  still guarding Skrunda radar facilities and the territory taken  over from Russia. The issue of organizing the guarding of these  facilities will be considered at Tuesday's session of the  Cabinet of Ministers.    After the session today, Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, head  of the commission, visited the Russian Air Force airfield at  Lielvarde. According to the army withdrawal schedule submitted  by Russia, the Russian Army must leave the Lielvarde airfield by  31 July 1994. There are approximately 300 Russian military  stationed at the facility at the moment.    Birkavs is planning to visit the Zvaigznite space  reconnaissance station in Ventspils district next week. This is  one of the three facilities that, together with Liepaja port and  the Skrunda radar station, have been called strategically  important by Russia at the interstate talks.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets AMSTERDAM The Netherlands goes to the polls today and a change of government is expected. Lehman Brothers says that it would be unrealistic to expect swift, radical changes in Dutch politics. Nevertheless, all the serious contenders for a share in governmental power advocate reductions in government expenditure, along with cuts in the cost of real labour and the share of labour in national income. Lehman says the extensive reforms of government expenditure should be good news for financial markets. Bond markets should react favourably to renewed efforts to reduce budget deficits but on balance, there is probably greater scope for reaction in the equity markets. DSM, the petrochemical group is expected today to report a return to profit in the first quarter of 1994 after two loss-making quarters in the second half of 1993. Analysts expect net profits before extraordinary items of Fl 15m - 50m, against Fl 6m in the first quarter of 1993. Philips announces first-quarter results tomorrow. Hoare Govett forecasts a 52 per cent rise in earnings per share, with higher sales compensating for negative price effects and earnings to be positively influenced by currency effects and lower financial charges. FRANKFURT Last week's surprisingly large cut in the repo rate to 5.47 per cent was very encouraging, says James Capel, which notes that over the past two weeks, the rate has fallen by nearly as much as the April 14 discount rate reduction. The broker says a smaller decline in the repo is likely at tomorrow's tender, although the scale of recent falls bodes well for a further cut in the discount rate, probably at the May 26 Bundesbank meeting. Schering has its annual shareholders meeting tomorrow. The drugs group said last month that sales rose 21 per cent in the first two months of this year and forecast earnings for the year would at least match last time's DM254m. MILAN INA, the state insurer, meets today to prepare the ground for its privatisation which is scheduled for late June. The Italian Treasury has not said exactly how much of the insurance group it plans to sell, although INA executives have said they hoped at least 51 per cent would be offered. The company is seeking a listing in Italy and the US.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Davis Service pays Pounds 52m for Mowlem tool hire business DAVIS SERVICE Group is buying the HSS tool hire business from John Mowlem for Pounds 52m to expand its core business after departing from car hire. Davis is raising Pounds 34.7m in a vendor placing and raising the other Pounds 17.3m as debt. The 16.9m new shares will expand Davis's equity by 20 per cent and existing shareholders can apply on a 1-for-5 basis. The issue is priced at 205p, compared with yesterday's opening price of 228p. It gained 2p to close at 230p. The HSS group made Pounds 4.76m operating profit last year on turnover of Pounds 59.9m. About Pounds 38m of net assets are being acquired. Mr John Ivey, Davis's chief executive, said the 170 HSS shops, serving the small builder and DIY market, had provided sufficient profit to offset a small loss in the other part of the acquisition, PB Plant Hire, aimed at construction companies and utilities. In 1990 the business had made Pounds 7.14m profit and it was PB that had declined since then. The acquisition would fit into the site services division, which mainly supplies mobile buildings and last year contributed Pounds 3.42m to operating profits of Pounds 19.4m from continuing activities. Davis is also involved in providing laundry services, workwear and linen hire, and cleaning. Mr Ivey said 75 per cent of the business was rental based. Last year the group substantially reduced its debt after selling the Godfrey Davis car hire business. In December it had net borrowings of Pounds 10.1m, giving gearing of 11 per cent. After the acquisition and share issue pro forma net debt rose to about Pounds 28m for gearing of 25 per cent. Mr Ivey said the group had also arranged a new Pounds 30m revolving loan facility, repayable between 1996 and 1998, 'to give us headroom' for further modest expansion. The placing is organised by Baring Brothers and Kleinwort Benson.</p>

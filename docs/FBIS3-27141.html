			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, February 18 (XINHUA) -- President Bill  Clinton notified Congress today that he is ready to order air  strikes by U.S. planes in Bosnia-Herzegovina if the Serbs failed  to meet the NATO deadline on Sunday [20 February].    The notification came despite Washington's cautious optimism  that the Serbs could remove all their heavy weapons from the  20-kilometer exclusion zone before Sunday.    "I am cautiously, cautiously optimistic about the  developments of the last few days," Defense Secretary William  Perry said today.    Perry is scheduled to join defense chiefs of five other  European allies for a meeting on Bosnia at the Aviano Air Base  in Italy on Sunday before the NATO deadline expires.    The Bosnian Serbs announced that they would withdraw all  heavy weapons from Sarajevo before Saturday, one day before the  expiration of the NATO deadline, after Russia promised to send  its troops to help implement the ceasefire in the city.    Washington welcomed Russia's efforts but insisted that no  extension would be allowed for the NATO deadline.    "The important thing at this point is to see actions from  the  Serbs, because in the past we've seen plenty of words," State  Department Spokesman Mike McCurry said.    There are reports that the Bosnian Serbs are pulling out  mortars and other heavy weapons from the capital that they have  surrounded for 22 months.    However, U.S. officials said reports from the ground were  inconclusive and they would "wait and see" if the Serbs would  indeed fully comply with the NATO ultimatum.    "There is no change in the NATO ultimatum at all," McCurry  said.    "We will be watching very closely this weekend what the  Serbs  are doing to comply because they know exactly what they have to  do, they know what will happen if they don't comply," he added.    At the White House, Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said, "The  test will be their (the Serbs') actions on the ground."    "The test has not changed," Myers said.    Clinton told Congress that more than 60 aircraft are  available for participation in the authorized NATO missions.    The formal notification followed a meeting of Clinton's top  security staff at the White House on the Bosnian situation.    A war powers act requires the president to notify Congress  any time he sends or plans to send U.S. troops to war.</p>

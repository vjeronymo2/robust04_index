			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / 'Open skies' accord could set trend THE 'open skies' agreement between the US and the Netherlands reached on Friday should be a mould-breaking accord and a model for future aviation pacts. It is expected to intensify the controversy in Europe over negotiation of future bilateral aviation agreements with the US. Instead of the usual bilateral restrictions on destinations to which carriers can fly, KLM, the Netherlands' flagship carrier, for example essentially gains authority to fly into any US city. US carriers will be offered unrestricted access to any Dutch destination. Mr Andrew Card, the new US transportantion secretary, described it as 'a very significant event in international aviation' while 'a dream treaty' was the description from Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen, the Dutch transport minister. But while this may not be the last 'open skies' agreement signed in the near future, there now seems little likelihood that a host of similar deals will follow - especially with more significant European nations. Relations between the US and France on aviation reached a low ebb this summer as the French demanded tighter control on US carriers' insatiable appetite for international access. The position with Germany is broadly similar. British Airways, the UK's flagship carrier, currently stands accused of sneaking around bilateral restrictions with its plan to invest Dollars 750m in USAir, a sizable US domestic carrier, in return for a minority stake. 'Open skies' has been a clarion call in US aviation policy for many months. It has, however, been prompted by self-interest rather than high-minded principle. As US airlines know to their cost, travel within the domestic market is depressed. The big US carriers such as American, United and Delta have spent hundreds of millions of dollars acquiring international route authorities. And, for once, luck was on the buyers' side: financial problems at the likes of Pan Am and Trans World Airlines turned these airlines - once flagships for the US industry abroad - into forced sellers. But the large surviving US airlines would like to do more than merely take over the routes which their ailing brethen used to serve. The obstacle is restrictive bilateral agreements which govern the access of airlines to non-domestic markets. Hence, the pressure for 'open skies'. The US transportation department a month ago summarised the key provisions of 'open skies' as: Open entry and unrestricted capacity or frequency on all routes - including the right to operate services between any point in the US and any point in the relevant foreign country. Flexible fare-setting arrangements. Liberal charter and cargo arrangements. Open code-sharing opportunties and non-discriminatory access to computer reservation systems. The right of any carrier to run its own handling operations at the overseas airport. The ability to convert and remit overseas earnings. However, the DoT's final order then muddied the waters. First, government officials suggested that 'depending on the characteristics of a particular bilateral relationship, we might find that additional elements beyond those listed ..would have to be included'. Second, they said that they would assess case-by-case whether each criterion had to be present for an 'open skies' relationship to exist. Some industry watchers view these qualifications as a disappointment. 'The entire effort to develop a firm definition of open skies appears to have been a waste of time,' said Avmark, the US-based aviation consultancy, 'since decisions will still be made on a case-by-case basis, permitting flexible interpretion of the eleven points, and taking into account other factors, such as airline ownership and control.' The thorny matter of foreign ownership is, in fact, left out on the 'open skies' definition altogether. At present, US rules limit foreigners to a 25 per cent voting interest in any US carrier, although equity stakes of up 49 per cent can be held without automatically being deemed foreign control. Some parties had urged the DoT to make liberal ownership provisions part of any 'open skies' agreeement. But, again, the DoT fudged: 'We feel that the best way to proceed is to address these matters on a case-by-case basis,' it said. Yet, in the light of the BA-USAir plan, it seems that ownership and control are becoming the relevant subjects. US carriers, having read the fine details of the BA investment agreement, note that its board presence would allow it to block all key decisions to be made by USAir - its annual budget, for example, or big capital expenditures. Moreover, they contend, if BA is allowed to make the purchase, this 'controlling interest' in USAir, the British government will have no incentive to negotiatea more liberal bilateral agreement. If the nation's only major airline has effective access to the US market, why should it be moved to grant US carriers be granted additional inroads into the UK? BA retorts that this is all anti-competitive, driven by the Big Three's desire to maintain dominance in their domestic market and starve USAir - debt-burdened and lossmaking - of new capital. The European commission is pressing for development of a common European external aviation policy to coincide with the European single market next year, and to enable the EC to negotiate as a block aviation accords with other industrial blocks like the US and Japan. But EC officials have warned that unilateral action by some member countries risks undermining this move towards a common aviation policy. They also fear some member states may negotiate new bilaterals with the US, which may be favourable to their national flag-carriers but would weaken the broader interests of the Community at large. Meanwhile, the DoT has yet to rule on the BA/USAir deal - indeed, it has not even determined a procedure for the decision-making. The skies may be opening in Holland, but elsewhere the clouds are just gathering.</p>

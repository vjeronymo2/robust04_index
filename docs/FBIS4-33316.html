			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 4 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Sandinist leader Victor  Tirado said today that the U.S. congressmen who have been in  Managua since Thursday "have come to pressure the Nicaraguan  Government into altering the country's political and economic  course."    "I have no doubt that Robert (Torricelli, one of the mission  members) came to press for political asylum in Nicaragua for  some of the Haitians," added Tirado, one of the 15 members of  the National Directorate of the Sandinist National Liberation  Front.    Torricelli, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Cass Ballenger,  a  Republican from North Carolina, are on a five-day visit to  Nicaragua to examine the problem of U.S. citizens whose  properties were seized by the Sandinist regime.    The U.S. "pressures" Tirado spoke about were denied on  Friday by Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal, who said:  "We like people to visit the country so they can see what is  going on in Nicaragua."    The problem faced by North Americans, who are demanding that  Violeta Chamorro's administration return the properties  confiscated by the Sandinists, is the leading problem between  the United States and Nicaragua. A failure to resolve this  conflict may lead to the blocking of an estimated $60 million in  U.S. economic aid to Nicaragua this year.    "Torricelli did not come to Nicaragua because it occurred to  him to defend the North Americans, but to exert pressure in  various ways for an alteration of the country's political and  economic course, Tirado said on a "Radio Sandino" talk show.    The Sandinist leader attributed this new round of U.S.  pressures to the traditional custom of Nicaraguan politicians  who "believe in resolving every problem in Washington." "We  must gradually change this attitude," Tirado said, after  pointing out the need to engage the U.S. officials in  discussions involving trade relations and investments and to  review treaties with them and contemplate a new relationship  between Managua and Washington.    According to Tirado, the presence of the U.S. legislative  mission in Managua should be taken advantage of to "discuss  trade relations (with Torricelli) instead of allowing ourselves  to be strung along by his views or his pressure." According to  "commander" Tirado, considering the correlation of forces in  today's world, gone are the days when the United States could  view Central America as its "backyard." "If these countries  (Central America) allow themselves to be called a backyard, it  means it is an opinion they share," added the leader, who also  pointed out that the countries in this region should function as  a bloc to preclude pressures from the United States.    Torricelli and Ballenger met last night with President  Violeta Chamorro, but after the meeting they refused to talk to  reporters. The U.S. congressmen also met with Managua Archbishop  Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo and this weekend will pursue an  agenda of meetings with representatives from various sectors.    The Association of Nicaraguan-American Owners of Confiscated  Property [Asociacion de Confiscados Americanos de Nicaragua],  formed by 650 Nicaraguan-Americans, is demanding the return of  1,400 properties valued at approximately $600 million. Roberto  Vassalli, president of the association, told reporters that in  four years the Chamorro administration has only resolved 20  claims "to the full satisfaction" of the organization's members.    On 29 April the "Helms-Gonzalez" amendment went into effect  in the United States; this amendment establishes a 30 July  deadline before which all countries must return confiscated  properties to U.S. citizens.    Vassalli said that the association also supports thousands  of  Nicaraguans who are demanding the return of properties seized by  the Sandinists during the past decade.</p>

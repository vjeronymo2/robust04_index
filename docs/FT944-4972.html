			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Scottish &amp; Newcastle Over the past two years, shares in Scottish &amp; Newcastle have risen 22 per cent against the brewery sector. The reasons are clear: it has made a series of well-timed and well-executed strategic moves. It pulled out of hotels at the right moment and diversified effectively into the continental European leisure industry. It also had the nerve to buy the Chef &amp; Brewer pub chain at a price which competitors deemed high, but which now looks reasonable. The figures yesterday were short on detail but the message was clear - the integration of Chef &amp; Brewer is proceeding better than planned. Annual cost savings should amount to an ample Pounds 14m by the end of the year. That said, without the first time contribution from Chef &amp; Brewer, the group would have struggled to produce much growth in either earnings or operating profits. Even if problems in malting accounted for half the decline in beer profits, the underlying business was subject to a familiar squeeze in margins. The industry backdrop remains challenging. Competition in the beer market is intense, volumes are falling as the drift to wines and spirits continues. The absence of a 'feel-good' factor means that there is little likelihood of a swift pick-up in retail profits as the economy recovers. The shares now enjoy a market rating and the outperformance is unlikely to continue.</p>

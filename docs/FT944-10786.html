			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: More confused Sir, Norman Lamont describes the Conservative backbenchers who forced the U-turn over Post Office privatisation as 'a taxi-full of flotsam and bobtail' ('Tory right threatens EU revolt after retreat on postal sell-off', November 7). What a confusing use of English. Does he mean 'flotsam and jetsam'? Or is the phrase he is grappling for 'rag, tag and bobtail'? Mind you, he wasn't much good with figures either. Paul Richards, 109 Hammersmith Bridge Road, London W6 9DA</p>

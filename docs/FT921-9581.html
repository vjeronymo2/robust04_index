			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems step up pact demands - Hung Parliament LIBERAL Democrats would press for at least one cabinet post if they formed a pact with either Labour or the Tories in a hung parliament. Party strategists have decided that the conditions they have set already for a post-election deal - legislation to introduce proportional representation and agreement on a four-year programme of government - would require Liberal Democrats holding ministerial office. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, will step up his party's campaign for constitutional reform today with a policy launch combining proposals on electoral systems, a bill of rights and Scottish devolution. He has previously said a bill on proportional representation would be a prerequisite for any pact agreement, but has so far stopped short of insisting on a cabinet post. Senior Liberal Democrats confirmed, however, that they are determined that any pact must yield tangible gains for the party if their support among voters is not to be jeopardised. The lesson learnt from the 1977-78 Lib-Lab pact, when the then Liberal party sustained the Labour government of Mr James Callaghan but failed to will many policy changes, is that negotiations will have to be far tougher. Liberal Democrats would have to be subject to the disciplines of government office and have the same access to information and advice as their larger coalition partners. In the 1977-78 pact, Liberal MPs often felt outmanoeuvred by Labour ministers backed by civil servants. There appears to be no preference among Liberal Democrats for heading any particular department - although offers of a cabinet post without portfolio would probably be rejected as meaningless. The home secretary's job might be a possibility if it was overseeing constitutional reform. Liberal Democrats yesterday previewed a general election poster with the slogan: 'No wonder Britain's ill, it has a bad constitution.' It is the first part of a week-long 'good government' campaign. Later, the party revived a campaign dating back to the Lib-Lab pact for proportional representation in elections to the European parliament. This week the party will take the European parliament to the European Court of Justice for failing to initiate electoral reform in the EC. Mr Andrew Duff, legal campaign leader, said he wanted the court to force the EC to start a reform process in time for the 1994 European elections: 'If the European Community has not helped to modernise Britain's electoral system by then, the European parliament will be a joke.' Sir Russell Johnston, Liberal Democrat EC spokesman, said: 'It is scandalous that British Liberal Democrats, who form the largest Liberal party in Europe, have been excluded from the European parliament by the perverse and reactionary nature of 'first-past-the-post'.'</p>

			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (1): Adjusting to a new climate - The dollar's sharp rise since February and the weakness of the D-Mark have shown once again how the foreign exchange market is good for surprises. But the market is experiencing changes which could mean that its boom years are over LIKE much of the financial world, the foreign exchange markets are going through a difficult adjustment to the far more sober business climate of the 1990s after the excesses of the opulent eighties. Overall profits are thought to have fallen in the sector last year, exposing excess capacity and forcing some smaller operators to quit the market. Even the dollar pyrotechnics of this year's first quarter have given the market little solace. The dollar's sharp fall against the D-Mark to new all time lows of around DM1.443 in mid-February and its subsequent 18 per cent rise in the seven weeks before Easter caught the market unprepared and so ill-placed to convert the turnaround into profit. The dollar's sudden surge was instructive, however. It largely reflected a one-off shift in investor sentiment in favour of the US after the Gulf war. Coming after a lengthy period in which the impact of interest rates on interbank trading had been the dominant influence on exchange rate movements, the dollar's remarkable rise was a timely reminder to foreign exchange traders that they ignore underlying investor sentiment, the purchasing power of currencies and economic and geo-political fundamentals at their peril. 'It was a classic case of the interbank market and genuine financial flows finding themselves at loggerheads', comments Mr Paul Chertkow, chief currency strategist with Citibank in London. The dollar surge began only days after the official discount rates in Germany and the US 'crossed over'. On January 31, the Bundesbank raised its discount rate by one half percentage point to 6.5 per cent and its more important lombard emergency funding rate by the same amount to 9 per cent. The following day, the US Federal Reserve cut its discount rate to 6 per cent from 6.5 per cent. On past experience, those rate changes would have pointed to continued dollar weakness. But such considerations took no account of the animal spirits aroused by US-led victory in the Gulf and a growing perception among long term investors, such as pension funds, that the US had become a land of cheap buying opportunities after a protracted dollar fall. These factors combined with a growing understanding of Germany's difficulties absorbing eastern Germany to release a flow of foreign portfolio capital in the direction of the US. That mood swing showed that the foreign exchange markets are always good for surprises. Not only interbank traders were caught out. The chartists, who try to assess future exchange rate trends on the strength of currency movements, were also wrong footed. But on the whole, the past two years have been remarkable for the relative stability of currencies in the face of striking geo-political change. In the early 1970s, the western world entered a protracted economic crisis with the unleashing of inflationary pressures world-wide, the first oil crisis and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. The result was a bonanza for foreign exchange traders as countries pursued 'beggar thy neighbour' economic and trade policies and currencies entered a decade and a half of wild fluctuation. Nearly 20 years later, the collapse of communism in eastern Europe, the mounting economic and political problems of the Soviet Union, the end of the 1980s boom in the industrial world and the outbreak of war in the Gulf might have been expected to create similar shock waves in the West's currency markets. This was not the case. By the time the iron curtain fell, the West had got its act together. All industrialised countries today pursue broadly similar economic policies that give priority to the combatting of inflation and encouragement of private enterprise rather than the pursuit of economic growth and full employment as ends in themselves. These lessons are now being adopted by the newly emergent democracies of eastern Europe and in much of the developing world. In the European Community, economic convergence has contributed to remarkable stability in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System since the last significant parity realignment more than four years ago. Sterling, having joined the system's wider 6 per cent fluctuation band last October, has rarely moved beyond 2.25 per cent either side of its DM2.95 central rate. Economic policy co-ordination, as practised by the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada in the Group of Seven, has emerged as a key factor influencing the foreign exchange markets. Since September 1985, the big industrialised countries have attempted to influence exchange rate movements through co-ordinated currency intervention, backed by frequent private discussions among G7 finance ministers and central bankers on economic policy issues. There is little doubt that the central banks have become progressively more adept in their efforts to influence currency movements. The G7 attempt to stabilise currencies through the so-called Louvre Accord of February 1987 involved massive intervention and the acceptance of distortions in financial markets that may have helped trigger the global stock market crash later that year. Since then the G7 have learned to be more pragmatic, seeking to curb wild currency fluctuations rather than defend target zones for currencies. As a result, relatively small scale intervention by the central banks managed first to brake the dollar's fall in February and then to induce a pause in its rise around Easter. G7 intervention is most effective when it reflects the clear political will of all members to steer currencies. Such determination has been less apparent as the dollar has risen. But changes in the internatiuonal banking industry have meant that the markets have punished the G7 less harshly than in the past for signs of disarray. Banks have become more risk averse in all their activities, including foreign exchange, reflecting their need to maintain strict capital adequacy standards. This safety-first trend has been enhanced by losses in the wake of falling stock market values in Japan and recession in the Anglo-Saxon countries. Attitudes and conditions have changed rapidly. The foreign exchange business was hugely profitable between the Plaza Agreement of September 1985, when the US, Japan, Germany, Britain and France agreed on joint action to depress the then overvalued dollar, and the 1987 Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies. 'There was a one way bet on the dollar and people built up their foreign exchange operations because it was easy money,' says Mr Michael Burton, heaf of corporate sales in the treasury department of the Hongkong Bank in London. In their gloomier moments, many market participants now wonder whether the foreign exchanges will ever recapture the speculative fervour and sparkling profits of the 1970s and early 1980s. Traders and economists now talk of a market which seems to have its boom years behind it and where activity is becoming increasingly concentrated among a few large banks. On the plus side, the liberalisation of eastern Europe may mean that currencies such as the Polish zloty, Hungarian forint and Romanian lei will be fully convertible and actively traded in centres such as London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, New York and Singapore in a few years' time. But the drive for economic and monetary union in Europe could mean the disappearance of west European currencies if and when the European Community adopts a single currency and central bank. Add to this the incipient tendency for other parts of the world to move in the direction of regional economic groupings such as the free trade area being negotiated between the US, Canada and Mexico, and it is easy to see why banks active in foreign exchange are increasingly seeking the stability provided by a solid customer base.

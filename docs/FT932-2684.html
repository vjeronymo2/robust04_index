			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Bund prices ease amid debate over interest rate cut HEATED debate over whether Germany will cut interest rates today was the focus for government bond traders and analysts throughout Europe. The consensus by the close of trading was in favour of no change and the view prompted German bund prices to end weaker on balance. The bund future for September reflected the tussle of views. It opened at 94.97, was bought up to 95.18 on rate cut hopes and then sold back to 94.80 on currency factors before recovering slightly to close at 94.90 in London. There was some disappointment that the weekly repo rate was left unchanged at 7.6 per cent, but the real damage was done by the surge in the dollar against the D-Mark. The two pfennig rise sprang from a shift of money into the US currency on comments from an official Bonn source that the government was not worried about the D-Mark's level. Mr Julian Callow, a European economist with Kleinwort Benson, said: 'In some respects the worst fears of the Bundesbank concerning the intentions of foreign investors have been realised.' THE net slide in German long-dated bonds was countered by a rise in the French equivalents. The disparate moves resulted in a new historic low for the OAT-bund yield spread which narrowed by two basis points to 0.16. On the Matif, French June futures opened strongly and broke through a key resistance level to hit 118.92 before profit-taking took it back to 118.86, up four basis points on the day. UK government bonds performed strongly yesterday as dealers focused on the deflationary pressure of actual and expected economic data. The market shrugged off Tuesday's 'Mansion House' speech on the economy by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. However, a fall of 0.2 per cent in retail sales against expectations of a rise reversed any concerns that inflation might be about to take off. It also came ahead of the latest unemployment data which are expected to show a month-on-month rise of 10,000 after recent falls and add to pressure for a further interest rate cut to kick-start the economy. Short-dated gilts were sluggish but at the long end they were ahead by around and gilt futures for September rose  3/8 to 104 25/32 by the close. IN THE high yielding European markets, Spanish government bonds picked up sharply as the market took heart from a meeting between Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, and a representative of the communist-led United Left as well as rate cut optimism. The yield on the 10.3 per cent bond due June 2002 fell 18 basis points to 10.52 per cent. DUTCH government bonds ended marginally lower across the curve as the Ministry of Finance announced that its new 6.25 per cent state bond maturing in July 1998 had raised Fl 9bn in three days. US Treasury prices were flat-to-firmer across the board yesterday as the market struggled to establish a new trading range in the wake of the recent good inflation figures. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/8 at 103 15/32 , yielding 6.811 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 3/32 , to yield 4.057 per cent. The day's economic news had little impact on sentiment. Industrial production rose 0.2 per cent in May, while capacity utilisation was unchanged at 81.6 per cent. May housing starts, meanwhile, rose 2.4 per cent. The data was broadly in line with analysts' expectations, and made little impression on dealers and investors, who were hoping in vain yesterday that the market would establish a decisive new trading range after the easing of inflation concerns.</p>

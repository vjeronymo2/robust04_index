			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: Eager to pluck the tempting cherry - Why Arthur Andersen wants a merger with BDO Binder Hamlyn When Mr Jim Wadia became managing partner of Arthur Andersen, the UK's fourth largest accountancy firm, in September last year, he set to work immediately on his plans for expansion. Seven months later - and sooner than he might have wished - his target became publicly known: a proposed merger with BDO Binder Hamlyn, the eighth largest firm. The idea, which Binder partners are debating this week, provides some insights into the structure of the two firms and the state of the UK accountancy profession overall. Last summer Andersen released fee income figures of Pounds 388.6m which helped it to jump up the league table of the largest firms to become fourth biggest and only Pounds 2m below Ernst &amp; Young, the third in size. It was also the only firm to report growth among the 'Big Six' - up by 17.4 per cent. However, Andersen remains frustrated. The UK - as well as Japan and Germany  -were the three areas where the firm's presence in significant economies was limited. This reflected a history of later development in these - sometimes heavily regulated - countries. Andersen, the only Big Six firm to start in the US rather than the UK, began operating in the UK only in the 1950s. It also irritates the firm that rivals often point out that the bulk of Andersen's UK business derives from its consulting arm rather than from core audit, tax and accounting work. In addition, Andersen missed out on much of the fee income garnered by its rivals for advice on privatisation and other government work during the 1980s. The reason was its audit of De Lorean, the fraudulent sports car manufacturer in Northern Ireland, in which the government invested substantial sums and then sued the auditor in an attempt to gain redress. Andersen has had no public contracts since then. Binder, therefore, was a logical target for Mr Wadia. Growth by acquisition would allow Andersen to expand most quickly. Below the Big Six, the next largest firm is Grant Thornton, which has a specialist niche concentrating on owner-managed businesses. After that comes Binder, modelled far more closely on the Big Six structure. It is one of the last tempting cherries for the larger firms, which are increasingly monopolising work for quoted companies of any size. Certainly Andersen sees its future non-organic growth coming from individual partners and small practice specialisms from other firms. Mr Wadia viewed Binder as tempting because it still has a large and loyal client base with more than 100 quoted companies of note and some highly regarded professionals and partners. It also has what Andersen does not: a private client base and significant government work. Although Binder has periodically been subject to rumours about its financial strength it is now said to be profitable. It has certainly proved tempting to other firms, which have periodically held talks for a possible merger. Mr Wadia wanted to take the initiative. He also reasoned that Binder's advantages could not last as growing competition between the larger firms began to erode its client base. Between 1992 and 1993, Binder dropped from seventh to eighth place by income, with a drop of 5.2 per cent to Pounds 108.5m. It has also failed to diversify as far as other practices, with audit a high 60.5 per cent of fee income, and relatively underdeveloped insolvency and consulting arms. These tentative conclusions formed the basis for a recommendation to the senior executives of the firm in Europe and the US who gave Mr Wadia approval to go ahead in February. That led to his discussions with a core group of Binder partners, and a formal offer last month. What Mr Wadia had perhaps not fully known was how differently structured Binder is to Andersen. There are 11 regional partnerships, each jealously guarding their independence from one another. Press reports of Mr Wadia's approach before some of these regional managing partners were even aware of the bid cannot have helped. In the next few days, each of the regional partnerships will be presented with a heads of agreement document fleshing out the proposals, and will be asked to vote for it. There will also be a vote of its 220 national partners, to determine issues such as who will be able to use the Binder name. Still under negotiation are topics such as how the costs of potential future litigation against the firm will be spread, and the terms on which Binder partners would join Andersen - notably, how many will become full partners in Andersen's worldwide organisation. While Binder claims that there will be no significant job losses, some fall-out is inevitable. Andersen is highly profitable for partners because its leverage is so high. The professional-to-partner ratio is the highest among all the UK's accountants at 15. Binder's is one of the lowest, at 7.4. For Andersen too, the merger will not be easy. It will be faced with integrating a large firm formed through a series of mergers and with very different traditions and culture. Most of its own professionals have by contrast worked all their lives for Andersen. One exception is Mr Wadia himself, who trained as a barrister before joining the firm as a tax specialist. If the merger goes ahead, Andersen will also have to be careful not to alienate key Binder partners who have close relationships with clients, which they may take away with them if they leave. As a result, Andersen has been careful to offer Binder the chance, at least initially, to retain its name and identity in a merged firm. Binder is telling its clients that there will be no material changes to staffing, costs or its approach. Quite how this will work in practice remains to be seen. The merger may prove too difficult for some of the smaller firms in the Binder network who want to maintain their independence. Nonetheless, Binder's largest and most important regional firms - London and Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and Newcastle - have indicated their enthusiasm, and Andersen will be willing to proceed even if only London and Leeds wants to go ahead.</p>

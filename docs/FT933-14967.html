			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Bosnia Moslems form federal plan BOSNIA'S collective presidency said yesterday it had agreed on the outline of a plan to create a federation out of the war-torn republic, as the chief UN relief official yesterday warned that humanitarian operations in Bosnia were in jeopardy. 'They (presidency members) agreed the constitutional make-up of Bosnia-Hercegovina should be along the lines of a federal state in which all citizens of three nationalities will have equal rights,' said a statement, read out by Moslem vice-president Ejup Ganic after the talks in Zagreb, the Croatian capital. The announcement, agreed after two days of debate, is likely to be rejected by Serb and Croat leaders, who have eagerly backed the republic's ethnic partition. The Bosnian plan rejects the principle of ethnic division and says provinces would have to be worked out on economic lines. Serb leaders at the weekend reiterated warnings that the Moslems would be left with nothing if they rejected a three-way partition. Moslems have opposed the division of Bosnia fearing it will leave them in economically unviable reservations. Most of the 10-member presidency has opposed the Serbo-Croat plan to divide the republic along ethnic lines despite the urging for an agreement from international peace mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg or face disaster in the winter. Mrs Sadako Ogata, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said the Bosnian operation was running out of money and called for a conference in Geneva on Friday to discuss the problems impeding the relief effort. While she did not say the UNHCR would pull out of Bosnia, she accused all sides of sabotaging the relief operation. Her remarks came as water supplies dipped dangerously low in Sarajevo because Serb besiegers were blocking fuel tanks from reaching the Bosnian capital. The fuel was earmarked for water pumps to supply Sarajevo. Doctors fear outbreaks of typhoid and dysentery in the city, which has been deprived of electricity as well as water. A UN official in Sarajevo said Bosnian defenders refuse to restore a supply grid which would also revive a Serb arms factory in the suburb of Vogosca. The official said Serbs, meanwhile, were refusing to repair a key power line from the Kakanj area in Moslem-held central Bosnia until Moslem snipers stopped targeting the Vogosca link.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lanzhou, March 25 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's  Gansu Province has decided to adopt a series of measures to help  residents living in the province's poverty-hit southern areas to  become prosperous over the coming seven years.    The mountainous southern areas are far from towns and suffer  from backward transport, farming methods and education. Lacking  supplies of piped water and electricity, these areas also suffer  serious soil erosion and frequent natural disasters. They also  have a large number of mentally retarded people and people  disabled by endemic diseases.    Statistics show that the residents of these areas have a per  capita net income of below 300 yuan (about 30 U.S. dollars) a  year, and have long depended on relief funds and grain from the  central government.    According to local officials, the province will earmark more  money in the coming seven years for the building of farmland  conservancy works, projects for providing drinking water to  local residents and livestock and for the installation of more  transmission lines of electricity for these areas.    At the same time, they will also be urged to plant more  trees, and strengthen the harnessing of small rivers, in a bid  to improve the environment for agriculture and to make the local  residents in these areas become self-sufficient in grain.    Efforts will also be made to encourage local farmers become  market-conscious and grow more cash crops. The farmers will  also be encouraged to set up more rural and township enterprises  near town and county seats and along highways, with the purpose  of tapping natural resources in their localities.    In addition, the province will implement on a trial basis  the  policy of letting economic entities, cadres and other  individuals contract the construction of help-the-poor projects  in the southern areas so as to make more residents in the  poverty-hit areas get well-off as soon as possible.</p>

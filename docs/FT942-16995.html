			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Observer: Turkish front Aysegul Nadir, divorced twice from fugitive business tycoon Asil Nadir, is not known for her discretion. The former beauty queen is using her charms via a telephone hotline to raise money for young Turkish patriots fighting in the armed forces against the Kurds. Donations are to be sent to account number 25440 at an Istanbul branch of Impexbank. Isn't this the bank her ex-hubby once owned and allegedly used to channel Polly Peck funds into his personal and private business activities?</p>

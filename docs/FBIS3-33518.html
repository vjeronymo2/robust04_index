Nearly everything  ranging from the closure of banks to intervention in financial  consortiums, including state loans with federal guarantees is  decided by the CMN. Central Bank [BC] President Pedro Malan said  the economic team believes the CMN has suffered hypertrophy, and  it wants to simplify it by transforming it into a forum for  debates and the creator of norms and the main guidelines for the  monetary policy and the financial system.    The changes in the CMN should take place together with the  process of the BC's independence, once a new special director is  appointed so he can guide discussions about the reform in  Congress. The CMN is made up of government and private sector  representatives.  <H5>  Defense of the Currency </H5>   The council's composition will not be changed. Private  sector  representatives will continue to participate but the CMN's  priority will be to defend the currency by supervising the  monetary policy and controlling the monetary base's expansion.    The CMN is also one of the organizations that judges  transgressions in the financial system. Bank directors, for  example, can resort to the CMN to protest a prohibition  determined by the BC. The judgment processes are slow and the  sanctions, when they are issued, come with years of delay. The  BC is considering making the CMN speedier. The CMN would,  therefore, lose its jurisdiction over such matters. Control of  the banks will remain a responsibility of a more independent BC.    The economic team's objective is to mark the independence of  the monetary authority when the monetary standard changes in  Brazil. The strong currency defended by Finance Minister  Fernando Henrique Cardoso implies an autonomous body to defend  its strength. Malan hopes that the new BC directors with a fixed  mandate will be defined by the end of the current administration.</p>

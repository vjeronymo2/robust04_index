			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] This year began with signs of uncertainty and a  certain lack of confidence on the part of the country's  businessmen.    Many of them are expecting that sales will show little  dynamism and that employment and investment will decline.  However, a majority hope that inflation will continue to  decline, or will at least stabilize.    These expectations were revealed in the results of a survey  of the private businessmen in various zones of the country  published in the local journal EKOS. In addition, the report  notes that these are indications that the economic program of  the government has reached a key point--one from which it could  either advance or retreat.    The chart shows some of the indicators of the expectations  of  the businessmen as determined by the survey published in the  journal in question.    The atmosphere of pessimism among the nation's private  businessmen with regard to the economic prospects of Ecuador for  this year, which might mean that the nation has reached a key  point in its stabilization process, was revealed by the results  of the survey of 80 executives in the industrial, trade, and  banking sectors throughout our national territory.    While inflation was regarded as the most serious national  problem until six months ago, economic growth and employment are  beginning to emerge as the main concerns today. That is what was  shown by the survey carried out by the journal EKOS, which  published its first issue a few days ago in Quito under editor  Pablo Lucio Paredes. He had served previously as the secretary  of the CONADE [National Council for Development] under the  current government.    None of the businessmen indicated a level of optimism of  more  than 50 points, while more than 70 percent of them gave their  optimism a rating of between 0 and 35 percent.    From the survey, one can conclude that 82 percent of the  businesses plan investment at levels that will increase their  assets by as much as 10 percent. This figure will merely serve  to maintain the current level of installed capacity if  technological and physical depreciation are taken into account.    In this connection, the survey shows, 1993 was a better year  than 1994 will be, although the difference between the two years  is not a major one, meaning that investments seem "not to have  awakened from their prolonged lethargy."    According to the results of the survey, the textile sector  represents an exception. After having seen major growth in sales  in 1993, this sector is planning a recovery in 1994, although  the year will be characterized by an acceleration in the process  of reducing personnel and incremental price reductions. A  similar exception is made where automotive enterprises are  concerned, as they take an optimistic view of their future.    On the other hand, the survey notes, the metal-mechanical  sector reveals negative growth, a decline in employment, and a  small increase in prices as a result of competition.  <H5>  Unemployment Persists </H5>   In the job sector, the survey warns that 45 percent of those  questioned plan personnel reductions, and only 16 percent have  planned to increase the number of employees by more than 5  percent.    In conclusion, stabilization continues to be accompanied by  dwindling employment, the survey notes.    Where the foreign-exchange market is concerned, the survey  indicates that 25 percent of those surveyed expect the rate to  rise to more than 2,500 sucres; about 50 percent believe that it  will reach that level; 30 percent maintain that the dollar will  not exceed 2,400 sucres; and another third believe it will not  exceed 2,300 sucres.    As to the active interest rates, 72 percent of those  surveyed  believe that they will not exceed 40 percent.    The weighted average of this indicator in 1993 was 41  percent, while that anticipated for 1994 is 36 percent. This  means that there is a clear expectation of a decline in  financial costs, according to the analysis.    The report comments that the movement from stabilization  toward growth is necessary from the point of view of social  balance, but it cautions that the tremendous fragility involved  in the early stages of a process of this nature must be borne in  mind. More profound modernization and structural reforms are  recommended.</p>

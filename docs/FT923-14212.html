			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Political Notebook: A time for radicalism NOW is the time for audacity: for the government to think about risky and unpopular decisions. It is hardly a welcome thought for Mr John Major as he peers through the gloom enveloping the economy into his party's renewed hostilities over Europe. His post-election honeymoon has been one of the shortest on record. Instead of pausing to rest and reflect, ministers have been trapped in the familiar business of tactical fire-fighting. There is no sense of panic. The prime minister is irritated but essentially unruffled by the sporadic outbreaks of dissent on the Tory backbenches. The message is that the government will play it long: over Europe and the economy, over Canary Wharf, even over such minor issues as the LSE's bid to occupy the former County Hall. Whitehall is awash with committees chaired by Lord Wakeham, the cabinet's fixer-in-chief. Mr Major, committed as ever to the ERM and to Maastricht, is prepared for a fractious rather than celebratory party conference. Colleagues share the judgment that the electorate had enough of Maoist-style permanent revolution during the late 1980s. The government's plans to shake up the public sector may be no less radical for their deliberate incrementalism. But there is a suspicion also that ministers have not adjusted their focus since April 9. Tory backbenchers, always uneasy about inaction, want a firmer sense of the government's agenda. Some 18 months of electioneering have produced instant reflexes, but too few ministers appreciate that victory has given them the most precious commodity in politics: sufficient time to first annoy and then placate the electorate. If vested interests and conventional orthodoxies are to be challenged and the tax system shaken up, the momentum must be established within the first year of a new parliament. Mr Kenneth Clarke, a shrewd cabinet heavyweight, has grasped the point. His inquiry into policing heralds a radicalism in the government's approach to law and order from which Lady Thatcher recoiled. His determination to abolish the Edmund-Davies pay formula will provoke a row with the police next year. So, too, will his plans to break the prison officers union's grip on the nation's prisons. But it should all be forgotten by 1996. Elsewhere there is less certainty. At education, Mr John Patten has grabbed some easy headlines with his championship of Shakespeare over Neighbours. A three-stage strategy to take over, revitalise and then return to parents the worst inner-city schools should guarantee a few more. Cabinet colleagues are less confident that his proposal to establish a centralised schools funding council will create a durable balance between parental choice and educational anarchy. In other areas - housing is one - there are plenty of ideas but also a sense that the strategy is fragmented. Why, one Tory MP asked this week, is the government promoting a myriad of small-scale schemes to encourage home ownership and then channelling billions of pounds to housing associations that refuse their tenants the right to buy? The public-spending round has a similar short-term focus. Ministers are concentrating on immediate savings rather than on strategic decisions that would deliver large cuts four or five years hence. Many Tories believe that the most pressing need for radical thinking - followed by action in next year's Budget - is on tax policy. A distinctive low-tax policy could be as decisive for Mr Major at the next election as it was in the last. For the foreseeable future, there will be no room for large net reductions, but there will be the opportunity to reshape the system. Mortgage interest relief is said to remain inviolate, but some of his colleagues wonder whether Mr Norman Lamont will be brave enough to extend the VAT base. An end to zero-rating on food would raise over Pounds 7bn. That might be too daring, but VAT on domestic fuel would raise Pounds 2.5bn, on new house construction Pounds 3.4bn, on transport Pounds 2.3bn and on newspapers Pounds 1bn. The money raised could be used to meet Mr Major's ambition to level the playing field on the tax treatment of savings, to reduce capital taxes, and to make a credible move towards a 20p basic rate of income tax. There would be howls of protest - for a year or so. But in the first year of a new parliament, the priority for Mr Major must be to ensure that incrementalism does not turn into drift.</p>

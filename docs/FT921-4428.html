			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Xenova in new US deal XENOVA, a fast-growing UK biotechnology company, will announce today its sixth significant collaborative deal with a large pharmaceutical or chemical company. The latest agreement - with Warner-Lambert of the US - is to develop drugs to treat heart and brain diseases, based on chemicals discovered by Xenova. The deal is worth several million dollars over five years. Xenova, a privately held company, was established in 1987 in Slough, west London. Its shareholders include 14 financial institutions in the UK, the US and Japan. The company specialises in discovering biologically active small molecules - as opposed to the large protein molecules favoured by many other biotechnology companies - by screening the chemicals produced naturally by micro-organisms, particularly fungi. Besides Warner Lambert, Xenova is collaborating with Genentech and Roche on pharmaceuticals, with Monsanto on fungicides and with FMC in insecticides. Its most important partner is Genentech, with which it signed a Pounds 12.5 agreement last September. It is too soon for any Xenova drugs to have reached the market yet but Mr Louis Nisbet, chief executive, says half a dozen promising candidates are in development - for treating cancer, auto-immune and cardiovascular disease. Xenova has raised Pounds 18m in capital funding and has an estimated value of Pounds 35m. It is deciding now how to raise further funds for the expensive business of product development. One option is a public flotation.</p>

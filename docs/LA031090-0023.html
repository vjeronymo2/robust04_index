			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FANS IN FIGHTING MOOD ABOUT KINGS-OILERS BRAWL  </P> <P> So, owner Bruce McNall doesn't think that any fan who was at the Forum on Feb.  28 was disappointed. I hate to break it to you Bruce, but as one who came to  see a hockey game and saw a boxing match instead, I was disappointed. I didn't  pay thousands of dollars for my season seats to see the game I love deteriorate  into a street brawl.  </P> <P> MICHELLE BUEHLER, Los Angeles  </P></p>

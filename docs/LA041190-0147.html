			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. SAYS 'NO' TO UNITED GERMANY IN NATO, WARSAW PACT  </P> <P> The State Department today flatly ruled out a proposal by Soviet Foreign  Minister Eduard Shevardnadze that a united Germany become a member of both the  Warsaw Pact and NATO.  </P> <P> State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the proposal "is in our  minds another form of neutrality which the Germans themselves, their neighbors  and the Soviet Union regard as undesirable."  </P> <P> The idea was floated this week by Soviet officials, including Shevardnadze in a  magazine published in Brussels, "NATO's 16 Nations."  </P> <P> Shevardnadze said in the article, "It should be recognized that the idea is out  of the ordinary, but must we cling to things we have grown accustomed to in  such an unusual situation?  </P> <P> "It would be erroneous to begin building German unity by destroying the  existing security systems without having replaced them with new ones. Dual  membership for Germany could provide a pragmatic way out of the difficulties."  </P></p>

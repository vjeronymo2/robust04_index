			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / EC steelmakers to face more closures, Brussels warns THE European Commission yesterday warned EC steelmakers they would have to close even more plants than originally envisaged if they wanted commercial and financial support from the Community. The call for more cuts came as the Commission unveiled a rescue package to help protect the industry, which is suffering from overcapacity, competition from cheap non-EC imports and the worsening recession. The EC would provide Ecu900m (Pounds 740m) of financial support for closure costs, but only if member states match funding promised by the Commission The Commission refused to estimate how many jobs might be lost in the EC industry as a result of capacity cuts, but an internal Brussels report has suggested that the original, more modest closure programme could lead to at least 50,000 redundancies. A German steel industry spokesman yesterday warned that it alone might have to shed 35,000 to 40,000 jobs under the new proposals. In their original forecasts, steel producers suggested they could reduce production of crude steel by up to 25.8m tonnes over the next three years, and rolled products by 17.9m tonnes. Mr Bangemann said yesterday that this was 'not sufficient', and steelmakers would have to cut a further 4m or 5m tonnes of capacity. Altogether, the Commission is looking for cuts of up to 30m tonnes in crude steel, and about 19m tonnes in rolled steel. Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC industry commissioner, and Mr Karel Van Miert, responsible for competition, said they hoped the plan would receive the political backing of industry ministers at a special meeting next week. However, they will not ask member states to take a formal decision on the package before May. Mr Fernand Braun, the EC's 'steel envoy', is to renew contacts with 70 steelmakers in the hope that they can offer more capacity cuts to satisfy the Commission before the May meeting. The producers will be asked to commit themselves to a binding closure programme by the end of September, and to carry it out by the end of 1995. The draft programme approved yesterday includes controversial plans to reduce alleged unfair competition from cheap steel imports from eastern Europe. German steel talks, Page 2</p>

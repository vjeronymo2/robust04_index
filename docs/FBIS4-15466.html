			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Koretskiy report in the "Russian-Ukrainian </F> Strategic Arms Talks" column: "Born to Fly, Without Kerosene  They Cannot Even Crawl"]    [Text] Ukraine is ready to part not only with the nuclear  weapons located on its territory but also with their delivery  means. This much is clear from the start of confidential  negotiations between Moscow and Kiev on the transfer to Russia  of 42 Tu-95 MS's and Tu-160 strategic bombers that Ukraine  inherited from the USSR. The fact that the talks are under way  was yesterday confirmed by an informed source in the Russian  Defense Ministry. Unlike Minsk and Alma-Ata [Almaty], however,  which voluntarily ceded to Moscow all of their strategic  weapons, Kiev intends not only to get rid of unwanted and costly  to maintain toys, but also to get something in exchange.    Out of Ukraine's 42 strategic bombers, 19 are  top-of-the-line  Tu-160's (the aircraft was developed in 1975 as a counterbalance  to the U.S. B-1B; it is inferior in combat load but superior in  speed). The estimated cost of the Tu-160 is $250 million. The  remaining 23 aircraft are Tu-95 MS's, second-generation  strategic bombers. At present Ukraine's heavy aviation is  located at air bases in Priluki, Uzin, and Ukrainsk.    The first reports about Ukraine's intention to sell these  aircraft to Russia appeared in the Kiev press at the end of  March. Among the first to raise this issue was the republic's  Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, who proposed to sell the  Tu-95 MS's and Tu-160's, "but not for money." He backed up his  statement by the fact that "Ukraine's air space is too cramped  for this class of aircraft." However, the explanation for the  "generosity" of Mr. Radetskyy, who for more than two years has  been reluctant to part with heavy aviation in spite of the  cramped air space, is trivial. In the context of an energy  crisis the average annual flying time in the Ukrainian Air Force  does not exceed 35 to 40 hours. Meanwhile analogous figures in  the U.S., FRG, and Dutch Air Forces are 160-180 hours, and in  the USSR they were between 130 and 150 hours. Ukrainian Air  Force simulators, on the other hand, do not give the pilots the  full sensation of flight.    The reason for Kiev's "submission" is the defection of  complete combat crews to Russia and the impossibility of  maintaining the Tu's in combat readiness. The wish to obtain in  exchange "components for front and army aircraft and also fuel,"  however, as expressed by Mr. Radetskyy, will hardly meet with  Moscow's understanding. Just like an alternative proposal to  exchange the bombers for Tu-134 and Tu- 154 civil aircraft in a  1:3 proportion.    As a source in the Russian Defense Ministry told  KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent, Moscow views as the most  acceptable "settlement" option the use of the heavy aircraft to  cover Kiev's indebtedness on natural gas supplies. Because the  talks began only two or three days ago, however, it is too soon  to talk about any variant of a deal on strategic aviation. As  for the "gas" option, Gazprom has not yet given its consent.  Indeed, why would it want strategic bombers?    Kiev's aspiration to relieve itself of an unbearable burden  is understandable. What is not is why Moscow has engaged in  this strange horse trading. After all, the redeployment of  Tu-95's and Tu-160's to Russia will call for their subsequent  conversion as "non-nuclear" (so that the START II provisions on  strategic aviation are observed), which will demand substantial  expenses not envisioned in the budget. It would be easy to  invite Kiev, "in a brotherly manner," simply to give the planes  away for free. Even so, the Russian Defense Ministry has made  it clear that so far they are not going to pay for this  hardware. Actually, there is nothing to pay with.  <H5>  The Strategic Component of the Russian and U.S. Air Forces </H5>   Russia (CIS):    52 Tu-95 K aircraft. Capable of carrying up to eight  cruise missiles to a distance of up to 12,800 km.    63 Tu-95 MS aircraft. Capable of carrying up to 16 cruise  missiles to a distance of up to 18,000 km. Before February  1994, 40 aircraft of this class were located on the territory of  Kazakhstan and 23 are still based in Ukraine.    23 to 25 Tu-160 aircraft (exact number unknown). Capable  of carrying 12 cruise missiles to a distance of up to 11,000 km;  19 aircraft of this class are based in Priluki. The last such  aircraft was manufactured by the Kazan aircraft plant in August  1992.    The United States:    95 B-52H Stratofortress aircraft. Capable of carrying up  to 20 cruise missiles to a distance of up to 16,000 km.    95 B-1B Lancer aircraft. Capable of carrying up to 16  dumb [svobodnopadayushchiye] bombs to a distance of up to 19,800  km.    20 B-2 Northrop ("Stealth") aircraft. Capable of carrying  between eight and 16 cruise missiles to a distance of up to  11,000 km. The first five aircraft of this class were to be  adopted by the U.S. Air Force for service in December 1993.</p>

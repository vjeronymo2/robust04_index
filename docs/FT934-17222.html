			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong at a record high on strong US buying EQUITIES closed marginally higher as investor interest turned to trading on the second section and the over-the-counter market, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average gained 28.30 at 20,105.71 after moving between 20,032.20 and 20,158.32. Traders said public funds and financial institutions supported shares, while individuals, tokkin, or specified money trusts, and foreign investors sought small-capital issues. The second section index rose 3.50 to 2,256.50, while the OTC average advanced 37.61 to 1,706.29. Volume on the first section came to 260m shares, against 290m. Advances led declines by 507 to 485, with 176 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 8.39 at 1,626.25 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.08 firmer at 1,255.35. Traders said some investors were becoming increasingly pessimistic over corporate earnings because of a spate of downward earnings revisions and restructuring announcements by major companies. However, Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel, said that with interest rates at a record low, cash, including speculative funds, should start entering the equity market. Mazda Motor dropped Y31 to Y483 on heavy selling after announcing that its pre-tax loss would rise to Y32bn from an earlier estimate of Y12bn. There was a recovery in large-capital issues and banks which were previously sold on profit-taking. Nippon Steel improved Y11 to Y318, Industrial Bank of Japan Y90 to Y3,260 and Fuji Bank Y50 to Y2,300. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose for the first time in six trading days, gaining Y4,000 at Y831,000. Investors sought prospective beneficiaries of the temporary easing of the country's imported rice ban due to the poor domestic harvest. The Agriculture Ministry yesterday announced that the rice harvest index was 80 against an annual average of 100, and said it would import 200,000 tonnes of rice as its first instalment. Trading companies such as Mitsubishi, up Y20 at Y1,190, gained, while warehouse issues also advanced, Mitsui Soko adding Y9 at Y940. DDI, a long distance telecom company listed on the second section, firmed Y140,000 to Y6.32m on reports of an easing of restrictions on portable telephones. In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 36.18 to 22,186.77 in volume of 16.4m shares. Roundup THERE WERE a number of impressive performances among the region's markets yesterday. Seoul and Taiwan were closed for holidays. HONG KONG climbed 1.7 per cent to a record close, encouraged by the more moderate tone of Chinese foreign minister Qian Qichen ahead of his meeting today with Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary. The Hang Seng index rose 125.12 to 7,676.22 in turnover that swelled to HKDollars 4.95bn from Wednesday's HKDollars 2.86bn. Strong US demand was noted as Morgan Stanley raised the Hong Kong weighting in its global equity model portfolio from 0.2 per cent to an overweight 3 per cent. Mr James Lister-Cheese of Morgan Stanley commented that Hong Kong was trading on a prospective price/earnings ratio of 13 times 1993 earnings, compared with p/e ratios in the mid-20s for many other markets in the area, largely as a result of perceived political risk. Morgan Stanley saw political tensions easing, he said, and a positive outlook for the Hong Kong economy as trade with China opened up. KUALA LUMPUR remained firm, the composite index advancing 7.27 to a record 853.83 close. A 50-cent gain in Telekom Malaysia to MDollars 17.20 helped to drive the index forward. SINGAPORE picked up as investors sought property issues ahead of more liberal use of workers' provident fund savings for investments. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 19.74 to 2,009.02 in volume that jumped to 471.78m shares from 356.70m. AUSTRALIA was pushed higher by gains in the futures market and the oil sector, as well as further rises in BHP and News Corp. The All Ordinaries index added 13.0 at 1,964.4 in turnover of ADollars 389.7m. BHP put on 10 cents for a record close of ADollars 16.26, while News Corp appreciated 8 cents to ADollars 11.00. MANILA turned lower as the peso's appreciation against the dollar led to a pullback in share prices of dollar-earning market leaders. The market index shed 8.65 to 1,973.76. BOMBAY rose on news that a resolution was in sight over the recent seizure of proxy-held shares by the income tax authorities. The BSE 30 index ended 32.97 up at 2,719.28.</p>

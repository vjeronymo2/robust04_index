			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- The money market is  expected to see a 1.8 trillion yen net liquidity surplus in  July, excluding government bond issuance, the Bank of Japan  [BOJ] said Friday [24 June].    The amount will be up from the 1.63 trillion yen surplus  posted last July, the central bank said.    The return of cash into the banking system following  payments  of summer bonuses in June is projected to generate a net 600  billion yen cash inflow, compared with 678 billion yen last July.    Together with the cash inflow, a net 1.2 trillion yen inflow  of treasury funds is forecast to put the overall net surplus at  1.8 trillion yen. The fiscal inflow was 958 billion yen in July  1993.    The balance of outstanding bank of Japan notes is predicted  to rise 4.9 percent year on year at the end of July.    Redemptions of government bonds are expected to create a net  inflow of 2.66 trillion yen into the money market, down from  3.35 trillion yen a year before, while collection of withholding  tax is projected to prompt a fiscal outflow of 4.21 trillion yen  compared to a 4.96 trillion yen in July last year.</p>

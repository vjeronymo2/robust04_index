			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Elf Congo to sell oil field stake Elf Congo, a subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine, the French oil group, is to sell a 22.5 per cent stake in one of its biggest oil fields in the Gulf of Guinea to Chevron of the US. Elf said yesterday the sale of the stake in the N'Kossa oil field and the Haute Mer permit would become effective following approval by the Congolese authorities. The French company declined to comment on the price to be paid by Chevron. The sale of the stake is in line with Elf's strategy of reducing investment costs and curbing its debt burden. The company is planning to reduce investment spending by 20 per cent this year to FFr32bn (Dollars 6bn). The N'Kossa field is due to start production in mid-1996. Elf Congo, 75 per cent owned by Elf and 25 per cent by the Republic of Congo, will be the operator on the two permits and will hold a 62.5 per cent stake in them. Chevron Overseas (Congo) will hold a 22.5 per cent stake and Hydro Congo, the state oil company, will hold 15 per cent. Chargeurs, the French diversified industrial group, has swung back into profit in the first half of this year, agencies report. It posted a net profit of FFr213m, compared with a loss of FFr209m in the first half of 1993.</p>

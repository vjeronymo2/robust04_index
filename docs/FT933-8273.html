			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Seeking a new balance The growing need for small firms to collaborate in research and development, training and even marketing is often in conflict with their urge to compete. So a recent study on how the Mittelstand in the Baden-Wurttemberg region is dealing with the dilemma is of potentially wider European interest. The Mittelstand is the collective name for the thousands of small and medium-sized companies whose remarkable export success was one of the foundations of Germany's post war economic prosperity. But as Philip Cooke, Kevin Morgan and Adam Price of the Department of City &amp; Regional Planning at the University of Wales College of Cardiff point out * a crisis of confidence has hit the whole sector. Nowhere is it more evident than in Baden-Wurttemberg, where one of the biggest threats comes from the car industry's increased tendency to source overseas on the one hand and to deepen relationships with a smaller number of domestic suppliers on the other. In machine tools, the fear is that the Mittelstand is too fragmented to stay abreast of new technologies and to meet the threat of more cost-effective Japanese rivals. Many companies, however, are sceptical of 'horizontal collaboration' as a means of easing the financial burden - the Mittelstand's apparent strength, fierce independence of a dynamic owner-manager, therefore becomes its weakness. The report examines in detail the state's novel regional innovation strategy, which in contrast with the French dirigiste approach tries to establish a new balance between collaboration and competition. It continues to respect the sovereignty of the firm, but with the help of new incentives it encourages companies to recognise the limits of autonomous action. Formidable problems remain and the most pessimistic think the region's overdependence on the mature auto industry could make it 'the Ruhrgebiet of the 21st century'. But the authors say it would be foolish to underestimate the capacity for renewal given the 'new mood' and the region's industrial, technical and institutional resources. *Available for Pounds 20 from RIR, PO Box 906, Cardiff CF1 3YN.</p>

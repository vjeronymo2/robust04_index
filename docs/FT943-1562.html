			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: RMC For the past 2 1/2 years, RMC has successfully insulated shareholders from the full brunt of the savage downturn in the UK construction industry, chiefly by virtue of its engagement in Germany where the construction industry has defied recession. Yesterday's results show that the group has reached a turning point, with the impetus coming from the UK. Profits at home more than doubled on turnover up 16 per cent, reflecting a favourable mix of higher volumes and prices as well as lower costs. This leaves RMC in a strong position. There is scope for further recovery in the UK and other continental European countries such as France, Spain and Austria. As for Germany, house building in the west may tail off modestly in the current year, but RMC is confident that this will be offset by a revival in commercial and industrial market. In the east of Germany, the construction industry is set to be the motor of recovery for years to come. RMC's low cost cement production facilities allow it to compete with cheap imports from Poland. RMC's decades-long engagement in Germany seems to have rubbed off on the company's culture. The group invests for the long term and is prudent in the way it husbands its cash. The only surprises are positive ones, such as yesterday's better than expected figures. The group's qualities have not gone unrecognised and the shares have outperformed the market by 12 per cent in the past year. The group has won, and deserves to keep, a premium rating to the sector.</p>

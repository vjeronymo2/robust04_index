			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / An industrial bed of nails Mr Heinz Kriwet, head of the Thyssen group, and paymaster to more than 50,000 of west Germany's steel workers, said last week that the weather had turned, writes Christopher Parkes. After several years of progress with a following economic breeze, he said, 'the wind is blowing in our face again'. The outlook is unchanged by yesterday's last-minute about-turn in the pay arena. There will be no strike. But there is worse to come for the workforce than picket duty on freezing streets. And steel company shareholders will feel the cold. At least 6,000 of Germany's 130,000 steel jobs will go before December, and many more are certain to be lost in the next two or three years. Thyssen and the other leading steelmakers, Hoesch and Krupp, which together account for more than half German production of 38,000 tonnes, are bracing themselves for a painful and quick restructuring bout. The slow erosion of the workforce from more than 200,000 in the early 1980s will now be followed by cuts. Barring calamities, the slow-burn takeover of Hoesch by Krupp should be completed by the end of this year, and Thyssen will have bundled together its mainstream Thyssen Stahl subsidiary with its loss-making special steels division, Thyssen Edelstahl. When that is over, Thyssen is likely to reopen talks on pooling resources in special steels with Krupp. The inevitable result is job losses as the companies strive to regain competitiveness. All three groups say they have already identified multi-million-D-Mark savings, but all three still see no signs of short-term improvements in the marketplace. Adverse trade winds, which blew Thyssen Edelstahl into a DM63m (Pounds 21.90m) loss last year, blasted 22 per cent off the value of incoming orders in the first quarter of the current year. Orders at Thyssen Stahl dropped 6 per cent, and Mr Kriwet forecast a further profits fall for 1992 to follow last year's 42 per cent slump. According to Hypo-Bank, one of Germany's leading banks, earnings per share at Thyssen this year will fall from DM22 to DM16, and Hoesch shareholders can expect a DM3 drop to DM20. Yesterday's pay deal, a basic 5.9 per cent compared with 6 per cent agreed last year when demand from east Germany and the booming car industry cushioned steelmakers from world recession, spells gloom for North Rhine Westphalia, heart of the steel industry. The domestic market has become a bed of nails: economic growth is slowing to about half last year's rate, and the important car industry, faced with falling domestic orders, promptly cut 10,000 jobs in the last three months of 1991. A pay injection may have eased some local symptoms, but in the end it can only exacerbate the disease diagnosed as the main impediment to the health of German steel. The IG Metall union yesterday declared itself pleased that steel pay was being brought into line once again with engineering workers' rates. But as Mr Kriwet pointed out before yesterday's deal: 'Steel companies are not in competition with metal-working industries, but with steel businesses in France and Britain, where wages costs even now are 30 per cent lower than ours.'</p>

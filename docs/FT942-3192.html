			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Italy tries to grasp the pensions nettle: A look at the budget implications of a constitutional court decision ordering payment of arrears The state of Italy's public finances has rudely interrupted the Berlusconi government's euphoria over its spectacular performance in the European elections. The immediate problem is a decision last week by the constitutional court obliging the government to pay arrears on certain categories of pensions dating back to 1983. But the need to find extra funds and neutralise the impact of the court ruling has highlighted the unresolved problem of Italy's public sector deficit, still equivalent to more than 10 per cent of gross domestic product. This in turn has provided a brutal reminder that the government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, for all its talk of reducing taxes and stimulating the economy, has a very slim margin of manoeuvre in its as yet ill-defined economic policy. The nervous reaction of the financial markets to the court decision  -both on the bourse and towards government bond prices - has rubbed home the point that the deficit cannot be ignored. Estimates of the cost of making the pension payments vary considerably because of the complexity of interpreting the court's decision. The upper limit has been put at a staggering L30,000bn (Pounds 12.4bn) by Mr Clemente Mastella, the labour minister, and it is unlikely to be lower than L16,000bn. The confusion is surprising because the constitutional court decision was known to be imminent. Its ruling in favour of paying arrears on certain minimum benefits stopped in 1983 was considered a near certainty by the previous Ciampi government and Mr Mario Colombo, the head of Inps, the state pensions institute, wrote a letter on May 11 to Mr Berlusconi when he had just been named prime minister warning of the potential costs. Tuesday afternoon was taken up by various meetings between Mr Berlusconi, his economic ministers, Inps officials and the comptroller of public accounts. Officials say that by tomorrow a definitive analysis of the cost will have been made; but they decline to say whether there will be a pre-summer mini-budget and whether plans for the 1995 budget have had to be rewritten. The government's initial reaction is to try to spread the arrears payments over a period of years, beginning in 1995. Thus the mini-budget could be retained as the government's original objective of finding around L6,000bn (mainly in spending cuts) to hold the public sector deficit down to L154,000bn. In this way, the timid economic recovery could be encouraged, stimulated by already announced measures giving tax incentives to invest and create new jobs. But this approach would not obviate the need for a tough 1995 budget if Italy is to lower the budget deficit in line with its main European partners as pledged. The government is acutely aware of this dilemma and hopes the markets will be satisfied by an early commitment - probably before the end of the month - to tackle the issue of pensions head-on. Italy's generous state pensions scheme has become a drain on Italy's public finances. Pensions are the largest item in the budget and account for 42 per cent of current spending. Measures introduced by the Amato government in 1993, considered bold at the time, are now inadequate. The compulsory retirement age was raised from 55 for women and 60 for men to 60 and 65 respectively (a rise of one year every second year as of 1993). The reference period for calculating pensions was increased from 5 to 10 years and the period of contribution entitlements was raised from 15 to 20 years. The linkage between nominal wage growth and wages was cut, restrictions were imposed on the much abused early retirement benefits and employee contributions were raised marginally to 9.9 per cent of total earnings. According to the Bank of Italy, pension outlays last year were L181,000bn, up 4.7 per cent. But without the Amato measures the bank says the rise would have been far greater. Equally worrying is the way the growing population of pensioners - more than 20m and for the first time more numerous than those in work - cannot be funded by the contributions of those in jobs. This year the treasury expects to have to cover a deficit of L74,000bn. The amount is already L7,000bn above budget and could be higher, as double the number expected of local government employees have submitted requests for early retirement. There have also been costly early state-backed retirement settlements in the steel and motor industry.</p>

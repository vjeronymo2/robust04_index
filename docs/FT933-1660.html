			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Italy's judges are brought to book: The only surprise is that it has taken so long THE courts in Rome have been dubbed 'the gateways to the mists'. This is a euphemism for the way proceedings are manipulated to create a fog of confusion in any prosecution, so preventing the truth from emerging. As a former chief prosecutor in Rome, Mr Claudio Vitalone has been long linked to some of the most notorious examples of obfuscation. He is now being investigated on charges of perjury that relate to the murkier aspects of the Italian judicial system and its manipulation by political masters. That the investigative magistrates should get round to examining members of their own profession is not surprising in the current anti-corruption climate. The only surprise is that it has taken so long. Compliant judges have played an essential role in protecting the corrupt politicians and their friends from prosecution - including those in the Mafia. So far this year an appeals court judge has been suspended because of suspected links with the Sicilian Mafia and at least three Naples judges have been suspended because of suspected links with organised crime. But the Vitalone case, more than any other, underlines the extent to which the separation of powers during Italy's discredited First Republic has become a fiction. Mr Vitalone is accused of perjury in connection with the murder in 1979 of Mr Mino Pecorelli, the editor of OP, a magazine that specialised in inside information on the government and security services. His lawyers say he is innocent. He is a close associate of Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former Christian Democrat prime minister, who faces charges of approving the Pecorelli murder. Mr Andreotti was questioned again on Tuesday about this murder. Rome magistrates allege Mr Pecorelli was killed by Mafia-sponsored hit-men because he knew too many secrets, including those surrounding the death of Mr Aldo Moro, the Christian Democrat premier kidnapped by Red Brigades terrorists. Only days before Mr Pecorelli was murdered, Mr Vitalone helped organise a dinner during which the journalist was persuaded to replace OP's cover story, which contained scurrilous insinuations about Mr Andreotti's financial dealings. Both Mr Andreotti and Mr Vitalone are alleged to have been friendly with the Salvo cousins, prominent Sicilian businessmen linked to the Mafia, who are said to have organised the killing. Their connection with the now dead Salvo cousins is central to the magistrates' case. The perjury charge, made last week, arose from magistrates cross-checking a statement of July 22 in which Mr Vitalone denied any connection with the Salvos and the Pecorelli murder. Mr Vitalone is credited with having over-hastily closed the books on investigations into the 1970 abortive coup by Prince Valerio Borghese, as well as other cases such as the 'Gladio' affair (right-wing elements in the armed forces and security services using the cover of secret Nato resources to destabilise the country). Mr Vitalone also played a prominent part in advising the government during the Moro kidnap - and the circumstances surrounding the negotiations with the late premier's kidnappers remain a mystery. Backed by Mr Andreotti, he left judicial office to become a Christian Democrat senator in 1979. Subsequently Mr Andreotti chose him as his minister of foreign trade. The perjury charge came on the day the Higher Judicial Council (CSM) approved his return from politics to the judicial ranks. A majority of the 33-strong CSM agreed he could take up a post in the Florence public prosecutor's office, even though he was already under investigation for alleged corruption relating to aid to Albania. He and his lawyer brother Wilfredo are also contesting charges of fraudulent bankruptcy. His readmission to judicial office has provoked such an outcry that the justice ministry has been obliged to seek a freeze on Mr Vitalone's posting. This in turn has thrown the spotlight on the composition of the CSM and the continued influence of the discredited traditional political parties over it. The likes of the investigative magistrates in Milan, who have done so much to inject energy and integrity into the judicial system, are by no means in the majority. Only two weeks ago Mr Diego Curto, deputy head of the Milan courts, who has handled some of the most important financial cases of recent years, was arrested on charges of abuse of office and corruption. He is in prison, accused of receiving L400m (Pounds 166,000) for his part in the 1990 buy-out at an inflated price by Eni, the state oil company, of Ferruzzi-Montedison's stake in their joint chemicals venture, Enimont. Mr Curto admitted he had received money for rigging the deal but had thrown the notes into the rubbish bin. Last week the funds were traced to a Swiss bank account.</p>

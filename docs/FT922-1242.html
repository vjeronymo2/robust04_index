			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (9): A market for the brave of heart - The Stock Exchange THE Jakarta stock market has had two turbulent years, its composite index crashing from a high of 682 in April 1990 to under 225 last October. Since then, however, steps have been taken to restore investor confidence including new listing requirements and the transfer of the exchange's management to a private company. On June 10, the day following parliamentary elections, the index broke 320, amounting to a 44 per cent rise in less than eight months. While many investors are carrying large losses from two years ago, fast profits can still be made. The share values of some of the most traded companies prove the point: between April 20 and early June Indocement, the largest company on the market, rose 14 per cent; Astra International, which accounts for half Indonesia's vehicle sales, went up 30 per cent; and Kalbe Farma, the leading pharmaceutical company, increased 25 per cent. The Jakarta market, however, is for the brave of heart. As Miss Sian Hansen, analyst at Crosby Securities, explains: 'Forces behind the Jakarta stock market are unusual. Companies' share values often fail to reflect underlying market principles. Instead, the market is fuelled mostly by sentiment'. A report by Hoare Govett in April, when the market stood at 271, predicted a 15-20 per cent growth in the index by the end of the year. Since the report, the index has risen a further 11 per cent and some brokers are talking of the index nudging 400 by year-end. The overriding characteristic of the Jakarta exchange remains its illiquidity and this brings with it volatility in share prices. Shares in Bakrie and Brothers, a conglomerate with key interests in the steel sector, have risen 100 per cent in three months on the back of heavy buying by foreign brokers. Regulatory changes drawn up by Bursa Efek Jakarta, the new private managers of the stock exchange, were due to come into force on June 18 and should improve liquidity. They provide tougher qualifications for a new company wishing to be listed on the exchange: an operating profit for two consecutive years; minimum assets of Rp20bn; equity capital of at least Rp7.5bn and paid-up capital of more than Rp2bn; at least 200 public shareholders; and a free-float of at least 1m shares. Companies may be struck off if they record losses for three consecutive years; if their shares are not traded for more than six months; if they cannot produce scheduled financial reports or if accounting standards are not met. The measures are designed to boost investor confidence after a series of scandals which began the index's precipitous fall in 1990. The worst was when Bank Duta, more than 70 per cent owned by charities chaired by President Suharto, failed to disclose foreign exchange losses of Dollars 419m a few months before the bank went public. Confidence in the business community was hit last year with the announcement by two companies, the Mantrust conglomerate and Bentoel, a cigarette company, that they would be unable to service loans totalling Dollars 770m. And there may be more bad news waiting in the wings. The Soeryadjaya family, which own 76 per cent of Astra International, the second-largest quoted company, have admitted that their private Summa Group requires financial restructuring. Brokers believe the Soeryadjaya family is preparing to sell up to half its stake in Astra International worth over Dollars 500m. The future of Astra International relies largely on who takes up the Soeryadjaya shares. If it is a reputable foreign company which can bring with it new technology and management expertise, Astra could emerge the stronger. Brokers are fearful, however, that the family is under pressure to sell to domestic, politically well-connected, companies with only limited experience in motor cars. Astra may not be be alone in having potential problems. Dr Mari Pangestu, head of economics at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta, says: 'Perhaps the greatest concern. . . is a string of company failures' in the year ahead. Many of the domestic conglomerates which expanded rapidly in 1989-90 have been vulnerable to high interest rates which followed the tightening of money supply in early 1991. However, Dr Pangestu says: 'In most cases core business is still relatively profitable.' If some companies are in trouble, the first to be affected will be the banks. A measure of investor confidence in Indonesia will be how the value of bank shares react to a new decree, expected to be finalised this month, which will allow foreigners to buy up to 49 per cent of a listed bank's shares. Brokers say the initial signs are mixed. Foreign investors have been working through domestic institutions to buy shares in advance of the decree but following a recent rally in bank share prices, concern over loan-loss provisions may dampen investor enthusiasm. Nevertheless, the long-term prospects for the market are bright. With a population of 183m and annual per capita income forecast by the World Bank to double to more than Dollars 1,000 by the turn of the century, Indonesia remains a vastly under-developed and potentially lucrative market. Mr Hasan Zein Mahmud, president of BEJ, bemoans the lack of initiative shown by many domestic institutions, such as state pension funds, which prefer to place their funds on time deposit. As such, he believes the future of the stock market lies in foreign investors' hands. He says there are thousands of potential companies waiting to list but adds: 'Who will be the buyer of shares? It must the foreign investor'.</p>

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Discord on London orchestra cash The Philharmonia has been chosen by Lord Justice Hoffmann to be the super orchestra of London. But his decision, given to the Arts Council music panel on Friday, has yet to be made public and it seems unlikely the Hoffmann report will be accepted without modification. The council asked Lord Justice Hoffmann, a music lover, to conduct an inquiry into three subsidised orchestras: the London Philharmonic, the Royal Philharmonic and the Philharmonia, two of which would lose their subsidy. The London Symphony Orchestra, resident at the Barbican, was excused the competition. There have been attempts for more than 20 years to reduce the number of London-based orchestras receiving Arts Council subsidy, with the aim of saving money and creating a world-class orchestra able to compete with the best in Vienna and Berlin. The contest raised a storm of controversy, not least because the odds seemed stacked in favour of the LPO. It has just entered its second season of a five-year residency as the orchestra of the South Bank Centre, with an increased annual subsidy of Pounds 1.3m to allow for extra rehearsal time. Lord Justice Hoffmann heard all three orchestras play and considered their written proposals. His choice of the Philharmonia creates problems for the South Bank and the Arts Council. Its music panel will have to decide whether it agrees with the choice. Even if it does the full Arts Council, meeting next week, can overturn the decision. The LPO's position at the South Bank, with a series of concerts planned years ahead, becomes impossible without a grant. If its concerts were cancelled it might have a legal case against the Arts Council, which funds the South Bank. The RPO, which receives only Pounds 400,000 a year in subsidy, or 7 per cent of its income, did not expect to be chosen but might now look more favourably on an Arts Council proposal to make it the orchestra serving the east of England. The future of the Philharmonia, which receives Pounds 700,000 in annual grant, seems secure. But it seems unlikely that the Arts Council will be able to withdraw subsidy to the LPO suddenly from next April, just two years after approving it. The LPO has hit a bad patch, with a management shake-up in the summer and continuing controversy over its principal conductor, Frans Welser-Most. A compromise might be worked out. The problem is that the Arts Council had its government grant for 1994-95 cut by 1.7 per cent in the Budget last week. It does not have enough money to both increase support for the Philharmonia and keep the other two orchestras afloat. It might defer a decision until after its examination of the regional orchestras next year with the BBC.</p>

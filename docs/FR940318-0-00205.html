			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Radiation curing is a production technique for drying and curing adhesives with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radiant energy in the form of ultraviolet (UV) or infrared (IR) light, electron beams (EB), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gamma or x-rays. The binding agents that can be cured with radiant energy are acrylics,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> epoxies, urethanes, anaerobic adhesives, and polyester resins. In many cases, if the materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are either heat sensitive or opaque, radiation curing cannot be employed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Radiation-dried coatings are applied as either a powder or as a high-solids form and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dried using the same radiant energy forms as used in radiation-cured adhesives. The binder  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems that can be dried with radiant energy are also similar. In cases where the radiant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy is harmful to a component, such as sensitive electronic equipment, radiant-dried  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coating cannot be employed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moisture-cured, chemical-cured, and reactive liquid adhesives are still not widely used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because they are still being developed or because performance or application problems still  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have to be addressed. They will not be widely commercially available for several years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Comment Response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Acceptable substitutes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It was suggested that the acceptable substitutes cited for MCF could also be extended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to other ozone-depleting solvents, such as CFC&hyph;113. Depending on the specific application,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that it is probable that the same substitutes would apply and has addressed such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter noted that some terminology was inconsistent and should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarified. The use of the collective term ``organic solvent'' when describing alcohols, ketones  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and esters was cited. EPA agrees and believes that ``Oxygenated organic solvent'' is more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific. This phrase was substituted in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unacceptable substitutes_no comments received.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pending substitutes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that other chlorinated solvents, glycol ethers, glycol ether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acetates and N-methyl pyrollidone be forbidden as substitutes. EPA believes that when used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as directed and within the specified controls, these substances are safe alternative processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other related issues_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that ``coatings'' needs to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be clarified to mean paint type coatings and not other coatings such as lubricants and mold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> releases. The phrase coatings is defined in the overview section to mean durable and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decorative coatings such as paint to clarify this application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Preliminary Listing Decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Acceptable substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Solvent substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Petroleum distillates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petroleum hydrocarbons are acceptable substitutes for MCF in adhesives, coatings, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inks. The principal concern with these substitutes is over risk to workers during manufacture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and use of the alternative solvent. However, the Agency's analysis of these alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that risks from use of petroleum hydrocarbons are well understood and already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to necessary controls. For instance, although these solvents are flammable, industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has a good record of safe use of these substitutes. Additionally, certain of the petroleum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrocarbons, for example n-hexane, have low Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs), but the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency's survey of exposures in the workplace found that these levels can successfully be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attained if adequate ventilation and appropriate work practices are implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency's analysis of the potential for risks to residents in nearby communities did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicate the potential for adverse effects near a site with industrial use of petroleum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrocarbons if a relatively toxic petroleum hydrocarbon is used. However, the Agency does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not believe that the risk screen describes the true risk presented by these chemicals. First, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency has determined that petroleum hydrocarbons used in this sector are rarely as toxic as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> n-hexane. Second, the screen used as past MCF emissions as a proxy for emissions of n-hexane. This approach does not account for other regulatory controls, such as VOC controls,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that limit emissions of hydrocarbons from industrial sites, and would consequently also serve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to lower any other health risks to the general population from these chemicals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For this reason, the Agency believes that petroleum hydrocarbons merit use as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes, although it encourages manufacturers to formulate products where possible with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds with lowest inherent toxicity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Alcohols, ketones, ethers and esters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alcohols, ketones, ethers and esters are acceptable substitutes for MCF in adhesives,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coatings, and inks. The concerns for use of these solvents parallel the concerns associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with petroleum hydrocarbons. In this case, two of the typical oxygenated hydrocarbons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examined in the Agency's risk screen, methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone, also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have comparatively low toxicity. For the same reasons described in the section on petroleum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distillates, the Agency is approving these compounds as substitutes for MCF. This approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also includes the same guidance to manufacturers_to select chemicals for product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulations with lowest inherent toxicity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Chlorinated solvents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Perchloroethylene, methylene chloride and trichloroethylene are acceptable substitutes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for adhesives, coatings, and inks. Use of these solvents merit special caution, since they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspected human carcinogens. However, as with other solvents, the Agency's risk screen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that proper workplace practices significantly reduce risks in occupational settings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency's examination of risks to the general population determined the highest potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for adverse effects to be associated with use of trichloroethylene, since it has the greatest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancer potency. Clearly there is a need for further assessment of the hazards from use of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical, and the Agency notes that authorities exist to address any risks determined from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such analyses under Title III of the Clean Air Act. Title III lists all three of the chlorinated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvents as Hazardous Air Pollutants, and mandates development of Maximum Achievable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Control Technology standards to control emissions of these chemicals in various industrial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> settings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

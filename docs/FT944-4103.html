			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Prague to approve VW/Skoda Auto deal The Czech government will give final approval to an agreement allowing Volkswagen, the German car maker, to take majority control of Skoda Auto, although an amendment to the pact appeared to be delayed earlier this week over environmental aspects of the deal, the industry and trade ministry said, Reuter reports from Prague. An official said the agreement was not approved at the regular session of government on Wednesday because a change over a paragraph on ecological aspects needed re-wording. The deal would allow Volkswagen to raise its 31 per cent share to 70 per cent by 1996. The Czech government will continue to hold 30 per cent of Skoda stock.</p>

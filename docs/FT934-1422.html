			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Programs to work out your taxes - Computing If self-assessment of income tax arrives as promised in 1996, we can be sure that a clutch of helpful computer programs will follow. Some are already with us. On the other hand, some of the software houses to which we might expect to look for help, such as Intuit and Sage, hesitate to get involved with this murky subject. I can see why. A tax practitioner was quoted in the Weekend FT recently as saying: 'It is amazing how intelligent people seem to have difficulty with their tax returns.' Perhaps I might explain. Sorting out the paper work and filling in a tax form is not particularly difficult. Deadly, but not difficult: rather like doing the ironing. But understanding a tax inspector's thought processes when the assessment comes home, now that's another matter. Few of the figures on the assessment seem entirely to match the ones I submitted. Why? What has happened to the covenants? Why has part of my husband's personal allowance been transferred 'elsewhere', away from PAYE? A tax accountant told me that his professional estimate of a client's tax liability never turned out to correspond precisely with the official assessment. Similarly, when I tested five personal tax programs using the figures I had submitted with our most recent tax returns, no two of them produced the same answer. Self-assessment is not going to work until the tax rules and their application, however extensive and complicated, are as unambiguous as the London street map or the rules of chess; and until a way is found to make straight the paths leading from the tax return to the assessment. The available computer programs fall into two categories: cheap and expensive. The cheap ones cost Pounds 50 or less, the expensive ones about three times as much. The difference lies in the greater sophistication of the expensive ones, and in the fact that they have share portfolio modules which will calculate capital gains tax as well as manage the lists of dividends and tax credits. A cheap program, the Consumers' Association's TaxCalc, came closest to the right answer for our own tax liability (I think). This program does not always get the press it deserves, because the Consumers' Association will not send out review copies, and journalists do hate paying for anything. TaxCalc leads users in commendably clear fashion through the tax return. I am sure its success at getting the answer stems from that clarity. It also sets out its results clearly, and prints a report which you can sign and submit as your return. An extra bonus: it runs from a single floppy disk. There are drawbacks: you cannot update TaxCalc; next year, you will have to buy it all over again. And you cannot enter the particulars of your income in this program. You will have to go through the printed report at the end and fill in the name and address of your employer and your building society, the recipients of your charitable covenants and so forth. If you have a substantial share portfolio, adding the names of the individual shares afterwards to TaxCalc's list of dividends is not really practicable. But even in that case, this program is an excellent way to check your tax assessment. PC Tax Adviser is another of the cheap programs. It does allow you to list the sources of your income. They will be printed in the report, and you can carry them forward to next year. I liked the way the program was set out. But I had some trouble tailoring our information to fit Tax Adviser's expectations - for example, we received both taxed and untaxed bank interest in 1992-3; Tax Adviser did not like that. The same problem arose with interest on gilts. This program still might be worth a look if you have a share portfolio and your other tax requirements are fairly simple. Digita's Personal Tax Planner did somewhat better on categories of income. It, too, will run from a single floppy disk. But the dull screens are hard to use, and look at least five years out of date. Digita invites users to classify income as 'Self', 'Wife' or 'Joint'. I am surprised the politically correct have not caught up with them for that. TaxCalc allows you to enter a figure for capital gains, and gives some guidance on where to get advice on the subject. The current versions of Tax Adviser and Personal Tax Planner leave capital gains tax out altogether. The expensive programs are edging towards the sort of thing an accountant might use. Vital Software's Tax Reckoner is an old friend; I have recommended it before. A Windows version is planned for next year. Microhelp's personal tax program is a newcomer, hived off from a suite of programs developed for accountants. Both are good; both are aware of the odder by-ways of the tax system, such as the Rentaroom scheme; both produced answers quite close to the figure TaxCalc and I judge to be right; both will keep track of share portfolios from year to year, calculate capital gains, and relieve you of the dreaded chore of typing lists of dividends and tax credits. Microhelp will sell you a cheap version which will prepare the schedules to attach to your income tax return, but will not calculate the tax due. That could be a very good way to look at the program and decide whether you want to go further. If your affairs are complicated and you dislike turning the job over to a professional adviser, you should consider one of these programs. But the price does represent a considerable outlay, and, as with any tax program, you will have to buy an annual update. The small companies which market them do not offer the sort of security you might have with a large software house - but then, there is not really much security anywhere in the computer world. All the programs mentioned run on IBM and compatible computers. All the prices mentioned include VAT. TaxCalc costs Pounds 19.99 to members of the Consumers' Association, Pounds 24.99 to everyone else. Tel: 0800-252-100. Digita's Personal Tax Planner costs Pounds 49.99. Annual updates are Pounds 12.50. Digita International, Black Horse House, Exmouth EX8 1JL. Tel: 0395-270273, Fax 0395-268893. PC Tax Adviser costs Pounds 49.95. Updates are Pounds 9.95. HCS, 3a Dudley Rd, Ashford, Middlesex, TW15 2 LE. Tel: 0784-255024. Tax Reckoner costs Pounds 99.95. The update for 1993-94 will cost Pounds 39.95 without a new manual, or Pounds 49.95 with one. Vital Software is at Dower House, Oxonhoath, nr Tonbridge, Kent TN11 9SS. Tel: 0732- 810330. The Microhelp programs cost Pounds 23.50 for either the income tax or the portfolio module, without the computation facility.

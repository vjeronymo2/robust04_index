			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Leading Article: A constitution is required TODAY'S EUROPEAN summit was convened by Mr John Major with a dual purpose: to consider 'shortcomings' in the European monetary system, and to respond to the concerns shown by electorates about the pace of European integration. Mr Major was soon dissuaded from tabling serious reform of the ERM, on the grounds that it might give markets the idea that a currency realignment was on the agenda. He still intends to have a post-mortem on last month's crisis, but this will not be 'a detailed operational discussion'; at most it will come to 'some procedural conclusions'. The main business, therefore, will be responding to public opinion - clearly something that needs doing. Even now it is not certain that the EC's leaders have taken the full measure of the crisis of confidence the Community confronts. Much of what has been said in the run-up to the summit smacks more of cosmetic presentation than of a serious rethink. To some extent that is inevitable. The 12 governments are rightly unwilling to tear up the Maastricht treaty and start again from scratch. A text agreed with so much effort cannot now be jettisoned without a great risk of torpedoing the entire European enterprise. The most important task that Europe's leaders have at this summit is to prove that they are still united and determined to move forward together. All are committed to Maastricht, and if they were now to abandon that commitment they would not soon agree on anything else to put in its place. The message received by the world would be that the EC is falling apart. Therefore the commitment has to be reaffirmed. Those who have ratified must stand by the judgment of their peoples or parliaments. Those who have not yet ratified must pledge their best efforts to secure ratification without further delay. The Danish government must spell out clearly what it thinks it needs to get the June verdict reversed, and the other 11 must do their best to supply it. Major's problem Whether the Danes can truly conceive a set of sidebars to the Maastricht treaty which do not require a new ratification process is open to doubt. It they cannot, their bluff may have to be called. Polls also show a large majority of Danes strongly attached to the EC as it stands. If invited to vote again on a text which, this time, has been ratified by all their partners, and is accompanied by one or more solemn declarations intended to soothe their main anxieties, they may well prefer to come on board. On the one hand, the debate in the other member states should have convinced them that they will not be alone in any future battles against excessive centralisation; on the other, they would know that by voting No a second time they run a real risk of the others deciding to go ahead without them. In other words, the 'Danish problem' is not really a Danish problem. It is shorthand for a problem of European public opinion in general, and perhaps British public opinion in particular. Indeed, many of Mr Major's guests in Birmingham believe that the real purpose of the meeting is to save his political skin. Luckily for him, they regard that as something worth doing. He may not be perfect in their eyes, but he has now staked his future on ratifying Maastricht and they do not want him to fail. What Mr Major apparently thinks he needs from this summit is an agreed statement on subsidiarity. Because he thinks he needs it, he will probably get it, though it is unlikely to take any very detailed form. Whatever preamble or sidebar is eventually to be tacked on to the treaty for Danish consumption will not be ready until the regular summit in December. From Birmingham, a statement of intent will have to do. Wider malaise But no one should imagine that such a preamble or sidebar is a sufficient solution to the widespread malaise which Maastricht has provoked, or revealed; or that the subsidiarity issue can ever be finally solved; or that that issue alone constitutes the problem. Much of the malaise is of economic origin and can only be cured by a renewal of economic growth. That part of it which relates to the structure and behaviour of the EC arises only partly from the non-respect of subsidiarity. It also arises from the lack of clarity and accountability in how the EC deals even with things which are properly its business. Subsidiarity can certainly be improved. Mr Jacques Delors, in the paper he submitted to his colleagues this week, suggested a sensible and carefully thought-out approach to the problem. Britain, especially, should welcome the emphasis he gave to the primacy of the internal market. For if this is neglected, subsidiarity could easily be used to demolish it, as differences in national regulations would undermine fair competition. But whatever happens the Community is going to retain significant powers, and it is vital that those powers be exercised in a democratic manner which citizens can easily follow. It is simply not acceptable that the legislature enacting rules for over 300m Europeans should be a cabal of ministers meeting behind closed doors. What the EC needs, and what Maastricht fails to provide, is a democratic and clearly intelligible constitution. Maastricht is still worth ratifying. But long before they are ready to implement its monetary provisions the leaders of the new European Union should reconvene to design a coherent set of institutions. One way to do this would be at a special intergovernmental conference before 1996, when the next one is due. Alternatively, the task could be undertaken by an elected constituent assembly, with the results subject to ratification by referendum in every member state.</p>

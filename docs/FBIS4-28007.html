			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a report from Kompong Cham Province,  hundreds of Vietnamese families are grabbing land belonging to  Cambodians on the upper and lower parts of the Kompong Cham port.    The Cambodian landowners there said they first saw 10 to 20  Vietnamese boats anchoring along the river banks near the port.  A few days later, they saw many more Vietnamese boats anchoring  along the river banks. Some small huts were also being built on  the river banks.    When the landowners told them to get out off their land,  these Vietnamese said they were not settling on these lands and  that they would be leaving after staying there for a few days.  Our people then returned home.    Two weeks later, the Vietnamese boat people went ashore and  built hundreds of huts on the river banks. They do everything,  including selling goods, fishing, and prostitution.    Seeing this, the landowners went to drive the Vietnamese off  their land. This time, the Vietnamese replied that the  Cambodian authorities had given them permission to settle there.  The Cambodian people complained to the ward authorities, but no  measures were taken to settle this problem. The people then  went to complain to the provincial authorities. But Hun Neng,  elder brother of one-eyed Hun Sen, who has been installed by the  Vietnamese as Kompong Cham provincial governor, threatened the  people against doing anything to harm the fraternal Vietnamese  and Vietnamese-Cambodian solidarity.    The people were very angry with this statement by Hun Neng.  They said he and all his colleagues are Vietnamese lackeys who  only defend the Vietnamese while oppressing the Cambodians. The  people said that they must not rely on the Vietnamese lackeys  any longer; they must solve the problem of Vietnamese  land-grabbing by themselves; they must not allow the Vietnamese  to grab their land; and that they will take action against Hun  Neng later.</p>

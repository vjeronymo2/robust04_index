			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Romanian Defense Minister Niculae Spiroiu by </F> unidentified Radio Romania reporter in Bucharest on 10 January  -- recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] Minister Niculae Spiroiu, the summit  meeting of the NATO member countries is currently taking place  in Brussels. What is your opinion about the solution proposed  by the Partnership for Peace to the East European countries and  about a possible access of our country to the North Atlantic  Alliance?    [Spiroiu] Well, there have been long preparations for that  meeting. As you know, there was also a meeting at Travemunde in  October. This is a meeting whose importance is determined by  the fact that, in practical terms, it will make official -- so  to say -- a viewpoint of the Alliance about the future of the  Alliance and mainly about the future position regarding the  acceptance of Central and Eastern European countries in NATO.  As is known, I have already mentioned it before that it is not  the Romanian Army that joins NATO, but Romania, and this is  Romania's foreign policy promoted by the competent bodies as  stipulated by the Constitution. The Army and the Ministry of  National Defense do nothing else but follow this foreign policy  and thus prepare the necessary elements to enable our military  body to integrate into the security structures that it will  join, namely NATO, the Western European Union, as well as other  structures. Thus, it is important for the Romanian Army that,  by following Romania's foreign policy, it should make the  necessary preparations for ensuring the compatibility of our  military body with the military bodies of the countries that  belong to the Alliance. Here I am referring to compatibility in  the area of structures, the decisionmaking system, political  control of civilian society over the military field, training  programs, and ultimately also the equipment, an element that  will be achieved gradually, as soon as necessary conditions will  be created for it. In this respect one might say that the reform  process in the Army that has been carefully prepared --  preparations for this reform finalized at around the end of 1992  and its implementation started as early as 1993 -- and includes  all these areas, starting with the legislative area up to the  other areas that I have mentioned before, does nothing else but  make our military body ready so that when the political decision  for our country to join the NATO or the security structures,  even on the basis of partnership is taken, we should be prepared  for it.    All I can say is that the Army has taken steps in this  direction. Certainly, the Partnership for Peace elevates to a  new level the partnership that has existed so far within the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC], that was set up after  1991, that is, after November 1991. Why am I saying that it  elevates the partnership to a new level? Because, this time we  are no longer talking about a collective relation, that is, to  join collectively these programs within the NACC, but about a  bilateral option, namely, the option of each state to have  access to this Partnership for Peace, certainly by fulfilling  certain conditions. And all I can tell you is the fact that  what we have been doing in the field of reforming the military  body is perfectly valid also for the Partnership for Peace.  Thus, if the meeting that is taking place today and tomorrow in  Brussels and that is attended by heads of states and governments  will adopt this idea of Partnership for Peace, I believe that  Romania, and mainly the Romanian Army -- since I can only talk  on behalf of the Army -- will fulfill the necessary conditions  to enable the competent political bodies to take steps toward  this partnership on a bilateral basis for peace.    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, do you believe that it is desirable  to have one step or several steps in the process of joining NATO?    [Spiroiu] It would be a great mistake to have several steps.  I have already stated, if I am not mistaken in the interview  that I granted to the daily ROMANIA LIBERA, or even in the  newspaper of the government that any type of discrimination  would create distrust and suspicion again and would bring about  a feeling of marginalization or isolation, which would be  counterproductive in view of the establishment of security in  this area. Thus, I believe -- but I have to repeat that the  decision rests with the political bodies -- that every country  should have equal security in this area, without discrimination,  without new frontiers, a sphere of security in which one should  take into account the interests of Russia and the independence  of Ukraine. In general, I personally believe that these are  very important elements for the establishment of European  regional security, thus the zone that includes also Romania.  Thus, this is very important.</p>

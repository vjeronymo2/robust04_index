			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BENEDICT CANYON CLOSING FOR 4 MONTHS FOR ROADWORK  </P> <P> In what is expected to cause a prolonged traffic headache for thousands of Los  Angeles commuters, Benedict Canyon Drive will close for about four months  starting in mid-August while construction crews rebuild a 2.1-mile stretch of  the crumbling canyon roadway.  </P> <P> The $1.1-million project will divert thousands of drivers between the Westside  and the San Fernando Valley to already-packed freeways and neighboring  thoroughfares.  </P> <P> Particularly hard hit will be the parallel canyon roads -- Beverly Glen and  Laurel Canyon boulevards, Coldwater Canyon Drive and Roscomare Road -- and the  main east-west roads at the top and bottom of the canyons, Mulholland Drive and  Sunset Boulevard. The Benedict Canyon closure comes at a time when traffic woes  have become the major concern of the affluent hillside residents between Sunset  and Ventura boulevards.  </P> <P> "It's not going to be 'Apocalypse Now,' but it is going to be bad," said Capt.  Vance Proctor, commander of the traffic division for the western division of  the Los Angeles Police Department. "There will definitely be an increase in  traffic on other roads and it will tack on extra long hours during the commute  period."  </P> <P> Despite the hardship, Benedict Canyon homeowners support the city's plans to  rebuild the road from Hutton Drive to the Beverly Hills city limits because the  highway is filled with huge potholes and gaping cracks. City engineers say the  road has deteriorated so much that patchwork repairs would be useless and they  are concerned about motorists' safety.  </P> <P> The Benedict Canyon Homeowners Assn. held several meetings with city officials  to work out project details, including the best time to resurface the road.  Although they both agreed that the best time to start would be in July, when  most schools are out, federal funds were not available so the project was  delayed.  </P> <P> "The road is in poor condition and it has needed to be resurfaced for years,"  said Fred Hamer, president of the homeowners group. "There's no doubt it will  cause some problems, but the long-term benefits make it worth it."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, neighboring canyon homeowners are dreading the coming months.  Already complaining that it sometimes takes 10 minutes to get out of their  driveways into the bumper-to-bumper commute traffic, they predict that even  simple trips to the store will take twice as long.  </P> <P> "It's going to aggravate a bad situation substantially," said Gerald Haims, a  member of the Coldwater Canyon Homeowners Assn. "It's a great concern for all  of us who live here. It's going to be a very, very irritating time.  </P> <P> "The real problem is not the people who live in the canyons -- they are very  tolerant of each other. But that's not true of the commuter traffic. Even when  the cars are at a dead standstill, they won't even let you in."  </P> <P> Tentatively scheduled to begin in mid-August, the first part of the project  calls for the reconstruction of Benedict Canyon between the Beverly Hills city  boundary and Hillgrove Drive. Once the work begins, the canyon road will be  closed by barricades between Hillgrove and Mulholland Drive, with only  homeowners, service people, visitors and emergency vehicles allowed through.  </P> <P> Traffic officials will give Benedict Canyon residents three access permits for  their cars and a private access code. Service people and visitors will be  required to give a correct address and matching access code to be admitted by  security officials at the barricades.  </P> <P> Traffic signals on parts of Mulholland Drive and Sunset Boulevard will be  adjusted to compensate for the heavier traffic, and extra police officers will  be assigned to the area.  </P> <P> "People will make adjustments and you find that in cases like this, traffic  isn't as bad as you might expect," said Brian Griffith, district engineer for  the project. "There are going to be areas where no matter what we try to do,  there's going to be more congestion.  </P> <P> However, Griffith acknowledges that the size and the length of the project pose  special problems for residents with high levels of traffic intolerance.  </P> <P> "We're talking about a different order of magnitude to hold the line for four  months, as opposed to six weeks for most projects," Griffith said.  </P> <P> As an added incentive to finish the project within four months, the contractor,  Security Paving Co., has a clause in its contract that will earn the company  $5,000 for each day the job is finished early. If the project runs over  schedule, the company will be penalized $2,000 per day.  </P> <P> Canyon residents and city traffic officials say they will do whatever they can  to move the project along as quickly as possible.  </P> <P> "They did a similar thing on Beverly Glen (in 1988) and everybody survived,"  Proctor said. "It's not going to be an easy time and I know a lot of people are  concerned. But still, I can't imagine it would be any worse than (driving on)  the 405."  </P> <P> The project: Reconstruction of a 2.1-mile stretch of Benedict Canyon Drive,  from the Beverly Hills city line to Hutton Drive.  </P> <P> Barricades: Once work begins, all access points to the canyon will be  barricaded. The barricades will be staffed around the clock by security guards.  During working hours, access from the north will be controlled at Mulholland  Drive. At night and on Sundays, it will be controlled from Hutton Drive.  </P> <P> BENEDICT CANYON DRIVE RECONSTRUCTION  </P> <P> Barricades will be placed on Benedict Canyon Drive at:  </P> <P> * The Beverly Hills city line  </P> <P> * Hillgrove Drive intersection  </P> <P> * Cielo Drive intersection  </P> <P> * Just north of Hutton Drive  </P> <P> * Just south of Mullholland Drive  </P> <P> * Deep Canyon Drive near Mulholland.  </P> <P> Work schedule: The project is expected to start in mid-August and last until  mid-December. Scheduled work hours are 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays and 8 a.m.  to 6 p.m. on Saturdays.  </P> <P> Access: Canyon residents displaying resident permits in their vehicles will be  waved through the barricades with minimal delay; these permits will be issued  three per dwelling shortly before construction begins. In addition, an access  code system will be set up so that residents can arrange for visitors and  service workers to enter the construction area. Details of the access code  system will be mailed to residents.  </P> <P> First phase: The highest priority will be the reconstruction of the roadway  from the Beverly Hills city line to Hillgrove Drive. When this is completed,  access to this southern portion of the affected area will no longer be  restricted.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORD LIKELY TO SEEK BUYER FOR NEWPORT BEACH DEFENSE UNIT  </P> <P> Ford Motor Co. is preparing to put its Newport Beach-based aerospace division  up for sale in a move that will come before the board of directors as early as  next week.  </P> <P> The possible sale of the unit comes amid increasing concerns about the  financial future of the defense industry, which is confronting major budgets  cuts as U.S.-Soviet tensions ease. In addition, the Ford Aerospace operation  has not been meeting its profit objectives set by Ford Motor headquarters in  Dearborn, Mich.  </P> <P> Industry sources speculated that Ford Aerospace would be purchased as a single  entity but then broken up and sold as separate pieces. The operation includes a  major missile manufacturing operation, a commercial satellite manufacturing  operation and various defense service organizations.  </P> <P> The company has purportedly prepared a prospectus for the sale of the operation  but industry sources said the prospectus has not yet been circulated.  </P> <P> Newport Beach-based Ford Aerospace Corp. has an estimated $2.5 billion in  annual revenue and 17,000 employees. It is uncertain what price Ford might seek  for the aerospace division.  </P> <P> Ford would not comment on speculation that Ford Aerospace is for sale.  Spokesman Bill Peacock said, "I think we're all aware that there is a lot of  speculation about the retrenching in the defense industry. But we're not  commenting on specific pieces (of reporting."  </P> <P> Chrysler announced recently that it would sell its defense business, but  General Motors has said it has no intention of disposing of Hughes Aircraft  Co., its defense unit.  </P> <P> A possible sale of Ford Aerospace was first reported in Washington Technology  magazine on Dec. 21. The San Jose Mercury News later quoted the head of Ford's  satellite operations in Sunnyvale as saying he was not aware of a possible  sale.  </P> <P> A senior official at a competing missile manufacturer said Ford Aerospace had  not met profit objectives set by the parent company and had lost a major  competition last year for a missile program known as the Advanced Anti-Armor  Weapon Medium. The winning team was Martin Marietta and Texas Instruments.  </P> <P> A move by Ford Motor to get out of the defense business would fly in the face  of Ford Aerospace's $425-million acquisition just over a year ago of BDM  International, a Virginia-based defense contractor involved in research for the  "Star Wars" anti-missile program, whose prospects are also uncertain.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most controversial of Ford Aerospace's programs was the Sgt. York,  an armored vehicle also known as DIVAD. The program was canceled by former  Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger in August, 1985.  </P> <P> The cancellation came after the Pentagon had spent nearly $1.5 billion on the  Sgt. York but then determined that the vehicle, equipped with radar and two  guns, was ineffective at its task of defending Army tanks and troops from  low-flying enemy aircraft.  </P> <P> At the time, the cancellation appeared to be a major blow to the Ford  subsidiary and the parent firm's participation in the defense business. The  program employed 1,900 people in 1984.  </P> <P> But the information provided later by sources made it seem as if the government  did Ford a big favor. Just before the cancellation, Ford was internally  projecting that it would lose more than $200 million on the Sgt. York program,  according to sources. As a result of the cancellation, Ford substantially  reduced its projected losses.  </P> <P> Ford's Newport Beach plant has a work force of about 3,000, and the company  employs about 4,500 others at its centers in Palo Alto, Sunnyvale and Mountain  View.  </P> <P> In a December, 1988, interview, Ford Aerospace President Donald Rassier said  the company was forecasting a growth in sales of between 10% and 12%. The  company had contract awards of $1.3 billion in 1988. No figure was available  for 1989.  </P></p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Message of the markets Bond markets have taken fright. But the slide in bond prices is only in part a response to changes in the fundamentals. It is also a technical correction after a long bull market. The question now is how the monetary authorities will - and should - respond to the adjustment, which has pushed the yield on US long-dated bonds up one percentage point since the trough in October. UK gilt yields have also risen by a percentage point since late December and even those on German bunds are up 0.7 percentage points since the beginning of January. At a time of increasing nervousness, markets tend to respond wildly to each new statistic. On Tuesday, it was the unexpected strength in the price index of the US Purchasing Managers monthly survey and news that US gross domestic product in the final quarter of last year grew at an annualised rate of 7.5 per cent. Yesterday, it was the turn of German money supply: the annualised increase in M3 of 20.6 per cent above the average for the last three months of 1993 sent shivers through the market. The figure is freakish. Nonetheless, it exacerbates the dilemma already confronting the Bundesbank, which has invested a lot of credibility in its 4-6 per cent target for M3 growth. The case for some such target is strong. The government, investors and wage bargainers all need clear guidance about the Bundesbank's intentions. But this advantage comes to naught if the failure to achieve the target has constantly to be explained away. It is particularly embarrassing when the Bundesbank feels forced to cut the short-term rate of interest even though its money supply target is overshooting. Yet that is exactly what it has had to do, however slowly and unwillingly. M3 seems to have been distorted, now by one thing, now by another, ever since unification. As for the astounding January figure, the annualised rate in the first month of a new year is inevitably volatile. In addition, the figure has been distorted by several special factors. The Bundesbank must now decide whether the persistent M3 overshooting is a warning of future inflation or a false alarm. Certainly, the real economy is not showing any sign of overheating. This being so, the Bundesbank will presumably ignore the latest rise. But its desire to postpone further easing until it has more information may be strengthened. A strong additional reason for caution, from the Bundesbank's perspective, is what has happened to bonds. The Bundesbank tends to pay particular attention to long-term rates of interest because of their relatively large role in German intermediation. But it will not be the only central bank to respond with caution. Even if part of the reason for rising bond yields is technical, part at least must be related to economic fundamentals. Cutting short-term rates in the teeth of such a shift in expectations could lead to a further flight from bonds, with damaging consequences, not least for German economic recovery. If a central bank is to cut interest rates in the face of rising long-term rates, it must be confident that its relative optimism over inflation will prove justified by events. Since they can no longer be so sure, central banks must be more cautious than they would otherwise have been. They should at least wait for the bond markets to settle down once more. For the moment, therefore, the right action in the main financial centres seems to be none. But it is too early to conclude that the trend towards lower short-term rates in continental Europe and the UK is at an end.</p>

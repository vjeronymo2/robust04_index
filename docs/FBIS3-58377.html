[passage  omitted] Cid Saldanha reports:    [Saldanha] [Passage omitted] NATO is to intervene in two  areas of former Yugoslavia, using force if necessary. The  objectives will be to protect UN contingents in Srebrenica and  to reopen the airport in Tuzla. This limited action was decided  at last night's dinner, attended by the heads of state and  government of the Sixteen. The action is not aimed at resolving  the Yugoslav problem, the solution to which can only be a  political one, Prime Minister Cavaco Silva said today.    [Begin Cavaco recording] Therefore, the outcome of this  summit, as a result of the accord achieved last night, is a very  clear statement that the allies have asked the United Nations or  the UN Security Council to take measures to protect UN soldiers,  to enable the rotation of the Canadian soldiers, and to enable  the opening of Tuzla airport to humanitarian aid. In  anticipation of what you may ask, [let me say that] in this  declaration and in what was agreed yesterday, the use of air  strikes is implicit, if deemed necessary in order to achieve the  objectives. [end recording]    [Saldanha] As for the possibility of such an involvement  representing greater Portuguese participation, Cavaco did not  rule it out, but said that this was not likely for now.    [Begin Cavaco recording] We cannot exclude ourselves from  making a contribution to peace operations, via NATO, via the  Western European Union, and via the United Nations. But at the  moment, and in line with last night's discussions, the question  is not one of increasing the number of troops on the ground.  [end recording]    [Saldanha] However, Cavaco Silva said that Portugal had made  available a small team of air traffic controllers that could be  stationed at Tuzla airport. The question of Bosnia has somewhat  altered the outcome of this summit that had centered on the U.S.  proposal Partnership for Peace. Cavaco Silva described this  proposal as the future of world security and described this  summit as one of the most important ever in NATO. [passage  omitted]</p>

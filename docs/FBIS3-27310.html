He made the statement here in a meeting with outgoing  Chinese  ambassador Huang Guocai.    Nouhak pointed out: Lao and Chinese leaders have maintained  close contacts with each other in recent years. Delegations  from various departments at different levels have frequently  visited each other. This has improved mutual trust and  friendship. Cooperation in the economic and cultural fields  have also developed rapidly and produced gratifying results.    He said: The two countries have satisfactorily resolved the  border issue left over from history in a very short period.  They have successively signed the "Sino-Lao Border Treaty" and  the "Sino-Lao Border System Treaty." This has not only laid a  stronger foundation for the good-neighborly and friendly  relationship between the two countries but also established a  model for peacefully resolving disputes between countries in  this region.    Nouhak said: The Lao party and government follow with great  interest the splendid achievements of China's in-depth reform  and expanded opening up. They are pleased to see that China is  more stable politically and socially, its economy prospers with  each passing day, and its people's living standards further  improve. He wished the Chinese people, under the leadership of  the CPC headed by General Secretary Jiang Zemin, achieve even  greater victories in building socialism with Chinese  characteristics.</p>

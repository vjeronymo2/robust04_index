			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZONING CODE AND THE COUNCIL  </P> <P> A recent poll conclusively showed that nine out of 10 people seeking building  variances and conditional-use permits prefer doing business with the Monterey  Park City Council than any other council in the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> To illustrate, at the Oct. 1 council meeting, a person asked for not one, not  two, not three, but four building variances and a conditional-use permit.  </P> <P> The applicant had illegally converted a garage into living quarters and needed  council approval to legalize the conversion and escape a court appearance. The  council OKd the variances.  </P> <P> Approving variances that forgive an illegally converted garage not only sets a  horrible precedent, but clearly does not meet any of the criteria (in the city  Building Code.) Therefore, at this very moment the city attorney is  hermetically sealed in a little room with porcelain fixtures next to the  council chamber creating a legal reason to justify the council's action.  </P> <P> What makes this situation even more questionable is that the applicant's name  prominently appeared on a political mailer sent out on behalf of Councilman  Fred Balderrama during the last election.  </P> <P> In addition, Councilman Balderrama was one of two council members to appeal  this case after the Planning Commission and Design Review Board rejected it,  thus saving the applicant a $244 fee. By their action, the council also saves  the applicant the time and cost of a court appearance.  </P> <P> Councilman Balderrama voted in favor of the applicant along with two other  council members who apparently are ignorant of the legal criteria and grounds  for approving variances. Or maybe it wasn't ignorance at all.  </P> <P> IRV GILMAN  </P> <P> Monterey Park  </P></p>

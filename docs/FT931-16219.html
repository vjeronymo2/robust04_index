			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Brazilian taxation reform for debate BRAZILIAN congressmen are to cut short their summer recess and return next Monday to a special session of Congress which has tax reform as its central issue. The session will be an early test for President Itamar Franco's strategy. He hopes to succeed during his two-year term by building consensus among legislators and opinion leaders, in contrast to the obdurate approach of his predecessor, Mr Fernando Collor de Mello, who resigned last week. The government is seeking additional tax revenues to reduce the budget deficit and to provide funds for social and infrastructure spending. It hopes that further changes in the tax code, together with already-approved adjustments in business income taxes, will bring it Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.8bn) more in revenues this year. The main proposal under consideration includes a levy on financial transactions, called a cheque tax, of 0.25 per cent. It would also simplify the dozens of individual levies in the Brazilian tax code. The administration is also considering a tax on company assets. A constitutional amendment, requiring two-thirds approval of both chambers, will be necessary if any new levies are to be implemented this year. The constitution stipulates that new taxes can only take effect in the 'fiscal period' subsequent to the one in which they are passed. One attorney speculated that the administration might try to skirt the need to change the constitution by defining each month as a 'fiscal period' and applying the tax in February if passed this month. If so, he predicted a flurry of company lawsuits. A bill approved by Congress in December lowered corporate tax rates from 30 to 25 per cent. However, many companies, especially those showing losses, will pay more because financial and operational income will be taxed separately. With Brazil's high interest rates, even money-losing companies have significant income from financial investments. The government hopes to obtain Dollars 5.2bn of the Dollars 12bn it says it needs through this mechanism. The National Confederation of Industry is threatening to go to court. Some observers believe higher taxes could reinforce a vicious circle of higher levies and growing evasion in Brazil. Brazilian tax rates are already high. The local subsidiary of Arthur Andersen, the US consulting firm, estimates that in 1992, federal and local taxes combined produced a tax rate of nearly 47 per cent on business. Other tax experts have estimated evasion rates of about 50 per cent. Some opponents of the reform argue that the government should merely do a better job of collecting taxes already on the books. Recent published estimates suggest that out of an economically active population of 61m, only 7m pay personal income tax, while 55,000 companies pay 80 per cent of corporate tax revenues due from 2m companies.</p>

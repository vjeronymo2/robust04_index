			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Xie Zuan (6200 9449): "There </F> Are Opportunities, Difficulties, and Hopes -- Hailing the  Satisfactory Conclusion of the Second Session of the Eighth  National People's Congress"]    [Text] Having satisfactorily fulfilled all items on its  agenda, the Second Session of the Eighth National People's  Congress ended this afternoon. The session was characterized by  democracy, solidarity, seeking truth from facts, and dealing  with concrete matters relating to work. The deputies  deliberated and approved Premier Li Peng's government work  report and other work reports, and decided on the work principle  and tasks of continuing to deepen reform, expand opening up,  promote production, and maintain stability.    The year 1994 is a crucial one for China in the transition  from the planned economy structure to the socialist market  economy structure, and one of accelerating the building of the  socialist market economy structure, maintaining the sustained  and healthy development of the national economy, and promoting  social progress in a comprehensive way. This year, a series of  major reform measures will be presented, and they will be  implemented steadily.    It seems that the tasks for this year are arduous, but the  prospects are bright. Just as the government work report  indicates, it is imperative to handle earnestly and well the  relationships among reform, development and stability. Economic  construction is the center of all work, and reform and opening  up are the impetus for development, whereas development and  reform are the foundation for socialist stability and lasting  order in the state, and the maintenance of social stability is  the indispensable condition for the development of the economy  and the smooth progress of reform. All work in China this year  will subject to and serve the overall situation of deepening  reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and  maintaining stability. While strengthening reform, opening up  and economic construction, the principle of "grasping two types  of work simultaneously, while paying equal attention to both"  will be adhered to. The building of socialist spiritual  civilization, socialist democracy, and the legal system will be  strengthened. All social undertakings will be developed  enthusiastically. Efforts will be exerted to elevate  educational, agricultural, cultural and art undertakings to a  new plane. We believe that through hard work, China will be  able to achieve these plans one by one.    China implemented the planned economy for a long period, now  it is advancing with long strides toward the market economy.  Doubtless it will face many difficult problems. In addition,  the building of a new structure itself is extremely arduous and  complicated. From building to consolidation and maturity takes  time and calls for society's all-out support. During the  session, however, people could see that China has already  discovered problems, and is beginning to look difficulties  squarely. As long as the chance is seized, China will be very  hopeful.    In the deputies' own words, the political situation in China  is stable and the opportunity is rare; the tasks are heavy and  the road ahead is long. From now on, China's economic  development and construction will operate by relying on the  legal system, and the lasting order of the state will be  guaranteed so that people can live and work in peace and  contentment.</p>

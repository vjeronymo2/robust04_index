Birkavs's decision was only disclosed on Monday, after the  session of the Latvian Way faction, in which the faction's  deputies questioned Andrejevs himself, Birkavs told journalists.  It is possible that the issue of confidence in Andrejevs will  not after all be brought up in the Saeima. The confidence vote  was proposed by Andrejevs himself in an open letter published in  DIENA, in which there was an admission of his collaboration with  the State Security Committee of the former USSR.</p>

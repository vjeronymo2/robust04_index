			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Fear of shopping The June retail survey from the Confederation of British Industry amply confirms that if the UK recovery is waiting for the consumer, it will have to wait awhile. Sales of household goods have fallen further below last year's levels. DIY stores, which saw growth in May, have slipped back again. Even grocery sales are slowing. The only bright spots are off-licences and chemists, which in the circumstances is perhaps not surprising. As for the outlook, retailers expect flat sales in July, while stocks, which were cut back sharply in June, are to be cut further. It remains peculiarly difficult to see what is to change the trend. The underlying message of the survey is that the weakest area of expenditure still relates to housing. If last Friday's rate rise by the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society is a guide - to say nothing of the momentary scare over a base rate rise - that is one area in which consumer confidence could have further to fall. From a narrower viewpoint, this once more raises the question of how to value the retail sector. As always, investors are reluctant to be out of retail on the grounds that it will be the first to enjoy the benefits when the recovery finally does arrive. But it is slightly unsettling to recall that retailing has outperformed the market in every quarter but one in the last two and a half years. Granted, some 60 per cent of the sector by weighting consists of Marks and Spencer, Boots and GUS, defensive stocks by any reckoning. But it is also worth recalling that the high rating of the retail sector in the 1980s was based above all not on trading but on asset inflation. Doubtless, the sector will be early to benefit from recovery. How much it benefits may be another matter.</p>

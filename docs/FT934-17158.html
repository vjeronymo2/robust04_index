			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / MoD to bring job cuts forward THE MINISTRY of Defence is to bring forward planned job cuts at its nuclear missile facilities on the Clyde, with reductions due to start next year, David White writes. It has announced plans to shed 340 jobs over the 12 months from April next year, with a further 300 due to go by the end of the decade, when the new Trident missile submarines will be fully operational. This is almost half the 1,400 workforce at Coulport's missile-handling facilities. The cuts come as a bitter blow to Scotland following the government's decision, confirmed this week, to stop refitting nuclear submarines at Rosyth on the Forth. Unions at the Clyde base had been expecting job losses but not at this stage of the programme. The cuts - which will save Pounds 16m - reflect the new arrangements for the US-supplied Trident missiles. Unlike Polaris missiles, which are serviced at Coulport, the Tridents will be returned to US facilities at King's Bay, Georgia, under a 1982 agreement between the two governments. Mr Ian Fraser, local secretary of the National Union of Civil and Public Servants, said: 'We were led to believe there would be gradual reductions, phased over a number of years.' The first Trident submarine is expected to become operational in early 1995. Some 3,000 people working for contractors at the nearby submarine base at Faslane also face progressive reductions as facilities there are completed.</p>

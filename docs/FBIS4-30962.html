			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mustafa Kurtovic from Gorazde] </F>   [Excerpt] According to information from the  surveillance-intelligence unit of the Operative Group East  Bosnia of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, the aggressor's units in  Gorazde are still 300-400 meters from the town center. This  once again proves that the aggressor is deceiving the domestic  and international public daily, which requires a more energetic  action by the UN Security Council and NATO and calls for an  immediate realization of Resolution No. 913 and the NATO  ultimatum. Since this morning, the Serbo-Montenegrin fascists  have been opening fire from antiaircraft machine guns and  antiaircraft guns at Hrenovica and [word indistinct] and from  antiaircraft machine guns, [words indistinct] and sniper rifles  at Djinjici, Stupi, Brijegi, and [word indistinct]. There are  chetnik infantry arms provocations along the  Osanica-Ilovaca-Orahovice defense line. [passage omitted]</p>

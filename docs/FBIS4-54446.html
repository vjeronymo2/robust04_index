			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 26 (ATA) -- The tribunal of Skopje  had scheduled for April 25 the trial against 10 Albanians  arrested several months ago, among who Mitat Emini, former  secretary of the Democratic Prosperity Party, Shenasi Rexhepi,  former assistant minister of defence in The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] and others. The trial has been  postponed for May 9, 1994 due to the strike staged by defence  attorneys.    The 10 Albanians are accused of the criminal act of  "collaboration for hostile activity," the Albanian TV said in an  information with a source from Skopje. Further on the  information said that Macedonian means of information are  manipulating even in the case of this trial, presenting the  accused as heads of the Albanian Army in this republic. Their  trial is being used for political aims on the verge of  multinational elections, presenting the Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia endangered by them. The Albanian political parties  in this republic considered the said trial as framed and against  the Albanians.</p>

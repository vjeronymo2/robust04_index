			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Graystone in agreed bid for Brit Syphon GRAYSTONE, the engineering company formed out of Ptarmigan Holdings, the flowers and hotels group, yesterday launched its second large paper-backed acquisition in little more than five months. It is buying British Syphon Industries in a recommended cash and shares offer which values the engineering, packaging and motor components company at Pounds 32.8m. For every 100 Syphon shares Graystone is offering Pounds 76.3 cash, 34 ordinary shares and 28 19.2 per cent cumulative preference shares. Graystone is raising Pounds 18.4m through a 7-for-4 rights issue of up to 167.4m shares at 11p each to help pay for the cash element. It is underwritten by Chemical Investment Bank. The brokers are Henry Cooke Lumsden. Graystone shares closed  1/2 p lower at 10p while British Syphon fell 12p to 83p. At the closing price the offer values Syphon shares at 96.5p. British Syphon brings with it about Pounds 8m in cash. The enlarged group would have turnover of roughly Pounds 60m in three distinct legs, mechanical products with some design features, electrical products and packaging and distribution. British Syphon has two main shareholders. Both have agreed to accept the offer. Britannia, a subsidiary of Bankers Trust, holds 69.4 per cent, the legacy of an attempt by management to take the company private, and companies connected with Mr Nathu Ram Puri, who foiled the privatisation, which hold 23 per cent. In May Graystone bought Cableform from FKI for Pounds 8m, funding the deal by a 14-for-3 rights issue priced at 8p each. In November it bought three engineering companies from Prospect Industries, a company which Mr Dick Richardson, Graystone's chairman and chief executive, originally floated off from Tace, the environmental controls company. He was managing director of Tace until 1991 when he resigned following a boardroom row. Mr Richardson, who joined Graystone in June last year, said: 'The engineering business is quite a good fit. They are already customers of ours as well as competitors. They also have distribution companies within them which gives us access to new markets.' Graystone hopes to pay both interim and final dividends for the year ended June 30 1994.</p>

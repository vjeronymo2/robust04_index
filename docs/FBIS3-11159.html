			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Passages in quotation marks in Creole] </F>   [Excerpt] Assistant Mayor [Joseph] Gerald Salomon says he  is ready to meet with Mayor Evans Paul provided that the press  is present. Salomon, who has been accused of hindering the  payment of Port-au-Prince City Hall employees, sends the ball  into the court of Evans Paul. The assistant mayor of the capital  accuses Paul of trying to impose suffering on the employees.    [Begin recording] [Salomon] ...in front of the press, on  television. I am ready to meet with the mayor to discuss these  problems because it is time that the public be made aware of  what is going on within the administration.    "The payroll has been prepared so that the refuse collection  employees can be paid for one month. The money has remained in  the mayor's hands. Until now, employees have been coming here  everyday and none of them has received his salary. Payroll has  been prepared for the communal home, but very few of those  people have received their salaries. Payroll has been prepared  so the mayors can be paid. No mayor has received his salary,  except for him [Evans Paul]. Payroll has been prepared for the  mortuary service. Until now, the people have been burying the  dead every afternoon for 12 months.    "The money has been in the mayor's hands for one month. The  money left the Supreme Audit Court on 8 February. At this time,  City Hall has over 4 million gourdes in the bank. Nobody has  received any salary except the mayor and his driver.    [Unidentified journalist] "You said you are ready to sit  face-to-face with Mayor Evans Paul, but in the open, in  public...."    [Salomon, interrupting] ...in public so he can provide  explanations regarding his infamies. People's money has been in  his hands for one month. He has not paid them. This is sad. One  cannot make people suffer like that.    [Journalist] "So, if I understand properly, you are not  responsible for what is going on today in City Hall?"    [Salomon] I am not. I called representatives of the mayor on  several occasions, [asking them] to come here. If paychecks are  available, they must find a way to pay the people. [passage  omitted] [end recording]</p>

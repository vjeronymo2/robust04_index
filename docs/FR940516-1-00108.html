			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Both the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute and the Engine Manufacturers Association have requested that EPA extend the effective date to 1997 for all engines. The Portable Power Equipment Manufacturers Association has requested that EPA extend it to 1997 for engines regulated and sold in California and to 1999 for preempted engines and engines discontinued in California. These industry association requests are available in the docket for this rulemaking. In all cases, these associations have argued that more lead time is needed to apply these standards to nationwide sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comment on the impact of its proposed effective date on both engine and equipment manufacturers. EPA also requests comment on alternative effective dates, including phased effective dates, such as 1996 for nonpreempted engines and 1997 for preempted engines, or a phase-in by engine size where Class I, II, III, IV, and V engines would meet the applicable standards at different times based on environmental impact and lead time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constraints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> J. Selection of Worst Case Emitter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA is proposing to use the criteria of highest weighted brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) over the appropriate engine test cycle to determine that engine configuration within an engine family which will be selected as the certification test engine. EPA believes that BSFC is an appropriate criterion for selecting a worst case emitter. In particular, EPA believes that an engine configuration with high BSFC will generally emit higher levels of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide than a second configuration in the same engine family which has a lower BSFC. EPA solicits comments on the appropriateness of weighted BSFC as the criterion to be used for selecting the worst case emitter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA considered one alternative method of selecting the worst case emitter. EPA considered leaving the selection of the worst case emitter up to the engine manufacturer with the guideline that the engine manufacturer must test that engine configuration within an engine family which is most likely to exceed any emission standard. EPA solicits comment on the appropriateness of this approach for selecting the worst case emitter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> K. Adequacy of Test Cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The test procedure proposed in this notice is capable of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predicting emission reductions at the level of proposed emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. The proposed test cycles are based on the Society of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Automotive Engineers (SAE) recommended practice  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> J1088. This is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a procedure that measures emissions over a number of steady state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating modes or conditions (speed/load points) and determines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average emissions over the entire test cycle by weighting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modes relative to their likely occurrence in actual use. Much of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the emission assessment work to date has occurred using the J1088  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has determined that the types of technology that will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forced by setting standards using the proposed test cycle will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in real emission reductions in actual use. The current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasible technologies are analogue in nature. Thus, when a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology is demonstrated to reduce emissions on six discrete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points on the engine speed/load performance curve, EPA expects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these technologies will perform in a continuum between those test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points. No large emission spikes will occur under operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions that were not specifically tested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No time is available to develop a more accurate test cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While improvements can be made and must be studied before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing more stringent emission standards that require more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sophisticated technologies, EPA has determined this test cycle is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate to produce the desired emission reductions expected by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed emission standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of the Phase 2 emission regulation process, EPA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified three test modes of the test cycle that it intends to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> study. First, EPA wants to evaluate whether the test procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be run using the engine's governor to control throttle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, EPA wants to evaluate the method by which the load points  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in the test cycle are determined. Third, EPA wants to study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sensitivity of emissions to the operating conditions not used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the test cycle to ensure emission benefits are not being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overlooked.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operating the engine directly on the governor as opposed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the throttle is allowed in the current test procedure as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed. However, it is optional and most manufacturers choose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to run the test by directly controlling the throttle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers do this to reduce the factors that can add  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variability to the test. EPA believes that, since engines in use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are controlled by the governor, a test cycle that simulates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual operation as closely as possible has the potential to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predict real in-use emissions more accurately. Before such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change is adopted, EPA intends to analyze the validity of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hypothesis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The average power generated during the test cycle has a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large impact on the emission result. The emission standards are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the mass emission generated for the amount of work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished (g/kWh). Since power is a factor in how much work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be accomplished, it weighs heavily in the final mass emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result. EPA wants to ensure that the test cycle does not reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> how much power (and thus work) the engine is capable of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieving, but is reflective of how much power the equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actually commands from the engine as it does its work. EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned that the actual power drawn by equipment in actual use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is lower than the average power drawn from the engine during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed test procedures. EPA does not have time to adequately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verify this hypothesis within the timeline of this rule, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intends to do this during the Phase 2 rulemaking process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

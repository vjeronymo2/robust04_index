			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] I shall continue in my post until I am released in  writing by the president in accordance with the Constitution,  Marek Borowski said today in an interview for the Polish Radio  Third Program.    [Begin Borowski recording] My resignation is final. The  objective of the meeting of the government coalition yesterday  was not to negotiate the matter but to explain the problem to  one another and to think about what to do next so that problems  like this will not arise in the future, as well as to part  without anger. I think we have succeeded in doing this. I  shall stay on in the post until I am released in writing by the  president in accordance with the Constitution. [end recording]</p>

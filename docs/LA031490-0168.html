			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: 'THREE MEN AND A BABY' IS 6 YEARS OLD, FILMING  </P> <P> REMEMBER "Three Men and a Baby"? Well, how could you forget that fluffy little  thing; it was such a big hit! Now "Three Men and a Little Lady" will reunite  Tom Selleck, Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg. It goes before the cameras April  9 in Los Angeles before moving to New York and Great Britain for further  filming.  </P> <P> In this sequel, the baby, named Mary, will be 6 years old. The plot is to  revolve around how her mother, Sylvia (actress Nancy Travis), is getting ready  to marry an English director. This means she will have to move abroad. The  three men who adore Mary are desperate, particularly Selleck, who has fallen in  love with Sylvia. So the three guys tour England, trying to prevent the  wedding.  </P> <P> WHO WERE the most glamorous, best-groomed women at the People's Choice Awards  last Sunday? Without a doubt, Raquel Welch and Jane Fonda took the honors for  pizazz and yet neither of these stunners will ever see 40 again. So much for  the Youthquake. Jane did appear to be having some problem with her cue cards  and it was fascinating -- as live television often is -- to see this usually  composed creature so flustered.  </P> <P> Roseanne Barr took home two awards, so in spite of the unsavory publicity that  constantly surrounds her, the public obviously still adores her. But she gets  this year's award for the worst acceptance speech. Really, shouldn't these  performers prepare just a little bit in case they win? It hurts their image to  appear so edgy, nervous and inarticulate. "You know, you know, you know" -- if  only this expression could be expunged from nervous speakers, the whole world  would improve.  </P> <P> CARROLL O'CONNOR has just marked the first anniversary of his serious heart  surgery and gall bladder removal but he was too busy to party. The great star  of "In the Heat of the Night" and his wife, Nancy, are remodeling their Beverly  Hills restaurant. This was formerly The Ginger Man but will soon be known as  Carroll O'Connor's Place.  </P> <P> Carroll's series for NBC wrapped for the season on Feb. 28, but he went right  to work on the above without a vacation. On April 1, he'll serve on Harry  Belafonte's committee for the Transafrica Benefit, and on April 7 Carroll  receives the John Wayne Cancer Clinic's Humanitarian Award in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> So how about those stories in the Enquirer that say Carroll is almost too  deeply depressed to move? This time he shrugs. Not true, sez Carroll.  </P> <P> ANDREI KONCHALOVSKY may be best known to you as the Russian who was once a big  heartthrob to Shirley MacLaine. But let's not forget his first American film in  1985, "Runaway Train," was nominated for three Academy Awards. After that he  did "Maria's Lovers," "Duet for One" and "Shy People."  </P> <P> So, Konchalovsky, the first Russian director to make movies in the United  States, is now going to return to the Soviet Union for the first time in 11  years. He will film "The Projectionist," marking the first time a motion  picture has been shot behind the walls of the Kremlin.  </P> <P> This is the tale of a loyal Stalinist who becomes Old Joe's personal  projectionist. Such an idea was unthinkable even six months ago, but now the  "Amadeus" star Tom Hulce is to be co-starred with Lolita Davidovich (you saw  her in the title role of "Blaze") in a film by Konchalovsky and Anatoly Usov.  </P></p>

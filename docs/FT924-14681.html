			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (1): Suspended animation - Denmark's future relationship with Europe will be determined over the next few months. Meanwhile, the country is living in suspended animation as a result of uncertainty caused by the Maastricht dilemma and the recent currency turbulence in Europe THE self-confidence, indeed self-satisfaction, of the Danes can rarely have soared to such heights as it did in June this year when they opened the month by rejecting the Maastricht treaty in a referendum on June 2 and then went on to win the European soccer championships. Ever since those heady days the Danes have enjoyed the feeling that David must have had after slaying Goliath. Nothing, perhaps, better illustrates the extraordinary upsurge in national feeling than the fact that more people turned out in Copenhagen to welcome home the soccer team than took to the streets on Liberation Day in 1945 to celebrate the end of the German occupation. But the country's leaders have not shared so fully in the popular euphoria. They have a deeply worried look. The optimistic view of the consequences of the Danish No to Maastricht is that Denmark has become a catalyst for change in public and political opinion and that modifications to Europe's structure will follow which will make the Community more acceptable to public opinion. The pessimistic view is that the Danes have placed themselves firmly on the sidelines of Europe and that what was seen by the voters as an assertion of national independence will instead render Denmark dependent on the Community, but without influence on its deliberations or decisions. The drama of Denmark's future relationship with Europe will be played out over the next few months and what the Danes themselves think or do may be of relatively little significance compared with what the Germans, the French, the British and others decide. In the interim, the country is living in suspended animation. All systems have gone into dead-slow as a result of the uncertainty caused by the Maastricht dilemma and the currency turbulence in Europe over the past few weeks. Economic activity has sunk to such a low level, says Mr Knud Sorensen, chief executive of the country's largest bank, 'that people can't even be bothered to paint their own kitchens any longer.' Still, Denmark's real GDP is expected by the government to increase by about 1.3 per cent this year and, but for the worst harvest for generations, caused by a long early-summer drought, the growth rate would have been half a point higher, which would have put the country among Europe's better performers. Denmark itself was not at the eye of the currency storm. Speculation against the krone pushed short-time term market rates of interest to exotic levels (at the time of writing, the one-month CIBOR was 29 per cent), but the Nationalbank (central bank) did not have to raise its own key interest rates to control the crisis. Given the state of the Danish economy just a few years ago, the ability of the country to weather the currency storm relatively unscathed is remarkable. Over the past 10 years, under the guidance of a succession of minority governments all headed by Mr Poul Schluter, the Conservative Party leader who celebrated his 10th anniversary as his country's leader on September 10, the external strength of the economy has been transformed. In 1982, Denmark was suffering from both an uncomfortably large external deficit and a budget deficit which peaked at about 11 per cent of GDP. In the course of the 1980s, the twin deficits were brought under control. The current balance of payments is now in substantial surplus of about DKr25bn; more than 2 per cent of GDP. The budget, for a brief period back in surplus, is in deficit again, but the deficit is relatively small - about DKr38bn or just over 3 per cent of GDP. If the Folketing (parliament) so decides, Denmark qualifies as a core member of the European Economic and Monetary Union, but on present evidence the Folketing will decide otherwise. Resolution of the problems caused by the No to Maastricht will remain at the top of the political agenda for some months, but not to the exclusion of other issues. The improvement in the external strength of the economy has yet to be paralleled by reforms which can strengthen the domestic economic performance. This will be the dominant issue of the 1990s. There is a feeling in the air that after 10 years with Mr Schluter and the Liberal Party leader, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister since 1982, the time for a change may be arriving. The opposition Social Democratic Party, which dominated Danish politics from the late 1920s until 1982 and is smarting at its long period in opposition, changed its leader in April when Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, 48, a former chief economist at the Trade Union Confederation, was elected leader. As a person and as a politician, the small centre parties, especially the Radical Liberals and the Centre Democrats, which are the king-makers in Danish politics, find him to be a more acceptable candidate for prime minster than either of his predecessors. But unless Mr Rasmussen shows willingness to consider radical changes in the structure of the bloated welfare state - which the party was primarily responsible for building up - parliamentary support for a change of regime may evade him, says Mrs Marianne Jelved, the leader of the Radical Party. Meanwhile, the parties which advocated a Yes to Maastricht - the Conservative and Liberal government parties plus the Social Democrats, the Radical Liberals, the Centre Democrats and one half of the Christian People's Party, representing almost five-sixths of the seats in the Folketing - have worked out a strategy to ensure that Denmark can nevertheless remain a fully participating member of the European Community. Denmark's negotiating position is not without some strength because the treaty cannot be implemented without the signature of all 12 members. The reality, however, is that if all the other 11 ratify but Denmark finally refuses to sign, it will cause considerable inconvenience for the other members. But the 5.1m Danes will not stop the other governments from going ahead with a European Union if they are determined to do so. The government's policy, therefore, is to gain authority to sign the treaty from a second referendum next year - but with several reservations or exceptions for Denmark to parts of the treaty. Mr Schluter has outlined a three-part package as the basis for next year's referendum. The first part will consist of an unchanged treaty text. To persuade the voters to swallow the treaty, two sweeteners will be added. Part two of the package will be a new agreement between all 12 members committing the Community to greater openness in its deliberations and emphasising that the principle of subsidiarity must, as it is intended, minimise interference from Brussels in the status and authority of national legislatures. The third part will consist of special arrangements, or exemptions, for Denmark. The detail of the special arrangements which Denmark wants have still to be hammered out in inter-party negotiations. The Danish proposals will first be presented in late October or in November in preparation for the Community's Edinburgh 'summit' meeting in December. But the broad outlines of the Danish requirements are clear and reflect what the voters on June 2 are deemed to have objected to most strongly in the Maastricht treaty. The Danes are uncomfortable with the idea of a common European defence (other than Nato) and allergic to the idea of a European army, so the first requirement will be an exemption from Danish participation in a common European defence policy. There is strong antipathy to the introduction of a common currency, so the second requirement will be an assurance that Denmark is not committed to participation in the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union. Rejection of European citizenship is likely to be another Danish requirement although, because Denmark allows foreign residents to vote in local elections, which is the main purpose of introducing European citizenship, this reservation does not seem to be very weighty. Two parties advocated a No to Maastricht; the right-wing Progress Party and the left-wing Socialist People's Party. Ideally, the Yes parties would like to ensure the support of at least one of the No parties, more especially the Socialist Peoples Party. The treaty was defeated primarily because the supporters of the Social Democratic Party ignored the advice of the party leadership. More than 60 per cent of the party's supporters voted against the treaty. It is felt that it would reassure left-wing voters if the SPP backed a Yes next time, but Mr Holger K. Nielsen, the party's leader, is keeping his options open. If the Danes vote No in a second referendum it will be a tragedy, says Mr Schluter. Denmark would then have to obtain some kind of associate membership of the Community. At worst, such a relationship could mean that the EC refuses to allow Denmark to continue to participate in the common agricultural and fisheries policies. Agriculture and the related food processing industries account for about 25 per cent of Denmark's merchandise exports and Denmark is one of the Community's largest exporters of agricultural products to third countries. Exclusion from the CAP would therefore have extremely serious economic consequences for Denmark.</p>

This  is based on certificates of inspection issued by the defense  forces headquarters on 1 and 16 February. The Riigikogu state  defense commission cannot accept the defective weapons which  arrived as part of the arms deal, as a gift to the Republic of  Estonia. This is what a statement says, signed by both Rein  Helme, chairman of the Riigikogu state defense commission, and  his deputy Peeter Lorents. The statement was released after the  commission's closed sitting today. The sitting heard  explanations from Foreign Minister Juri Luik, Defense Minister  Indrek Kannik, and Defense Forces Commander Aleksandr Einseln  and discussed assessments made by experts at the defense forces'  headquarters. State Secretary Ulo Kaevats had provided his  explanations in writing.    The Estonian Government concluded an arms deal with TAAS  Israeli Industries Ltd on 7 January of last year and the  Riigikogu ratified it on 15 December. According to the  agreement, the TAAS firm pledges to sell to Estonia various  defense products and services. The arms deal contract  stipulates that the Israeli TAAS firm guarantees the reliability  of the products and effectiveness of materials. The total arms  deal amounts to over 49 million U.S. dollars, over 680 million  Estonian kroons, and Estonia is to pay this amount in (?eight)  installments.</p>

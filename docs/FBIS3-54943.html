A special  report by scientific center leaders and experts on this vitally  important topic has been published in a special issue of the  RAU-corporation's information and analytical weekly OBOZREVATEL.  This report will be issued to all State Duma and Federation  Council deputies since it is intended primarily for people who  make political decisions or take part in their preparation.    The new Federal Assembly has to begin work at a dramatic and  crucial period in Russia's history. The country's fate in  forthcoming years will depend largely on the present-day  decisions of the legislative and executive organs of power.    Will the present crisis be overcome or not -- that is the  question. Suffice it to say that the year of 1992 went down in  Russia's history with an extremely alarming outcome. For the  first time in peace time the death rate exceeded the birth rate.  Over the first nine months of 1993 the situation deteriorated  still further -- the death rate exceeded the birth rate by 0.5  million. That means that there is a real threat to the existence  and survival of the nation itself.    Today we must assess soberly and without prejudice the  situation in which the country has found itself and ascertain  the reasons which have led to such a tragic development of  events.    The authors of the report believe that it is essential to  renounce an excessively ideological assessment of events and the  traditional habit of forcing these assessments to fit the  short-term goals and aims of particular political parties.  Before it is too late the interests of the people and the  country as a whole must be put foremost -- not verbally, as has  been the case before, but in practical actions.    The main principle of state policy in our day is less  ideology, and more science, pragmatism, and national consensus.  Otherwise, with the present split, it is impossible to  elaborate a correct and effective policy for effecting  transformations to society and the economy. This approach is  especially important in ensuring the Russian state's security.    Above all, the report's authors believe, we must clearly  determine Russian national interests and the priorities which  accord both with the interests of individual citizens and of  society as a whole and among these put foremost those on which  the existence of the state itself depends. On this basis  scientists propose to elaborate a program of reforms in the  interests of all society as a whole, and not of individual  strata of society.    A program which is of a national nature, a realistic,  pragmatic program free of any form of dominant ideology -- that  is what our country is in extreme need of today. The authors of  the analytical report about Russia's future rightly emphasize  that the Fatherland's citizens have the right to know and are  even obliged to know the nature of the latest "bright horizons"  which are being offered to them, the way in which reforms will  be conducted, and how much time they will take. Citizens have  the right not only to question but also to completely disagree  with a proposed program and ultimately to demand a report on the  government's activity.    As the recent elections showed, the country needs a  government which can find a way out of the crisis. All  democratic forces interested in Russia's conservation and  prosperity are called on to unite on this government's  nationwide platform.    For this scientists propose not so much an economic as a  comprehensive program of actions. Russia's national security  strategy in 1994 should include, first, the renunciation of the  extremes of the political struggle and the consolidation of  legality and law and order, second, a fruitful struggle for  Russia's economic, financial, and political independence, third,  a series of effective measures, not propaganda measures, to  improve the living conditions of Russia's citizens and above all  of the least protected of them -- pensioners, the sick,  children, and the disabled -- and, fourth, the resurrection of  Russia's spiritual potential. The report offers a detailed  analysis and a package of measures for all these avenues.</p>

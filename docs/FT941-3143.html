			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: GrandMet and Brent Walker off to court Grand Metropolitan is taking Brent Walker and William Hill to court in an attempt to clarify an aspect of the September 1989 agreement between them, under which GrandMet sold its betting shops business for Pounds 685m. The legal proceedings look set to regenerate a bitter dispute between the two companies over the deal. The purchase of William Hill and Mecca Bookmakers from GrandMet, and the debt taken on to effect it, proved the final straw for Brent Walker, the leisure and property group, which was already overburdened with borrowings. A year after the purchase went through, Brent Walker was tipped into the financial crisis from which it has never recovered. Brent Walker has been attempting to reclaim Pounds 200m of the purchase price from GrandMet since 1990, saying that profits of the business were not up to the promised level. Brent Walker, which finalised a financial restructuring in March 1992 but has since met further problems, only refinanced the Pounds 375m William Hill loan at the beginning of this month. The timing of GrandMet's move suggests it was waiting for the refinancing before proceeding. The disagreement between the two companies over the purchase price had gone to independent arbitration, but as yet no conclusion has been reached. In its statement Brent Walker said GrandMet was 'seeking rectification of certain clauses of the agreement'. These are thought not to relate to more than half the value of Brent Walker's claim. GrandMet said that originally both sides had interpreted one aspect of the agreement the same way. However, in the last 18 months or so, it asserted, Brent Walker had changed its interpretation of the agreement. GrandMet said it was going to court so the question of how to interpret the clauses could be settled by a judge. Brent Walker never paid the final Pounds 50m instalment due to GrandMet in September 1990. GrandMet sued Brent Walker for the payment and the court ordered Brent Walker to pay. However, the amount due is still rolling up interest and GrandMet has not received it.</p>

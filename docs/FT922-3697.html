			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Companies stir a sleepy corner as they search for the Holy Grail: The popularity of undated preference shares UK companies and banks eager to bolster their balance sheets are turning again to undated preference shares to raise permanent capital, stirring an area of the capital markets dormant for 20 years. In May, Commercial Union became the first UK insurer in recent memory to issue preference shares, raising Pounds 100m. This week Enterprise Oil is looking to raise up to Dollars 300m (Pounds 164m) by issuing preference shares in the US, the first UK non-bank company to raise equity capital like this. Preference shares pay a fixed coupon like a bond but rank below all debt holders in the event of winding up. Interest payments can be suspended if the company hits trouble, absorbing losses like equity if dividend payments are passed. And because most preference shares do not have a redemption date, holders need never be repaid. The only recent UK issuers of preference shares were banks, stimulated by the fine print of international banking regulation: other than ordinary shares, preference shares are the only instrument classified as 'core' capital. Banks have driven the latest rash of sterling issues. National Westminster launched a Pounds 140m preference share issue in September last year, followed by Barings and Bank of Ireland. From the perspective of the UK company finance director, preference shares offer a simple way to bolster the balance sheet without diluting existing shareholders. 'Everybody has been looking for the Holy Grail - an instrument which counts as equity on the balance sheet, yet is non-dilutive to existing shareholders,' commented Mr Andrew Shilston, treasurer at Enterprise Oil. While the quest is not new, many of the more complex instruments designed to meet the objective have proved fundamentally flawed: Convertible preference shares incorporating a put option - allowing investors to sell the bonds back to the company at a premium - were issued by a number of high-flying UK companies including Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Next and Hillsdown. However, as shares fell from the peak of the late 1980s, investors demanded repayment rather than converting into ordinary shares. Supposed equity capital became a pressing liability. Convertible capital bonds are deeply subordinated in the manner of equity but do not contain the dangerous premium put option. Issuers include Sainsbury, Tesco and Tarmac. The exact terms of issues vary, but even under old accounting rules auditors were not always comfortable presenting convertible capital bonds as equity. Under new rules proposed by the UK Accounting Standards Board, most convertible capital bonds will have to be accounted for as liabilities. Auction-market preferred shares (AMPs) are a US invention, offering investors the chance either to sell their paper or demand a higher return at a regular auction. The drawback for the company is that the cost of capital rises if it runs into problems. If an auction fails completely, with most investors looking to offload paper, the AMPs pay a punitive interest rate. Dividends can be suspended, but mount up for payment at a later date. Rank repaid Dollars 200m AMPs last year when a decline in its credit rating increased the cost of capital. As each of these structures has shown fragility, attention has switched to the old 'plain vanilla' idea: fixed-rate, undated preference shares. Moreover, as interest rates fall, the cost of new fixed-rate preference capital should also fall. This has already happened in the US. At current interest rates sterling preference shares still look an expensive form of capital in the early years. But if companies deliver real dividend growth, fixed-rate preference capital soon becomes cheaper to maintain than ordinary equity. The biggest hurdle for potential sterling issuers is finding willing buyers. UK institutions had little appetite for undated fixed-rate instruments in the high inflation years of the 1970s and 1980s. Instead, they wanted equity-linked paper - such as convertible preference shares and convertible capital bonds. However, some institutional investors now take the view that sterling's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism should result in lower inflation and lower interest rates. It could also mean a period of economic consolidation, in which companies struggle to deliver real dividend growth. On this argument, fixed-interest instruments - especially paper priced to reflect current interest rates and offering a higher yield than ordinary corporate bonds - are again investments worthy of consideration. Few have switched substantial sums into fixed-interest securities. Most investors still expect ordinary shares to out-perform fixed-interest securities in the 1990s. 'The sterling preference share market is by no means unlimited. There is still a select group of major institutions driving it,' commented Mr David Karat, head of capital markets at Salomon Brothers in London. But even a marginal increase in buying of fixed-interest instruments has opened up the sterling preference share market. In addition to recent issues by companies and banks, building societies have raised Pounds 460m over the past year through issues of permanent interest-bearing shares. Like preference shares, these are undated, pay a fixed rate and are deeply subordinated. If this trend continues, more mainstream UK companies could be raising permanent, fixed-rate capital in either sterling or dollars. There are certainly good arguments for doing so. 'Academic theory states that the capitalisation of enterprise should not affect its value. In reality, there is virtue in looking at all forms of available capital,' commented Mr Stephen Crompton, treasurer at SmithKline Beecham, the UK-listed pharmaceuticals group.</p>

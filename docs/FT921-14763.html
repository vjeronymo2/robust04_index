			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Technology: Getting to market on time Concurrent engineering? Never heard of it, say 66 per cent of senior managers in UK manufacturing about a system that slashes product development times through teamwork and modern computer-aided design and manufacturing technology. That is one finding of the 1992 Manufacturing Attitudes Survey* sponsored by Computervision, the big Cad/Cam supplier, and released yesterday. The survey, conducted by Benchmark Research, polled 152 senior managers. It confirms that UK manufacturers have made great strides in reducing costs and improving product quality but they still have plenty of catching up to do on reducing product development times. The survey makes interesting reading in the aftermath of last week's initiative by the National Economic Development Council to spread the word about new manufacturing techniques throughout British industry. When asked what the key manufacturing issues would be in the next five years, more than 95 per cent of respondents said cost-reduction and more than 80 per cent said quality. Just 60 per cent said reducing time-to-market. Garreth Evans, Computervision UK managing director, said: 'The success of many multinational companies demonstrates that reducing time-to-market has a colossal beneficial impact on costs and quality. Why don't UK organisations recognise this?' Encouragingly, the survey found that 70 per cent of the sample had introduced multi-disciplinary project teams - an essential element of the concurrent, or simultaneous engineering, approach. And 44 per cent of these sites had included customers in the teamwork process. Of the 34 per cent who had heard of concurrent engineering, 72 per cent agreed that it offered a significant advantage over current methods of development. *1992 Manufacturing Attitudes Survey.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans says it would  be irresponsible if Australia rushed into making a decision on  whether to send troops to Rwanda as part of a United Nations  peacekeeping mission. The government has deferred a decision  and instead has sent a five-person reconnaissance team to assess  the situation in the strife-torn central African nation.  Senator Evans says this is not an unreasonable response to what  could be a very risky endeavor.    [Begin Evans recording] The situation is simply so complex,  so messy, so uncertain, that I think we would be irresponsible  if we made any firmer decision than that before knowing how it's  going to pan out.

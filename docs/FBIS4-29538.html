He delivered Kim's remarks in his talks with Foreign  Minister  Han Sung-chu after his arrival from Pyongyang, ministry  spokesman Chang Ki-ho said.    Han was quoted as telling him that the North Korea-U.S.  talks  should be consulted between Seoul and Washington after the two  countries confirm North Korea's true intentions.    Carter explained that reports about him telling Kim Il-song  that the United States stopped discussing sanctions against  North Korea was a result of misinterpretation, saying he meant  the sanctions will be temporarily suspended on condition that  the nuclear suspicion is resolved.    The ex-president and his wife returned to Seoul after a  four-day visit to North Korea where he met twice with the senior  Kim for extensive talks on the nuclear problem.    He came back with a message that Kim wants to directly meet  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam "without any delay."    Meanwhile, Carter said he tried to meet also with Kim  Il-song's heir-apparent son Kim Chong-il during his trip but was  denied.    A South Korean official said Carter asked several times that  he be able to meet junior Kim through North Korean officials but  was refused, being told that Kim Chong-il did not have time.</p>

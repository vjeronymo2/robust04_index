			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Banham warns council reform could cost Pounds 1bn SIR JOHN Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission, has told Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, that the transition costs of local government reform in England 'could well exceed Pounds 1bn'. In a letter to Mr Gummer, which has also been sent to local authority associations, Sir John also said the review could cause political trouble for the government. He said: 'A number of Conservative backbenchers have made it plain to us that they would like to see no change in the present arrangements.' Last month Mr Gummer changed his policy guidance to the commission and said it should recommend replacing counties with all-purpose unitary authorities, even if this involved marginal extra cost. He also accelerated the review, so that the commission should complete its recommendations for all English counties by the end of next year instead of 1997. Sir John's estimate of costs echoed a previous estimate of Pounds 1.1bn by the Labour-controlled Association of County Councils, which says the case for change has not been made. According to Sir John the costs could exceed Pounds 1bn 'once full information technology implications are taken into account'. But the cross-party Association of District Councils attacked the counties for 'scaremongering', and said high cost estimates had failed to take into account the possible gains from selling surplus buildings after reorganisation. Sir John sought to assert his independence and repeated complaints that civil servants had interfered with the review. The commission announces its final recommendations for restructuring Cleveland, Derbyshire and Durham on November 8. Local authorities are divided over Mr Gummer's new policy. The ADC has welcomed it but counties described Mr Gummer as 'presumptuous' for 'prejudging the wishes of local people and the outcome of the review'.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / SPD blocks tax reforms THE German government's tax reform package looks set to collapse after the failure of long negotiations with the parliamentary opposition. The package includes cuts in corporate tax, higher family allowances, and a one point increase in value added tax from 1993. Hopes of persuading at least two Social Democrat-ruled states to break ranks and support the package next week in the SPD-dominated Bundesrat, the German upper house, faded yesterday after the failure of a conciliation committee to find a compromise. The deadlock between the Christian Democrat-led governing coalition and the SPD means that the tax amendment package is almost certain to be rejected in the Bundesrat next week, and therefore to be abandoned. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, accused the SPD yesterday of 'frivolous and completely irresponsible' tactics in opposing the package, and promised that he would bring the same proposals back to parliament by April. That will coincide with state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and Baden-Wurttemberg, two key polls whose proximity almost certainly reinforced the deadlock. Even if he does then succeed in dividing the SPD, the amendments would be unlikely to become law before the autumn. The key issue is the VAT increase, from 14 to 15 per cent, which the SPD rejects as anti-social and inflationary. Mr Waigel insists that Germany is committed to the increase by the European Community, which has set 15 per cent as the floor. The stand-off on VAT has blocked the other proposals in the package, including an increase in child allowances from DM50 to DM70 a month and a series of enterprise tax cuts, such as a large increase in the tax threshold for company property tax, and a similar increase in the threshold for the tax on trading profits. The other key area hit by the deadlock is the transfer of resources from the wealthy western states to the east. The entire yearly proceeds of the VAT increase, DM10.4bn in 1993, were to be devoted to the German Unity Fund. In addition, structural funds for infrastructure projects in poorer western regions were to be transferred entirely to the east. The Confederation of German Industry accused the SPD-ruled states of 'fiscal egoism,' in blocking a tax package designed to make Germany more attractive to foreign investors. Mr Karlheinz Blessing, secretary general of the SPD, accused the government of failing to observe social equality and fair burden-sharing in the tax package, favouring business at the expense of the lower-paid.</p>

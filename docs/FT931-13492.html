			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Defence cuts may undermine Nato's role, Worner warns THE Nato alliance's chief mission, the defence of western Europe, risks being undermined by sharp cuts in defence spending by its members, Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general, said yesterday. Mr Worner warned that some - perhaps all - alliance members could be tempted to ignore the main defence force by focusing on innovations such as peace-keeping and the creation of a mobile rapid reaction force. Belgium has announced plans to cut its armed forces by nearly 50 per cent to 45,000 by 1995; the Netherlands aims to cuts the size of its army by more than half to 37,000 by the end of the century. These figures are inflated by the decision to end conscription by 1995 and 1998 respectively. Other Nato allies, hit by recession, are considering deep defence cuts. Germany faces a huge budget deficit because of the costs of unification. At a news conference in Brussels, Mr Worner reaffirmed that Nato remained the principal forum on European security questions. The Western European Union - the nascent defence arm of the European Community - was still complementary but subordinate to Nato, he said. Nato officials are worried that defence cuts in Europe will provoke retaliation in Washington. Already, the US Congress has passed a bill which reduces US spending on Nato infrastructure this year to Dollars 60m (Pounds 39.4m), down from a planned Dollars 240m.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Letter: Advantage to preserve Sir, I was dismayed to read that the British Council's funding is at risk ('Funds threat to British Council', October 7). Widespread use of the English language is the one real long-term competitive advantage, not just for British industry and commerce but also for British art and culture that Britain has on the world stage. It would be short-sighted to risk that advantage for any short-term gain. I would hope that Sir Martin Jacomb, a merchant banker of repute, is able to persuade the Foreign Office and Treasury number crunchers to share a banker's vision of Britain's long-term investment needs. I Jacob, Robson Rhodes, 186 City Road, London EC1V 2NU</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Waigel rejects advice on interest rates from Paris: French minister told the Bundesbank knows best MR Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday effectively told his French counterpart, Mr Edmond Alphandery, to mind his own business: the Bonn government did not need outside advice, and German monetary policy was a matter for the Bundesbank alone. He was responding to a broadcast in which Mr Alphandery claimed he had called a meeting in Paris for yesterday to discuss concerted action on interest rates. Mr Alphandery said the Bundesbank should move faster to relax its 'unduly restrictive' monetary policy. 'We are going to speak equal to equal . . . That was not the case a few months ago . . . Today the franc can support itself, perhaps better than the D-Mark,' Mr Alphandery said. Mr Waigel, blaming pressure of work, instantly cancelled what his officials called a 'routine' quarterly meeting of the Franco-German economic and finance council. Yesterday he aired his riposte in a radio interview. Mr Waigel said the Germans knew exactly what was required and what was possible. The view from Frankfurt and Bonn is that the fledgling French minister's statements on Thursday were clumsy and undiplomatic. There would 'certainly' be no collaborative reductions in interest rates, he said. The government was doing 'precisely what is necessary to provide the Bundesbank with room to manoeuvre', in preparing a package of cuts aimed at reducing public spending deficits, which the Bundesbank considers essential before it can consider further interest rate reductions. It was certainly desirable that that interest rate cuts should be possible in a period of recession, Mr Waigel said. He said German long-term rates were at their lowest for three years. He and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, who was also due to attend yesterday's cancelled meeting, had repeatedly stressed how important it was for other countries to make the most of any latitude allowing reductions. France now has official short-term rates below those in Germany for the first time since the late 1960s. Fresh indications that western German inflation has peaked emerged yesterday with reports of year-on-year rises of 4.1 per cent and 3.9 per cent in two key states during June. For the whole of the region inflation is expected to dip to 3.5 per cent by the end of the year. But recent forecasts suggest little further decline in 1994. Currencies, Page 13</p>

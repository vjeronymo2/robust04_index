			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Business and the Environment: Containing a spent force - G7 plans to make Bulgaria's Kozloduy nuclear power plant as safe as possible After three years of discussion over how best to provide emergency aid for the 58 Soviet-designed nuclear reactors in the former east bloc, the Group of Seven industrialised countries has finally begun to act. It has just agreed its first joint project, an Ecu24m (Pounds 18m) grant to Kozloduy, Bulgaria's troubled nuclear power plant. The grant will be used to import safety equipment for Kozloduy, declared Europe's most dangerous nuclear power station in 1991. It will be paid out of the Nuclear Safety Account which was set up by the G7 at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development last March and had received contributions of Ecu115m by June. In return, the Bulgarians have agreed to shut down the plant's four 440MW VVER (old pressurised water reactor) units - which lack containment to enclose them in an accident - as soon as financially possible, which may be by 1998. The EBRD aims to make the plant as safe as possible until this happens. Unlike many of the region's other nuclear plants, Kozloduy has already received much western attention. 'Until now, we've received around Ecu18m from the EC's Phare programme (funding eastern European projects) and had some 1,000 western experts visiting Kozloduy, but this has been spent mainly on analysing the plant and its problems, and on retraining staff,' says Nikita Shervashidze, deputy chairman of the Bulgarian government's Committee of Energy. 'The EBRD grant will provide us with hard currency to buy foreign safety equipment. This will include process computers to make the system more user-friendly, extra cooling devices, isolation valves, spare parts and ultrasonic inspection equipment for the pressure vessels.' The equipment will be purchased through tenders which the EBRD will help NEK, Bulgaria's state-owned electricity monopoly, to organise. 'One of the weakest points of electricity companies in the former east bloc is organising procurement, arranging financing and dealing with western banks. We have no experience in this and will rely on the EBRD's support,' Shervashidze says. 'We hope we can complete the project within 18 months and set up a model of how it can be done for other recipients of grants.' But it is clear the west must provide much more funding if the project is to fulfil its long-term aim of seeing units one to four closed down. The Bulgarians are adamant the country needs nuclear energy and say Kozloduy supplies between 35 and 40 per cent of the country's electricity. Due to the ageing of the country's non-nuclear plants, this share could rise to 50 per cent, according to Yanko Yanev, chairman of the Bulgarian Nuclear Safety Authority (RNSA). He says the country will not close down the reactors until it can finance the upgrading of Kozloduy's remaining two 1,000MW units. 'We are willing to co-operate but we cannot accept some sort of conditionality. 'We are trying to look for energy options which will permit closure of units one to four, although three and four are relatively new.' But the two 1,000MW units could cost Dollars 500m (Pounds 357m) each to modernise and be made more reliable. They are considered safer than the 440MW reactors as they have containment facilities, but have proved to be a less dependable source of electricity than the older units. Last September a fire in unit six closed the 1,000MW units - they share a common spare power supply. Shervashidze is hoping the EBRD will also help Bulgaria to secure commercial loans for the upgrading work and for a second nuclear project on the Danube at Belene which is 60 per cent complete. But the country looks like having little chance of raising substantial funding from the west - negotiations with the London club of commercial banks over Bulgaria's Dollars 11bn debt broke down again in July. Also, many western countries and institutions, notably the World Bank, believe that nuclear energy is no longer cost-effective and will not finance new nuclear plants. Ivan Uzunov, professor of atomic energy at Sofia University, believes Kozloduy and other Soviet-built reactors in the region can only be made to pay if safety standards are compromised. Uzunov, who has advised western countries such as Austria and Italy on nuclear policy, says a grant of Ecu24m is 'absolutely nothing' compared with Kozloduy's immediate needs. He acknowledges the plant's safety has improved substantially in the past two years, but says he is still not satisfied that units two and three are sound enough to operate or that the plant's 7,000 employees have had enough training. But his main concern is the build-up over the past three years of 600 tonnes of spent radioactive fuel elements at Kozloduy which are being stored in pools of water. In cold war days, these were reprocessed by the Russians at little cost to the Bulgarians. Now, the country faces reprocessing bills of Dollars 1,000 per kg. Shervashidze says Kozloduy has storage space for the spent fuel elements for two more years. He hopes that by then, Bulgaria will have built dry storage facilities - but again, this requires financing. Uzunov would like to see alternative storage facilities built as soon as possible. He says that an explosion at the Soviet Kishtim nuclear plant in the Urals in 1957 was caused after 70 tonnes of spent fuel elements overheated due to a shortage of water; parts of the region are still contaminated. He also believes the Bulgarian authorities have not received enough independent advice and have been influenced by the western nuclear industry, hungry for new orders in eastern Europe due to falling domestic demand. As an alternative to spending on nuclear energy, he is lobbying for western help to improve energy efficiency at conventional power plants and increase Bulgaria's connections to international gas pipelines and electricity networks.</p>

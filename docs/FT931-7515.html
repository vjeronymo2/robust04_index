			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / People: Thorpe picks Imro over SFA Top jobs at City regulatory institutions have been much on offer recently - with the Securities &amp; Investments Board and three self-regulatory organisations, Imro, the SFA and PIA, the controversial new retail financial services SRO, all looking for chief executives in the past month or two. Following SFA boss John Young's appointment to SIB, Phillip Thorpe, deputy chief executive of the securities and futures industry SRO, and widely regarded as a strong candidate to replace Young, has decided to take up the seat at Imro that falls vacant on the retirement of John Morgan. Thorpe (right) who, since October, has been working on the Large review of the workings of SIB to be presented to the chancellor next month, says it was the 'element of reconstruction' that attracted him. 'I am not saying that there hasn't been a lot of work done at Imro in the wake of the post-Maxwell soul-searching. But there is still considerable capacity to be added. And then there is the key part, which is making it all work.' A straight-talking New Zealander, whom industry observers hope will inject a breath of fresh air into the sometimes clubby and inward-looking world of money management, Thorpe, 38, had spent a year before his current assignment on secondment from the SFA to London FOX following the discovery of irregularities at the exchange. He acknowledges that most of his experience, in London and Hong Kong, has been in legal and regulatory posts involving securities and futures broking  -one reason for accepting the challenge of Imro rather than courting the SFA position - but he says he reminds his new parishioners that he was also chairman of the unit trust and mutual fund committee in Hong Kong in the late 1980s. Adds Charles Nunneley, Imro's chairman: 'We wanted someone who would work with a firm hand. We would have preferred to go for a practitioner and we saw one or two but we decided in the end on the best person for the job.' Morgan, 61, who had previously managed the British Rail Pension Fund, steps down in July. ***** Peter Hedges, who stepped down as chairman of Taylor Woodrow's property division last September, has resurfaced as a non-executive director of Ward Holdings, the Kent-based housebuilder which has been one of the companies hardest hit by the slump in house-building in the south-east. Hedges, 49, joined Taylor Woodrow in 1966 as a development surveyor and was appointed a member of the board in 1986. As chairman of Taylor Woodrow Property he was responsible for a number of big property developments in the UK and overseas. There has been a considerable reshuffle at the top of Taylor Woodrow over the last year and some analysts speculated that Hedges quit because he may have been passed over for the top job. He joins the board of the family-controlled Ward Holdings as it is starting to recover from the severe slump in the industry. It lost Pounds 5.3m last year and passed its final dividend. Apart from a directorship of TransEuropean Properties, Hedges has been working as a consultant for Bankers Trust and various firms of liquidators since he quit TW. ***** Graeme Wall, who has particular responsibility for the Anglian operation, has been appointed to the main board. ***** Brian Pearse, the 59-year-old chief executive of Midland Bank, has picked up his first non-executive directorship. He joins the board of Smith &amp; Nephew, the 137-year-old healthcare group on March 1. Pearse, who started his banking career with Liverpool's Martins Bank in 1950, is one of two new non-execs. He is joined by Sir Anthony Cleaver, 54, who is chairman of IBM UK and a director of General Accident. S&amp;N, whose earnings have fallen for the past couple of years, has been regarded as one of the more paternalistic companies in its sector with its board dominated by 'Smith &amp; Nephew men'. However, Eric Kinder, who took over as chairman in May 1990, has been bringing more non-executives on to his board and says that he has now reached his target of a 50/50 balance between execs and non-execs. S&amp;N is a big fan of Pro-Ned, the Bank of England-backed organisation that promotes non-executives. Kinder says it has no 'vested interest'; it just puts 'good people in touch with good companies'. Sir Francis Kennedy, who has been on the board since 1988, was found through Pro-Ned, as was Nancy Lane, a microbiologist at Oxford University, who joined in October 1991. Sir Anthony also came via Pro-Ned. However, Pearse was introduced to S&amp;N by Sir Francis Kennedy some years ago and it has been keen to recruit him for some time. Kinder says he did not want to recruit 'good' non-execs per se but was keen that they have different areas of expertise.</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> PAULEY MAY LEAVE 'TODAY' SHOW  </P> <P> NBC "Today" show co-anchor Jane Pauley said she probably will leave the program  by the end of the year but will stay with the network "in some fashion or  other," the Washington Post reported today.  </P> <P> "I am definitely staying at NBC," Pauley told the newspaper in a telephone  interview from New York.  </P> <P> NBC spokeswoman Peggy Hubble said an announcement concerning Pauley would be  made in two or three weeks.  </P> <P> Pauley has co-anchored "Today" for 13 years, but her future with the program  has been the subject of speculation in the weeks since Deborah Norville took  over as newscaster on the program. Pauley told the newspaper there has not been  hostility among members of the "Today" show cast, although she did say the  place has been more tense since Norville swapped duties with John Palmer, who  has been sent to "NBC News at Sunrise."  </P></p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Arts: Faced with a view - London Galleries Tai-Shan Schierenberg, now 30, first came to general notice as winner of the National Portrait Gallery's John Player Portrait Award of 1989. That interest was sustained by the accession to the collections early this year of the portrait of the writer and barrister, John Mortimer, that had been commissioned as part of the Award. Now he is having his first substantial exhibition at a London gallery. Such progress is not unusual, but it is deserved. The much-vaunted revival of figure painting has all too often been honoured more in the breach than the observance, the enthusiasm of young artists for the idea of the figure out-running all sense of technique, analysis and understanding of the subject. Schierenberg is nothing if not enthusiastic, as much for the medium and stuff of oil paint and the act of painting itself as for his subject, and yet his natural expressionist ebullience is never out of hand. The figure is invariably well established in a coherent pictorial space, formally complete, an active presence and credible likeness, no matter how cursory the statement. The point is only that such formal strength never springs entire from the artist's own head, but must depend on the essentially disinterested study of the external reality and truth, the truly creative imagination necessarily responsive and unself-conscious. Schierenberg may leave off at the judicious moment - even a moment too soon, with a hand or face or foot as yet unresolved - but in all these paintings, the small landscape and portrait studies and the larger, ambitious conversation-pieces alike, it is clear that he sits in front of his chosen subject and immediate pre-occupation, and looks at it long and hard. In any sensible world 66 year old Peter Coker should by now be enjoying the fruits of reputation and distinction won over a long career. Yet, such is the English penchant for putting artists into safe and certain categories that he is by no means so well known and supported as he deserves to be - a situation made all the more poignant by illness that has prevented him working these two years past. Oh yes, he enjoyed an early success with the new social realism, the 'kitchen sink' painting of the 1950s that has now been given a room to itself in this year's hang at the Tate; and, yes, he was elected to the Royal Academy remarkably young. But that was more than 30 years ago, and the subsequent quasi-official support, the British Council tours abroad, the inclusion in the definitive exhibitions at home, the regular monitoring of the work and, in due course, perhaps, the retrospective at the Tate, have not been for him. The received opinion was always that, with the kitchen sink's moment, so too his had slipped away. A representative Coker 1950s butcher's shop was in the Tate, and that was that: what more could he want? It only takes a sight of this current retrospective, small as it is in its London showing, and the barest consideration of those artists who have received consistent support across the years - the Hamiltons and Hockneys, the Longs and Dennys and now the Hursts and Whitereads - to reveal such an attitude for the partial, self-serving, myopic nonsense it really is. Coker might not be an important artist in quite such terms as pass for importance in the curator's or modern art-historian's eyes, but how often do we find such 'importance' trotted out to mask manifest ineptitude or affectation? All the time. And the actual quality of the work? Ah, well, hmm, yes, quite. Coker's essential subject is the landscape, wild and windswept in the Hebrides, hot and domestic in France, close and intimate in Epping Forest. To mark the transition from those old sides of beef of the 1950s to the trunks and clumps of trees that followed soon after, and so on to the later cliffs and fields and hillsides, is to see no arbitrary shift and readjustment, but a natural, ordered and consistent development. Those butcher's still-lifes, controversial in their time, seem now a kind of landscape, those trees still-life of sorts, and the landscapes down the years drawn ever with the firm hand and close attention that were the character of those quietly obsessive, monumental early images. We can only pray that Peter Coker is at work again before too long. Stephen Finer, now with Bernard Jacobson, is having his fourth London show. He is a painter principally of the human head, worked for the most part on a fairly small scale. He works from the model, yet it would be misleading to describe his paintings as portraits, for any conventional likeness is shadowy, obscure and fleeting. Yet, in these densely overlaid and reworked surfaces, the marks buried and obliterated and insistently re-established, the sense of a real and particular human presence remains curiously strong - likeness as experience and sensation rather than obvious record. So it is that he stands with such mentors as Auerbach and Bacon in the tradition of a disciplined and objective expressionism. Also showing at Flowers East and London Fields are Trevor Sutton, with his new monotypes; John Loker, with recent water-colours; and Carole Hodgson, with a most impressive group of her latest sculptures and works on paper, ambiguously redolent of landscape, and the landscape implicit in the human figure. Tai-Shan Schierenberg: Angela Flowers at London Fields, 282 Richmond Road E8, until October 11. Peter Coker: Abbot Hall, Kendal, until October 25, &amp; The Friends Room, Royal Academy, until October 11; the two shows combine for Carlisle and Ipswich. Stephen Finer: Bernard Jacobson, 14a Clifford Street W1, until October 3.</p>

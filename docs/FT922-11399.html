			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Food &amp; Drink: Recipes to stir the pulses - Cookery / Vegetarianism has come of age VEGETARIANISM has come of age at last. Gone are the deadly-serious pulse and wholegrain menus that lay like lead on the stomach and depressed the spirit of those who did not worship at the altar of the health food religion. New-wave vegetarianism is concerned not with cant but with the pleasures of good eating without meat. Red meat, that is: fish remains on the menu for many and game and poultry for some. The new style is generous of spirit, full of joie de vivre, rich in textures, bursting with fresh tastes, often robust but also capable of lovely subtleties. The most exciting new exponent is a young cook called Annie Bell, whose first book has just been published: A Feast of Flavours, subtitled The New Vegetarian Cuisine (Bantam Pounds 14.99). Bell is a talented and instinctive cook, no stickler for the confines of tradition but breaking new ground happily with her own menu structures. Her meals are designed as 'a series of little courses that complement and mingle with each other' rather than what my husband calls the obligatory three-piece suite: first course, main course and pudding. The idea is appealing, but I am not convinced entirely that some of her menus are practicable. It is all very well for caterers and chefs (she is a caterer) to continue working behind the scenes as a meal progresses, and to deliver an extra little dish here and there. But most home cooks, surely, want to hang up their aprons when the doorbell rings and spend the evening with those gathered round the table. Perhaps I am just too old a dog to learn new tricks. Certainly, some of her menus made me salivate as I read them, and they include many triumphs. Her cooking style, and the way she combines ingredients, show a fine understanding of, and respect for, the raw materials. She seems fond of many of the ingredients I love: lemons, aubergines, fennel, spinach, globe artichokes, caramelised onions, pears, pine nuts, red peppers, basil and rocket. Like many who eschew meat, she displays a weakness for sweet things, particularly chocolate. There are some lovely pastry recipes: phyllo tartlets filled with parsley puree and grilled courgettes; scallops and artichoke bottoms in puff pastry with a puree of roasted garlic; and a rhubarb tart that throws all pre-conceived notions of rhubarb tart out the window. Some of the dishes that attract me most are beautifully simple: wilted spinach with hazelnut oil and pomegranates; wild rice and fennel salad; peaches baked on brioche with a sabayon sauce; and the two I quote below. Her recipe for stuffed peppers is far and away the easiest I know to prepare  -and it is one of the best stuffed pepper dishes I have eaten. Here is a vegetarian cook who is not shy of butter, cream or eggs. She does not once suggest using wholewheat pastry or brown rice. Indeed, her book is very nearly a pulse-free zone (Le Puy lentils are served with mussels, tapenade toast and quennelles of tomato mousse) and there is a notable absence of the quiche-style cliches that pass as vegetarian options in some circles. This is happily hedonistic vegetarianism. The title is apt. Annie Bell has delivered a feast. PEPPERS ROASTED WITH CHERRY TOMATOES AND HONEY (serves 6) Luscious and brilliantly simple - I wish I had thought up this recipe myself. Bell advises that the peppers are best served warm, and suggests using a mixture of red and yellow vegetables to create a harlequin effect. Ingredients: 3 red or yellow peppers;  3/4 lb red or yellow cherry tomatoes; 3 teaspoons honey; olive oil; flat-leafed parsley to garnish. Method: Cut the peppers in half from stem to base, leaving the green stalk attached. Remove the seeds and pith. Halve the cherry tomatoes and fill the pepper cavities with them. Dribble over the honey and a little olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and bake in a very hot oven for 20-30 minutes until the peppers are wilted and patched with brown. Serve garnished with chopped parsley. As the peppers cook, the juice from the tomatoes combines with the juice from the peppers, merging with the honey and olive oil into a heavenly liquid which demands that a loaf of good bread is at hand. CHAR-GRILLED FENNEL WITH FRESH HERBED CHEESE (serves 6) Ingredients: 3 fennel bulbs; 1 lb ricotta or fresh cream cheese; 2 dessertspoons finely-chopped chervil, chives, parsley, fennel, lovage; good Italian olive oil; lemon juice; 6 slices coarse-textured white bread, char-grilled on a stove-top griddle just before serving. Method: Combine the cheese and herbs in a bowl. Shape the mixture into a square or cylindrical log about 7in long, cover, and chill until required. Quarter the fennel bulbs by first cutting them in half vertically, slicing between the shoots, then cutting each half in half, again vertically. Nick off any excess root, leaving enough to hold the layers together. Steam the fennel for 5-7 minutes. Pat it dry and brush with olive oil. Season and char-grill for 20-30 minutes until it starts to char in patches. Squeeze lemon juice over the fennel. Serve it with slices of the herbed cheese, olive oil trickled over and a sprinkling of salt, plus the char-grilled bread.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["rzi"-attributed report: "New Rumors About Cessna </F> Passengers"]    [Text] It seems that several intelligence agents of former  East Bloc states were involved in the events, which ended, for  the time being, on the evening of 24 January with the crash of a  Cessna 425 private plane into Lake Constance, a crash which has  led to many speculations. This is shown by files of the Latvian  Public Prosecutor's Office, to which the Riga daily DIENA was  able to gain access. According to latest findings by the  Stuttgart Land Office of Criminal Investigations, in addition to  pilot Rudolf Wirschen and the two Czechs, Iveta Ranetova and  Alena Petrusova, Berlin building entrepreneur Josef Rimmele and  his partner Klaus Eichler were aboard the plane. The latter two  tried to make a deal with allegedly radioactive materials in the  Latvian capital of Riga last autumn.  <H5>  Murky Water, Murky Figures </H5>   According to the files of the Latvian investigators, Rimmele  and Eichler were high-ranking former employees of the GDR  [German Democratic Republic] State Security Service; another  wire puller of the deal and mediator of murky business contacts  in the east, Klaus-Peter Nedwig, served as a lieutenant colonel  in the GDR People's Police in the past. The interpreter for the  Germans was Pawel Minarchik, formerly captain of the  Czechoslovak intelligence service, who had infiltrated Radio  Free Europe as an employee during the years of the Cold War and  was later sentenced to a prison term for trying to blow up the  radio station.    According to the files of the Riga Public Prosecutor's  Office, in spring 1993 Rimmele and Eichler met in Prague with  Alexander Korisno, the owner of the Marketing Service company,  which is registered in Latvia. Already at that time, they spoke  of a deal with "rare metals." On 24 October 1993, Rimmele,  Eichler, Ranetova, Petrusova, as well as Minarchik arrived in  Riga. There, in the office of the Dimassko company in Valdemara  Street 161, the men met with the so-far unknown sellers of 66 kg  of rubidium and 6 kg cesium 133 (both metals are not  radioactive). According to findings by the Latvian public  prosecutor's office, at that time the goods were in the bonded  warehouse at Zurich Kloten airport at the disposal of a company  owned by Rimmele. The purpose of the trip to Riga reportedly  was to settle payment modalities -- $2 million in cash were  demanded. However, the fact that the two buyers had not yet  found a customer for the allegedly "hot goods" and thus were not  able to pay seems to have met with little understanding by the  sellers, according to the files of the Latvian investigators.  <H5>  In the Hands of the Mafia </H5>   The further course of the events reportedly was as follows:  When Rimmele, Eichler, and Minarchik left the office, they were  attacked in front of the door by six to eight masked men, who  pushed them into a small bus, threatening to use their weapons.  The bus took them to a hiding place in a private building in  Saremas Street 8. There the kidnappers demanded money. The  above-mentioned address is well known to the local police: The  building used to belong to Viktors Balulis, a gangster with a  long police record, who had fled from the authorities and gone  abroad.    According to the findings by the Latvian investigators,  Rimmele and Minarchik were released soon afterwards, while  Eichler--tied with hand-cuffs to a heater -- remained in the  basement of the building in Saremas Street. Minarchik and the  two women were emphatically told not to leave Riga, while  Rimmele flew back to Germany -- probably to get money. On 27  October, he turned to the German Embassy in Riga, reporting that  Eichler had been kidnapped the day before. However, Latvian  Interior Minister Kristovskis was told by the Embassy about this  matter as late as on 3 November.  <H5>  Goods From Moscow </H5>   When Rimmele returned to Riga on 10 November, Korisno, the  above- mentioned owner of the Marketing Service company,  demanded not only $2.2 million as payment for the goods, but  another $17,000 for himself as a bonus. On the same day he was  arrested by the police. During the subsequent interrogation,  Korisno admitted to talks with Rimmele and Eichler about the  purchase of "rare metals" and to several meetings with the two  in Riga, but he claimed that he did not now where Eichler was.  On 20 November, Eichler managed to flee despite the fact that  he was constantly watched. He immediately reported to the  police and told them about the background of the kidnapping.    According to the current findings of the Riga Public  Prosecutor's Office, the "rare metals" probably reached  Switzerland from Latvia without any detours; only the juridical  and financial part of the transaction took place in the Baltic  republic. Clues point to a scientific production facility in  Moscow as the actual seller. So far, the Latvian public  prosecutor has issued indictments against five persons only for  kidnapping.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> A WARHOL CHRISTMAS: CLICHED BUT CLEVER  </P> <P> If somebody found a bunch of shopping lists with doodles by Andy Warhol, you  can bet they'd be snapped up by some salivating collector and grandly exhibited  in a burst of fulsome PR. So it isn't surprising that the Center for Decorative  Arts in San Juan Capistrano is making a fuss over a set of Christmas cards  Warhol made for Tiffany &amp; Co. in the early 1960s, on view through Dec. 23.  </P> <P> Actually, the seemingly low-key, ultratraditional designs for the cards reflect  some of the central concerns of Warhol's own work. He was, after all, the  artist who deliberately sought out such banal or well-known subjects as  Campbell Soup cans, Brillo boxes and the faces of Jackie Kennedy and Marilyn  Monroe. He presented these subjects as mindlessly repetitive, identical images  suited to an era of mass media, mass production and mass ennui.  </P> <P> The cards, which Warhol designed while he still worked as a commercial artist,  offer images of fruit baskets, Christmas trees with birds and baubles, kids  holding hands, a sled filled with presents -- the most uncreative and cliched  subjects imaginable.  </P> <P> Of course, these subjects were likely to please the average card-buyer looking  for something pretty and seasonal. A major consumer in his own right (as  posthumous auctions of his bric-a-brac made clear), Warhol always had a  brilliant grasp of consumer habits.  </P> <P> The watercolor originals are cheerily executed in the unsettling colors  (avocado greens, hot pinks) stylish in the late '50s and early '60s. They also  are full of Warhol-style repetitive imagery: To make the trio of holly leaf,  fern leaf and mistletoe Christmas trees that appeared on a card from about 1963  (precise dates apparently are unavailable) Warhol repeated the same four-branch  segment over and over. The eye reads the juxtaposed branches as a tree,  although the branches aren't actually connected to each other.  </P> <P> Other images, such as the two designs of Christmas trees made with little  stars, seem to have been hand-stamped onto the paper -- a primitive form of  mechanical reproduction. ("Christmas Tree With Continuing Stars" is actually a  fine little conceptual exercise. The whole paper is dotted with colorful stars  which "fall" like snow, except where they are printed in close, overlapping  formation to form the outline of a tree. Warhol's penciled-in triangular  guidelines are visible under the mass of stars.)  </P> <P> In 1962 Warhol pioneered the concept of having his "paintings" silk-screened by  assistants rather than painted by (his) hand. So making designs for  mass-produced cards was right up his alley.  </P> <P> Even the fact that they were made to be sold by a ritzy Fifth Avenue jewelry  store probably suited him to a T. As others have pointed out, Warhol's art was  the reflection of an affluent society. Wealthy people shelled out more for  Warhol's screen-printed portraits of themselves than they would have paid for  ordinary, painstakingly hand-painted portraits.  </P> <P> So, far from merely being a hungry artist's potboilers or curiously banal  mementoes of a world-beating career, the cards are full-fledged pieces of  Warholiana. And it just so happens that Tiffany's is reissuing two cards each  year beginning this Christmas -- a savvy move in an era that once again is  likely to ooh and ah over the sweetly traditional motifs. But we know better.  </P> <P>  Fourteen Christmas card drawings by Andy Warhol are at the Center for the  Study of Decorative Arts through Dec. 23, along with Christmas trees decorated  by 10 designers. The center, at 31431 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano,  is open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. A $3 donation is  requested. Information: (714) 496-2132.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 20 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The conflict inside the Liberal Democratic Party  [LDP] over the election of a successor to Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa came to a temporary halt after Michio  Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and foreign minister,  decided on 19 April to give up his plan to leave the party and  run as candidate for prime minister.    However, the current political upheaval has brought about  great turmoil in the party which involved even a faction leader  and caused the defection of as many as 12 Diet members, thus  leaving behind a major crack in the LDP. Intraparty criticisms  of LDP President Yohei Kono's leadership for not being able to  take advantage of a golden opportunity to recapture political  power are expected to increase. The LDP is still plagued by  potential further defections as it enters a volatile state  wherein it is unable to control its party factions.    On the afternoon of 19 April, two policy groups were having  heated exchanges at the LDP's headquarters, where the meeting  between Kono and Watanabe was under way. One was a general  meeting of the Sasshin no kai [Association for Change] (chaired  by Taro Nakayama) consisting mostly of Diet members who had been  reluctant to support electoral reforms. There was an outpouring  of criticism against the LDP's leadership over the commotion in  the party. Some members claimed that "it was possible to take  back political power, but we failed to do so. The  responsibility of the president, secretary general, and other  leaders in this should be called into question." The meeting  decided to demand a change of leadership.    At the meeting of the Parliamentary League for the Promotion  of Political Reform (chaired by former Prime Minister Toshiki  Kaifu) held in the next room, participants expressed the  following opinions: "If top priority is given only to avoiding  the splitting of the party, the LDP will perish gradually; our  ship will sink"; "If you talk only of solidarity, there can be  no hope for the renewal of the party." The meeting adopted an  emergency declaration asking the leadership to promote party  reform.    Ironically, these two groups, which were once rivals in the  party which took opposing positions on the issue of political  reform, are now partners in their criticism of the leadership.    The Kono leadership, which was launched under a pledge to  reform the party, has so far been forced to manage party affairs  defensively by giving top priority to party solidarity. This  was the first time that the LDP faced a situation in which it  could take the offensive. While it succeeded in toppling the  cabinet, it in turn allowed Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and others from the ruling  parties to meddle in LDP affairs, which resulted in the  attempted defection of Watanabe, a faction leader, and the  actual defection of a number of Diet members. In the present  case, a feeling of helplessness also permeated all the factions,  which were unable to take unified action and to control faction  members like in the past.    At the LDP General Council meeting on 19 April, a veteran  Diet member lamented: "At least, Mitchi [Michio Watanabe] was  able to express his views on recapturing political power. The  leadership was not able to say anything." Kono listened to this  criticism with a grave expression.    Together with party reform, Kono intends to step up  preparations for the next general election under the new  electoral system for the lower house, and for the upper house  elections next year, by appealing to "recapture political power  through elections" and by maintaining party unity.    A majority in the party believe that "the coalition  government is plagued with various contradictions in policy and  in other areas; it will be a matter of time for the new  administration to come to an impasse" (according to a senior LDP  official). However, the LDP's prospects for recapturing the  government also remain uncertain. A young Diet member belonging  to the Obuchi faction says, "If another coup d'etat occurs, the  LDP will certainly face the danger of a major breakup." A sense  of crisis is already spreading in the party.</p>

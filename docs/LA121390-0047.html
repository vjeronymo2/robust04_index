			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REPORT ON HOTEL DRAWS CRITICISM  </P> <P> The adequacy of an environmental impact report on a proposed 495-room resort  hotel in Rancho Palos Verdes drew criticism Tuesday from about a dozen  residents, including members of a newly formed environmental group.  </P> <P> The project, proposed by the Monaghan Co., would be built on the former  Marineland site and would include the hotel, a golf course and convention  facilities.  </P> <P> Gar Goodson, chairman of Save Our Coastline 2000, told the Planning Commission  hearing that the impact statement is "seriously inadequate" because it does not  discuss the project in relation to the city's General Plan, which discourages  the construction of "industrial and major commercial activities due to the  terrain and environmental characteristics of the city." The land is zoned for  commercial and recreational use.  </P> <P> Goodson and several other members of the group, which has about 150 members,  most of them residents of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, said the new organization  is dedicated to keeping commercial development off the bluffs that overlook the  Pacific Ocean.  </P> <P> Today is the last day to submit written comment on the EIR. The commission  directed the consultants who authored the EIR for the city to prepare a  response to the public comments for a Feb. 4 meeting.  </P> <P> When the document is complete, the Planning Commission may certify the report.  The commission's decision can be appealed to the City Council.  </P></p>

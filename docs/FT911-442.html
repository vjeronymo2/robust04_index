			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Rise in US wholesale prices A MODERATE increase in wholesale prices in April, disclosed by the US government yesterday, helped reduce fears that recent monetary easing by the Federal Reserve would undermine the inflation outlook. The producer price index for finished goods rose 0.2 per cent last month, taking the annual rate of wholesale price inflation to 3.2 per cent. The increase followed four successive monthly declines in producer prices - declines, however, that were driven principally by sharply falling energy prices. The improving inflation trend was most noticeable in the widely watched 'core' producer price index, which excludes the volatile food and energy components. Core producer prices rose 0.2 per cent in April, taking the underlying annual rate of wholesale price inflation to 3.7 per cent. This was the second small monthly rise in core prices, a sharp improvement on monthly increases of about 0.5 per cent at the start of the year. Prices for crude industrial inputs and goods at an intermediate stage of production - forward indicators of prices for finished goods - both declined last month, having fallen most months since recession began to bite hard last November. The annual rate of inflation for crude and intermediate goods is running at minus 1.7 per cent and 1.1 per cent respectively. The latest Blue Chip consensus forecast is for consumer price inflation of 4.5 per cent this year, a full point lower than last year. Inflation is forecast to fall to 3.9 per cent next year, giving the Fed more scope to pursue expansionary policies.</p>

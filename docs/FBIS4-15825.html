			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] Every-Monday pickets in front of the Russian  military headquarters building in Tallinn will be continued  until Russia has pulled out its troops from Estonia, MP Viktor  Niitsoo (Estonian National Independence Party faction) told ETA  on Monday [11 April]. Niitsoo said that the fact that in the  last round of Estonian-Russian inter-state negotiations Russia  abolished its promise to withdraw its troops from Estonia by  August 31, 1994, changed nothing in the order of organising the  pickets.    "We have enough patience and if necessary, the pickets will  be continued until we have reached our aim," he added.</p>

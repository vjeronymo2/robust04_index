			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Italian media give strike lead Italy's media went on strike yesterday ahead of today's four-hour general stoppage called by the trade unions to protest against pension and welfare cuts in the 1995 budget. The three main trade union confederations behind the strike have called for a massive response and have organised more than 60 demonstrations around the country. The stoppage is expected to bring Italy to a standstill despite the refusal of unions in some sectors to take action. In the run-up to the protest, the government has been trying to table a rapid series of amendments to correct obvious cases of injustice in the proposals for pension reform. The main category at risk are those who have filed notice with their employers to retire, or who have just retired. Under the terms of the existing proposal, they will not be able to draw a pension until February 1995. In making the amendments, Mr Clemente Mastella, the labour minister, hinted that the government is willing to reopen discussions with the unions. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has, meanwhile, held a meeting with trade union leaders, signalling that should the social climate become tenser after the general strike, he would be willing to act as a mediator.

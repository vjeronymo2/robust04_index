			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Anatolyevich Maksimov, Moscow City </F> Duma speaker, conducted by Nikolay Figurovskiy: "Our Homes and  the City Duma"]    [Text] On 12 December of last year Muscovites elected  a city Duma comprised of 35 deputies. The new representative  body's speaker is Viktor Maksimov. He is 47 years old and has  lived in Moscow since 1968. He started out as a neighborhood  militiaman. He later worked in the USSR and RSFSR ministries of  internal affairs. He was a Moscow City Soviet deputy.    At PRAVDA's request the head of the Duma talks about  his job.    [Figurovskiy] Viktor Anatolyevich, how does the Moscow City  Duma differ from previous representative bodies?    [Maksimov] The City Duma's powers are not based on  authoritative directives to the executive branch, but rather  proposals of various options for solving problems. Duma decrees  are signed by the mayor of Moscow. However, if necessary the  Duma can override the mayor's "veto."    [Figurovskiy] Soon after its election the Moscow City Duma  was called a "pocket" Duma. Is it in anybody's pocket?    [Maksimov] In my opinion, the fact that the government's  proposal regarding a transition to a new system of payment for  housing and municipal services was discussed at five sessions  and sent back for additional work three times indicates that the  Duma made substantial amendments to the draft before approving  it, with the objective of increasing Muscovites' level of social  protection.    [Figurovskiy] Nevertheless the rent hike was an unpopular  measure, to put it mildly.    [Maksimov] Yes, it was unpopular. But as long as housing is  free it will not go to the people who need it, but instead to  those who are close to those in power. Consider this: of the  millions of square meters of free municipal housing built in  Moscow every year people on prefectures' waiting lists get only  about 20 percent...    There is one solution: transition to a market economy.  Everything should have its price, and everything should be paid  for.    [Figurovskiy] So will the great mass of middle-income  families have to say goodbye to their dreams of new apartments?    [Maksimov] Not everyone will have to acquire housing at the  market price. Following the example of many countries, we will  introduce this system: every citizen will have the right, once  in his or her life, to receive a standard allocation of housing  of average quality free of charge. But if you want an apartment  with more space or a better floor plan, then pay for it!    The higher payment for housing is a first step in that  direction, though not a very large one. It will take us roughly  five years to go all the way.    There are 18 square meters of living space for every  resident  of Moscow. Yet there are 700,000 people on waiting lists who  have 8-10 square meters apiece. Another fact: luxury apartment  buildings have very large auxiliary rooms that have not been  paid for up until now. Is that fair?    [Figurovskiy] How much will housing now cost in Moscow?    [Maksimov] The new system will take effect in the second  quarter. The government proposed introducing it in March, but  the Duma deputies insisted that the new rates not be introduced  before the city had a functional housing compensation system. We  also insisted that rent depend not only on the number of square  meters in an apartment, but also on the building's category.  People will have to pay more for square meters that are "extra"  relative to a social standard.    The gist of the new system can be expressed in a few words:  rates for apartments and municipal services will be indexed in  accordance with price increases over the past three years. At  the same time, a number of categories of Moscow citizens will be  paid housing compensation.    In the initial stage of reform a "belated" indexing of rates  will be carried out. In the second stage, which the government  plans to begin on 1 July, prices will go up by factors of  between three and five. True, if the new system has not worked  out by 1 July the Duma will have an opportunity to halt and  postpone the start of the second stage.    A number of categories of Muscovites will receive housing  compensation during the first stage. Compensation will be  provided to citizens within the limits of Duma-approved  standards for living space and municipal service consumption,  with consideration for each family's total income. The deputies  have approved the following housing standards: for citizens  living alone, 33 square meters; for two-person families, 42  square meters; and for families with three members or more, 18  square meters per person. Incidentally, that is more than the  government of Moscow proposed.    The average amount of rent and municipal services (excluding  electricity, phone and radio hookup) can be calculated by  multiplying the total size of an apartment by roughly 100. For  example, if an apartment has 50 square meters of space, then the  payment for it will be approximately R5,000. But that is only  for Muscovites who have apartments that do not exceed living  space standards. Those who have more square meters of space than  allowed under the standard will also pay more.    The size of subsidies is determined according to a simple  formula: the amount that goes to pay for an apartment should not  exceed 10 percent of a family's budget.    Compensation will be paid in a non-cash form via a savings  bank, i.e. a citizen will not be able to receive the money  directly.    During the second quarter subsidies will only go to the  poorest families --approximately 4 percent of Moscow residents.  Subsequently the number of people receiving subsidies will  increase.</p>

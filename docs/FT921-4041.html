			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Economists give their ratings NATWEST BANK Score: 7 out of 10 MR LAMONT scores a good mark because he met some important political and economic requirements. His room for manoeuvre was much less than assumed because his tax receipts were much less because of the recession. He announced a very high PSBR in a manner which is prudent. He managed to administer stimulus to demand without unsettling the financial markets. Only mild criticism was that he didn't announce more direct tax relief for the company sector. ROGER BOOTLE - MIDLAND MONTAGU Score: 6 out of 10 THE overwhelming influence on the Budget was the sharp deterioration in public finances which itself was due primarily to the continued recession. Given that he has only been able to give a small net tax reduction of Pounds 1.5bn, the chancellor has used his money imaginatively. The Budget is well balanced with significant help for small businesses and a reduction in tax for individuals. The new 20p band is very well judged from a political viewpoint. It will be difficult for Labour to respond. KEVIN GARDINER - SG WARBURG SECURITIES Score: 4 out of 10 THE chancellor was neither bold nor coherent. It was rather a mishmash. The score was low because of the 'poor' state of public-sector accounts. The prospective borrowing situation is significantly worse than expected, and there is a very large government deficit emerging with a tax package smaller than expected. Expectations for economic recovery have been halved in scale and effectively postponed by a year. He should have been more upbeat in commitment to the ERM. BILL MARTIN - UBS PHILLIPS &amp; DREW Score: 1 out of 10 THE budget will not act as a significant stimulus to the economy. The budget deficit is almost certainly out of control. The tax cuts are rather parsimonious. They were certainly less than the market had been expecting. Most people would expect the tax cuts to be short-lived. Mr Lamont would be lucky to see growth at half the rates he had forecast. Prospects for inflation remain good, but prospects for activity remain grim. PETER SPENCER - SHEARSON LEHMAN Score: 7 out of 10 IT was disappointing. Mr Lamont showed some clever card play, but his hand was worse than had been thought, and he failed to produce the election-winning trick everyone thought he had up his sleeve. I am afraid the cupboard is simply bare, and Mr Lamont is in the unenviable position of being placed in the role of Old Mother Hubbard. He had promised an economic recovery, 20 per cent tax rate, and entry into the narrow band of the ERM, but had done little towards fulfilling his promises. GAVYN DAVIES - GOLDMAN SACHS Score: 6 out of 10 IT falls between every conceivable stool. It does not put Labour on the spot and it does not transform the Conservatives' electoral position. It also does not seem likely to bring interest rates down, although the government could still be saved by Spain or Belgium cutting their rates in the next few days. He made a virtue of not kickstarting the economy, but I think that is just what is needed. The Treasury clearly thinks the recovery is already under way, but that judgment is highly questionable.</p>

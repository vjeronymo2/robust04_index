			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Clinton budget brings back rosy scenario - It is fiscally responsible but the spending projections are implausibly optimistic President Bill Clinton delivered a fiscally responsible budget yesterday, but the administration's projections of future spending trends look implausibly optimistic. In an attempt to create room for increased investment in areas critical for American competitiveness, such as education and training, Mr Clinton is proposing a 'hard freeze' on discretionary spending. He envisages total discretionary spending rising from Dollars 550.1bn in fiscal 1994 to Dollars 554.4bn (Pounds 369.6bn) in fiscal 1999, in cash terms less than 1 per cent. And this is not to be achieved only through the continuing shrinkage of the defence budget, which declines 13 per cent over this period. Mr Clinton plans a total increase in non-defence discretionary spending of only 9.9 per cent in cash terms over five years - a substantial cut in real terms given that inflation of 3.0-3.5 per cent a year is expected over this period. Few industrial countries have achieved this kind of restraint on domestic programmes. And there is little in US history to suggest it will be feasible: between 1989 and 1994, such spending rose 45 per cent in cash terms. The proposed freeze is the only way Mr Clinton can achieve the deficit reduction he promised while also modestly increasing public investment. Spending on mandatory or entitlement programmes - such as healthcare and public-sector pensions - will continue to rise rapidly, crowding out other expenditure. Mandatory spending will rise 4.4 per cent in the coming year, against less than 1 per cent for non-defence discretionary spending. Over the next five years mandatory spending is projected to rise from Dollars 730.4bn to Dollars 1,020.5bn, or 40 per cent. It is optimism on spending that permits Mr Clinton to project sharp declines in federal borrowing. In spite of last year's tax increases on the wealthy, total receipts as a percentage of gross domestic product are projected to decline slightly over the next five years - from 18.8 per cent of GDP to 18.6 per cent. Spending, however, is expected to fall from 22.3 per cent of GDP to 20.9 per cent. The deficit is expected to decline from Dollars 234.5bn (3.5 per cent of GDP) in fiscal 1994 to a trough of Dollars 173.1bn in fiscal 1996 (2.3 per cent of GDP). It then begins to creep higher, exceeding Dollars 200bn by fiscal 1999. None of these figures allows for the impact of this year's main legislative priority - reform of healthcare, a sector that accounts for 14 per cent of GDP. Mr Clinton's plan would extend health cover to uninsured Americans (15 per cent of the population) and guarantee a generous package of benefits for everyone. According to White House estimates these additional costs would be largely offset by parallel measures to reduce the rate of growth of spending - such as the creation of large purchasing co-operatives and caps on growth in private-sector insurance premiums. The administration estimates that if Mr Clinton's health plan were implemented, mandatory spending would grow by 45 per cent over five years, a little faster than the 40 per cent projected without reform. With the plan, mandatory spending would rise from 11 per cent of GDP today to 12 per cent in fiscal 1999; without it, mandatory spending would rise to 11.7 per cent. The White House figures again look optimistic. But any calculations are hypothetical because it appears unlikely that Mr Clinton's health plan will be enacted in its original form. Congress seems likely to favour less ambitious reforms which scale back the level of guaranteed health benefits but which also impose fewer direct controls on spending growth. The stress on fiscal discipline in Mr Clinton's budget is ostensibly balanced by a commitment to higher public investment as a means of boosting growth and improving the prospects of disadvantaged groups. But both elements of the equation are exaggerated. The proposed axing of more than 100 programmes sounds impressive, but it will save only about Dollars 3bn in a Dollars 1,500bn budget. Congress, in any case, is unlikely to approve many of the cuts. The investment agenda includes planned increases in spending on 'workforce security' (improved access to skill training and job search), education (including an expansion of the pre-school Head Start programme), commercial technology, physical infrastructure and the environment. Few will argue with this shift of priorities, but the scale of the investment effort falls far short of Mr Clinton's promises during the presidential election campaign. The president is asking Congress to approve an additional Dollars 13.7bn in spending this year on his main investment proposals. That represents less than 1 per cent of the budget. It is a change only at the margin. Mr Clinton's claim to have dispensed with Republican 'smoke and mirrors' in his economic forecast seems only partly justified. The White House is projecting steady economic growth of 2.5-3.0 per cent for the rest of the decade, reducing the jobless rate to 5.5 per cent, even though this would represent one of the longest unbroken business upswings on record. It assumes the Federal Reserve will allow consumer price inflation to creep higher - from 2.8 per cent last year to nearly 3.5 per cent by 1997. The greatest optimism is reserved for interest rates. The White House expects three-month rates to remain 3.5 per cent or less throughout this year and, more surprising still, to average less than 4.5 per cent every year until 1999. The yield on 10-year bonds is assumed never to rise above 6 per cent. This is indeed a rosy scenario.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE BUDGET'S ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS (CALENDAR YEARS)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Actual                  Projections                         1992  1993  1994  1995  1996  1997  1998  1999  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gross Domestic Product * (Constant 1987 dollars)  3.9   2.3   3.0   2.7   2.7   2.6   2.6   2.5 Consumer Price Index *   3.1   2.8   3.0   3.2   3.3   3.4   3.4   3.4 Unemployment rate % **   7.3   6.7   6.4   6.0   5.8   5.6   5.5   5.5 Interest rates %  91-day Treasury bills   3.5   3.0   3.4   3.8   4.1   4.4   4.4   4.4  10-year Treasury notes  7.0   5.9   5.8   5.8   5.8   5.8   5.8   5.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Per cent change, fourth quarter over fourth quarter ** Fourth quarter level: Pre-February 1994 basis  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

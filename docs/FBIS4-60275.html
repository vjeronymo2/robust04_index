			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Furayh Abu-Middayn, member of the </F> Palestinian National Authority, by Radio Monte Carlo  correspondent Salim Badawi; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Abu-Middayn] The transfer of power has actually  taken place. It is over now. The only pending issues are those  issues related to daily life, such as travel permits, permits to  enter Israel, bringing food from inside Israel, maintaining  electrical current and telephone lines, and other issues.  However, the administrative apparatus, which includes 6,400  employees, is running like a watch in the Gaza Strip. Military  positions are under our control. Their reconstruction is under  way to make them fit the coming stage. The problem is that we  are starting at zero. It is true that we have an administrative  apparatus, but so far the donor countries have not sent enough  money to turn the wheel of daily economic life.    [Badawi] Yes, there must obstacles. How are you facing these  obstacles? Can you specify some of them?    [Abu-Middayn] First of all, the major obstacle is now the  arrival of university students in the West Bank at their places  of study. This issue has not been resolved completely. The  second problem is that for the last 27 years Israel made  everything in the Gaza Strip, the electrical current,  telephones, and even the milk cup, dependent on the Israeli  economy, in a programmed and systematic manner. Therefore, we  cannot get rid of this overnight. This is a very difficult  problem to resolve. Based on this, I can give you an example  about bread and how to get flour from inside Israel. The  merchant first must get a permit. This needs time. So, once  again, the permits are a major point. The agreements signed in  Paris and elsewhere are not implemented on the ground.    [Badawi] So, how do you coordinate with the Israelis,  particularly on daily life issues, as you said?    [Abu-Middayn] There is a liaison committee formed of five of  our colleagues. They spend four hours a day on this. We believe  that immediately after the 'Id al-Adha, there will be a daily  plan of work with the Israeli side concerning our joint affairs.  However, internally, we have full independence these days. We  feel that decisions are being made. So, the heaviest burden is  being shouldered by the National Authority members. They were  quickly chosen for this post in the Gaza Strip. There are only  three members, Dr. Zakariya al-Agha, Dr. Riyad al-Za'nun, and  Furayh Abu-Middayn. We were forced to make preliminary  decisions on the ground even before official procedures such as  oath-taking or the completion of the Palestinian National  Authority. As you know, it includes 24 members, and not all  have been named. However, we are now compelled to take urgent  measures and to make decisions on the ground on a daily and  hourly basis.    [Badawi] As you said, there is intermingling between the  administration of daily affairs and long-term planning  concerning the self-rule areas.    [Abu-Middayn] This is true. We are trying to create new  facts and mechanisms on the ground. We are waiting for  financing, for the Marshall plan, so to say. There is the $1.2  billion the World Bank should give to us to begin immediate  financing. There is also the EC and another $750 million. The  truth is that we must build an infrastructure. This is the most  important problem facing us on the ground. The roads, schools,  hospitals, and even the armies brought from outside all need  houses and other services.    [Badawi] What kind of infrastructures are now available to  you in Gaza and Jericho?    [Abu-Middayn] We have only highly qualified cadres, but no  money. This is the problem. The vehicle is lubricated, the  driver is in it, and it is waiting to be filled with gas, if we  can say that. We need to pump a huge amount of money.  Approximately 60,000-70,000 jobs must be created. This is  because Israel has closed 60,000 jobs inside Israel. There is a  manpower problem in Israel. Unemployment has reached 60-65  percent. This is the most serious problem. Unemployment in the  Gaza Strip has reached the zero point or the red line. I am  sorry to have deviated from your question, but the truth is that  the Arab and Israeli blockades have integrated against us in the  Gaza Strip. You know that the Gaza Strip is like an island in  the sea. It is surrounded by Israel and the sea.    [Badawi] Can we say that your projects are ready and the  only  thing missing is money?    [Abu-Middayn] Yes. I hope the donor countries will fulfill  their obligations. We do not want to be another Yeltsin or  another Russia with just more and more promises, especially  since we are not asking for a favor, but this is the Middle East  equation, namely, that without Palestine there will neither be  economic or security stability.    [Badawi] Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn: How are the people inside  taking the new situation?    [Abu-Middayn] They are looking to the future with a mixture  of hope and apprehension. They are glad to be rid of the  khaki-clad occupation troops that ruled over them for 27 years  and sent 220,000 of them to prison. This nightmare is over.  However, the discussions of bread and butter issues will begin  in a week or two. This is what the Palestinian people inside  look to with fervent hope. We are up to the challenge. But the  world has obligated us to this agreement, such as it is.  [sentence as heard] However, this is not the Palestinian peace  we are looking for. But we will create from this limited  achievement something for the future. The international  community must, however, remember that for over two and half  years of negotiations it has pressed the Palestinians [words  indistinct] and (?then we will see what happens later). Even the  Europeans [word indistinct], even those who have made the  nuclear option available to Israel took this position. The  Palestinians are, therefore, rightly apprehensive about the  future and that the international bodies will not deliver on the  promises they have made to the Palestinian people over the past  few years.    [Badawi] As you know, in addition to the day-to-day problems  you are facing, there is the fundamental issue of the settlers.  This week some of them went with their weapons to pray in  Jericho. Do the Palestinian police have a contingency plan to  contain and handle any future friction; are they armed with the  necessary powers to do that?    [Abu-Middayn] Let me put it this way. Land mines have been  left behind -- three settlements in the Gaza Strip and the  synagogue in Jericho. These are flashpoints that bring to mind  what happened in Hebron. Yesterday, a settler close to Netzarim  was fired on. Today, they carried out provocations on the street  that goes past this settlement. We have pointed this out to the  Israelis and tried to convince them that, if only for their own  safety, these three settlements must be dismantled. Some 550  soldiers are posted to provide protection for 150 settlers. The  settlement problem in the Gaza Strip... [pauses], I want to  break the glad news to you that 50 to 60 percent of the settlers  are bracing to leave the strip. I have been reliably informed  that they are putting in claims for compensation in return for  moving behind the green line. The security settlements you are  asking about are problematic, whether we are talking about the  Jericho synagogue or the three Gaza settlements. These are  flashpoints. The settlers travel on Arab roads in the Gaza  Strip under Army escort. But this is a daily friction that I  fear may erupt into a bloody incident. The Israeli Government  must, therefore, consider the removal of these three outposts.  We may be able to work out a solution in the future.    [Badawi, interrupting] In the meantime...    [Abu-Middayn] But the settlement activity is the real  obstacle.    [Badawi] In the meantime, how will you handle the potential  for friction?    [Abu-Middayn] The Palestinian police have plans for such an  eventuality. None of the settlers may leave their settlement  without obtaining a prior permit. But, if an armed settler  attacked a Palestinian, no one must expect him to be treated  with patience. I am not issuing threats, but bullets will be  returned in kind.    [Badawi] But this situation will cause problems for you with  the Palestinians themselves, especially seeing that three  Palestinian factions active inside the occupied land are  refusing to surrender their weapons. How do you acquiesce to  settlers carrying arms and deny this right to the Palestinians?    [Abu-Middayn] Last week, those who wagered on a Palestinian  bloodbath or a fratricidal conflict were disabused of their  illusions. Brothers in the opposition factions were out on the  streets firing in the air in jubilation alongside the  Palestinian army. Everyone saw this on television screens. The  problem of Palestinian fighting Palestinian does not exist.    [Badawi] Yes, but three Palestinian organizations declared  from Damascus that they refuse to hand over their weapons in the  occupied territories.    [Abu-Middayn] Sir, they have not been asked to hand over  their weapons. The handover of weapons has not been asked for.  What is wanted is to rationalize weapons because control over  weapons was lost in a certain phase.    There are 20,000 weapons in Gaza. Perhaps, 20 percent or  less of these weapons are in the hands of organizations and 80  percent of them are in the hands of ordinary citizens. I am  concerned with the loose weapons present in the hands of  ordinary citizens; these weapons have reached some criminal  cells. These are the weapons that should be controlled. If  anyone wants a weapon to protect himself or for other reasons,  we can reach agreement and there can be a plan for licensing  weapons or something similar in this regard. We, however, do not  seek to arm the Palestinian people, the arms are a support for  the Palestinians. These weapons [word indistinct] are a support  for the Palestinian army's weapons, and they are not against  this army.    [Badawi] There are other possibilities that cannot be  subtracted from the practical theories, such as what happened in  Hebron this week. To what extent would this be reflected on the  situation in the self-rule areas?    [Abu-Middayn] I previously said so, and the Israeli side  complained about a statement I made [words indistinct]. If what  happened in Hebron took place at a time when we had 6,000-7,000  soldiers in Gaza, the real massacre would have occurred in Gaza  and not in Hebron. This is because the reply would have been  harsh and violent because the Israeli Army is very strong.  However, no one can [words indistinct].    If a Gazan takes to the street, would we open fire on him?  Definitely not. Thus, the Israelis, and not the Palestinian  side, should take this into account. Knowing that 30 people  were massacred at a mosque on a Friday in the month of Ramadan,  we cannot say that we in Gaza would not make a violent reply.  These issues are submitted to the Israeli side, which should  study them because peace is more important than 400 extremists.  I do not like to use the word extremist because, to me, each  settler is an extremist. Thus, there are 120,000 extremists in  the West Bank and Gaza; they are the settlers. Hence, the  Israeli Government should have its own calculations. We did not  carry out any action whatsoever. However, in case of  self-defense and in order to defend dignity, there could be a  bloodbath.    [Badawi] It can thus be said that construction work has  begun, though it may be stumbling due to lack of the necessary  funds. On the political level, however, do you have any idea  about when the whole team of the National Authority Council will  be joining you, or...?    [Abu-Middayn, interrupting] Very soon. I believe that by  Saturday, the first day of 'Id al-Adha, President 'Arafat will  have declared all the names. You know that the responsibility  is heavy, and some brothers are reluctant to join the  Palestinian National Authority. In other words, you know that  there is fear of assuming responsibility at historic moments.  This matter needs time to contemplate. I, however, believe  there are dozens of people ready to accept this challenge.    [Badawi] Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn: On the legal level, what  laws and jurisdiction are you now implementing to resolve the  differences you may face at times?    [Abu-Middayn] This is an important question. Palestinian  law has existed since the British mandate. Egypt, during former  President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir's rule, kept this law until the  time of Israeli occupation. The Gaza Strip's situation remained  as a fully independent legal issue which used to bear the name  of Palestine and there was a Palestinian constitution. The  judicial system exists, and there are three levels of  jurisdiction. The legal body exists but it was paralyzed in the  past seven years after the policemen resigned.    Immediately following 'Id al-Adha, we will start work in the  judicial field. The courts are ready but there are also  criminal cases like thefts, murders, and others. Prisons will  probably be ready within 48 hours to receive of course,  smugglers, thieves, and others. We had hoped that we would have  prisons. To cut things short, I would like to tell you that the  first case is a surprising case. The first person we  apprehended was a man who had stolen things from the Palestinian  military administration. These things were the keys to Gaza  prison. That's why we released him without any thought because  stealing the prison keys had its meanings and historical  dimensions after this long time. It will be the first time in  our history that a Palestinian will sit in this place. We hope  that we will be up to the responsibility. There must be a  judicial system that is not factional, and that is independent,  honest, and qualified. This is an essential equation and this  is the sole guarantee. The military forces should be headed by  a sound and independent legal body. The first thing we should  do is to respect the law.    [Badawi] So far, how do you assess the response of the  citizens to the police, the Palestinian force?    [Abu-Middayn] Let me tell you something. Murders, and the  car thefts have decreased. Look at the cooperation on the  streets. People from all walks of life visit police stations,  and inform about violations. The man on the street in the Gaza  Strip now even tries to avoid traffic violations. One week ago,  things were different. One has started to feel that the streets  are under control. There is a solid relationship between the  Palestinian police and the people. A murder case took place two  days ago and the investigation concerning it is proceeding  normally and routinely. There is an understanding to activate  the role of the law so that we may reach the next stage. How  can we hold elections and exercise democracy without law and the  prevalence of the law?    [Badawi] With respect to elections now, the talk is that  they  will be held in October, next fall.    [Abu-Middayn] Next fall because first of all the law should  prevail. Otherwise, why hold elections? First, the issue of  the elections should be seriously studied. We are doing our  best in this respect. But, elections for a legislative council  are not permitted at this stage. But municipal elections, rural  council elections will, probably, be the first elections with  which we will start. Then we will move to a higher stage. I  believe that the Palestinian people are dutybound to set an  example among these many Arab regimes which are fighting,  particularly what we witness in Yemen. We are pained to see  this taking place.    [Badawi] Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn, thank you.</p>

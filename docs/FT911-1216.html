			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Eastern Europe 'needs to adjust to trade patterns' EAST EUROPEAN countries must speed domestic reform, if they are to draw real benefits from adjusting trade, William Dullforce in Geneva writes. This advice comes from a symposium of 40 eastern and western economists organised by the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) and the Osteuropa-Institut and Sudost-Institut in Munich last year, and now in book form*. Trade reform in isolation is deceptively easy, the economists warn. Enterprises can be granted rights to import and export on their own, and foreign currency auctions can be quickly set up. But without domestic reforms, enterprises will not respond to enhanced export opportunities and more realistic exchange rates. Cuts in central controls over trade seemed so far to have had only limited effects in improving the quality of exports, the economists noted. They favoured a shift from quotas and administrative curbs to conventional tariffs on the import side. But they warned that partial reforms, such as reducing limits on imports of intermediate goods while maintaining protection for consumer goods, as in Poland, could be counter-productive, by raising protection for domestic producers. Opinions differed on future trading links in Comecon. *Reforms in Foreign Economic Relations of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Pp 200. Available: Palais des Nations, CH-1211 Geneva 10.

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling continues to weaken STERLING continued to perform nervously against the D-Mark yesterday after Germany's figure for June M3 money supply came in at 8.7 per cent, writes James Blitz. The fear that the Bundesbank will lift its Lombard rate when its council meets next month continues to hang over the pound. A poor set of UK trade figures for June also depressed the currency, with the visible trade deficit widening by Pounds 0.1bn from the previous month. Yesterday, sterling declined a pfennig from its previous close to DM2.8325. A worrying feature of the pound's performance is that it is the only currency in the European exchange rate mechanism which continues to weaken against the D-Mark following Monday's concerted intervention in the market by the US Federal Reserve and the European central banks. The Italian lira showed some improvement against the D-Mark, firming to L758.2 from a previous L759.4. The Spanish peseta strengthened to Pta64.10 to the D-Mark from Tuesday's Pta64.16 close, while the French franc steadied against the German currency, ending unchanged at FFr3.378. The underlying problem for sterling is that most of the central banks with high-yielding currencies have tightened either fiscal or monetary policy to withstand the D-Mark's rise. The Bank of Spain appeared to be tightening monetary policy yesterday by draining overnight funds from the interbank market at 12.75 per cent, compared to 12.45 per cent previously. The Italians have raised their discount rate by 1.75 percentage points in the last two weeks, and are also attempting to slim down their budget. Yesterday's announcement of a tighter fiscal package by the UK government may have an effect on sterling in the next few days. Dollar/D-Mark trading was sidelined yesterday, with most traders confident that Monday's central bank intervention will keep the US currency trading in tight ranges for a while. The dollar moved between DM1.4780 and DM1.4900, closing unchanged at DM1.4885. Mr Alan Greenspan's testimony on the US economy continued to have little effect on the currency, but unfounded rumours that the United Nations had started military operations against Iraq brought support. The dollar ended in New York at DM1.4852. The yen was lower against both the D-Mark and dollar yesterday following the resumed slide in the Japanese stock market which left the Nikkei average at a six-year low of 15,542. As a result, the dollar moved up to Y127.20 at the start of European trading from an opening of Y125.25. It ended in London at Y126.85. The D-Mark rallied to a closing Y85.25 in Europe from an opening of Y84.07. In New York the US unit closed at Y126.68.</p>

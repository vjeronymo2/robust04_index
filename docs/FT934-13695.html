			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental bourses consolidate gains MANY of the continent's bourses took a breather yesterday from the bull run, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT took a pause from its record breaking ways with most analysts commenting that the current rally still has a long way to go. Opinion remained divided as to whether the Bundesbank would cut interest rates at its regular council meeting tomorrow. Some commentators said yesterday that they believed a cut would not happen until the release of M3 and inflation data, due out over the next few days; and that November was the most probable date for an announcement. The DAX index moved from an intraday low of 2,021 to close down 6.56 at 2,026.76. Turnover was DM9.8bnbn, with institutional funds reported to have stayed on the sidelines. In a day bereft of corporate news BMW staged a turnaround with a gain of DM12 to DM613: the stock has been lagging behind other motor sector shares. In contrast Volkswagen shed DM7.00 to DM375.20 and Daimler DM6.50 to DM740.00. PARIS staged firm although turnover slipped back from the level seen at the start of the week. The CAC-40 index added 2.33 to 2,147.32, after a day's high of 2,150 and a low of 2,137. Turnover was estimated at FFr3.3bn after Monday's FFr4.5bn. EuroDisney shed a further FFr1.55 to FFr51.65 as selling appreciated after its recent news of job cuts. James Capel in London commented that while the redundancy scheme will have a one off negative impact on profits, the news had already been largely discounted. 'The more pressing problem is its future funding,' the brokers said. Bouygues was down FFr4 at FFr708 ahead of reporting a first half profit of FFr79m against FFr108m in the same year ago period after the close of trading. Elf Aquitaine regained FFr4.10 to FFr438.10 as it announced that it was planning to restart production at its Nigerian facility. AMSTERDAM remained in positive territory with the CBS Tendency index at one point going reaching a new record high, before closing 0.4 higher at 132.5. Akzo was one of the day's main losers, falling Fl 2.40 or Fl 184.40, as some investors booked profits after reaching a new record high on Monday. ZURICH encountered profit-taking after its run of seven consecutive record highs, and the SMI index finished 2.9 lower at 2,660.7 as some of the early losses were pared. Nestle continued as the most activeley traded stock, adding SFR2 to SFr1,174. CS Holding, whose shares are viewed by some analysts as undervalued, rose SFr15 to SFr3,365. MILAN turned lower, the market held back by the burden of cash calls during the current trading month, and the Comit index eased 0.94 to 588.94. Fiat fell L145 or 3.6 per cent to L3,855: the shares had risen by 10 per cent rise over the previous two sessions since its rights issue began. Against the downward trend, the new Ferruzzi shares added L1,533 to L51,278 after their recent sharp falls. Montedison rose L11 to L837.30. VIENNA was modestly firmer with some profit-taking in evidence. The ATX index put on 0.67 points to 1,078.23 with Flughafen Wien down Sch13 at Sch531. COPENHAGEN put on another 0.23 in the KFX index to 100.79 but Sophus Berendsen built on Monday's fall, off a further DKr2 to DKr474, following the announcement that it was reducing its stake in Rentokil of the UK. STOCKHOLM gave way to profit-taking which left the Affarsvarlden index 0.8 lower at 1,397.0.in heavy trading The market had opened firm before a wave of selling in Astra and Ericsson shares sent the market lower. Ericsson B shares retreated SKr9 to SKr457 while Astra A shares slipped SKr2 to SKr180. Interest rate sensitive banks and insurers put in a better performance. S-E Banken A shares added SKr2 to SKr57. BRUSSELS saw profit-taking which left the Bel-20 index 5.19 lower at 1,375.86 in turnover of BFr2.16bn. Analysts believe that talks on the social pact, which are scheduled to begin in coming days are unlikely to have much impact on the market. However, they added that foreigners were likely to to be ready to pick up shares if Belgian investors became sellers due to fears about the outcome of the talks.

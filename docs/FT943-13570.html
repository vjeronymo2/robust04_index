			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: No point to government proposal on delegating pay bargaining Sir, Publication of the white paper on civil service reform continues the depressingly regular process of the government announcing the introduction of new policies, while quietly signalling the demise of others ('Whitehall faces sweeping reform', July 14). The delegation of pay to all departments and agencies by April 1 1996, the latest ministerial fad, will only result in both a massive extension in costs, as well as in the actual numbers of people who will now need to be employed on annual negotiations exercises. National pay bargaining arrangements, by and large, have worked very well. In their place will come 150 bargaining units and an increase in negotiators and back-up staff from a handful based in the Treasury to an estimated 3,000 across every department and agency. There is, of course, no evidence that the fragmentation of pay bargaining will either reduce the overall pay bill, or ensure that particular groups of staff will have better performance rewarded. All that has happened this year, for instance, in those areas that already have delegated pay, is that the hundreds of extra hours of negotiations in different agencies have resulted in remarkably similar, if not exactly identical, pay deals. And, as in the case of Railtrack, the potential for disputes will mushroom because Treasury ministers will still be breathing down the necks of these 3,000 negotiators. So what on earth is the point? The birth of a new policy also sees the timely death of another - market testing. Buried deep within the white paper is the announcement, quite unthinkable at the start of this year, that the Treasury will no longer insist on departments establishing market testing programmes with centrally set targets. Market testing has been an enormously costly disaster, which ministers now admit, even if they still will not say so in so many words. I have no doubt that within a few years delegated pay is likely to go exactly the same way. Barry Reamsbottom, general secretary, CPSA, 160 Falcon Road, London SW11 2LN</p>

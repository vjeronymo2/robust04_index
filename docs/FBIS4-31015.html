			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/5/1994 -- Romanian President  Ion Iliescu received at Cotroceni Palace on 31 May Miltiades  Evert, president of the New Democracy Party of the Hellenic  Republic, leader of the opposition in Greece.    After recalling the fine relations between Romania and  Greece, even at the time when the two countries belonged to  differing social systems, the Hellenic politician pleaded in a  press statement for the necessity of establishing a climate of  peace in the Balkans. "Romania, Bulgaria and Greece are spaces  of stability and these countries have to take over the  initiative of pacifying the Balkans," Miltiades Evert said.    He mentioned he proposed to the Romanian president "the  signing of an agreement on existing frontiers intangibility" by  the Balkan countries, as well as the passage to concrete  measures for such a document to be signed the soonest. "The  signing of such an agreement would be the first great step  toward peace in the Balkans, that should be ensured first of all  by the Balkan peoples," he added.    In the same context, Miltiades Evert said that the signing  of  the proposed agreement would be difficult at this moment for  Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, countries that are at war now, but  the other states in the zone, he said, were bound to do it  "precisely in order to prevent the expansion of the conflict and  to ensure welfare and economic development in the Balkans."    The conclusion of treaties to guarantee the current  frontiers  can be a first step toward securing peace in the Balkans,  assessed Miltiadis Evert, president of the New Democracy Party  of Greece, during an interview with Romanian Minister of Labour  and Social Protection Dan Mircea Popescu, in Bucharest, on 31  May.    The interview occasioned a survey of the stage of the  bilateral relations which, they assessed, had to be increased  and diversified, as well as the approach of stability and  cooperation in the Balkans.    Minister Dan Mircea Popescu outlined to the guest the  Romanian Government's current priorities, emphasizing among them  the securing of an adequate social protection and an increasing  living standard of the population. He considered the  difficulties Romania was going through at this time could be  eased only through good-quality work, an efficient management  and steady international economic cooperation, which, between  Romania and Greece, could be achieved on multiple planes.</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 64 SCHOOLS ELECT TO GO YEAR-ROUND BY SUMMER  </P> <P> Sixty-four schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District plan to switch to  multi-track, year-round operation beginning this summer, and almost 40 more  expect to move portable classrooms onto their playgrounds this fall to help  relieve overcrowding in the district.  </P> <P> Most of the schools are among 109 ordered by the school board in February to  increase their capacity by 23% this year to accommodate exploding enrollment  growth. The school plan was submitted to board members Monday and a vote is  expected next week.  </P> <P> The district already has 102 schools operating on multi-track year-round  schedules, which allow a campus to accommodate up to one-third more pupils by  dividing the student body into several groups that attend school on staggered  schedules, with one group on vacation at all times.  </P> <P> Still, schools in some areas are so crowded they are forced to send children to  less crowded campuses up to an hour away. A record 25,000 students are being  bused away from their neighborhood schools this year because of overcrowding.  </P> <P> The plans will create more than 20,000 classroom seats throughout the district  this fall, allowing about 5,000 of the 17,500 elementary school students now  being bused to return to their home campuses.  </P> <P> But it is not clear whether the additional space will give the district much  breathing room. More than 10,000 new elementary students are expected to enroll  next fall, and similar increases are expected for the following few years.  </P> <P> "Whether we're standing still or making progress has yet to be determined,"  said Roberta Weintraub, who represents the East San Fernando Valley, which will  have a large proportion of the year-round schools.  </P> <P> Over the next three years, the remainder of the district's 600 schools will  have to find ways to increase space for students by 23%. Parents and staff at  each school will be allowed to vote to select from among four options to create  the needed space.  </P> <P> The options include adding bungalow classrooms, putting two more children in  each classroom, going multi-track year-round, or cooperating with nearby  schools to transfer entire grade levels there. For instance, an elementary  school could send sixth-graders to a neighboring junior high if space permits.  </P> <P> Because of restrictions on the number of portable classrooms a school may use,  many schools will have no choice but to go multi-track year-round -- as was the  case with 61 of the 64 schools opting for year-round this year.  </P> <P> It will cost the district almost $500,000 to finance conversion of the 64  schools to year-round, not including additional operating and maintenance  costs.  </P> <P> The money will pay for such things as additional teacher and clerical time to  organize students and teachers into separate groups or "tracks," and storage  cabinets to hold materials for "roving" teachers who will have to change  classrooms every few months.  </P> <P> The district also will spend $12.2 million to purchase and install 123 portable  classrooms at schools selecting that option, and about $45,000 to convert  office space to classrooms at other schools.  </P> <P> But district officials estimate they will save $7 million in transportation  costs if 5,000 fewer students are bused next year.  </P> <P> In the past, multi-track year-round schools in the district have received up to  $150 additionally per student from the state as part of an incentive program to  encourage districts to go year-round.  </P> <P> But Gov. George Deukmejian has proposed changing the formula to give less money  to large districts such as Los Angeles, and the state's independent legislative  analyst recommended Monday that the state end the incentive program altogether,  saying it costs too much and has had little effect on whether districts go  year-round.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CHANGES TO INCREASE CAPACITY AT L.A. SCHOOLS  </P> <P>  Under a school board mandate to increase capacity by 23%, 63 elementary  schools and one junior high in the Los Angeles Unified School District will  convert to multi-track, year-round operation this summer. Others schools have  chosen to add portable classrooms, increase the size of classes, convert  administrative space or reconfigure to create additional space.  </P> <P>  Elementary schools going multi-track year-round (90 days on / 30 days off  calendar):  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crenshaw area  </P> <P> Alta Loma  </P> <P> Hillcrest  </P> <P> Hyde Park  </P> <P> Sixth Street  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hollywood / Los Feliz area  </P> <P> Van Ness  </P> <P> Dayton Heights  </P> <P> Dorris Place  </P> <P> Elysian Heights  </P> <P> Garvanza  </P> <P> Los Feliz  </P> <P> </P> <P> San Fernando Valley  </P> <P> Apperson, Sunland  </P> <P> Arminta, North Hollywood  </P> <P> Bassett, Van Nuys  </P> <P> Beachy, Pacoima  </P> <P> Broadous, Pacoima  </P> <P> Burbank, North Hollywood  </P> <P> Canoga Park  </P> <P> Coldwater Canyon, North Hollywood  </P> <P> Dyer, Sylmar  </P> <P> El Dorado, Sylmar  </P> <P> Fenton Avenue, Lake View Terrace  </P> <P> Fernangeles, Sun Valley  </P> <P> Harding, Sylmar  </P> <P> Hazeltine, Van Nuys  </P> <P> Langdon, Sepulveda  </P> <P> Noble, Sepulveda  </P> <P> Plummer, Sepulveda  </P> <P> San Fernando  </P> <P> Sharp, Pacoima  </P> <P> Strathern, North Hollywood  </P> <P> Sylmar  </P> <P> Telfair, Pacoima  </P> <P> Valerio, Van Nuys  </P> <P> </P> <P> Southeast area  </P> <P> Florence  </P> <P> Nevin  </P> <P> Parmelee  </P> <P> Russell  </P> <P> Weigand  </P> <P> South-Central area  </P> <P> 66th Street  </P> <P> 68th Street  </P> <P> 74th Street  </P> <P> 95th Street  </P> <P> 107th Street  </P> <P> Budlong  </P> <P> Manchester  </P> <P> Manhattan  </P> <P> Weemes  </P> <P> West Vernon  </P> <P> Woodcrest  </P> <P> (Also Foshay Junior High School)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Harbor area  </P> <P> Fries, Wilmington  </P> <P> Gardena  </P> <P> Gulf, Wilmington  </P> <P> Hawaiian, Wilmington  </P> <P> Lomita Fundamental Magnet  </P> <P> Meyler, Torrance  </P> <P> Normont, Harbor City  </P> <P> </P> <P> East Los Angeles / Eagle Rock area  </P> <P> City Terrace  </P> <P> Fourth Street  </P> <P> Griffin  </P> <P> Ninth Street  </P> <P> Rowan  </P> <P> Sheridan  </P> <P> Sierra Vista  </P> <P> Elementary schools adding portable classrooms and / or using other options such  as increasing class size, converting office space to classrooms or  reconfiguring by grade level:  </P> <P> </P> <P> Westside  </P> <P> Bellagio Road, Bel-Air  </P> <P> Brentwood Science Magnet  </P> <P> Canyon, Santa Monica Canyon  </P> <P> Castle Heights, West Los Angeles  </P> <P> Hancock Park, Fairfax  </P> <P> Kenter Canyon, Brentwood  </P> <P> Laurel, Fairfax  </P> <P> Open School, Fairfax  </P> <P> Overland, Rancho Park  </P> <P> Paseo del Rey Fundamental Magnet, Playa del Rey  </P> <P> Rosewood, Fairfax  </P> <P> Shenandoah, West Los Angeles  </P> <P> Warner, Westwood  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P> <P> Westwood  </P> <P> Loyola Village Magnet, Westchester  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crenshaw area  </P> <P> </P> <P> Avenue Fundamental Magnet  </P> <P> Windsor Hills  </P> <P> Western  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hollywood / Los Feliz area  </P> <P> Selma  </P> <P> Valley View  </P> <P> </P> <P> San Fernando Valley  </P> <P> Andasol, Northridge  </P> <P> Balboa Gifted Magnet, Northridge  </P> <P> Carpenter, Studio City  </P> <P> Chandler, Van Nuys  </P> <P> Darby, Northridge  </P> <P> Dearborn, Northridge  </P> <P> Dixie Canyon, Sherman Oaks  </P> <P> El Oro Way, Granada Hills  </P> <P> Emelita, Encino  </P> <P> Encino  </P> <P> Hart, Canoga Park  </P> <P> Kittridge, Van Nuys  </P> <P> Lassen, Sepulveda  </P> <P> Monlux, North Hollywood  </P> <P> Nestle, Tarzana  </P> <P> Parthenia, Sepulveda  </P> <P> Pinewood, Tujunga  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P> <P> Vanalden, Reseda  </P> <P> Vintage Fundamental Magnet, Sepulveda  </P> <P> Wilbur, Tarzana  </P> <P> </P> <P> South-Central area  </P> <P> 135th Street  </P> <P> </P> <P> Harbor area  </P> <P> South Shores Magnet, San Pedro  </P> <P> Crestwood, San Pedro  </P></p>

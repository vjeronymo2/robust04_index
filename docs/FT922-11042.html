			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (22): Back from the brink - The Baltic shipyards FIVE ships are under construction for South African owners in Polish shipyards, a sign of the revolution in Poland's foreign economic relations and the competitive strength of the shipyards on Poland's Baltic coast. The upturn in worldwide shipping orders and the wholesale closure of shipyards in the UK and elsewhere over the past decade has opened new opportunities for an industry which faced bankruptcy in the 1980s. Gdansk shipyard, which in August 1980 became the focus of attention after a shipyard electrician called Lech Walesa leapt over the shipyard fence to rally workers behind a strike which led to the birth of Solidarity, was threatened with closure by the communist government only four years ago. Now shipyard director Mr Hans Szyc says the yard has orders worth more than Dollars 1bn and is negotiating new orders worth Dollars 250m. Output rose 28 per cent in 1990 and a further 21 per cent last year but with domestic interest rates at around 60 per cent per annum and wages constrained by the government's popiwek tax on wage increases, the industry is constrained by tight credit and shortages of skilled labour, in spite of the more than 2m officially unemployed. Thousands of skilled workers left Gdansk shipyards when it was under threat of closure. 'Now we are left either with the old workers or the young recruits. We employ over 7,200 but we need another 1,000 skilled production workers to get to full production. At present we're only working at about 50 per cent capacity,' says Mr Szyc. The labour shortage, partly relieved by a group of 200 gastarbeiter shipyard workers from St Petersburg, is partly a result of low wages and harsh working conditions and partly a function of low productivity. It takes about 700,000 man hours on average to build a ship at Gdansk, twice the West European or Far Eastern levels. Wage rates by contrast are only 10 per cent of European and Asian levels although on average labour costs account for only 6 per cent of total shipbuilding costs. Gdansk, with its old facilities and sprawling lay-out, traditionally concentrates on building specialist, high-value ships. Two of the five ships on order for South Africa - both reefer ships for Safmarine - are being built here. A further 10 such ships are on order, including six for Norwegian owners. The order book also includes four Ro-Ro (roll-on, roll-off) ships for Finnish owners and three container ships for French and German operators. Last year, the state-owned shipyard lost 280bn zlotys on its fixed price contracts as costs rose in line with inflation while the zloty's steady appreciation cut revenue. The picture is brighter in the more modern and rationally laid out yards at Szczecin and Gdynia. The latter, which is a serious candidate for privatisation, has just won two orders for 110,000-tonne, double-hulled Afromax tankers from Burmeister and Wain of Denmark, bringing the total order book to well over 1m tonnes. Apart from two dry docks, one able to accommodate ultra- large tankers and equipped with a huge gantry crane capable of lifting 900-tonne blocks, Gdynia also has some of the most modern cutting and welding equipment of any European yard. The competitiveness of the shipyard was recently revealed when a customer was required to explain to insurers the reasons for ordering ships from Gdynia. The Polish yard was able to offer a contract price of around Dollars 44m for an Afromax tanker for which Korean and Japanese shipyards were asking between Dollars 52-54m with slightly lower specifications. The Asian shipyards were able to deliver in 14 to 16 months while Gdynia took between 24 and 28 months. This was partly a question of order books and partly man-hours. While the Japanese yards required 500,000 man-hours at Dollars 25 an hour, the Polish yard expected to consume 1.25m man-hours at a rate of Dollars 1 and hour. In the past, the profitability of Polish yards has been handicapped by poor payment conditions. Contracts requiring only 20 per cent of the price during construction and 80 per cent on completion were common. This left heavy exposure to domestic interest rates of 60 per cent and higher. The yards have also had to absorb the retroactive removal of the 20 per cent government subsidy. In addition, Polish yards have been left with several nearly completed or completed ships ordered by the former Soviet Union but not delivered because of the collapse of the old rouble trading system. Several older orders have been re-negotiated on more favourable terms, however, and new orders are only accepted with heavy up-front and progress payments written in. With shipowners around the world renewing ageing fleets the Polish yards are confident of better times and good order books until well into the next century, but need much re-organisation and change in the meantime.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Japanese banks return to aircraft leasing Japanese banks are returning to the aircraft leasing market after a two-year absence, amid signs of an improvement in the financial situation of the international airline industry. Japanese institutions dominated the aircraft leasing business in the five years until 1991, accounting for more than 50 per cent of all new aircraft financing. Their share subsequently collapsed to less than 10 per cent as Japanese banks, hit by a fierce credit squeeze, abandoned the troubled airline market. However, a number of recent aircraft leasing deals have confirmed the renewed interest of Japanese banks. They have bid aggressively for aircraft leasing business, which has in turn led to a drop in debt financing costs for airlines. Swissair is believed to have secured a spread of between 50 and 55 basis points on the cost of a Dollars 120m lease, arranged by Sanwa Bank of Japan, for a new McDonnell Douglas MD-11 wide-body aircraft. It would have probably faced a spread of between 60 and 70 basis points 18 months ago for a similar leasing deal, said Mr Ian Hosier, the head of Sanwa's London transport finance arm, yesterday. This reflects increased competition among banks for arranging aircraft tax leases for quality airlines, although the spreads have yet to reach the lows of around 25 basis points commanded by top airlines three or four years ago during the industry's last boom. The Swissair deal to be signed next week is also significant because the Swiss carrier has traditionally turned to the US aircraft tax lease market for aircraft financing, but decided to switch for the first time to Japan because of the more competitive terms offered by the Japanese bank. Japanese and US institutions have also been battling over a Dollars 220m leasing deal involving two MD-11 aircraft for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. The US banks are understood to have clinched the deal, but only after being forced to make additional concessions to improve on a rival Japanese bid. Other significant deals include the Dollars 550m financing by British Airways between February and April of six Boeing aircraft through the Japanese lease market on spreads of 50 to 55 basis points on the debt. British Aerospace is also back in the Japanese aircraft leasing market for the first time since 1992. BAe's new aircraft leasing asset management organisation has just completed three leasing transactions with Japanese institutions and is believed to be negotiating up to eight more. These leasing transactions also cover a 10-year period, reflecting renewed confidence in BAe's financial situation on the part of the international banking community, including Japanese banks. Only 18 months ago banks were not prepared to take more than five-year credit exposure on BAe aircraft. 'We are seeing increasing interest from banks of all types to invest in aircraft leasing, but particularly from Japanese banks which faced the biggest squeeze but are now recovering,' Mr Hosier explained. After cutting back sharply in aircraft lending, many banks were now finding themselves 'underlent' at a time when the airline industry was picking up and had overcome the traumas of airline bankruptcies, widespread cancellations and deferrals of new aircraft orders, and the collapse of GPA, the Irish leasing company. The International Air Transport Association is forecasting that airlines will return to profit on international scheduled services this year after four years of record losses.</p>

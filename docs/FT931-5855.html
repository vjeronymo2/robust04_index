			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Scottish constitutional review downplayed MINISTERS are trying to dispel expectations that the exercise of 'taking stock' of the constitutional position of Scotland will lead to radical changes. Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, told MPs yesterday that there would be nothing in the government's proposals to undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom or Scotland's place in it. Other ministers have been hinting privately at a 'minimalist' solution. One of the main elements will be greater use of the Scottish grand committee - made up of all 72 Scottish MPs - for handling Scottish business in the Commons. The deal is also likely to include more administrative devolution from Whitehall to the Scottish office. It is due to be considered by the cabinet today and to be announced by Mr Lang next week. Ministers for other departments who were involved in the exercise have been highlighting the danger of an 'English backlash' if the government were seen to be conceding too much to the Scottish lobby, particularly since the Tories' 11 of the 72 Scottish seats is a much higheer total than was predicted. It is already clear that the government's proposals fall far short of what the opposition parties are pressing for. Questioning the Scottish secretary yesterday, Mr Alex Salmond, the Scottish National party leader, said there was a world of difference between increasing the powers of Scotland and increasing ministerial patronage. Mr Tom Clarke, the shadow Scottish secretary, said Labour would introduce a bill to submit Scotland's constitutional position to a referendum if the government did not 'consult the people.' There was a clear majority among Scottish MPs for a separate Scottish parliament, he said. No matter how well-supported among opposition parties such a bill would be, however, it has no prospect of becoming law without government backing. The Scottish Office is considering the controversial step of putting its proposals for local government and the Scottish water industry into a single bill next session to help ease pressure on the government's legislative programme.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Dangerous path to advocate for Yeltsin to safeguard society Sir, John Lloyd and Leyla Boulton ('Iron fist and an iron glove', September 25) refer to the dangers of a dictatorship in Russia, the 'supine nature of the media' and the apparent fact that it was an insult by Ruslan Khasbulatov about the drinking habits of the president that was 'crucial' in Yeltsin's move against the parliament. They also point out that the regions and republics are taking advantage of the situation to increase their independence. I would like to make several points. First, Yeltsin himself actively encouraged the regions and republics in their separatism by attempting to use them as a tool against the parliament. Second, the article suggests that Yeltsin 'must' use both the 'iron first and the iron glove' - echoing a theme in your editorial the previous day ('Next steps for Mr Yeltsin') that a constitution that gives power to the president is the 'only basis for stable democratic rule in Russia'. In the face of the comments about a 'supine' media and the importance of the relatively trivial (in a healthy democracy at least) Khasbulatov insult, these are dangerous urgings. Third, if Yegor Gaider, first deputy prime minister, manages to tighten macroeconomic conditions significantly before the election, unemployment and the hardship of many will increase. Moreover, the effects of greater reliance on market forces will vary between regions and republics, heightening the separatist desire of some. What will happen if these (and other) factors produce a new parliament that is not willing to accept either the Yeltsin version of a new constitution or the Gaider economic policies? Would you suggest that Yeltsin dissolve it? What should he do about separatist regions and republics that have seen a constitution torn up? Crush them? Your newspaper, western governments and international financial institutions (which have been 'crucial' in assisting Yeltsin to act decisively) have chosen a dangerous path in encouraging Yeltsin and his men to believe only they know how to mould a new society.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 8 Feb -- The Russian Federation  Communications Union has warned the government and TV companies  that "it will black out all TV programs except the morning and  evening newscasts put out by Ostankino and the All-Russian State  TV and Radio Broadcasting Company" from 10 February onwards.  The blackout will continue until the state TV and radio  companies pay all the debts they owe TV and radio transmission  enterprises for 1993 and January 1994. The threat was contained  in a statement issued today by the coordinating committee of  workers employed at TV and radio transmitters in the Russian  Federation. The statement has been sent to Viktor Chernomyrdin,  chairman of the Russian government, to the Ostankino management,  and to Russia's Communications Ministry.    The statement says this ultimatum is justified because the  extremely acute financial crisis at transmission stations  relaying state radio and TV programs has still not been  resolved. The Finance Ministry has not settled debts owed to  communications enterprises. Radio stations in Kamchatka,  Kaliningrad, and other towns have already been silenced because  transmitter stations cannot pay for electricity and other  supplies. The majority of communications enterprises in Russia  are on the brink of grinding to a halt.    The statement says, however, that the coordinating committee  "considers it essential to maintain the intercity telephone  network and to ensure that public information can still be  broadcast, especially in emergencies."</p>

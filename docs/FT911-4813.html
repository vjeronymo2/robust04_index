			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Market weakens on the latest data London equities staged a sharp reversal yesterday as early bid talk was overwhelmed by concern that the next cut in UK interest rates was several months away. The initial strength followed Hanson's Pounds 500m cash raising exercise in the Euromarkets. A familiar list of possible bid targets did the rounds in the market, and several of them managed to hold on to small gains made as a result. This speculative activity initially pushed the FT-SE 100 index to a new intra day high of 2555.3 but trading was light and the rise almost immediately triggered selling of Footsie futures contracts. Sentiment was not helped by suggestions that the Bundesbank might raise German interest rates at its fortnightly meeting tomorrow. Last week another German rate, the repo, moved slightly higher and shares were similarly edgy before the last Bundesbank meeting. Some analysts suggested that a rise of about half a percentage point was a possibility tomorrow, although money market activity in Frankfurt appeared to point to no immediate change. The London mood darkened further as the latest statistics on UK output prices underscored the market's view that there was a floor under interest rates. Factory gate prices rose 0.7 per cent last month, leaving the annual rate at 6.3 per cent for the third month in succession. If traders and investors needed confirmation that this implied that the underlying rate of inflation is still a problem for the government, they had only to look at the money markets. If inflation stays high, as output price statistics suggest, so will the price of money. Three month interbank rate - which is an expectation of the average base rate over the next three months - closed at 11 7/8 per cent, compared with the base rate now of 12 per cent. The gilts market was dull as a result. Much of last week's tap stock issue remained unsold and prices generally were trimmed. 'It is cheaper to buy in the market,' said Mr Paul Walton at James Capel. Mr Walton added that equity strategists were trying to anticipate the effect the May local government elections might have on share price sentiment. Analysts were preparing contingency responses to both good and bad performances by the ruling Conservative party. Sterling lost some ground yesterday and this led several large-capitalisation issues to underperform an already slipping stockmarket. Shares fell steadily from the day's peak, not helped by a weak opening on Wall Street, to end just above the day's low at 2519.5, a net decline of 23.3. The swing on the day was more than 37 points. Turnover at 446m shares was a little higher than the previous session's depressed level but still less than the volume the market has become accustomed to in the bull run that started in January. The reversal of fortune was also seen in the futures market, which moved in a 50 point range. Traders said that the June contract dropped through a support level, and it continued to fall in after-hours trading. Apart from Hanson, corporate news was thin on the ground. There was one small rights issue from engineering group EIS. It served as another reminder to the market that with the Footsie so near its all-time high that more, and larger, rights issues are likely in the short term.</p>

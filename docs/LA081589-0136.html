			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> AGNOS HITS CRITICS OF BALLPARK PLAN  </P> <P> Mayor Art Agnos angrily blasted critics of a new downtown ballpark during a  debate over the proposal.  </P> <P> Slamming his prepared notes against a chair as he paced in front of the  audience Monday night, Agnos accused opponents of hurting the future of the  city. "I'm tired of this attitude where we say we are going to take this fight  to every precinct and every neighborhood," Agnos said about a vow by critics to  block the ballot proposal with a grass-roots campaign. "What we are talking  about is the future of San Francisco."  </P> <P> Agnos' remarks came before members of the Alice B. Toklas Lesbian/Gay  Democratic Club. The audience sat silently as Agnos blasted critics of the  $115-million China Basin ballpark proposal he put together. Gay votes are  considered vital for passage of the fall ballot measure.  </P> <P> Opponents said the new ballpark would be just as cold and windy as Candlestick,  would block bay views and would turn out to be costlier than current estimates.  </P></p>

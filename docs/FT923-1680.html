			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: The franc under fire The French franc's honeymoon period looks to have been even briefer than sterling's. At least the pound managed to struggle back above DM2.81 last Monday in response to that wafer-thin German interest rate cut - into what laughably seemed like reasonably safe territory at the time. But the euphoria which initially greeted the wafer-thin French majority in favour of Maastricht yesterday was quickly replaced by fresh doubts over the currency. The Bank of France can hardly have been pleased to see the franc back within a centime of its ERM floor despite heavy intervention after touching FF3.3910 earlier in the day. Given the speed and savagery with which Messrs Major and Lamont were swept away, it would be idle to assume that the French Government can easily withstand the tide. There is admittedly much more will in Paris than there was in London, and much greater credibility behind the commitment to defend existing parities. But the markets again scent blood and the weekend's lukewarm endorsement of the treaty can only encourage further testing of the defences. With an election just six months away the speculators may calculate that the government's nerve is likely to crack. Much will depend, though, on the attitude of the Germans. The current crisis is, after all, as much as anything a test for the Bonn/Paris alliance which lies at the core of the European Community, and even a modest German cut could stave off the need for a French interest rate rise. Whilst the Germans might be reasonably sanguine about British and Italian devaluations, they may conclude that letting the franc go the same way would be handing the French a clear competitive advantage. Yesterday's fresh bout of disappointing news from the French corporate sector was another reminder that the tensions between German monetary policy and growth priorities elsewhere must ultimately snap.</p>

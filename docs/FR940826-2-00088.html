Separation Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To help give effect to the equal access and manufacturing provisions of the proposed Final Judgment, Section III requires that, so long as the judgment is in effect, McCaw and McCaw affiliates that are involved in the operation of wireless systems and the provisions of local wireless services shall be maintained as corporations or partnerships separate from AT&amp;T as specified in that section and in the Structural Separation plan to be filed for approval by the United States pursuant to Section VII.A. Section III requires that McCaw and McCaw affiliates shall be maintained as corporations and partnerships with separate officers and personnel and separate books, financial or operating records; retain all wireless service licenses and title and control of the wireless infrastructure equipment used by its systems; and retain responsibility for the operation of their wireless services, and may not delegate substantial responsibility for such business activities to AT&amp;T, provided that AT&amp;T may act as McCaw's agent to the extent authorized in Section IV.F and may provide general corporate overhead and administrative services to McCaw and its affiliates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to facilitate the monitoring of AT&amp;T's compliance with equal access and the manufacturing provisions of Section V of the proposed Final Judgment, Section III.D requires that any interexchange services, wireless infrastructure equipment and related engineering services or services related to the marketing of wireless services AT&amp;T provides to McCaw or its affiliates be provided only pursuant to detailed filed tariffs or written contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, as discussed above, Section III.E limits the use by McCaw and McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems of AT&amp;T trademarks and trade names prior to and during the conversion of McCaw Cellular Systems to equal access. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Compliance Plans <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section VII.A obliges AT&amp;T, not less than 90 days after entry of the judgment, to file plans for implementation of the judgment's terms with the United States. This framework is drawn from similar procedures established in the MFJ for the implementation of equal access and other nondiscrimination obligations imposed on the Bell Companies, although in this proposed Final Judgment the Department of Justice has the authority to disapprove plans, and such disapproval would have significant consequences. In particular, AT&amp;T must file a Structural Separation implementation plan describing its implementation of Sections III and V.A.4; an Equal Access implementation plan for each McCaw Cellular System, describing its implementation of Section IV; and a Nonpublic Information implementation plan, describing its implementation of Section V.A. AT&amp;T must supplement the plans as necessary to describe the implementation of equal access in subsequently acquired cellular systems and to describe significant changes in the plans. The plans shall be effective 90 days after filing with the United States, unless disapproved by the United States by written notice to AT&amp;T that identifies the manner in which the plan is insufficient. The Department may in its discretion approve a plan in fewer than 90 days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement to file plans to implement the detailed injunctions, and to obtain the approval of the United States for such plans is intended to give AT&amp;T, McCaw and the United States flexibility to adopt procedures that best accomplish the purposes of the judgment, so long as those procedures conform to the language of the judgment, and will permit the United States to assure that AT&amp;T complies with its obligations under the judgment. In the absence of an effective Structural Separation plan, AT&amp;T must comply with Section III without modification and may not perform Proprietary Development for McCaw. In the absence of an effective Equal Access Plan, AT&amp;T may not provide interexchange services to customers of McCaw Cellular Systems, except under arrangements existing prior to the merger. In the absence of an effective Nonpublic Information plan, AT&amp;T would be enjoined from selling cellular infrastructure equipment to any McCaw Cellular Systems or McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems that were not equipped with AT&amp;T equipment prior to the commencement of this action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Modification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The duration of the proposed Final Judgment is ten years. Because it is possible that during that period there could be major changes affecting competition in wireless telecommunications that could be material to the matters addressed in this judgment, Section X provides certain grounds for modification in addition to the standards provided by the common law applicable to the modification of government antitrust consent decrees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the equal access provisions of the judgment are modeled on those that the United States has recommended be imposed on the Bell Companies if they are permitted to provide interexchange service from their wireless systems. Accordingly, Section X.A permits AT&amp;T or McCaw to seek modification of the equal access provisions of Section IV of the proposed Final Judgment if Bell Company wireless systems are relieved in whole or in part of the comparable equal access and nondiscrimination provisions of the MFJ as a result of legislation, judicial orders or agency orders that vacate, modify, supersede or interpret the provisions of the MFJ. In such an event, the provisions of Section IV of the judgment shall be modified or vacated to provide the same relief to AT&amp;T or McCaw upon their showing that competitive conditions do not require a different obligation for AT&amp;T and McCaw and the modification is equitable and in the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section X.B provides that changes in wireless telecommunications markets that could be foreseen at this time shall not be a bar to modification. Specifically, if AT&amp;T or McCaw show that other wireless telecommunications services have developed as effective competitive alternatives to today's cellular services, or that there have been other changes or developments affecting a relevant market, a showing that intervening changes have made retention of a provision of the judgment inequitable shall be sufficient to justify a modification, irrespective of whether those changes were foreseen or foreseeable when the judgment was entered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, to assure that the procedures, practices and obligations of the proposed Final Judgment are implemented without delay or distraction, AT&amp;T and McCaw have stipulated that they will not move for any modification of the judgment, except with the consent of the United States, for eighteen months following the commencement of the action. The United States will not unreasonably without its consent to modifications, and will consent to motions seeking reasonable modifications that are justified by competitive conditions and are consistent with the purposes of the judgment and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Remedies Available to Potential Private Litigants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 15, provides that any person who has been injured as the result of conduct prohibited by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages the person has suffered, as well as costs and reasonable attorney's fees. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will neither impair nor assist the bringing of any private antitrust action under the Clayton Act. Under the provisions of Section 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(a), the proposed Final Judgment has no  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> prima facie  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> effect in any private lawsuit that may be brought against the defendants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Bosnians say talks collapsing The Bosnian government said yesterday that talks on the republic's ethnic partition were on the brink of collapse because the Serbs had made no territorial concessions, writes Laura Silber in Geneva. After a series of bilateral meetings on the two-way division of Sarajevo with their Bosnian Serb adversaries, Mr Mohamed Sacirbey, Bosnia's UN ambassador, said, 'It seems that the Serbs are not willing to give anything'. However, Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, said the two sides were close to a settlement on the capital. Michael Littlejohns adds from the UN: Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, co-chairman with Lord Owen of the conference on former Yugoslavia, is being relieved of his other responsibilities as special representative of the UN secretary general. He will be succeeded by Mr Yasushi Akashi, whose direction of the recent UN peacekeeping operations in Cambodia was widely praised. A spokesman for Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, secretary general, said Mr Stoltenberg's heavy involvement in peace negotiations left him too little time to discharge the duties of chief of mission of the UN protection force and special UN representative.</p>

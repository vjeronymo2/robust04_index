			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COUNSELORS USE PERSUASIVE POWERS ON TRUANT YOUTHS  </P> <P> The three teen-agers sat on brown chairs in the locker room of the Glassell  Park swimming pool. The hour was approaching noon on a school day. The youths  were hungry and restless. But they had no choice but to wait.  </P> <P> About 9 a.m. that day, Los Angeles police officers had brought in Margaret, 13,  and Luisa, 14. About 11:30, police brought Tommy to the room. Tommy was already  warming up his excuse. Those are not the students' real names.  </P> <P> "I was going home," Tommy said, and the two girls giggled. The two counselors  in the room glanced at each other knowingly. They had heard that one too many  times.  </P> <P> There was no escape. The youths were in for several hours of boredom and  unwanted adult company, the consequence of being truant.  </P> <P> That was the scene at one of the Los Angeles Unified School District's 11  Operation Stay in School (OSIS) centers one recent morning.  </P> <P> The OSIS centers serve as drop-off points for truants picked up on the streets  by police officers who patrol in special "juvenile cars." The counselors use  gentle persuasion along with their limited legal powers to try to turn young  people away from truancy.  </P> <P> Although California law requires children ages 6 to 17 to attend school,  truancy itself is not a crime and students cannot be arrested merely for being  out of school. However, the state Education Code allows school officials and  police officers to keep truant students in custody during school hours until a  parent or guardian can retrieve them.  </P> <P> Those picked up in the Northeast area of the district are brought to the OSIS  center in Glassell Park, which opens each fall in the pool house after the end  of the swimming season. In its first week, beginning Oct. 16, the center  processed 36 juveniles, counselor Karen Crowl said.  </P> <P> The center is staffed by Crowl and an aide, Rudy Martinez, who have worked  together since 1979, when the program was housed at the Highland Park pool.  That building was damaged by fire in 1987, and the counselors moved to the  Glassell Park Recreation Center at 3650 Verdugo Road.  </P> <P> When truants are brought in, the counselors try to contact their parents to  pick them up. If a parent cannot be reached, a counselor returns the student to  school, Crowl said. The counselors also watch for signs of child abuse, which  they report to authorities.  </P> <P> While this day's students waited to be picked up or taken back to school,  Martinez bantered with them. He asked each one general questions about what  they were doing when they were picked up, how they get to school and where  their parents work. Then Martinez began targeting more specific problems that  the students' schools might have told him about, such as frequently missing  classes, fighting or shoplifting.  </P> <P> Out of earshot of the truants, Martinez said: "Most of them blame the school  and not themselves when they get into trouble. I like to try to help the kids  straighten themselves out."  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Detective Doug Evans said police support the truancy program  because, besides keeping students in class, it has helped reduce daylight crime  near schools.  </P> <P> Juveniles who habitually ditch school often look for opportunities to make  trouble, and "anything taking them off the streets helps," Evans said.  </P> <P> At the Glassell Park OSIS center, Crowl and Martinez watch 12 to 15 truants  during an average day. Officers find the youths either by seeing them on the  streets or by hearing reports of loud daytime "ditching parties" from  complaining neighbors, Crowl said.  </P> <P> "We have gotten 16 kids all at once from a ditching party," she said.  </P> <P> Griffith Park and the Glendale Galleria are among the hot spots for truant  students to gather. During the 1988-89 school year, the Glassell Park center  processed 952 truants, according to a Los Angeles school district spokeswoman.  </P> <P> "Most of the time, the parents don't realize the student's attendance is much  worse than they think," Crowl said.  </P> <P> Crowl said OSIS is most effective for youths who are not yet habitually truant.  </P> <P> "For some kids, all it takes is to be picked up by the police that one time,"  Crowl said.  </P> <P> Of the 14,353 truants processed by the district's 11 centers during the 1988-89  school year, only 3% were picked up more than once for being truant, said a  spokeswoman for OSIS' downtown office.  </P> <P> "They're the kids with parents less likely to come pick them up, " said Crowl,  referring to those who are repeatedly truant.  </P> <P> Margaret is one such "hard-core truant," Martinez said.  </P> <P> When encountered at the Glassell Park center last month, it was the sixth time  she had been picked up for truancy and the second time that she had been taken  to Glassell Park. A phone call to Eagle Rock Junior High School revealed that  she had not been in school for three weeks.  </P> <P> Even though Margaret's mother calls her school to check up on her at the  request of her school counselors, Margaret's attendance has not improved. "I  never went last year," she said.  </P> <P> Margaret said her mother had scolded her for not going to school before but  that she would run away if her mother tried to punish her. She and Luisa were  given "opportunity transfers" from another school, meaning that they had been  in trouble at their home school.  </P> <P> When they were transferred to Eagle Rock, they had to sign an agreement saying  they would attend school regularly and, if caught ditching, would be  transferred to their former school, Martinez said.  </P> <P> For some youths, an opportunity transfer to another school is all they need to  go straight, Crowl said. "A different atmosphere, a different crowd might do  the trick," he said.  </P> <P> Different schools have different ways of dealing with truants, she said. Irving  Junior High School in Glassell Park will not allow truant youths to return  until their parents come in to discuss the child's behavior. Other schools,  such as Benjamin Franklin High School in Highland Park, hold the students in  detention after school.  </P> <P> Jan Avallone, an assistant principal at Franklin, said the school's attendance  office requires the student to make up the class time that was missed by doing  homework during after-school detention. In addition, the school insists that  one of the student's parents come in for a conference with the dean.  </P></p>

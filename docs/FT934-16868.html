			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Global offerings push US houses up league table THE POPULARITY of global bond offerings has strengthened the position of US investment banks in the international bond market, at the expense of European and Japanese banks, industry data show. The number of US banks in the top 10 positions in the league table of Eurobond lead managers has risen to five at the end of the third quarter of this year from three at the same stage last year, according to IFR Securities Data. Goldman Sachs, which was in fifth place last year, has captured the number one slot from Deutsche Bank. Morgan Stanley, Salomon Brothers and Lehman Brothers have climbed into the top 10 from double-digit positions in 1992. A wide range of supranational, sovereign and provincial borrowers have issued global bonds in the past year, culminating with the Republic of Italy's record Dollars 5.5bn offering in mid-September. The process of offering bonds simultaneously in the US, Europe and Asia allows borrowers to raise larger sums than in the Eurobond market and to place the paper at the best possible price. Not surprisingly, the mandates for these issues - the majority of which have been in dollars - have tended go to banks which have the ability to distribute and trade the bonds on a global basis. This is where US banks have the edge over their European and Asian competitors, since they have been more successful in penetrating the European and Asian markets than vice versa. Their increased market share also reflects the diversification of their primary and secondary business into other currencies apart from the dollar. By contrast, the majority of mandates won by German, Japanese and UK banks are still for issues denominated in their domestic currency despite their efforts to diversify into other currencies. However, although US banks have been successful in establishing relationships in a market where around half of the borrowers and investors are European, they still have to prove that they have a long-term commitment to the market. Although they are quicker off their feet when a market becomes interesting, in the past US banks have been equally quick to withdraw when conditions deteriorate. European and Asian banks, by contrast, have a much more consistent track record. US banks also remain a force to reckoned with because of their extensive retail networks. The Eurobond market is still dependent on retail investors in Europe and Asia, in spite of the growing interest from institutional investors. Volume in the Eurobond market has topped the Dollars 300bn mark after the first nine months of this year, compared with Dollars 269bn for the whole of last year. Syndicate managers expect the new issues market to remain active for the next eight weeks, during which time the World Bank is expected to launch its first D-Mark global bond offering. The European Community is expected to tap the D-Mark and Ecu sectors. Several sovereign borrowers, including the Kingdoms of Belgium and Denmark, are also scheduled to make an appearance.</p>

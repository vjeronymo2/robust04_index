			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / BBC on-air promotion excessive, says MMC THE BBC has been criticised by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for excessive on-air promotion of its products. An MMC report sent to Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the board of trade, calls for a much stricter code of practice to govern on-air promotion by the corporation. Mr Heseltine is expected to accept the recommendations of the body, which investigates potential anti-competitive practices. The year-long investigation was prompted by the Sadler Report on cross-media promotion which in March 1991 accused the BBC of 'blatant distortion of competition' in the promotion of its magazines on BBC television. IPC, the UK's largest magazine publisher, was among the publishers which complained about what was seen as unfair competition. The publisher initiated legal action against the corporation for 'abuse of market position'. The MMC has accepted that it is not against the public interest for the BBC to promote products such as the Radio Times or Good Food magazine on air. All profits are ploughed back into BBC programmes. The commission has decided that the scale and impact of such on-air promotion should be restricted along the lines of the Independent Television Commission's rules for ITV. On ITV, details of a book or video can be given at the end of an associated programme but the mention must be brief and restrict itself to basic information such as title and price and whether the product is available through bookshops. In recent years the BBC has started showing what are in effect glossy full-blown commercials for its products - a practice which would not be allowed on ITV. The MMC has recommended that time limits should be imposed on promotional material on BBC television and radio and that promotion of a magazine or a book can come only after the relevant programme. A book or magazine on gardening, for example, could be promoted only after a gardening programme. It is not clear whether this compromise will satisfy those who argue that all BBC promotion is by definition unfair because it involves free 'advertising' for products being sold in competitive markets. The inquiry by Mr John Sadler, a former MMC member, was triggered by complaints that Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International titles were abusing their position by promoting Sky Television. Mr Sadler decided that, despite owning five national newspapers, News International was not in a position to 'prevent, restrict or distort' competition in the newspaper industry. The Sadler report did, however, recommend that the newspaper industry create a code of practice on cross-media promotion to cover advertising and editorial content. No such code has yet been implemented.</p>

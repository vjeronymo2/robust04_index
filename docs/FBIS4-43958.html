			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, June 22 (AA) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman  Ferhat Ataman said today that the Amnesty International report  showed once more that it has mistaken on the situation of human  rights practices in Turkey.    Ataman told his weekly press conference that the image which  the organization attempted to portray about Turkey did not  reflect the facts.    Ataman said that parliament, independent justice, and a free  press were functioning in Turkey which has been a member of the  democratic Western community for half a century.    `It is a fact that the significant fall of terrorism leads  to  significant improvements in human rights practices,' he said.    Ataman also recalled that Article 8 of the antiterror law,  which was criticized by Amnesty, was at present discussed at  parliamentary commissions.    `Turkey is a transparent democracy. Anyone may visit any  place, like a recent visit by Western ambassadors to the  southeast,' he said.    In an annual report, the human rights group singled out  Colombia and Turkey as being particularly aggressive violators  and said they appear to be using U.S. military aid for torture,  military attacks on civilians and other abuses.</p>

Today, a day of work, the deputies finished forming  the parliamentary committees. [passage omitted]    They also discussed resuming televising of the Parliamentary  Hour program. Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the Committee on  Information Policy and Communications, stated that the campaign  against the State Duma in the mass media is an echo of the war  which was waged between the fourth estate and the former Russian  Federation parliament. In order to break this tendency, a  number of measures must be carried out, the chairman said. In  particular, a State Duma press center must be set up through  which objective information could be fed to newspapers, radio,  and television.    As for the Parliamentary Hour television broadcast, the  committee thinks it would be pointless to have this in the form  in which it emerged under the former Supreme Soviet. Many  deputies disputed this stance, however, and as a result they  made no decision on the matter. [passage omitted]</p>

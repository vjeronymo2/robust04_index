			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Philippe Tesson] </F>   [Text] To the great embarrassment of the so-called  institutional lists representing political parties or headed by  men who are or have been in power, Bosnia is making a loud entry  into the campaign for the European elections. Yesterday,  Bernard-Henri Levy [French writer] announced a "Sarajevo" list.  Today, Alexandre Minkowski [French professor] is due to confirm  his intention of fighting a campaign in which the Bosnian  tragedy would be one of the central themes.    The emotional impact of these initiatives, if they are  confirmed, will be strong and will give the campaign an  unexpected tone. The leaders of the "big" lists will be  questioned on ground which they were planning to avoid. The  intrusion of this tragic war into the debate on Europe will  strengthen the public's image of the Twelve's impotence and  hence revive the question of European legitimacy.    Indeed, how can people be criticized for questioning the  meaning of Europe if it cannot help to settle conflicts causing  bloodshed within it? But, at the same time, how can they be  made to understand that the Twelve's responsibility lies not so  much in their present paralysis, to which they are doomed, as in  the criminal lack of foresight they demonstrated before the war  broke out? Even if Europe had had or now had the political will  to become involved in the conflict, it does not have the  military means of doing so. This obvious fact should not calm  our revulsion, but it should prompt us to moderate our European  fervor. Maastricht is only at stake in this lamentable affair  to the extent that the misleading campaign waged during the  referendum presented that treaty as a panacea serving a utopia.    The Bosnian tragedy brings us back to the reality of Europe.  It is a good thing that it should emerge in the campaign. Not  to generate new illusions, which could lead us to believe that  there is still time for the Twelve to intervene (what  intervention and stemming from what unity?), but to ensure that  we finally understand that, for a long time to come, Europe, and  especially if it is expanded, will never be more than a  community of interests, in the least lofty sense of the word.</p>

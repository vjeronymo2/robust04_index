			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Kerkorian faces lawsuits over sale of MGM studio CREDIT Lyonnais, the French state bank that controls MGM, the Hollywood studio, has filed a lawsuit seeking Dollars 500m from Mr Kirk Kerkorian, the former MGM owner, and several of his business associates. MGM has filed a separate suit against Mr Kerkorian and his colleagues, seeking Dollars 750m of damages. The legal actions, filed in Los Angeles, allege that Mr Kerkorian engaged in a scheme to deceive Credit Lyonnais in order to facilitate his November 1990 sale of MGM to Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the controversial Italian financier who in turn was forced out of the studio last year by Credit Lyonnais. Mr Kerkorian is accused in the Credit Lyonnais lawsuit of having conspired with Mr Parretti to conceal the fact that MGM had insufficient cash flow to finance its opera-tions following the acquisi-tion. He and his colleagues are accused in the separate MGM action of having breached their fiduciary duties in relation to the cash flow analyses presented in 1990. Lawyers for Mr Kerkorian termed the accusations 'completely unfounded'. Capital Cities/ABC, the US broadcasting and publishing group, was financially capable of and interested in making a significant acquisition costing as much as Dollars 8bn, Reuter reports from New York. Mr Daniel Burke, chief executive officer, told an investors conference that the company was constantly looking for such a deal, but gave no indication whether a move was imminent.</p>

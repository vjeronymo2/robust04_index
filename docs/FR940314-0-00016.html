			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) Individual projects funded under this section are subject to supplemental funds requirements set forth in &sect;1703.23;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) At the Borrower's option with REA concurrence, all or a portion of the additional funding may be used to assist project owners receiving funding from Federal grant funds under this section to meet their supplemental funding requirements set forth in &sect;1703.23 of this subpart. Such additional funding will be deemed as Federal funds and accounted for in accordance with paragraph (h)(1)(i)(A) of this section for electric borrowers or paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(A) of this section for telephone borrowers, as appropriate; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) At the Borrower's option, all or a portion of the additional funding may be retained as non-Federal funds, for any rural economic development project(s), subject to paragraph (g) of this section and REA concurrence. Additional funding committed as non-Federal will be accounted for in accordance with paragraph (h)(1)(i)(E) of this section for electric borrowers or paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(E) of this section for telephone borrowers, as appropriate; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Grant funds will only be provided to an REA Borrower for a revolving loan program when a proposed budget submitted to REA demonstrates and the Borrower agrees in writing that no more than 10 percent of grant funds received are used to cover operating expenses of the revolving loan program. Operating expenses include the costs of administering the revolving loan fund and the provision of technical assistance to project owners. All proceeds in excess of those needed to cover authorized expenses, as described above, must revert to the revolving fund and be available for re-lending for eligible projects. Budgets which reflect expenses incurred in operating the fund must be submitted to REA annually;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) The Borrower may charge reasonable loan servicing charges. For purposes of this section, loan servicing charges must not exceed an amount equal to the sum of one percent per year of the outstanding principal on the first day of each year on each project owner's zero-interest loan which is made from the REA grant proceeds;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) The Borrower will submit documentation indicating that potential projects which are eligible for funding have sufficiently progressed in the planning stage to allow grant funding approved for a revolving loan program to be requisitioned by the Borrower, disbursed by REA, and loaned to recipients within 3 years of the date of grant approval by REA. Grant funds that have not been requisitioned within 3 years will be cancelled, unless the Administrator has approved an extension in writing. Grant funds will be disbursed by REA in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) If the revolving loan program is terminated, further disbursement of grant funds will be cancelled. Repayments of loans made using grant funds which have been disbursed will be used in accordance with the Borrower's rural development plan;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Payment of creditors which provide interim or construction financing to a viable project for eligible purposes as set forth in &sect;1703.17 of this subpart may be authorized. Refinancing for the sole purpose of replacing higher interest conventional financing with zero-interest revolving loan funds is not authorized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Borrower's rural development plan. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  REA requires that the revolving loan program be administered in accordance with a rural development plan, developed by the Borrower and approved by REA. The plan must be of sufficient detail to provide REA with a complete understanding of what the Borrower intends to accomplish by administering a revolving loan program. The rural development plan will provide the mechanics of how the revolving loan funds will be disbursed to the project owner. The rural development plan must outline the Borrower's plans for administering the revolving loan program, during the initial period when REA grant funds are lent by the Borrower and after the revolving fund becomes non-Federal in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. The plan must outline the following: (1) Specific objectives for the revolving loan program, revolving loan operating procedures, lending parameters, maximum and minimum loan amount, and types of projects to be funded;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Documentation of Borrower's coordination of lending activities with other local entities that provide financing for rural economic development projects. Such documentation will indicate that the Borrower will not compete with, but supplement other sources of legal financing; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Eligibility criteria if other than outlined in this subpart;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The application process and method of disposition of the funds to the project owner; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) A procedure for monitoring the project owner's accomplishments and reporting requirements by the project owner's management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Borrower's scope of work. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Borrowers applying for grant funding under this section must submit a scope of work to REA. Applications for grants under this section will be evaluated for funding based on the Borrower's rural development plan in paragraph (b) of this section and the scope of work. The scope of work must contain the following items: (1) Documented need for grant funds. The Borrower must identify a sufficient number of rural development projects of the type specified in &sect;1703.18 (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) which are currently being planned requiring zero-interest loans equal to the amount of grant assistance requested from REA. These projects may be supported with a community facilities plan, or other development plan, prepared by local community leaders in cooperation with the Borrower. For each project, the Borrower will submit information required under &sect;1703.34; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Documented authority and ability of the Borrower to administer a revolving rural development loan program in accordance with the provisions of this subpart.

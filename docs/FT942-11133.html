			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of Madeira (7): Jardim is used to getting his own way  -Peter Wise and Dominick Coyle profile the regional president An 18th century Portuguese naval engineer's map of Maastricht, a town now symbolic of European integration, hangs in the office of Mr Alberto Joao Jardim, president of the regional government of Madeira, reflecting what he describes as his 'European soul'. Two other plaques in the pink-walled villa of his official residence affirm character traits that critics say are more prevalent in the 51-year-old politician. One states simply: 'J'ai toujours raison.' The other, in English, asks: 'Why argue? Just let me have my own way.' Mr Jardim has been getting his own way for a long time. He has headed the regional government since Madeira was made autonomous in 1978 and has won an overwhelming majority on the island for Portugal's centre-right Social Democratic Party (PSD) in 23 consecutive elections - local, regional, national and European. Admirers describe Mr Jardim as a forceful character who has been singularly successful in winning support from the European Union and the central government in Lisbon for an unparalleled period of development in Madeira. Critics brand him as little short of a dictator who has wielded the EU's largesse in a way largely designed to bolster his own power. Mr Jardim acknowledges that his 16 years in office have placed a strain on the democratic system. 'There is no doubt that a prolonged period in power carries risks and creates dependencies,' he says. 'Voters have to choose between the lesser of two evils: electing an alternative party whose policies they have no faith in or re-electing the same party knowing the dangers of protracted office.' He has not yet decided whether to stand for re-election to a fifth four-year term as regional president in 1996. Like many strong leaders, Mr Jardim's chief concern is to groom a successor who will not split his party into rival factions. Even opponents accept that he is more likely to lose his leadership as the result of a coup within the regional PSD than through an election victory by the Socialist party, which polls about 30 per cent of the vote. Why has he enjoyed the overwhelming support of voters for so long? Certainly, he has charismatic appeal. During a recent carnival, he danced along the streets of Funchal dressed as a Zulu. He is known to break out into song during election addresses. 'I'm a wag and a bon vivant by nature,' he says, drawing on a Churchillian cigar. 'But my behaviour is also didactic. Leaders on the mainland practise politics as if it were a Roman Catholic rite. I want to show young people that democracy is fun, natural and human.' People vote for him, he says, because he has improved the quality of life in Madeira and broken down a hierarchical society. A secondary-school teacher and part-time businessman who had taken 13 years to acquire a law degree, he came to the fore in Madeira after the 1974 revolution that restored democracy in Portugal; first as a journalist, then as the regional leader of the newly-formed PSD. Mr Jardim first approved legislation providing low-interest credit for peasants to buy the land they worked. 'A worker wasn't allowed past the kitchen of his boss and all hell was let loose if a poor boy wanted to marry a rich girl,' he says. 'All that has changed. Madeira is now predominantly lower middle class.' He is clearly not sorry that some English families may not be as prominent in Madeira's economy as they were before the revolution and shows considerably more enthusiasm for rich Madeirans from emigrant communities who have returned to the island to pursue their business careers. Such criticisms would appear to sit ill with an English family such as the Blandys, whose interests in areas vital to Madeira's economy such as tourism and wine are being developed in a modern entrepreneurial spirit that must benefit the island. But Mr Jardim is firm - some would say stubborn - in his convictions. His main opposition, he says, is not the Socialist party but landowners and once-powerful economic groups resentful of the position and influence they have lost. He complains of systematic harrying from the Diario de Noticias of Funchal, the best-selling newspaper in Madeira, which is owned by the Blandy family. And he is not averse to banning journalists from the mainland at press conferences as 'a legitimate protest against the lies they tell about me'. Among criticisms that those on the left level against Mr Jardim is that he stirs up popular prejudices of anti-communism and latent separatism. The first he readily admits to: 'I am equally anti-communist and anti-fascist but I'm not anti-alcohol nor anti-women.' The second he dismisses: 'I'm as Portuguese as anyone from the mainland' - and considerably more European, he claims, than many 'provincial' and 'old-fashioned imperialist' politicians in Lisbon. Before the last regional elections in 1992, the Socialists raised charges of Mr Jardim's high-handed treatment of the opposition to the level of a national debate on an alleged 'democratic deficit' in Madeira. But the PSD was re-elected with two-thirds of the vote. It was a 'joke' that backfired on the Socialists, says Mr Jardim, because the people of Madeira 'don't like to see their problems debated on the mainland'. One question on which Mr Jardim would have welcomed more debate from the mainland was the possibility of his standing against Mr Mario Soares when the Socialist leader was first elected as president of Portugal in 1986. Is Mr Jardim likely to be a candidate in the next presidential election in 1996? 'Portugal has invested a lot in me and I am ready to serve in whatever capacity my country chooses,' he says. 'But being a decorative figure like the Queen of England doesn't attract me. I like executive power.'</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: International Bonds: Convertible capital issue allows low-cost cash call AUTOMATED Security (ASH), the UK electronic security company, yesterday launched an issue of convertible capital bonds due 2006, which combined the features of a convertible and a rights issue. The structure allowed the company to raise more funds at a lower cost, analysts said. The Pounds 60m deal, increased from Pounds 50m, includes a clawback feature which allows qualifying shareholders to take up to 75 per cent of the issue. The remaining 25 per cent, equivalent to 5 per cent of new equity, is offered internationally. The issue was arranged by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Such a structure is useful because UK companies are only allowed to issue new equity to a maximum of 5 per cent of their market capitalisation in any year, without offering a 'clawback' which prevents equity dilution by allowing existing shareholders to take up the new equity. Because ASH is capitalised at just over Pounds 300m, it could only have brought a small convertible bond offering, without a clawback feature. The company could have brought a rights issue instead. But a rights issue would have had to be priced at a discount to ASH's share price, while the convertible structure allowed the company to set the conversion price at a 13.1 per cent premium, at 250p. Further, a rights issue would have been essentially domestic. The company was keen to widen its investor base abroad in order to reflect its business expansion into Europe and the US. ASH, which has had an ADR facility since 1989, is awaiting approval to list its shares on the Nasdaq system. The deal will be counted as equity for accounting purposes, and so will allow the company to reduce its high level of gearing. ASH estimates that its gearing of 85 per cent will be brought down to under 40 per cent. Mr Jim Grantham, director of convertible research at County NatWest, described the deal as 'further evidence of how a Euro-structure can be more flexible than a domestic issue.' Dealers reported firm demand for the deal which was considered quite attractively priced. However, some predicted that placement would be largely domestic, because the company is not very well known outside the UK. The issue traded at a half point premium to its par issue price. In the Swiss market, Sunkyong, the Korean trading company, launched a SFr65m convertible offering. The deal was quoted at 101 3/4 bid, a premium to its par issue price. British Gas brought a SFr75m issue of promissory notes via Swiss Bank Corporation. Staatsbank, the former East German central bank, has increased the size of its floating rate note issue, launched on Tuesday from DM4bn to DM5bn.</p>

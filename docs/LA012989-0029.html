			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> GIORDANO: "ANDREA CHENIER." Zinka Milanov, Mario del Monaco, Leonard Warren;  Metropolitan Opera Chorus and Orchestra conducted by Fausto Cleva. MET-15 (two  compact discs or two cassettes). (Available for a $150 contribution from the  Metropolitan Opera Fund, Box 930, New York, N.Y. 10023). Nobody suspected it  was a golden age while they were living through it, but if this is how  Giordano's fantasy of the French revolutionary poet fared on the afternoon of  Dec. 4, 1954, then we'd all better look back with regret. Bold, authoritative  singing like that delivered by Milanov's Maddalena, del Monaco's Chenier and  Warren's Carlo Gerard is these days a part of contemporary casting fantasies,  rather than an opera house reality. The performance is stagy, unsubtle (Del  Monaco would appear to have located the radio microphone and rarely  relinquishes it) and immensely enjoyable. Cleva's no-nonsense conducting of the  percussion-heavy orchestra is an additional plus. The digitalized restoration  is impressive, and like all the Met Historic Broadcasts, the packaging is  lavish. ALLAN ULRICH  </P></p>

Reports from that area say that the residents of Subantando,  north of Choa, put up barricades in the streets in protest  against the behavior of the Popular Movement for the Liberation  of Angola-Labor Party, MPLA-PT, armed forces, which are accused  of attacking innocent civilians and burning homes in retaliation  for a recent attack by the Front for the Liberation of the  Cabinda Enclave, FLEC. In recent years, the MPLA-PT army's  behavior has only increased separatist feelings in Cabinda.  Recent problems turned out to be the straw that broke the  camel's back.</p>

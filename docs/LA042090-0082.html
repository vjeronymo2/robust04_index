			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMY REJECTS COMBAT ROLES FOR WOMEN  </P> <P> The Army said Thursday it has rejected a recommendation for a four-year test  that would allow women to hold combat-related jobs.  </P> <P> "The Army does not feel that a test is warranted. We feel our current policy  reflects the intent of Congress by excluding women from the highest risk of  direct combat," the service said in a statement released at the Pentagon.  </P> <P> The recommendation was made last fall by the Defense Advisory Committee on  Women in the Services. The panel was founded in 1951 and advises the Department  of Defense on women's issues.  </P> <P> "We currently offer women full career opportunities and maintain equitable  advancement in schooling and promotion selection rates," the Army statement  said.  </P></p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Readymix declines to IPounds 3.63m '1991 was a year of mixed fortunes' for Readymix, the Dublin-based concrete and building materials group, with pre-tax profits declining from IPounds 4.85m to IPounds 3.63m (Pounds 3.38m). Moreover, the company said that 'the final outcome was somewhat better than could have been anticipated from the first six months, when profits fell 25 per cent to IPounds 1.76m. It added that the year had seen 'a return to more normal levels of construction activity after the exceptionally buoyant conditions experienced in 1990'. In terms of profits and earnings per share, 1991 had been the company's second best year. Turnover slipped to IPounds 31.7m (IPounds 32.2m). While major road projects, sanitary services and industrial development had maintained 'reasonable levels of demand', housing, agriculture and commercial developments were weak. Earnings shed 2.78p to 8.05p per share and the final dividend is lifted to a proposed 2.2p for a total of 2.75p (2.5p).</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Labour to unveil plan for homes spending LABOUR INTENDS to unveil plans soon which would allow a government led by Mr Neil Kinnock to implement a housebuilding programme without adding directly to public spending. The package is one of a number of ways in which the party aims to harness private funding for measures which would not require extravagant spending pledges. Mr Clive Soley, Labour's housing spokesman, will announce details of a national housing bank which would encourage the building of homes for rent by lending to housing associations and private landlords. The bank would be structured as a public limited company rather than a statutory corporation. Its borrowing would fall outside the Treasury's definition of the public-sector borrowing requirement, and would not increase it. The bank would also offer a way of recycling local authority capital receipts from the sale of council houses back into housing without increasing the PSBR. Local-authority money invested in the national housing bank would not count towards the PSBR - even if the money were lent to housing associations. A blueprint for a national housing bank has been drawn up by Mr Stephen Merrett, who advises Labour's front bench on housing policy. In a Fabian Society pamphlet Mr Merrett suggests that up to Pounds 10bn could be raised through such a bank over five years. A National Housing Bank. Fabian Society, 11 Dartmouth Street, London SW1H 9BN. Pounds 3.50.</p>

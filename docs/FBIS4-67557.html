			<p>BFN     [Text] (DYN) -- A British company -- under the guise of  carrying out important ecological work -- is planning to plunder  some 50,000 hectares of quebracho woods in the province of  Santiago del Estero without the permission of the Argentine  state, according to a report from a local environmental group.    A complaint was lodged yesterday [14 May] by the Cordoba  FUNAM ecological group (Foundation for the Protection of the  Environment) in conjunction with a fellow British group which  said the woods, in the region of Moreno in the northeast of  Santiago del Estero, would be in grave danger if no action was  taken by the government to shelve the plans.    The British company, currently assessing the cost of the  project, hopes to market the quebracho with the brandname "AAA  Hardwood." The work would be carried out in conjunction with the  local Australian Argentine Agricultural (AAA) group.    "The project will be promoted by an ecological lobby as if  it  had come from a forest which had been exploited rationally,"  FUNAM President Raul Montenegro said. "In other words they will  try to fabricate a green image."    The British company's plans, leaked to FUNAM last month,  estimate that once work gets under way in Santiago del Estero  the company will be in a position to produce some 3.6 million  metres of parquet, 13,901 tons of charcoal and 30,000 tons of  other fuel.    A probe into the affair has also discovered that a leading  bank in the Federal Capital has offered to put up capital in  order to fund the project.    Santiago del Estero forestry commission representatives have  said they will fight the plans although they have not yet  received precise details of the British company's intentions.    Meanwhile the national government has made no comments on  the  case.    The forests under threat are considered the most important  of  their type in Argentina.</p>

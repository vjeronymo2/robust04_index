			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Croats take hard line on Moslem sea port CROATIAN President Franjo Tudjman yesterday appeared to damp hopes of a rapid resumption of the Bosnian peace talks when he said he was not prepared to make any further concessions to the Moslems' territorial demands. Speaking in Zagreb, five days after the breakdown of the talks in Geneva, Mr Tudjman insisted he would not hand over the Adriatic port of Neum to the Bosnian government. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian president, who yesterday met United Nations officials in New York, has repeatedly insisted that peace talks cannot restart unless the Croats guarantee the Moslems access to the Adriatic. Mr Tudjman's statement came amid signs that US officials were seeking to step up the pressure on both the Serbs and Croats to make fresh territorial concessions. In an apparent attempt to force Serb leaders to be more flexible, the west has moved to stop sanctions busting along Serbia's southern border, it emerged yesterday. The former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, apparently prompted by the US, announced that it had stopped illegal commercial traffic between the two states. Meanwhile, as Moslem and Croat forces continued to jostle for land in central Bosnia, UN officials warned that another humanitarian crisis was developing in the central Bosnian town of Jablanica. In the last week up to 10,000 Moslem refugees had arrived in the small mountain town, which has been cut off from aid convoys by fighting between Moslem and Croat forces, according to Mr Ray Wilkinson, a UN spokesman in Sarajevo. The majority of the refugees appeared to be victims of Croat 'ethnic cleansing', although 450 men had also apparently come from Croat detention camps, Mr Wilkinson said.</p>

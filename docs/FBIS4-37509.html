I have noticed the full support for the Yemeni  people, and that the Algerian people are following the  development of the situation in Yemen.    I would like to reassure our brothers in Algeria, who have  supported the Yemeni revolution and everything else in the  interests of the Yemeni and pan-Arab causes, that events in  Yemen, which are regrettable, are within the framework of  protecting Yemeni unity and the Yemeni people's national gains.    The Yemeni people are determined to endure any sacrifice to  protect unity and achieve victory, and are determined to respond  positively to any effort which falls within the framework of the  sacrosanct national principles of the Yemeni people.

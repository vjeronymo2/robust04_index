			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> TRAVEL IS BROADENING FOR OCC STUDENTS  </P> <P> A group of Orange Coast College students who took part in the school's first  "semester abroad" program have learned there's a world of difference between  Costa Mesa and Costa Rica. But it was these contrasts -- particularly the  environment and language -- that led to the creation of the program in Central  America.  </P> <P> Botany and ecology professor John Lenanton and Spanish professor Susana Salessi  put together the 15-week study program after a 1988 visit to the college by  Carlos Rivera, a Costa Rican government official. The teachers were attracted  by Costa Rica's stable politics and educational opportunities.  </P> <P> "There is not another place that can compete with Costa Rica with regard to  diversity of habitat," Lenanton said.  </P> <P> Students were attracted by the opportunity to live in another country.  </P> <P> "I was always interested in the environment and I wanted to learn a language in  a neutral country that has good relations with the United States," student  Julie Rona said.  </P> <P> The Orange Coast College group arrived in Costa Rica in January. Classes have  been held at the Institututo Centroamericano de Asuntos Internacionales -- the  Central American Institute for International Affairs -- in San Jose. The  institute provided classrooms and a political science instructor, organized  field trips and coordinated housing for students with Costa Rican families.  </P> <P> The course has taken students to Costa Rica's two coastlines, to the volcanic  mountain range that separates them and into three distinct tropical forest  environments.  </P> <P> There have also been trips to museums, Latin dance clubs, the Legislature and  the theater.

Security Council resolutions, President Nursultan Nazarbayev of  Kazakhstan said here on Friday after his talks with President  Francois Mitterrand. The Kazakh leader made a brief stopover  here on his way from New York to Almaty.    Addressing journalists after being received in the Elysee  Palace, Nazarbayev pointed out that his arrival in Paris  coincided with a "critical phase" of the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. "Each side should adhere to U.N. Security  Council resolutions. If the resolutions are implemented, we  will get every chance to arrive at a peaceful solution to the  conflict," he emphasised.    Nazarbayev told journalists about the contents of his talks  with President Mitterrand, pointing out that they considered a  wide range of international problems, the state of affairs in  Central Asia and CIS countries, in particular.    The president of Kazakhstan said "there were no divergences  of opinion" during the talks. He said Franco-Kazakh cooperation  develops in the proper direction, which is indicative of "a  further strenghtening of friendly contacts between Kazakhstan  and France." By way of example, Nazarbayev cited contracts  concluded between the Kazakhstan Government and such large  French companies as Elf Aquitaine, Total, Citroen, and Cogema.    "President Mitterrand and I agreed to give a boost to the  functioning of the mixed economic commission set up by the  governments of our two countries," Nazarbayev said, adding that  the first priority task of Almaty is to strengthen bilateral  cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises.    After talks in the Elysee Palace, the president of  Kazakhsatn  left by air for home.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE ONE-BEDROOM UNITS SOUGHT;  </P> <P> QUALITY OF LIFE A CONCERN IN APARTMENT LIMITS  </P> <P> When city planners wrote the new zoning ordinance that the Glendale Planning  Commission considered this week, they had two goals in mind -- reducing the  density of new apartments and making them more attractive.  </P> <P> The new ordinance would force developers to build shorter apartment and  condominium buildings that sit farther back from the street and would blend in  better with Glendale neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The buildings would be smaller and have more one-bedroom apartments and more  parking spaces. And developers of structures with more than 24 units would have  to install swimming pools, laundry facilities and landscaping or pay special  fees to the city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Giant Cubes'  </P> <P> The revamped zoning ordinance is meant to curtail the construction of large  apartment buildings with four- or five-bedroom units that Councilwoman Ginger  Bremberg likened to "giant cubes" because of their boxiness.  </P> <P> Often, these buildings take up as much space as possible, consuming most of the  grounds that otherwise could be landscaped.  </P> <P> "It's the trend," developer Berdj Karapetian said. "More developers are  building and more people are buying large apartments."  </P> <P> The heart of the new ordinance will attempt to reverse that trend by reducing  the bulk and scale of future projects.  </P> <P> "The staff proposal would encourage the development of more modest-size  dwelling units, including one-bedroom apartments, which are currently not being  proposed by the development community," Planning Director John McKenna said.  </P> <P> City planners are also seeking ways to cushion the impact of Glendale's  continued population growth. One of the ways is to require more space between  buildings. Another is to require deeper building setbacks from the streets. The  proposed ordinance would do both.  </P> <P> The number of parking spaces required would increase to a minimum of two per  unit. Developers would no longer be permitted to fulfill parking requirements  with compact car-sized spaces substituting for full-sized spaces.  </P> <P> Also, the new ordinance would treat each level of a partially underground  parking garage as a full story, a change aimed at lowering the overall height  of new buildings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Increase Building Costs  </P> <P> Finally, the ordinance would add a number of features that could upgrade the  occupants' quality of life and would certainly make it more costly to build  apartments in Glendale.  </P> <P> All new buildings with more than three units would have to be equipped with  spas, for example. Structures with more than 24 units would have to include  swimming pools. If builders do not wish to build the pools, they may pay fees  to the city instead.  </P> <P> Elevators would be required for apartments three stories or taller. Landscaped  outdoor space would be required, as would laundry facilities.  </P></p>

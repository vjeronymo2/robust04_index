			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Jeszenszky stated that  representatives of the Hungarians of Slovakia and Romania must  also be involved in the preparatory discussions of the Paris  conference on stability in Europe. His comments came at his  address to the conference.    Jeszenszky said: the Hungarian delegation will be  formulating  a separate opinion in the form of an explanatory declaration,  which will call attention to the fact that the three million  Hungarians living outside Hungary are not represented by anyone  at the Paris talks.</p>

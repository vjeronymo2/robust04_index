ADD is seeking disability and other grassroots organizations, minority coalitions, civil rights and other private non-profit organizations experienced in working with culturally diverse communities to develop successful collaborative models for supporting the ability of minorities with developmental disabilities to exercise greater choice and self-determination by engaging in leadership activities in their communities. Such leadership activities at a minimum should provide them the needed knowledge, skills and confidence to access services and other supports available to them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

But Kansas (16-0) responded with 12 consecutive points and took the lead  for good, 82-81, on a pair of free throws by Jeff Gueldner with five minutes  remaining.  </P> <P> The Cornhuskers didn't fold when Kansas got back into the game, forcing ties,  at 83-83 and 85-85, but went cold down the stretch, missing the front end of  three free throw situations. Kansas stayed ahead by making 11 of 12 foul shots  in the final three minutes.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, the Jayhawks moved into the No. 1 spot in the Associated  Press poll for the first time since Wilt Chamberlain's sophomore season,  1956-57.  </P> <P> Kevin Pritchard scored 22 points, 18 in the second half, and Rick Calloway  added 21, including 15 in the final 20 minutes for Kansas.  </P> <P> Gueldner finished with 15 for Kansas; Pekka Markkanen added 14 and Freeman West  13.  </P> <P> The Jayhawks won at Nebraska for the first time since 1985.

The Wolverines (10-2, 0-1) had won  10 consecutive games.  </P> <P> Mike Griffin's basket gave Michigan a 64-52 lead with 7:58 remaining before the  Hoosiers began their run.  </P> <P> A three-point shot by Jones, who scored 20 points, brought Indiana within 64-61  with 6:36 left, and the Hoosiers finished the run with eight consecutive free  throws. Indiana, which trailed, 33-13, took the lead for the first time, 65-64,  on two free throws by Calbert Cheaney with 2:21 left.  </P> <P> Two free throws by Greg Graham gave Indiana a 67-64 edge with 1:01 left and  Jones made it 69-64 with 40 seconds left.  </P> <P> No. 2 Georgetown 87, Pittsburgh 71 -- Mark Tillmon scored 29 points at  Pittsburgh to lead the Hoyas to their 12th consecutive victory.  </P> <P> Tillmon, who scored 39 points in Georgetown's 93-91 victory over Providence on  Saturday, had 20 in the first half for the Hoyas (12-0, 3-0).  </P> <P> The Panthers (5-8, 0-3), who lost their fourth consecutive game, had 22 points  from Bobby Martin.  </P> <P> No. 14 Louisiana State 111, Tennessee 94 -- Chris Jackson scored 33 points and  led a 14-2 run midway through the second half that powered the Tigers in a  Southeastern Conference game at Baton Rouge, La.  </P> <P> Tennessee (8-5, 3-1), which trailed twice by 10 points in the first half,  scored nine consecutive points to close the half and took the lead on a  three-point basket by Ron Taylor to open the second half.  </P> <P> LSU (9-2, 2-1) had a 71-69 lead when Jackson scored five points as the Tigers  pulled away.  </P> <P> No. 25 Xavier 89, Chicago Loyola 73 -- Michael Davenport scored 26 points at  Cincinnati to lead the Musketeers to their 10th consecutive victory in a  Midwestern Conference game.  </P> <P> Xavier trailed by a point at halftime but went on a 24-12 run to start the  second half.  </P> <P> Florida State 104, Jacksonville 99 -- Irv Thomas scored five of his 27 points  in the second overtime and and finished with 17 rebounds to lead the Seminoles  at Tallahassee, Fla.  </P> <P> Florida State (11-4) never led during regulation play and forced the first  overtime on Ron Miller's layup with 42 seconds left, tying the game, 85-85.  </P> <P> Florida State played both overtimes without scoring leader Tharon Mayes, who  fouled out with four seconds left in regulation.  </P></p>

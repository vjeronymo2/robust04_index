			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Puerto Ricans speak out against Clinton tax plan PUERTO RICO'S government has attacked tax changes proposed by US President Bill Clinton which it says will damage the island's economy. The US administration has proposed that section 936 of the internal revenue code, which has led many companies to set up factories on the island, be changed as part of efforts to cut the federal deficit. The administration of the US Caribbean possession, which had earlier appeared willing to consider Mr Clinton's proposals, began signalling a policy switch last week amid mounting fears of economic dislocation resulting from the changes, which could lead to disinvestment and increased social and political problems. 'Puerto Rico stands to lose 30,000 jobs if the Clinton proposal is implemented,' said Mr Baltazar Corrada del Rio, the island's secretary of state. 'This means that unemployment, now 18 per cent, will increase to 21 per cent.' The Puerto Rican government has begun seeking the support of Caribbean neighbours to argue in Washington against changes to the revenue code; it claims Mr Clinton's proposals will affect a programme under which Puerto Rico has pledged to lend Caribbean countries about Dollars 100m (Pounds 64.9m) a year. Section 936 of the US tax code allows federal tax exemption to Puerto Rican subsidiaries of US companies. Profits from these subsidiaries are deposited in Puerto Rican banks. The deposits, totalling about Dollars 15bn, are central to the island's financial stability. US government officials say section 936 costs the Treasury Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn a year. Mr Clinton is proposing to change the tax break to a 60 per cent wage credit, in an attempt to raise Dollars 7bn for the Treasury over five years. 'All this means is that there will be more dependence on federal aid, such as food stamps, and more pressure for migration to the mainland. The Clinton proposal for Puerto Rico is the reverse of his policy for the rest of the US,' Mr Corrada del Rio said. Puerto Rico's neighbours will be quick to argue against the Clinton plan. Previous administrations on the island have committed Dollars 100m a year of the section 936 deposits for low-interest loans for business projects in Caribbean Basin countries. Since 1985, neighbours have received Dollars 650m in loans under the scheme.</p>

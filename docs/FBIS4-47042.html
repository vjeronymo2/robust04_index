			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Osochnikov: "Provincial Games?"] </F>   [Text] Judging from the aggressiveness with which Deputy  Mayor Vitaliy Mutko, at a news conference in the staff  headquarters of the organizing committee of the Goodwill Games  yesterday, discussed his trip to Moscow and the negotiations  held in the government of Russia, he was not very satisfied with  the results of his trip. And no wonder.    As it turned out, the top brass regard the Games as a kind  caprice of the St. Petersburg authorities.    This pertains to several ministries, for example, the  Ministry of Communications, which under the aegis of the Games  is trying to run telephone lines through almost all of Russia,  leaving St. Petersburg with only part of the funds allotted for  solving this problem. And the departments responsible for  providing for the security of the guests and participants in the  Games are not much better. Thus the Ministry of Internal Affairs  is trying to shift the entire burden of the financial costs for  placing and keeping its additional contingent in St. Petersburg  onto the city budget. This will amount to R46 billion and could  never be covered by the funds already allotted by Russia, all of  which have been used to revamp the sports facilities for the  Games.    In Vitaliy Mutko's opinion, such an attitude toward the  forthcoming sports forum on the part of Russian power structures  must be overcome. And it is possible that this will be done in  the next few days, since the government commission will arrive  in St. Petersburg today. It will clarify the real costs to the  city for preparing for the Games, which will place on the  federal budget the costs it should rightfully bear. Perhaps the  last "i" in the discussions of the question of who should pay  for what will be dotted this weekend during the visit to St.  Petersburg of Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, who is  responsible in the Government of Russia for preparing for the  Goodwill Games.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sian Clare, Ian Graham, Chris Parkin, Alison Little, PA </F> News]    [Text] A referendum would be held in Northern Ireland to  discover the views of the people over their future, the British  Government said today.    In response to 20 questions posed by Sinn Fein on the  Downing  Street peace declaration, the Northern Ireland Office issued a  statement saying the wishes of the greater number of people in  Ulster would be determined in a special poll.    The Government also drove home its message to the terrorists  to give up violence.    The statement bluntly told Sinn Fein to stop "playing for  time" and that democracy and violence cannot be reconciled.    The Government regards only one of the 20 questions put by  Sinn Fein as involving an explanation of the text of the Joint  Declaration.    In the declaration, the Government had said they would  "uphold the democratic wishes of a greater number of the people  of Northern Ireland."    Sinn Fein challenges the Government over the precise  definition of this phrase and asks how it would be measured in  practical terms.    The Government's comment is: "The wish of a greater number  of  the people of Northern Ireland would be determined by a  numerical majority of those validly voting in a poll fairly and  explicitly organised for this purpose.    "Provision for such a poll is made in Section 1 of the  Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973."    In comments on the other questions, the Government  frequently  refers Sinn Fein to the text of the Joint Declaration, quoting  large chunks.    At the end, the Government poses its own question for Sinn  Fein, urging them to renounce violence in accordance with the  wishes of the people of Northern Ireland.    "Democracy and violence cannot be reconciled. Sinn Fein must  choose. They know what they have to do if they are effectively  to fulfil their democratic mandate.    "The democratic path leads to a meaningful role in the  political process: a process in which, as has been explained,  all issues are open for discussion and negotiation.    "The alternative is isolation -- standing on the outside  while those committed to democracy shape the agreement,  structures and institutions that will determine the  relationships between the peoples of these islands."    The Government says the majority of people in Ireland want  an  end to violence now.    "Their wishes could not be clearer. There is no conceivable  justification for continuing to rob people of their lives, least  of all a call for a textual explanation of the Joint  Declaration," the statement says.    "Sinn Fein asks what comes next. Certainly no further  playing for time," it warns.    Sinn Fein's questions were sent to the Northern Ireland  Office through the Irish Government.    Final agreement on the British Government's response was  reached at a Cabinet sub-committee meeting today.    Elsewhere in its commentary on the questions, the Government  makes clear that acceptance of the Joint Declaration is not a  precondition for entering the talks process.    "What is required is a permanent end to the use of, or  support of, paramilitary violence," the statement says.    The British Government says it "accepts the validity of all  electoral mandates, including that of Sinn Fein."    It runs through what would happen if Sinn Fein and the IRA  renounced violence, saying exploratory talks would take place  after a three-month lapse.    These talks would explore the basis on which Sinn Fein would  be admitted to the peace process but without anticipating the  negotiations within that process.    There would also be an exchange of views on how Sinn Fein  would be able eventually to play the same part in the public  life of Northern Ireland as current constitutional parties.    The talks would examine the practical consequences of the  ending of violence.    The statement also makes clear: "A lasting and general peace  would render military operations in support of the police no  longer necessary."    Sinn Fein said tonight that they would examine the answers  they had received to see if they provided the clarification they  required.    Mitchel McLaughlin, Sinn Fein party chairman, said: "Clarity  on the issues we have identified is in everyone's interest and  is crucial to the development of a viable peace process.    "The response from the British Government can only assist in  the development of such a peace process if it provides direct,  unambiguous and comprehensive answers to the 20 questions we  have asked."    He added: "We will therefore be examining the British  response to see if it provides the clarification which we  require to make a properly informed assessment of the Downing  Street Declaration."    Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams was today on the first of a  five-day trip to Italy. Sinn Fein said it would be faxing a  copy of the response to him.    It was thought unlikely he would make an off-the-cuff reply  before returning to Northern Ireland next week for consultations  with party leaders.    In its response the Government tells Sinn Fein that no  organisation has a veto over the peace process "whether by  withdrawing from it or by refusing to renounce violence."    It adds: "An end to violence would open the way for a  comprehensive reassessment of existing provisions against  terrorism, many of which would become irrelevant and obsolete in  a climate of peace."    Sinn Fein's questions probe a wide range of issues  surrounding the Joint Declaration, many of which the Government  responds to merely by quoting the document's text.    Only one of the 20 questions submitted to the Government by  Sinn Fein was genuinely seeking clarification of the Downing  Street declaration, Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew  indicated tonight.    He said: "The rest of them are invitations to negotiate. We  are not going to negotiate. That is made very clear."    Sir Patrick said on the BBC Six O'Clock News before the  Government had published the questions and its commentary on  them: "We are facing something of great seriousness. We are  facing the continuance of violence for political purposes."    He insisted that the future of Northern Ireland would be  decided "by consent and democracy and not by violence or  coercion."</p>

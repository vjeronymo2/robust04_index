			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Books: Country life, French style - Fiction DAUGHTERS OF THE HOUSE by Michele Roberts Virago Pounds 14.99, 172 pages 'THE WAR was a sort of bookmark which divided the pages of history': Daughters of the House is full of solid imagery like that. Each of the 50 chapters is named after an object: 'The Sofa', 'The Red Suitcase', 'The Fish-kettle', 'The Chandelier', 'The Green Scarf'. Its descriptions are so vivid that you know the way around house and village; you know colours, textures, tastes and smells, the sensuous surface of everything, and the wider atmospheric effects of weather and light. Michele Roberts has been compared with Colette and in minuteness and immediacy, yes, there is something in it; also in the fact that the setting of this novel recalls Colette's world: nature in general and French country life in particular. So far so good, and very good this side of it is. In a prosperous farmer's household in Normandy an odd mixture of relatives and relationships makes for tensions, disloyalties, passionate affections and lies. Across the fields is the village with its peasants and shopkeepers and its sinister, time-serving cure. Leonie and Therese are first cousins, Leonie half-English but ending up the virtual owner of house and farm because Therese enters the convent of an enclosed order, thus vanishing for 20 years. When she suddenly comes out it is clear that something must give way, since Leonie is passionately attached to her way of life and possessions and if a claimant as good as Therese turns up her claim to them seems doubtful. The story is not just, or even mainly, about possessions, though: more about the unravelling of ancient secrets, about rancour left over from the years of German occupation and the jealous scratching of personalities across nearly 40 years. As the novel is short and the plot labyrinthine, there seems rather too much crammed in, with the final surprise abrupt and a good deal of the rest unexplained or inexplicable. Until quite far into it, who is exactly who is hard to be sure of, or what is fact and what conjecture, accusation or subjective judgment - things being understandably bizarre and bitter in the post-war years of an occupied country. What is best about the novel is its snappy, highly readable style and its moments of acute insight, of strange, original intuitions, as when Leonie, crossing the Channel, lives through the transformation of England into France in terms of language. Or when the two girls, so closely linked yet so inimical, play out their fantasies in bloodthirsty games of medicine or martyrdom. The pointilliste technique that looks so simple (very short sentences, minimal complexity of syntax, jabs of colour, cumulative small effects) lends itself particularly well to these powerful thrusts of the irrational. On straightforward plotting and narrative it is less effective, condensed to the point of confusion and with a crime-story technique of cues, hints and red herrings that often leaves one puzzled rather than curious. What happened in the cellar when Antoinette lost her show? What happens to Therese in the final fire? Above all, what are those visions about demonic possession or celestial visitation: hysteria or holiness, both or neither? The overlap between dream and reality, supposition and fantasy and the facts of the case, is often too great. If the physical world is perfectly portrayed, every leaf in place, every scent recognisable, the everyday world of actual happenings and credible characters is much more weakly handled. Despite this it makes an attractive appearance in the Booker short list, an accessible and intelligent good read where good reads are sometimes scarce. A final point which adds piquancy is that Therese's surname is Martin, which was that of St Therese of Lisieux, the Carmelite nun whose autobiography has gone round the world since she died nearly a century ago, aged 24. Michele Roberts never reveals this, as it were, double billing, though there are hints for those in the know - the jacket with its portrait of St Therese, the acknowledgement to her Histoire d'une Ame in the Author's Note, the fact that the fictional Therese has written her own autobiography with the same title, and that her father has a habit of calling her his 'little flower'.</p>

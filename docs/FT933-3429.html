			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Observer: Corporate convictions The prominent City members of the Cadbury committee appear to have placed greater emphasis on honing their corporate responsibility skills than on exercising the profit motive. For although the report of the committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance, chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury and published in December last year, has become an unexpected best-seller, with nearly 7,000 copies flogged to date at Pounds 10 a go, the committee does not stand to benefit. And that robust sales figure comes on top of the 5,000-odd copies which Cadbury required to be sent free to companies and accountancy firms. Sales of the report should have generated a tidy sum for Gee, part of Professional Publishing, which printed the report. However, Gee will be the only beneficiary, as the committee signed away to the publishers all its rights to sale proceeds, royalties and reproduction fees from other publishers. The committee should have known better. Its draft report, issued last July and distributed for free to encourage comments, was so popular it had to send out 13,500 copies, footing the printing and postage bill itself. Having relinquished the opportunity of making some money from its activities, the Cadbury committee will now have to rely on continued sponsorship from sympathetic organisations and businesses if it is to fulfil its plans for future work.</p>

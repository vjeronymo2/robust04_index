			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 11, IRNA -- President Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani in his inaugural address to the Second  Congress of Construction Jihad here today said the country was  on the road to progress and despite the existing bottlenecks the  economic situation was in "complete natural gear."    He said Iran possesses machineries, industrial raw materials  and energy sources, which fact should make the path of the  second 5-year development smoother.    The Iranian economy was in a better position today than five  years ago, he added.    On the fuel problem in the country, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said  Iran would face no problem in this connection since its natural  gas production of 120 to 130 million cubic meters per day  exceeds its domestic demand of only 80 million cubic meters.    He appreciated the efforts of construction jihad workers and  reiterated the importance of training and research for the  country's reconstruction.</p>

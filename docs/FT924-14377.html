			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Inflation remains at 3.6% HEADLINE INFLATION was unchanged last month, but the underlying rate dropped within the upper limit of the Treasury's new target range. Official figures yesterday showed that the retail prices index rose by 3.6 per cent in the year to September, unchanged on the previous month. Although this disappointed City expectations of a drop to 3.5 per cent, the underlying measure - which excludes mortgage interest payments - fell to 4 per cent, its lowest level since March 1988. Earlier this week, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced a target of between 1 and 4 per cent for Britain's underlying inflation rate. Sluggish economic conditions mean this rate is likely to continue falling for at least another year. The disinflationary momentum of the economy was further highlighted by news that house prices fell on average by a record 3.1 per cent last month. Halifax building society, which released the figures, said this was the third consecutive monthly drop and the biggest since it began publishing an index in 1983.

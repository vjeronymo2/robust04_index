According to the document, on all matters of their activity  legislators must be "received without delay by state and local  administration officials and by factory and office managers."  They can demand that "any violations of the law, rights,  freedoms, and legitimate interests of citizens be eliminated,  and that the officials to whom a lawmaker's demand is addressed  immediately adopt appropriate actions."    A lawmaker's monthly salary will be 90% of what a  federal  minister is paid. The Speaker receives 40% above his  salary  for chairmanship, and his deputies, committee chairmen and other  senior Duma officials receive 25% on top of their wages. A  bonus for "intensive" work done will amount to 50% of a  legislator's salary. Veterans are entitled to a 40%  increase to  their pay.    Cabinet members working in the Duma get nothing for their  parliamentary duties.    Legislators are entitled to free travel across Russia by  plane, train, car, or ship and on all means of public  transportation, except taxis.    A lawmaker should mail letters and telegrams as government  reports.    A Duma member without permanent housing in Moscow gets  within  3 months an apartment for residence with his family during his  time in office. The flat is not subject to privatization.    A parliamentarian receives a diplomatic passport to be valid  for his entire term in the Duma.    According to the document, if the Duma is dissolved, its  members receive allowances for the period before their powers  expire, based on their monthly salaries.    Lawmakers will be allowed to transport property to the place  of their permanent residence free (containers of up to 10 tons).    A legislator can have three assistants, one of them to help  him in parliament, the others -- in his constituency. The  assistants have monthly salaries as well.</p>

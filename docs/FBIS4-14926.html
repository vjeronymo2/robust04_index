			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Serhiy Osyka, Ukrainian deputy minister for </F> external economic relations, by Volodymyr Skachko; place and  date not given: "Ukraine and the International Market: How To  Build Bridges" -- first paragraph is HOLOS UKRAYINY  introduction published in italics; questions published in  boldface]    [Text] Since the time when Ukraine was proclaimed an  independent state and immediately recognized as such by Western  states, the first delights caused by these events should have  been replaced by more day-to-day concerns. However, it should  be admitted that these problems have not diminished since then,  but, as it seems, have only been aggravated. Nonetheless,  according to competent people, possibilities for the  normalization of Ukraine's external economic relations have not  yet been exhausted. We have asked Serhiy Osyka, Ukraine's  deputy minister for external economic relations, to tell us  about current economic relations between Ukraine and the West.    [Osyka] Let us look at things objectively -- many problems  facing Ukraine's gaining a strong foothold in Western markets  are caused not by economic factors, but by political ones.    I will give only one example, but an exponential one. If one  were to analyze the course of events connected with the problem  of assets and liabilities of the former Soviet Union, one may  discern an essential unbalance between Western countries'  positions on this issue.    This past year's decision by the Paris Club to defer the  debts of the former USSR, in general, took into account only  Russia's interests. The point is that the assets of the former  USSR are still working only for Russia. However, these assets  belonged formerly to all republics of the Union, including  Ukraine. To assess more clearly how this affects our state  interests, let us recall that these assets include the debt  obligations of many countries of the former USSR (amounting to  almost $100 billion), which may be used as stocks and bonds on  international share markets; they also include a great deal of  immovable property abroad, as well as know-how and technology,  primarily in the branch of precision machine building; lastly,  they include trademarks and brands, which bring in many millions  [currency not specified] in income.    A few more concrete examples.    As a result of Ukraine's undergoing the routine of controls  over space technologies, according to many politicians, the  situation has become inequitable. A package of Russian  agreements related to the joining of an international space  program are being implemented to a large extent (practically 80  percent) by Ukrainian industry. First of all, these are such  systems as "Zenith" and "Tsyklon," which are being produced in  Ukraine.    The second example: The Plodimport foreign trade association  of the former USSR has automatically become Russia's foreign  trade association. However, at one time in the past, the  Plodimport production association sold the exclusive rights to  use its trademark to the Pepsico company for a period of 20  years. This is an asset, too.    Stolichnaya vodka has been produced with the significant  participation of Ukrainian enterprises. Its trademark is one of  the assets of the former USSR, as well. By now, this trademark  is used by Russia only -- this means that we are cut off from  this particular export market. However, annual profits for this  export are measured in the billions.    One more example: In 1992, President Yeltsin authorized  sales of the Topaz-2 satellite system. The world was astonished  by both this resolution and the ridiculously low asking price.  Notwithstanding the fact that all the enterprises of the Topaz  association are located in Ukraine, the Paris Club regarded  their production as an asset of the former USSR. In this way,  Ukraine is being cut off from markets which provide profits of  many billions for goods and technology produced by generations  of Ukrainian citizens.    These are very essential limitations placed on the markets,  from which Ukraine could draw money for its own work, instead of  resolving its financial problems solely by means of credit.    Thus, as you see, the worsening of the country's internal  situation is connected with rather essential international  factors, even though I do not exclude such reasons for our  crisis as our legislative mistakes and many other problems which  have been widely reported. However, without overcoming these  negative external political factors, no resolute actions by the  government and no new laws, on their own, will help us resolve  this heap of problems.    [Skachko] Serhiy Hryhorovych, these reasons, of which you  has just spoken, cannot be easily managed. However, there are  various internal problems in Ukraine, which are connected with  exports and imports, are there not?    [Osyka] One of the principal factors influencing the  financial sphere and the stability of hard currency exchange  rates is the following: The export capacity [eksportoyemnost]  of Ukrainian industry and economy is much lower than our import  capacity. Up to 1991, as you know, this problem was resolved at  the expense of the USSR's export capacity.    Our exports today are only a part of Ukraine's full export  potential. They are practically incapable of securing our need  for hard currency to upkeep the stable exchange rate of our  currency; in addition, they secure our import needs only to the  lowest degree, even in their most vital part. Ukraine's  traditional exports are ferrous metals, chemical products,  textile fabrics, and certain other goods. However, these very  exports are faced with a sharp increase in production costs,  which brings practically to naught the hard currency  profitability of these products.    For instance, fertilizer. The production of one tonne of  carbimide or ammonia requires about one tonne of gas. Gas is  priced at least at $65-70 per tonne, while carbimide is sold,  depending on the season, at $75-100 per tonne. It is quite  obvious that this product is becoming unprofitable. At the very  best, output can be equal to input. Taking into account the  energy-consuming production of metals (gas and coke are also  involved), we see that the picture is much the same.    Many products of the machine-building industry, especially  new technologies as well as many products connected with  machine-building services and installations, either are not  allowed to enter external markets due to political reasons, or  are again being considered as part of the former USSR assets.    It should be no surprise to you that innumerable Ukrainian  enterprises had been included in the closed production and  technology cycles of the USSR. What was a production  cooperative earlier, now must be restored by Ukraine on trade  basis. It is, mind you, trade with imports.    The consequence of all these factors is very simple: The  export capacity, which is much lower that the import capacity,  implies a hard-currency deficit. Due to such a situation --  regardless of whether mechanisms for regulating currency  exchange rates include the policy of stock exchange sales -- the  demand for hard currency always surpasses supply. This  difficult situation makes it impossible to maintain a stable  exchange rate by traditional methods (for instance, by National  Bank interventions). We need a stabilization fund exceeding the  demand for hard currency in a traditional situation to make use  of Ukraine's full economic potential. Due to this situation, it  is vitally important that we resolve a number of political and  legal problems, in other words, to create a new legal area for  the activity of Ukrainian entrepreneurs. Believe me, we are not  sitting idly by.    One of the principal directions is our active movement  toward  joining the GATT. Professionals, who are working on this  endeavor (I am one of the heads of this group), assess the  situation realistically.    [Skachko] Serhiy Hryhorovych, you headed Ukraine's  delegation to last year's GATT talks. What were the results of  those talks?    [Osyka] At that meeting, the GATT Council of Representatives  approved a resolution on the creation of a working group for  preparing a memorandum on Ukraine's joining GATT. Work on this  document is still continuing. What kind of document is it?  First of all, it is a detailed description of Ukraine's  legislation connected directly or indirectly with various forms  of foreign economic activity; in the first place, it is related  to issues of foreign trade, administrative stages, custom  duties, and tariffs. This is not simply a description of our  laws; the memorandum is to include not only legislative bases,  but also sublegislative [pidzakonny], departmental acts which  constitute four-fifths of our legislative foundation. However,  it is not all, either. The GATT document is to include a  detailed analysis of the legislative situation in general, as  well as, if necessary, additional explanations from individual  points of view.    We are asking GATT to grant us preferential status [rezhym],  that is, the status of a country with a transforming economy.  The memorandum is to supply the foundation underlaying a GATT  resolution on our country. In fact, regardless of the talks on  joining GATT, work on the memorandum is a good opportunity for  ourselves to become familiar with the particulars of the  law-governed state which we have today. Ukraine's second step  toward joining GATT is in bringing its legislation in line with  world standards, even if only to a minimal degree. It is a  necessary condition for us to be equal trading partners with the  world. There is a great mass of legislative work which must be  carried out on a highly professional level. I would like to  believe that a new parliament will include professionals who  will be up to this task.</p>

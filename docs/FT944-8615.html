			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking triggers small setback in equities - Market Report London's equity market ran into the expected bout of profit-taking yesterday, but was also slightly unnerved by an uncertain showing from gilt-edged securities and a general round of weakness across international markets. The weakness across European markets spread to Wall Street, which opened on a lacklustre note and continued to lose ground after London closed, when it was showing a fall of 24 points on the Dow Industrial Average. The FT-SE 100-share Index finished another lively session 19.0 lower at 3,127.5. The second line issues were much quieter and more resilient than the leaders, with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index settling a net 6.2 down at 3,576.6. Dealers described yesterday's action as a 'consolidation' rather than a poor performance, pointing out that the FT-SE 100 had risen more than 70 points since the start of the week and in the face of a steep rise in US interest rates. 'Although there was a flurry of selling in the late afternoon, it never felt as if the market was going to crack on the downside,' said one leading trader. He added that the London market would probably continue its consolidation phase today but that short term the outlook remained positive. 'I feel we will make good progress next week and we could well test the 3,200 level,' he said, although he noted the strong resistance in the market as the Footsie moved above 3,155 on Wednesday. That view was mirrored elsewhere. A technical analyst at one of the big UK integrated houses pointed out that volumes in futures trading on the two sharply advancing days this week were more than twice the level of yesterday, indicating that the momentum factor was strongly on the upside. The FT-SE 100 opened marginally easier and made a half-hearted attempt to go better, reflecting Wall Street's resolute performance overnight. The move quickly ran out of steam, however, and share prices slipped away as news of stagnant retail sales in October, confirming similar evidence from last Monday's Confederation of British Industry survey, filtered into the market. Analysts said sentiment had been additionally affected by the latest political unrest in the government which resulted in the prime minister threatening to call a general election unless the Euro rebels in the Tory party came to heel. Thereafter there was virtually no respite for the market, with prices drifting back, ignoring intermittent bouts of support, and then moving decisively lower as US markets lost ground. The dollar was seen as the main cause of the weakness on Wall Street, falling sharply in spite of another batch of economic data pointing to deflationary pressures in the US. The fall in US housing starts and a surprising decline in the Philadelphia Federal Board index bemused analysts. Turnover yesterday was well down from the buoyant levels of Tuesday and Wednesday, reaching 702.6m shares, with non-FT-SE stocks making up a high 65 per cent of that total. The 702m was inflated, however, by a long list of bed and breakfast, or tax-related, deals, which accounted for turnover of well above 60m shares, or getting on for 10 per cent of the total. The merchant banks with big market operations were among the best performers yesterday. SG Warburg, the UK's flagship investment bank, raced higher again, but closed well off the day's top as dealers said the rise was more a reflection of the break-up value of the bank and a strong push by one leading broker, rather than any substantial takeover rumours. Builders merchants were the market's biggest casualties as Meyer International caused widespread gloom in refusing to increase its interim payment and preaching caution on second-half prospects.</p>

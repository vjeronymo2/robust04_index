			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Brent Intl pay-out cut after fall to Pounds 7.14m Brent International, the troubled speciality chemicals group whose chief executive resigned in August, is cutting its dividend after pre-tax profits slumped from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 7.14m in 1993. Profits for the year to December 31 were struck after Pounds 289,000 of compensation to former chief executive Mr Steve Cuthbert, who had a two and a half year contract at a salary of Pounds 135,000. Mr Keith Hutchings, the former finance director who has been acting chief executive since his departure, said the scale of compensation reflected the fact that Mr Cuthbert was over 50. Exceptionals of Pounds 3.91m included Pounds 580,000 of costs relating to acquisitions which were aborted early in the year when the scale of the group's problems became clear. Earnings per share dropped from 10p to just 3.2p. There was a reduced final of 2.4p (5.8p) leaving a total of 4p (7.4p). The profit figure includes gains of Pounds 6.76m on the disposal of businesses. Sales from continuing operations rose 5 per cent to Pounds 114m. Excluding exceptionals, operating profits in the continuing businesses fell from Pounds 9.3m to Pounds 6m. The company said there had been some improvement in the UK and US but not in continental Europe which accounts for 43 per cent of sales. However, Lord Lane of Horsell, chairman, said, 'the lower cost base from which we now operate should enable us to make further progress in 1994.' Mr Hutchings was yesterday confirmed as chief executive, with Mr Bill Jessup, former finance director of Beauford, the struggling engineering group, replacing him as finance director. Lord Lane will retire next year and be succeeded as chairman by Mr Alec Daly, who joined the board a year ago. The shares fell 15 1/2 p to 105p.</p>

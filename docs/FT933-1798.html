			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Privatising British Coal STATE-OWNERSHIP of Britain's coal industry has been a dismal business. For much of the period since nationalisation in 1946, British Coal has become a byword for strikes, poor investment and anachronistic working practices. Taxpayers and electricity consumers should therefore heave a sigh of relief that the government is finally pressing ahead with privatising the industry with a sale planned next year. Privatisation is also the industry's best chance of surviving in the long run. British Coal's high costs relative to imported coal and other sources of energy have contributed to a sharp decline in its market, with the result that the company is now dying on its feet. An industry which had 1,500 pits and employed three quarters of a million people on nationalisation is now down to 30 pits and 33,000 employees. When privatised, it will have shrunk again to perhaps half its current size. Any hope for stemming yet further decline rests on improving productivity on a scale faster than state-owned British Coal has been able to achieve. Ministers have adopted a flexible approach to determine the structure of a privatised industry. Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, announced yesterday that pits would be offered for sale in five regional packages but that groups would be able to bid for any number of packages. This approach will allow the market to decide the industry's structure and the government to realise the highest value for public assets. Slash overheads Another benefit is that lively entrepreneurs, for whom the whole of British Coal might have been too much to swallow, will be able to take part. Management and employee teams will also be able to propose buy-outs. Such talent may be just what the coal industry needs. Those who risk their own money will have the greatest incentive to slash overheads, devise more efficient working practices and seek out new markets. Leaving the market to decide structure also neatly sidesteps conflicting competition arguments over whether the industry should be broken up prior to privatisation. One view, influenced by the problems that resulted from privatising British Gas and British Telecommunications as monopolies, is that a large number of competing coal companies would deliver lower prices. A rival view is that the generating duopoly of National Power and PowerGen would find it easy to dictate terms to a fragmented industry, so British Coal should be privatised as a single entity. Best way Neither competition argument is compelling. British Coal is unlike the utilities in that it has to compete with foreign coal and other fuels. Privatising it as a single entity would therefore not substantially reduce competition. On the other hand, though the generators' duopoly power is certainly a cause for concern, the best way of dealing with this would be to tackle that power directly rather than build up British Coal as a counterweight. Mr Stephen Littlechild, director-general of electricity, is already pursuing this possibility. Nevertheless, there are many details ministers will need to determine before privatisation. How will British Coal's contracts with the generators be split up between successor companies? Who will assume its liabilities and what arrangements will be made to compensate redundant workers in the future? How will the government's scheme to subsidise extra coal sales operate? Who will control the coal industry's Pounds 13bn in pension assets? Most important, how big an industry will be privatised? Mr Eggar was studiously vague on this final question yesterday, raising concerns that the government will try to find some backdoor way of keeping more pits open than the market can support. Dud mines might be packaged with viable pits or private buyers might be asked to give guarantees not to close mines for so many years after privatisation. It is certainly possible to put such an interpretation on Mr Eggar's reticence. But the more likely explanation is that ministers know that further pit closures are inevitable before privatisation but were so badly burnt by last year's pit crisis that they cannot bring themselves to admit it.</p>

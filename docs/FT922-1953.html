			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y unveils revised plan for restructuring of debt OLYMPIA &amp; York yesterday outlined a new debt-restructuring proposal which would include extending repayments on most of its debt for five years. It would also mean disposing of some of its Canadian properties and other investments. The company reaffirmed an earlier plan to convert some of its CDollars 13.5bn (USDollars 11.2bn) debt into equity. However, it continues to insist that control remain with its existing owners, Toronto's Reichmann family. The new proposals, which are still being discussed with key creditors, were contained in a progress report to the Ontario court of justice. Separately, a group of Canadian banks applied to the court to terminate interest rate swaps with O&amp;Y. The banks argued that the value of the swaps, which are considered an asset, is declining as interest rates fall. O&amp;Y, however, maintains that it requires the instruments to protect it against adverse interest rate movements. In its submission, O&amp;Y reiterated the importance of remaining a going concern. It warned that immediate liquidation would result in 'significant losses to virtually all groups of creditors'. It also said common management of its properties 'serves to increase asset values in the aggregate'. The latest restructuring proposals call for loans to be categorised as either convertible debt or non-convertible debt. At the end of the five-year standstill period, convertible debt-holders would have the option of exchanging their claims into common shares. The company also promised to draw up annual 12-month and 24-month business plans to be approved by an operating committee representing the creditors. It proposed liquidating marketable securities on an orderly basis, except for certain core holdings, including its stakes in Gulf Canada Resources, newsprint-maker Abitibi-Price, and property developer Trizec. Meanwhile, O&amp;Y's information officer filed his first monthly report on the ailing developer's financial condition yesterday, and promised monthly briefings to the company's far-flung creditors. The report, compiled by Mr Bernard Wilson, a partner at Price Waterhouse, will be made available only to O&amp;Y's creditors and other outsiders this morning. The reports stem from creditors' efforts to obtain more detailed information since O&amp;Y filed for bankruptcy protection for its Canadian assets on May 14. O&amp;Y handed control of the Canary Wharf project in London's Docklands to administrators two weeks later, but its US buildings remain outside the court orders. The court order covers about two-thirds of O&amp;Y's CDollars 13.5bn debt. Creditors affected by the Canadian order, including 91 banks and many holders of publicly-traded securities, have been divided into six committees to facilitate negotiations on the restructuring plan which O&amp;Y is now compiling. Mr Wilson said a PW corporate finance team was also working with O&amp;Y and the creditors 'in a pro-active manner' on the restructuring plan.</p>

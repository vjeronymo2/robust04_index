			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / World Trade News: China threatens retaliation if US imposes trade sanctions CHINA yesterday warned the US it would impose retaliatory duties on US imports worth Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 641m) if Washington carries out its threat of trade sanctions against Beijing. The warning comes on the eve of the sixth and final round of trade talks between the two countries on the protection of copyright and patents, due to open in Washington tomorrow. The talks are scheduled to last two days. The US has announced it will impose tariffs of up to 100 per cent on a wide range of Chinese exports valued at Dollars 1.5bn if agreement cannot be reached on the protection of US intellectual property. It has set a deadline date of January 16, extended from November 26 last year, for a resolution of the dispute. If none is reached it will invoke the punitive sanctions allowed under the 301 Section of the US Trade Act. Washington says China's laws provide inadequate protection for copyright and patents. It accuses China of being the single largest pirate worldwide of US intellectual property, causing losses amounting to Dollars 430m annually. US officials say China's law leaves almost all films, plays, books, computer software and music recordings unprotected. Trade talks between the two countries have so far failed and the likelihood of sanctions is growing. Chinese exports at risk include beer, silk clothing, shoes, pharmaceuticals, jewellery and raw materials.</p>

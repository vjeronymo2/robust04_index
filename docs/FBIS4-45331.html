			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Erlend Clouston: "Scots Drug Abuse `Costs </F> &pound;1bn a Year'"; first paragraph is THE GUARDIAN  introduction]    [Excerpts] Erlend Clouston reports on a Commons inquiry  that suggests a third of Scots in their early twenties could be  experimenting with drugs, and talks to an addict about his  lifestyle.    Drug abuse in Scotland is costing the taxpayer almost  &pound;1  billion a year--25 times the official calculation.    A report by the all-party Scottish Affairs Committee  released  yesterday suggests that up to one-third of Scots in their early  twenties could be experimenting with various drugs; 20,000  people are thought to be injecting illicit substances--11,000 in  Greater Glasgow alone, including almost half the children in one  Strathclyde secondary school class. Funding an injected  addiction is said to cost a weekly average of &pound;300.    The report recommends wider provision of synthetic opiates  and an education programme to tackle Scotland's growing drug  crisis.    The committee estimates that, taking into account theft,  interdiction, prisons and treatment, drug abuse north of the  border is costing the taxpayer &pound;936 million annually.    "It is a much more serious and extensive problem than any of  us imagined," said committee chairman Willie McKelvey, Labour MP  for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, at yesterday's launch of a document  that has taken seven months to prepare and involved the 11  members in visits to the Netherlands and the United States.    Up to 90 per cent of young people attending raves are  thought  to be using Ecstasy, LSD or amphetamines. Temazepam, a  pharmaceutical painkiller, has become one of the favourite  opiates of "the least well educated and post-socially  disadvantaged as groups of mis-users". An Edinburgh GP told the  committee that his surgery's prescription of the drug had risen  by 131 per cent recently.    However, the report drew back from making a direct link  between poverty and drug-taking, preferring to talk of a  correlation rather than a causal relationship.    The recommendation that the substitute drug methadone be  made  more freely available by health boards was the most  controversial aspect of the report. It cited a US study which  showed that the crime rate among a group of 491 addicts on a  methadone course had dropped by 79 per cent. While acknowledging  that it was the perfect solution, the report found that the  advantages of the "soft landing" approach--no injecting, and  addicts kept in touch with the support agencies--were too great  to be ignored. [passage omitted]    To alert potential drug consumers to the dangers--57 per  cent  of Lothian HIV sufferers contracted the virus from infected  needles--the committee called for an education programme  starting at primary school. Mr McKelvey said many Scottish  mothers were "fraught with despair in some areas as all their  kids are at risk".    Finding an effective solution will not be easy. Both  "shock-horror" and neutral information packages distributed in  the Netherlands have provoked a rise in the level of drug-taking.    The committee obliquely criticised the police for failing to  do more to impound the possessions of drug dealers. In 1992 the  authorities in England and Wales seized assets worth &pound;16  million. In the same year the Scottish forces confiscated goods  and property worth &pound;28,440. "The Association of Chief  Police  Officers accepted that the police had not been up to speed on  the issue," the report records.</p>

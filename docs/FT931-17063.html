			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Markets: Recovery is not business as usual - London THE CHART alongside may hold the key to the stock market's performance in 1993. It shows the ratio of M4, the broadest measure of the money supply, to GDP. Over most of the past 12 years, the ratio has been rising steadily. For every pound of GDP, people have been holding an ever-higher amount of money in M4's cash, bank and building society accounts. The upward trend has levelled off over the last couple of years, but the UK is still awash with liquidity. The Treasury argues that the steady upward trend simply reflects the rising wealth of UK households. The flattening in the ratio over the past two years echoes the damage done to wealth by the recession. Once that is past, the upward trend will continue. If that is so, there is little implication for the stock market. But consider what might happen if the public's holdings of liquid funds represent not merely a side-effect of increasing wealth but also a judgment about relative rates of return. For much of the past decade, nominal interest rates on pass-book accounts have been comfortingly high. For the past few years, indeed, the funds that make up the bulk of M4 have produced extremely attractive real rates of return. Since Britain left the ERM in September, interest rates have fallen sharply. They are likely to fall further in the new year. What will savers do with their money as building society accounts no longer look so attractive? A similar - though deeper - cut in interest rates in the US led to a flood of retail investors' money into the stock market, helping to push it to new heights. UK interest rates are unlikely to drop as far as those in the US. And Britain does not have the same number of aggressive independent stock-market investors. But it does have a large and imaginative collective investment industry, skilled at channelling the public's savings into the most appropriate market. A strong start to the year for equities, building on the 129-point rise in the FT-SE 100 index since mid-December, might make this task easier, rekindling public enthusiasm for shares for the first time since the 1987 Crash. Even if retail investors still steer clear of equities, however, a shift in their portfolios might influence the stock market in a less direct way. The post-September steepness of the yield curve - which rises from roughly 5 per cent interest rates on short-term retail deposits to an 8 1/2 per cent yield on long-term gilts - allows individual investors to obtain higher returns by moving along the curve. If they do so in large numbers - either by buying gilts themselves or, more plausibly, by buying insurance industry products backed by gilts - the huge scale of the government's borrowing requirement for next year will become much less threatening, to the equity market's benefit. Such financial considerations apart, the equity market in the New Year is likely to be dominated by the outlook for the economy. The current level of share prices - with the FT-Actuaries industrials selling at 17 times reported earnings - reflects the consensus that a slow, stuttering, recovery from recession is under way. In the last couple of weeks of 1992, however, hopes have spread that the recovery may prove brisker than expected. The strong performance of the new FT-SE Mid 250 index, which contains the mid-sized companies that rank just below the FT-SE 100, reflects this view. Typical Mid 250 companies are more focused on UK domestic markets than their larger cousins; and the index also contains many companies from the capital goods and construction supplies industries. The Mid 250 index as a whole outperformed the FT-SE 100 by 6 1/2 per cent in December, thanks to strong performances by such companies as Tiphook (up 30 per cent on the month); Shanks &amp; McEwan and T&amp;N (both up 25 per cent); BICC (up 24 per cent) and Marley (up 23 per cent). The optimism these movements reflect was reinforced by consumers' enthusiastic shopping in the days just before and just after Christmas. Share prices of stores rose six per cent in the last two weeks of the year, putting them on a p/e ratio of 21, a figure that is clearly already discounting good sales in 1993. As the old year ended, it was left to the stores' more glamorous cousins, the food retailers, to underline that the recovery will not simply be a return to pre-recession business-as-usual. During the three years or so of depressed economic activity, the world has not stood still. Cost structures have been altered, new capacity has been brought into use, competitive relationships have changed. This is most obviously true for those companies faced with overseas competition, for whom the EC's single market ushers in new challenges. But it is also true for the gilded giants of food retailing, despite their relative immunity to rivals from abroad. The stock market's growing unease about how long the supermarkets will be able to combine rapid growth and high margins showed up in a - perhaps exaggerated - reaction to some small-scale price cuts by the big chains, pulling the sector down 3.6 per cent on Wednesday. At the end of the year's trading, the market was valuing supermarkets - on a dividend yield of 3.12 per cent - less generously than stores (3.11 per cent), something that has happened on only two other days in the past five years. In this and other ways, the recovery is likely to be no respecter of formerly comfortable certainties.</p>

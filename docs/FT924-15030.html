			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Yeltsin bows to backlash over reforms MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian president, yesterday abandoned outright support for his cabinet, admitting they had made mistakes and that the sacrifices of the Russian people had been greater than needed. 'Corrections must be made in the reforms. This is a demand from the president,' he told Russian deputies. He also made overtures to the centrist industrialists' faction, Civic Union, which wants slower reform and industrial subsidies retained. The effect of Mr Yeltsin's speech was to put him above the political fray, in a position where he can choose between competing programmes - and where his support for the cabinet of Mr Yegor Gaidar is now much more measured. He chided the 'Gaidar team' for rejecting all ideas not their own and advised them to take note of the proposals of Civic Union, led by Mr Arkady Volsky. Mr Yeltsin singled out two of Mr Gaidar's closest allies - Mr Peter Aven, minister for foreign economic affairs, and Mr Andrei Nechayev, minister for the economy, blaming them for inefficiency. He followed that with the lukewarm observation that this was not a cause for the resignation of the government and that 'another government would have been worse'. The fate of Mr Aven and Mr Nechayev was uncertain last night, though the rumour mill had already marked the latter down for the ambassadorship to Austria. Mr Volsky, said Mr Yeltsin had shown support for his programme and warned that if the government did not accept it, his powerful Civic Union bloc would go into full opposition. Mr Gaidar, speaking after Mr Yeltsin, claimed there was no alternative to his programme and produced a detailed critique of the industrialists' proposals, saying that the 'Chinese model' of controlled reform from the top endorsed by Mr Volsky and his colleagues was not an option for Russia. That model, he reminded the deputies, was one where opposition was suppressed and division of powers unknown. On specific measures, the president said that: The rouble - which plunged again against the dollar yesterday from 309 to 342 - should be 'the only means of payment in Russia'. He proposed banning the use of foreign currencies to pay for goods and services, a measure which would directly oppose the trend to the use of hard currencies by foreign and Russian companies. A 'real' rouble rate against the dollar must be achieved by widening trading of the rouble. Exporters would be made to sell all of their hard currency receipts for roubles at the market exchange rate - a measure sure to be unpopular with Russia's hard pressed export industries. He had already signed a decree allowing citizens to use their privatisation vouchers to buy land, houses and municipal property (shops and small businesses), as well as shares in large companies for which the vouchers were originally designed. He had also signed a decree setting up a system of land banks to encourage the growth of private farming. General Alexander Rutskoi, the influential vice-president, had been put in charge of a special commission to root out corruption. This is widely seen as a high profile job which appears to recognise the vice-president's growing political influence.</p>

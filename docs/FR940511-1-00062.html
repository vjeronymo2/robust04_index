			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In &sect;98.70, the CCDBG rule requires grantees to submit annual reports to the Secretary by December 31. This provision is not affected by the extension of the expenditure period by section 8 of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments of 1992. Each report must specify expenditures made by September 30 of the year in which the report is submitted to the Secretary, with each fiscal year's funds accounted for separately. However, we are proposing to revise &sect;98.70 to more clearly state the requirement and to delete those requirements no longer applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=2 --> PART 255_CHILD CARE AND OTHER WORK RELATED SUPPORTIVE SERVICES DURING PARTICIPATION IN EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Child Care That Is ``Reasonably Related'' To Parent's Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Under the regulations for title IV&hyph;A child care, a State must assure in the State Supportive Services Plan that child care provided or claimed for reimbursement is reasonably related to the hours of participation in JOBS or in other State-approved education and training (for care under part 255) or employment (for care under parts 255, 256 and 257). ACF recognized that many individuals would participate in education, training and employment on less than a full-time basis, but decided not to regulate a definition of what constitutes child care that is reasonably related to the parent's hours of participation or employment. Rather, we gave States the flexibility and, we believed, the authority to develop their own policies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During our discussions with States, however, we learned that there is some misunderstanding or disagreement about who has the responsibility for establishing policies on what constitutes an amount of child care that is reasonably related to the parent's training or employment. For example, internal or external reviews or audits have questioned how a State determined that the child care under review was reasonably related to the parent's activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ACF continues to maintain that State IV&hyph;A agencies should establish their own policies for what constitutes a ``reasonably related'' amount of child care. Therefore, we propose to have the State include in its Supportive Services Plan a description of its policy on what constitutes child care that is reasonably related to the parent's hours of participation in education, training or employment by revising &sect;&sect;255.1(e)(4) and 257.21(a)(6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Including the State's ``reasonably related'' child care policy in the federally approved Supportive Services Plan will clarify the IV&hyph;A agency's role in developing and articulating the State's policy in this area. By having written policy on ``reasonably related,'' States should avoid such disputes with potential reviewers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In proposing this regulation, we wish to clarify the difference between a policy which addresses paying for child care when a child is absent from regularly scheduled care (e.g. due to illness) and a policy which describes what is reasonably related child care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A ``reasonably related'' child care policy correlates the parent's activities with the amount of child care that the IV&hyph;A agency views as necessary based on the parent's activities and in consideration of other factors that the agency regards as significant. For example, States may wish to include such factors as the individual needs of the recipient family, the availability or lack of care alternatives in a local market area, need for continuity of care by a specific caregiver, or the needs of a Head Start Agency to meet operating expenses for wrap-around child care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contrast to the ``reasonably related'' policy which relates the parent's activity to an amount of child care, an absence policy addresses the fact that children will occasionally miss child care especially due to illness. A State's absence policy would establish when a State would pay for child care even when the child is absent. FFP is available for payments made in accordance with a State's absence policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``reasonably related'' policy the State describes in its approved Supportive Services Plan will become the standard against which actual payments will be judged, for example, for audit purposes. We therefore advise the State to articulate its policy clearly to all individuals responsible for approving the payment or reimbursement of child care services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Determination of Physical or Mental Incapacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Under the regulations for AFDC child care at part 255 and Transitional Child Care (TCC) at part 256, the determination of mental or physical incapacity for a child over age 13 can only be made by a ``physician or a licensed or certified psychologist.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

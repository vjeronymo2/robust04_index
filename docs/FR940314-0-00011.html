			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were a number of recommendations concerning purposes eligible for funding, including comments that REA should make grant funds available for businesses in a for-profit status. REA believes there is adequate flexibility with the rule as written regarding eligible projects. The quality of the proposal and the degree of benefit to the rural community or the potential for economic development are determining factors in application approval. It should be noted that rural for-profit and non-profit projects alike may be able to obtain grant funds in conjunction with zero-interest loans for feasibility studies and technical assistance. In addition, for-profit as well as non-profit entities that enhance the overall quality of medical care or provide advanced telecommunications services or computer networks for medical and educational services may be considered for grants because they may facilitate projects which will improve the rural communities overall and provide needed services to rural America. However, generally, REA desires to fund non-profit entities, since grants to for-profit entities for direct business start-up costs could result in the possibility or perception that grants would provide certain for-profit entities an unfair competitive advantage over those entities not receiving REA funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It was also suggested that housing be included as eligible for funding under the regulation. REA recognizes the value of adequate housing in developing rural areas. However, REA believes other federal programs are available to provide housing, and grant funds will be better utilized to provide broader community-wide facilities and infrastructure improvements. REA Borrowers may, in accordance with a rural development plan for a revolving loan fund, provide housing assistance from those funds classified as non-Federal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, it was suggested that grant funds be used for venture capital purposes. The focus of the rural economic development loan and grant program is to allow REA Borrowers to assist projects that will promote rural development. REA intends to be flexible in meeting this objective; thus, applications will be evaluated on a case by case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There were several objections to linking grants to zero-interest loans. Some comments urged direct grants for feasibility studies and technical assistance be provided to non-profit entities and that grants be made outright, without loans, to economically distressed local governments. REA feels that grants for feasibility studies or technical assistance will most likely be effectively used in conjunction with loans. Grants in conjunction with loans strengthen the loan program and maximize the benefits derived from the limited amount of grant funding available. No change is being made to allow direct grants to economically distressed local governments; however, provisions of the program as written will enable REA Borrowers to facilitate economic development in distressed rural areas by funding worthwhile community development and job creation projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters suggested that the 10 percent limitation for using grant funds for administrative costs of the RLFs be revised to provide more flexibility in determining these costs. No change is being made to the program at this time. REA feels that limiting the funds used for administrative costs will be an incentive to encourage REA Borrowers to stress prudent management of the funds and maximize the benefits for rural development. REA encourages interested rural development organizations to work with REA Borrowers to minimize overhead costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters felt REA's grant funding limitation of 80 percent of the cost of establishing the revolving fund, which will require 20 percent supplemental funding to the revolving loan fund by the Borrower, is overly restrictive. These organizations stated that this Borrower supplemental funding requirement, and the supplemental funding requirement for individual projects, was too burdensome. Additionally, commentors objected to requiring projects be funded by REA Borrowers ``up-front.'' This requirement was set forth in the proposed rule's preamble paragraph entitled ``The establishment and/or Operation of a Revolving Loan Fund by REA Borrowers'', &sect;1703.22(a)(3) relating to supplemental funding requirements, and &sect;1703.22(h)(2), ``Requisition requirements'', which requires Borrowers be reimbursed 80 percent of funds expended for approved projects. REA believes the supplemental funding requirement should remain applicable for Borrowers establishing revolving loan funds, as well as supplemental funding for individual projects presently required for zero-interest pass-through loans. REA has found that the supplemental funding requirement specified in &sect;1703.23 of the regulation, as applied to individual projects, has been beneficial for the zero-interest loan program by maximizing the use of outside funds. Likewise, REA believes the Borrower supplemental funding requirement for the revolving loan fund will be equally beneficial for the grant selection process by evidencing a degree of Borrower support and commitment to the revolving loan fund, and it will provide REA adequate assurance of effective project review and oversight resulting in projects having a high probability of success.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

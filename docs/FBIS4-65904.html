			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by </F> Alexandra Schwartzbrod and Gilles Senges; place and date not  given: "Leotard: `Foreign Operations Should Total 3.3 Billion  Francs'"]    [Text]The parliamentary debate on the military  programming law, which commits France to spending 613 billion  francs [Fr] on equipping its Armed Forces between now and the  year 2000, is to begin today in an atmosphere of calm that is in  sharp contrast to the stormy debates on nuclear deterrence that  have stirred up the political class in recent months. In an  interview with LES ECHOS, Defense Minister Francois Leotard  pointed out that his bill is merely the expression of choices  which are in line with the defense white paper. He explained  his decision to give priority to ongoing production activities  to the detriment of research, and acknowledged that he has  changed his position on the antimissile defense projects. From  the industrial point of view, he affirmed that he had confidence  in companies and wanted to leave strategic choices up to them.  Lastly, he gave an initial estimate of the cost of France's  foreign operations in 1994, which should total Fr3.3 billion, a  figure which includes the scaling down of troops in the former  Yugoslavia. He hopes that this will be financed, like last  year, by the supplementary budget.    [LES ECHOS] The military programming law should be passed by  the entire political class, including the Socialists. This lack  of controversy, does it not show that those who accuse you of  having postponed all the important choices, were right?    [Leotard] There have been and there will be debates, but the  bill should be passed with broad approval. I understand this  very well and I hoped for it, because when the security of our  country is at stake, it is best to avoid party squabbling. The  agreement of the three major political groupings would be a good  thing. It would show that we have done our work well. Everyone  is aware of the government's desire to make defense a priority.  The figures included in the military programming law prove  this, since we are increasing our investment regularly until the  year 2000.    The debate will certainly continue on topics such as nuclear  testing or certain armament programmes. However, I vigorously  disagree with the allegation that no choices were made in the  military programming law. First of all, I have never heard  anyone ask for a program to be stopped. Moreover, the bill  submitted to Parliament is the expression of choices which are  in line with the white paper: the choice of joint Armed Forces;  priority to production currently under way; and the  reinforcement of conventional forces. It is true that in 1997,  decisions will have to be made on a number of programs such as  the NH-90 helicopter, the ATF transport plane, or the second  aircraft carrier. However, it is not necessary, nor is it  possible, to make these decisions before then.    [LES ECHOS] Have you made a choice regarding the APTGD  (long-range precision weapon) missile?    [Leotard] We will make a choice this year. However, I would  like to emphasize in this respect that we have planned to  earmark funds for the supersonic antiship missile program, the  successor to the Exocet, and to do so before 1997. This will  allow us to maintain our skills in the area of ramjet engines.    [LES ECHOS] You have decided to give preference to ongoing  production activities to the detriment of spending for upstream  research. Is that not dangerous in the long term given the fact  that the United States is doing the opposite?    [Leotard] Spending for research is being reduced very  slightly as a percentage of equipment expenditure, but as this  is increasing in volume, we end up with virtually the same  amount in constant francs. However, this is also a choice  because we want to emphasize production. The productivity  efforts which we initiated must also apply to research. I am  convinced that we can do better with the same resources and that  this decision in no way and in no sector will compromise  France's military research effort. There is still redundancy to  be eliminated and rationalization to be made. And this will make  it possible to reinforce our efforts in priority areas. I feel  that the time has come to put the emphasis on production,  because I feel that priority must be given to equipping the  Armed Forces.    [LES ECHOS] Are you not worried about industrial research  agencies?    [Leotard] Everyone knows that the armaments industry is  experiencing tough times. It is losing jobs. I do not wish to  embellish the reality, but we are making the best possible use  of our resources to maintain French competence. I cannot see  any technological skills which we would be abandoning.    [LES ECHOS] Yet, at the same time, you say that they are  going to have to be shared or abandoned?    [Leotard] Yes, in the future. Successive defense ministers  often found themselves faced with a sort of budgetary obstacle  which they used to push ahead of them. My concern is to have  France get over such obstacles without too many difficulties so  that we can appropriately prepare for the coming century. We  are at the end of a period in which more than 90 percent of our  defense requirements were produced nationally. More European  cooperation is emerging on the horizon. We are faced with an  alternative: either cooperate, or purchase from abroad,  something which we would like to reduce. To this end, we are  going to spend Fr1.2 billion per year between 1995 and 2000 on  foreign purchases, compared with Fr1.4 billion per year between  1987 and 1994. There is no third option, since it would mean  the multiplication of national production by each of the  European countries.    [LES ECHOS] One year ago, you made a vibrant plea in favor  of  antimissile defense. That is one of the rare lines of action  which has been totally ruled out. What happened?    [Leotard] I now have a slightly different approach to the  problem. I have observed that in the United States and in  Germany the debate on this issue has been marked by a great deal  of modesty, not like the enthusiasm of the eighties. As you  know, we are devoting considerable debate--and also money--to  policies which provide partial solutions to the problem in the  knowledge that France alone is not able to solve it all by  itself. What we want is to make the Germans our partners in a  number of research areas. Within the current context of our  research and products, we can provide certain aspects of an  antimissile-based defense system. Here I am thinking in  particular of the APTGD missile, which is a weapon of  retaliation and is therefore part of this type of thinking. The  Helios optical observation satellites and Osiris radar are also  being actively continued in this spirit. Space observation is  of fundamental importance in this area. We must now look and  see what we are politically prepared to share with others, such  as the warning system.    [LES ECHOS] Are you prepared to give the larger part of the  Osiris program to the Germans?    [Leotard] The Germans seem to be interested in genuine  cooperation with us in the area of space intelligence. That is  a good thing. In addition, there is indeed a link with the  industrial alliance projects currently being negotiated.    [LES ECHOS] Is Germany, which is slashing its defense  spending, still a reliable partner?    [Leotard] In any case, we are in an imbalanced relationship,  in that we are increasing our spending when all the other  countries are reducing it. This allows France to pull the  others along and to keep its lead. Cooperation is, by  definition, based on the budget decisions of others. As long as  there is no political authority in Europe, or legal structures  such as a European armaments agency protecting national budget  decisions, we will have this very delicate problem. If the  British, German, and French develop a joint strategy in the  industrial area, they are literally saving the European defense  industry, and that is what I am endeavoring to do. Not a week  goes by that I do not have discussions with my German or British  counterparts. A very strong political will must be imposed on  the military staff and industry.    [LES ECHOS] Before moving on to the European stage, should  you not first of all successfully complete the industrial  restructuring of French firms, as your predecessor began to do?    [Leotard] The state certainly has responsibilities and  resources, but it does not have heavily influence the decisions  of businesses which themselves have been, via the market, the  major indicator of their strategy. This does not prevent me  from giving support to regrouping operations at European level,  which are currently being negotiated, including operations  between private companies. I think that the collaboration  currently under way, provided it leads to a satisfactory  agreement, is the basis of the European defense industry and  complies perfectly with the interests of our national industry.  As for relations between Aerospatiale and Dassault, I think  that this operation is an intelligent one. It should be  pursued. Whether or not this should be done by hacking away at  it or throwing diktats at it, I do not know. I am not an  ideologist.    [LES ECHOS] What is your strategy for Dassault?    [Leotard] Our duty is to make that company give some thought  to the post-Rafale period and open up its long-term prospects:  In other words, to push it to move closer to other industrial  companies. Dassault is making genuine and courageous efforts to  rationalize its plant. It too has its own corporate reason for  being. It is a company that makes one of the best products in  the world.    [LES ECHOS] As regards the rapprochement between Thomson-CSF  [Wireless Telegraphy Company] and TCE [Thomson Consumer  Electronics], is there still talk about going private again?    [Leotard] No. This rapprochement is no longer news.    [LES ECHOS] Are you in favor of a rapprochement between CSF  and DASA?    [Leotard] If plans for a rapprochement were to take shape  with regard to part of the activity of these two companies, I  would look into it with the concern that it be in line with the  highly advanced rapprochement currently emerging between  Aerospatiale and DASA.    [LES ECHOS] GIAT [Industrial Group for Ground Weapons]  Industries has announced poor results. Do you hope to see it  recapitalized?    [Leotard] It will have to be. The thing that really strikes  me, however, is that we are dragging along extremely heavy state  structures which are no longer suited to the constraints of the  market, with cost levels that are much too high. We must  therefore continue down the road taken to adapt to the market.  For GIAT Industries, this will involve pursuing efforts to  boost productivity. Many of its production centers are still  not in a position to produce under good conditions. We have to  motivate employees so that the adjustment can be made with the  fewest possible social difficulties. This is just as true for  GIAT Industries as for other companies.    [LES ECHOS] Do you think you will be able to comply with  budget restrictions this year?    [Leotard] I will have to make efforts like all the ministers  due to the reduction in operating expenditure. However, do not  forget that the Defense Ministry is the state's leading investor  and that it is increasing its efforts throughout the military  programming law.    [LES ECHOS] What is your estimate of the cost of foreign  operations this year?    [Leotard] It should total Fr3.3 billion, in terms of  remuneration and operating expenses. Nevertheless, we have to  remain very cautious. These are only forecasts. In addition, I  would like the prime minister to allow us to repeat what  happened in 1993. Indeed, for the first time the additional  spending on foreign operations was not financed by tapping into  spending for defense equipment. The prime minister is well  aware of this problem.    [LES ECHOS] You have given Army Auditor Yvon Jouan the task  of studying weapons exports. In the coming year, do you plan to  reform the way in which this activity is organized in France?    [Leotard] The system used by the CIEEMG (Interministerial  Committee for the Study of Weapons Exports) is very strict and  tightly controlled. I feel that this is a good thing. It does  not leave room for unexpected increases or for attitudes that  run counter to a political will. With regard to the system used  by the armaments offices, I personally feel that there must be  some rationalization along geographical, institutional, or  structural lines. We are working on it.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Heavy weather at P&amp;O Like many UK companies, P&amp;O could do with a decent dose of inflation. Not only would this swell the value of its Pounds 4bn asset base and shrink the relative burden of its Pounds 1.7bn of debt. It would also enable P&amp;O to push through much-needed price rises in its housebuilding and shipping arms. As it is, although P&amp;O is seeing a pick-up of activity in many areas, it is experiencing little improvement in margins. This joyless recovery has left it with creaking timbers as an 11 per cent decline in net pre-tax profits illustrates. The 7 per cent fall in the company's stock price reflects renewed doubts about P&amp;O's ability to sustain its hefty dividend. P&amp;O's enhanced scrip dividend temporarily eases the pressure since it effectively works as a minor rights issue. It saves Pounds 35m of tax from disappearing into the chancellor's pocket, and preserves Pounds 163m of cash. But the scrip dividend will only pile up future financial worries for P&amp;O. If fully taken up, it will expand P&amp;O's equity by about 6 per cent. That will prove expensive to finance given the stock's yield of 6.5 per cent. More robust economic recovery, if not inflation, could yet save P&amp;O's blushes. But it will take P&amp;O several years to generate the profits needed to rebuild cover sufficiently to contemplate any dividend increase. The added longer-term worry is that P&amp;O has recently been selling the ballast that enabled it to keep an even keel during the downturn. The stable earnings contributions from companies such as Sutcliffe can no longer be relied upon in future.</p>

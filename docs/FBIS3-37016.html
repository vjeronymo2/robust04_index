The finalization of a convention against double taxation is  of special importance, as the document will help to regulate  economic and financial relations. The second document will be a  framework agreement on cooperation in education, science and  culture. Both documents have been fully prepared for signing by  foreign ministers in the presence of the Russian and British  leaders.    In the opinion of the diplomat, there are no serious  problems  in the Russian-British relations. "All major stumbling stones  have been removed," he said.    As for international issues, the Russian Foreign Ministry  hopes to discuss the European situation, including the creation  of security system and development of Russian relations with  "the seven". The latter may become "the eight" in future.    The sides will also focus on Russian and British future  actions at the U.N. Security Council or CSCE.    The British prime minister will be informed about the  Russian  situation and its relations with former Soviet republics. A  special item on the agenda will be relations with the Baltic  states, where "considerable progress has been achieved".    The Baltic theme will also be analyzed by Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev and British Secretary of State for  Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Douglas Hurd. The latter will  leave Moscow for Riga on February 16 to meet foreign ministers  of the three Baltic republics.    "Russia and Great Britain have long discussed the Baltic  issue and Russia is grateful for British readiness to help  settlement of the remaining problems," said Fokin.    In his words, the negotiations may result in signing of  other  documents, including those on security.</p>

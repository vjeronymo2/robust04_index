			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / 2,200 jobs threatened at Swan Hunter THE FUTURE of the long-established shipbuilding industry on Tyneside was placed in jeopardy yesterday when Swan Hunter lost its bid for a vital contract to build a 20,000-tonne helicopter carrier for the navy. Swan Hunter described the surprise decision as 'potentially terminal'. Labour MPs said it would force the closure of Swan Hunter and put 6,000 people in the north-east out of work. The contract, believed to be worth about Pounds 170m, has gone instead to VSEL, the submarine yard at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, in conjunction with the Norwegian-owned Scottish company Kvaerner Govan. Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, said the VSEL bid won 'by a very substantial margin of more than Pounds 50m'. Neither VSEL nor Swan Hunter would comment on details of the respective bids. Mr Aitken said the government had taken 'full account' of wider factors such as Swan Hunter's future. But he added: 'The final judgment was made on our normal technical and value-for-money criteria.' The plan for a helicopter carrier was thought likely to be dropped in MoD budget cuts but was revived in March. The ship, to be called HMS Ocean, is designed to carry 12 helicopters, capable of landing several hundred Royal Marines. Swan Hunter was hoping to secure subsequent contracts for two large assault ships, worth about Pounds 200m each. Work on current orders - completing three navy frigates - will run out by the end of next year. Swan Hunter's yard at Wallsend employs 2,200, compared with 4,500 when it was privatised in a management buyout in 1986. The company is owned by 36 senior managers; it has no parent to fall back on. Since it opened in the 1870s, it has constructed 2,700 ships, from the famous Cunard liner Mauretania to the current aircraft carriers Ark Royal and Illustrious. Yesterday, with a terseness which underlined the seriousness of its predicament, the management refused any comment beyond a brief statement from joint chief executive Dr Roger Vaughan. It said: 'The order being awarded to anyone other than Swan Hunter will have serious consequences.' VSEL said the jobs argument was the same whether the contract went to Barrow-in-Furness or the Tyne. The deal marks the submarine builder's return to surface ship work after an 11-year absence. Under the contract, the ship itself will be built at Kvaerner Govan on Clydeside and will be turned into a military vessel at VSEL. The work will sustain about 500 jobs at VSEL over the next 18 months. The yard, which has cut its workforce to 7,700 from 14,300 in 1989, is still expected to make further reductions.</p>

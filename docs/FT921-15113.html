			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / US jobless figure hits highest level in five years PRESIDENT George Bush returned to Washington from his Asian trip yesterday to be greeted by a jump in unemployment to the highest level for five years. Furthermore, a New York Times/CBS opinion poll showed that eight in 10 Americans believe the economy is in 'bad shape'. The Labor Department said the unemployment rate had risen to 7.1 per cent last month compared with 6.9 per cent in November and 5.3 per cent at the start of the recession 18 months ago. Financial markets took the jobs statistics calmly, although share prices were set back - albeit fairly modestly - for the first time since mid-December. The deparment's figures for payroll employment were better than feared but it revised downwards its estimate for November to show an even larger decline - 265,000 rather than 241,000. Speaking at Andrews air force base, Mr Bush said he was 'disappointed' by the rise in unemployment but claimed his efforts to open markets in Asia would stimulate growth and create more US jobs. The opinion poll, however, indicated that fewer than a third of Americans believed Mr Bush's Asian trip would create jobs. Mr Bush's overall approval rating fell from 51 per cent to 48 per cent. Voters appeared evenly divided when offered a choice of re-electing Mr Bush or supporting an unspecified Democrat. Mr Bush is expected to attempt to rebuild his popularity by unveiling an ambitious growth plan in his State of the Union address on January 28. Yesterday Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, said economic data did not support the degree of gloom expressed. The economy was stalled rather than falling sharply. The unemployment rate remained low by the standards of previous downturns. The Fed would take whatever steps were needed to ensure 'sustainable economic expansion', he said, but warned Congress that fiscal measures to stimulate the economy were 'premature'.

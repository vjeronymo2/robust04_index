			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Collecting: Dealers play it safe - Susan Moore, in Florence, finds the Italians curiously quiet AN uncharacteristically muted mood settled on last week's gala opening of the 18th biennial international antiques fair at the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence. With most Italians preoccupied by the country's political and economic uncertainties and worried by the new taxes, it seems unlikely that it was simply the torrential rain that prompted the diminished attendance and dampened spirits - and discouraged the usual exuberant immodesty of hemline. Even the fair's future is in question. After years of discussion, it seems that the 15th century palace will receive its long-overdue renovation. Top priority is the removal of the disfiguring 1950s metal fire-escape from the palace's elegant open courtyard that any number of swags of fruit and flowers, banners, potted trees or obelisks fail to mask. Will the work be finished by 1995? Will the exhibitors bear the burden of increased costs? The fair is synonymous with the Palazzo Strozzi. The city fairground at the Fortezza da Baso lacks its cachet. Unlike its counterparts in Milan and Rome, the Florence fair has never been a pre-eminently commercial event. Few dealers expect to do much business here. 'I'm here to see that children don't touch anything on Saturdays,' one gallery assistant quipped. Instead, the fair prides itself on being a meeting place and a showcase for the best the dealers have to offer, an elegant event to launch the Florentine autumn season. Certainly the fair looks better than ever. The small over-stuffed stands that seemed to transform the Renaissance palazzo into a souk have been replaced by airier and more gracious spaces. Dealers have been taken out of the sultry, basement which is now a 'strongroom' for silver and jewellery. Florentine dealer Giovanni Pratesi, offers a grandiose mixture of the rare and the historically important. Leone Cei presents fine 17th century pictures which include striking canvases by the father of Neapolitan still-life painting, Luca Forte. A small but choice group of Old Master drawings, shown by Munich dealer Katrin Bellinger, grace a stand shared with Harari &amp; Johns. Attracting most attention at the gala, however, was the exhibition of erotic clocks and watches brought by Swiss watchmakers Blancpain. As for the top dealers bringing their very best, however: I think not. The glaring exception is London Old Master dealer Richard Green, exhibiting in Florence for the first time. His awkward corner stand, more thoroughfare than gallery, is conspicuous by its quality. It boasts no less than a pair of Bellottos, two pairs of Canalettos, including rare views of Florence, a large Boudin, Fantin-Latour roses and a wall of Dutch cabinet pictures. 'The most expensive corridor in Florence outside the Uffizi,' grins Jonathan Green. With price tags amounting to some Dollars 15m (Pounds 9.70m) he is probably right. Most dealers are playing it safe. Few want to risk exposing their most important - or their freshest - stock when there is a good chance of it not selling. The days of frenetic, often indiscriminate buying of Italian art at crazy prices, where perhaps 70 per cent of pictures sold at auction outside the country went to Italian bidders, often paying in cash, are over. It has been possible to do business at the top end of the market, however, where prices have remained stable. The Italians have long preferred to confine their bigs deals to the privacy of their own galleries, well away from the beady gaze of the taxman. 'Perhaps more than ever, the most important thing is to be discreet', says Alessandro Montanaro of Visconteum. Most worrying, perhaps, has been the withdrawal from the marketplace of the professional classes. However, at least there seems to be some equation between quality and price in the Italian art market. Visitors to the Palazzo Strozzi fair will, however, find maddeningly few descriptive labels and certainly no prices pinned to the walls. The growing professionalism of the Italian art trade ought to extend to more rigorous vetting procedures at its antiques fairs, as witnessed at the new Turin fair recently. It would also be in the long-term interests of both dealer and collector to rid themselves of the so-called 'expertises' that plague far too many works of art. The fair continues at the Palazzo Strozzi until October 11.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / UN treads warily on Yugoslavia MR Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, called last night for quick action to prevent the Yugoslav ceasefire from breaking down, but stressed it was still not possible to deploy a large international peacekeeping force. In a report to the Security Council, he recommended instead increasing from 50 to 75 the number of UN military liaison officers sent in last month to help consolidate the truce. Earlier in the day Lord Carrington, chairman of the European Community peace conference on Yugoslavia, arrived in Belgrade on a mission aimed at hammering out differences over the UN peace initiative and reviving the EC's role as mediator. At the same time, about 4,000 people turned out in Belgrade in support of Mr Milan Babic, leader of the self-proclaimed Serbian republic of Krajina in southern Croatia. Mr Babic is seen by Serb leaders as the main obstacle to deployment of 10,000 UN peacekeepers in Serb-populated regions of Croatia. However, at yesterday's low-key rally, as a Belgrade journalist reported, 'most of the crowd were refugees from Croatia. Mr Babic has little support in war-weary Serbia.' During his two-day mission Lord Carrington, a former British foreign secretary, will assess whether the EC conference can be reconvened. Serbia has called on the UN to take over as political mediator, accusing the EC of taking sides in the conflict.</p>

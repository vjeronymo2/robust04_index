			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Swedish rate rises surprise markets Sweden's central bank yesterday announced an unexpected increase in interest rates, jolting Swedish financial markets, surprising markets elsewhere and heightening political tensions ahead of next month's general election. The move, meant to stop signs of resurgent inflation, was the first increase in official interest rates since the krona was floated during a currency crisis in November 1992. It ended a steady downward trend that has helped Sweden emerge from its deepest recession for 50 years. The Riksbank raised two of its three key rates. It increased its repurchase rate, the main short-term interest rate, by 28 basis point to 7.20 per cent and its lending rate by 50 points to 8.00 per cent. It left its deposit rate unchanged at 6.00 per cent. Swedish markets, already nervous over the threat to economic recovery posed by the perilous state of public finances and uncertainty surrounding government policy after the election, reacted with alarm. The Stockholm stock exchange general index fell by 1.89 per cent, while market interest rates rose sharply. The yield on five-year government bonds jumped by more than 50 basis points past 10.90 per cent and the yield on 12-month treasury bills rose by 80 basis points to 9.60 per cent. Mr Urban Backstrom, the Riksbank governor, said the increase was needed to counter a tendency towards higher inflation during the spring and summer as the krona weakened, the international economy strengthened and Swedish industry approached capacity ceilings. The consumer price index showed an annual rise of 2.6 per cent in June, up from 1.8 per cent in March, threatening the Riksbank's long-term target ceiling of 3 per cent. 'Inflation must not be allowed to re-emerge,' Mr Backstrom said. 'This view has broad-based support. The Swedish economy has paid a considerable price for the inflation of the 1970s and 1980s.' He also cited 'uncertainty related to the problems surrounding the public finances'. Economists in Stockholm said the rise appeared to be intended as a strong signal to political parties to enact tougher policies to deal with the big budget deficit and fast-growing public debt. With government debt soon due to exceed 100 per cent of gross national product, Swedish market interest rates had already pushed up well ahead of European rates, leading the government to lower its GNP growth forecast for 1995 from 3 per cent to 2 per cent. The centre-right coalition sought to blame the interest rate reverse on the imprecise economic policy proposals of the opposition Social Democratic party, which holds a lead in the opinion polls ahead of the September 18 election. 'The markets have reacted with concern because they do not know what will happen if the Social Democrats win the election. Therefore interest rate increases are necessary to show that high inflation will not be acceptable,' said Mr Bo Lundgren, the minister for taxation. Mr Goran Persson, Social Democratic shadow finance minister, responded that the Riksbank measure 'is the final rejection of the incumbent government's policies'. But he refused to commit the Social Democrats, who have emphasised tax increases as well as savings to narrow the budget deficit, to greater cuts in public spending, which now accounts for some 70 per cent of GNP.</p>

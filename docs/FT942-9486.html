			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Mexican attorney general resigns Mr Diego Valades, Mexico's attorney general, resigned abruptly at the weekend, the second justice minister to quit in the past four months. The resignation, announced without any official explanation, adds to the turmoil surrounding the administration of security and justice as the country prepares for presidential elections in August. Mr Valades had come under fire in the past weeks over the arrest of the Baja California deputy state attorney general, Mr Sergio Ortiz, on charges of collaborating with drug traffickers. Mr Ortiz is a member of the conservative National Action party (PAN), which interpreted the action, as well as Mr Valades' refusal to investigate allegations of corruption they levelled against Mr Carlos 'Hank' Gonzalez, the powerful agriculture minister, to be a declaration of political war. The administration of President Carlos Salinas and his ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) can ill afford a fight with PAN, which has generally been a government ally. Mr Valades may have been forced to resign in order to placate the opposition party. A climate of insecurity, highlighted by the assassination of the PRI's presidential candidate, Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, and a series of kidnappings of Mexican businessmen, also helped to damage Mr Valades' public image. Mr Valades, according to aides, had his own problems with a lack of respect given to him and his post by Mr Salinas. The investigation of the Colosio assassination has been placed under a special prosecutor, while a new National Public Security Commission, which is run directly from the president's office and to which Mr Valades had to answer, was formed less than a month ago. The appointment of little-known Mr Humberto Benitez to replace Mr Valades in the attorney general's office is a sign that most serious law and order issues, including the election, will be dealt with by the presidency. In Mexican political circles, the circumstances surrounding the resignation, which are unlikely to go away with a simple change in chief personnel, were lamented more than the resignation itself. One newspaper, La Jornada, entitled its editorial 'The Fraying of the Attorney General'. Little by little, the editorial said, 'the attorney general's function is wasted under a justice system overwhelmed by demand and a climate of corruption that permeates nearly all levels of the ministry.'</p>

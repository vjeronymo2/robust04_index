			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Motorola gets cash for global mobile telephone service MOTOROLA yesterday completed the Dollars 800m (Pounds 540m) first round of financing for a project to launch 66 telecommunications satellites to create the world's first global mobile telephone service. The scheme, called Iridium, is the first of several rival proposals to move beyond the drawing board. If it goes ahead, it will be the largest ever private sector aerospace investment. Iridium Inc has already signed a Dollars 3.4bn contract with its minority stakeholder parent, Motorola, to design and build the network. Motorola plans to start a service in 1998 that will allow mobile telephone owners to make calls from anywhere in the world. Other services will include paging and facsimile. The first round of financing for Iridium has attracted cash from companies in the state and private sectors in North and South America, Europe and Asia. US investors include Raytheon, the aerospace company, and Sprint, the telecommunications service provider. Stet, the holding company for Italy's domestic and international telecoms businesses is involved as is the Mawarid Group, a Saudi Arabian industrial group. Japanese investors, including Sony, Mitsubishi and Mitsui, have invested as the Nippon Iridium Corporation. Many of these investors will act as service providers to domestic and regional customers. Motorola has invested about Dollars 270m of the Dollars 800m. It expects its stake to fall to no less than 15 per cent as new investors join. The project has drawn in two new competitors in the satellite launch business: Russia's Khrunichev Enterprise, which builds the Proton rocket; and China's Great Wall Industry Corporation, which makes the Long March series of satellite launchers. Regulatory hurdles remain as Motorola competes with other proposed satellite telephone systems for approval from the US Federal Communications Commission and authorities in other countries. In securing the financing, Motorola has overtaken its rivals, which include Inmarsat, the mobile telecommunications co-operative owned by 69 national telephone operators, and Loral, the US satellite manufacturer.</p>

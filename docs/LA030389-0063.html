			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A 30-year-old man was in good condition after being shot early Thursday as he  fled a burglary, police said.  </P> <P> Edward Wilson was shot in the left arm after a burglary at the home of Joseph  Schimka, 55, in the 5000 block of Hilda Road, police said. Schimka told police  he heard sounds from the garage just before 3 a.m. When he went onto the porch,  he saw a man carrying a vacuum cleaner and yelled for him to stop.  </P> <P> The man dropped the vacuum cleaner and was running away when Schimka fired a  shot from a .45-caliber semiautomatic, police said.

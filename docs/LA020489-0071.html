			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . .: DADDY'S GIRLS  </P> <P> "Brilliant . . . yeah, you're brilliant . . . it's brilliant."  </P> <P> Brilliant isn't the kind of word you expect to hear from rappers, who generally  are bent on trying to prove how tough they are and often seem ready to pick a  fight. But it's a favorite of Sandra Lawrence, who with her younger sister  Timmy makes up the Wee Papa Girls, a London-based rap act that has been a hit  in England and makes its Los Angeles concert debut Thursday at the Palace in  Hollywood.  </P> <P> "We're the nice posse," says Lawrence, 23, referring to the "crew" of friends  and associates she and Timmy, 19, have assembled in London.  </P> <P> "There are some clubs we go to in London that have all these hard crews, and  it's a bit frightening," she says. "If we go we get stared at, 'cause we just  go there to grit our teeth and have a good time. It doesn't have to be like  that. But you have ignorant people who think it is like that."  </P> <P> Not only is the Wee Papa Girls' attitude a bit against the grain, so is their  music. Though inspired by American hip-hop styles, the songs on the new album,  descriptively titled "The Beat, the Rhyme, the Noise" (including a version of  George Michael's "Faith"), utilize the hyperactively pulsating foundation known  in England as "house" music. Clever production touches by the team of Two Men  and a Drum Machine (actually Andy Cox and David Steele of the group Fine Young  Cannibals) give the music more of a real song sense than much rap pieces have.  </P> <P> "A lot of English rappers like to pretend they're L. L. Cool J or Public Enemy,  which is fine because a lot of people admire them," Sandra Lawrence says. "But  we've got another side of English rappers who want to have their own style.  We're not sure what category to put us under. We're not pop, but we're not that  hard. We're trying to think of a fun word to use."  </P> <P> How about brilliant? STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Fedesarrollo [Foundation for Higher Education and  Development] has sounded the alarm: Drug trafficking money is  flooding Colombia. Money laundering is at the wholesale level  here. The measures adopted to control money laundering equally  affect legitimate businessmen.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] About $4 billion  from drug trafficking reportedly arrives in the country each  year. The most common method to introduce money is through  construction, cars, and many consumption goods like food and  presents.    [Fedesarrollo President Eduardo Lora] Almost every product  can be imported by purchasing it abroad using foreign currency  that was bought at very low exchange rates and used as money  laundering mechanisms.    [Reporter] The National Superintendency of Banks and the  National Customs and Tax Directorate are currently investigating  some 5,300 violations of foreign exchange guidelines that  businessmen, importers, and even banks have concocted. At least  90 percent of them are supposedly involved in money laundering.    [Bank Superintendent Jose Elias Melo] Financial institutions  are frequently involved in money laundering operations because  they handle money.    [Lora] The attraction stems from the slowness of the  devaluation process, which makes stashing money in Colombia more  profitable than stashing it abroad.    [Reporter] Colombia lacks legislation to control money  laundering. Meanwhile, measures to restrain lawful money, such  as credit restrictions, affect drug traffickers and legitimate  businessmen equally. [end recording]</p>

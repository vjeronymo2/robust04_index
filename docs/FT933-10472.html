			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / People: Littlewoods appoints thwarted purchaser Littlewoods Home Shopping Group has invited Harald Schroff, who is retiring from the main board of the German mail-order house Quelle as he turns 60 this September, to join its board as a non-executive director. There are still relatively few continental Europeans on the boards of British companies, though earlier this year Budgens appointed Hans Reischl, chief executive of Rewe, the German supermarket chain, to its board. Quelle, which like Littlewoods, is an unlisted, family-run company, had been one of several parties interested in buying into the British market by acquiring Littlewoods' home shopping business. Months of negotiations were however broken off in April last year when the Liverpool-based retailing and football pools group appeared to be unable to secure what it regarded as a suitable price. At that stage the company said it therefore intended to develop home shopping as one of its core businesses. Yesterday Littlewoods confirmed that it had got to know Schroff as a result of the talks, and that, as he was possibly the most experienced executive in the field of European home shopping, it hoped to gain from his expertise. Joining Quelle in 1957, Schroff had had a seat on the main board since 1980. In 1986, he was put in charge of the special mail order division as well as all of Quelle's activities outside Germany, which includes France, Austria and Belgium. When Littlewoods restructured at the beginning of the year, creating the home shopping and other groups out of what had previously been internal divisions, it said it would appoint non-executive directors to the boards of the new limited companies, when the right people came along. Schroff is the first such appointment.</p>

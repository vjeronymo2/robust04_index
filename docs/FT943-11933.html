			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / World Bank attacked for backing Nyerere World Bank loans exceeding Dollars 1bn to Tanzania in the 1960s and 1970s helped sustain a 'poorly thought out socialist experiment', according to a confidential internal report drawn up by the agency. The two-volume analysis of relations between the World Bank and Tanzania between 1961 and 1987 is highly critical of the support for former President Julius Nyerere's socialist programme launched in 1967. The report, obtained by the Financial Times, is still confidential, according to World Bank officials yesterday, though they said this may be reviewed in the light of the bank's new disclosure of information policy. Mr Nyerere nationalised the country's industries, and some 14m peasants and their families were compulsorily regrouped in 'ujamaa', or collective, villages in an effort to make water, health and education more accessible. But the badly planned exercise disrupted agricultural production. Since independence in 1961, the bank and other donors have provided nearly Dollars 16bn in aid. The largest single contributor has been the bank, while Sweden, Denmark and Norway have together provided Dollars 3bn. Scandinavian countries have been among the largest bilateral donors. The hitherto unpublished report, although compiled in 1990, five years after Mr Nyerere retired, throws new light on about the donors' share of responsibility for Tanzania's economic decline. Many of the issues raised, including problems of aid co-ordination, effective utilisation of assistance, and donor reluctance to disclose policy failures, continue to characterise current efforts to tackle Africa's development crisis. The document suggests that what it sees as Mr Nyerere's well meaning but impractical socialist vision was indulged by senior bank officials. Mr Robert McNamara, the former US secretary of state, was bank president from 1968 to 1981, most of the period covered by the report. The report criticises what it calls a 'stance of uncritical support for government policies' adding: 'Even where risks were noted, the board consistently reiterated that it was the bank's role to be at the forefront of social innovation and change, supporting new approaches to development even at the risk of failure. 'The bank's practice of choosing to accept and not to influence the development path led to considerable difficulty when the bank then sought to restablish some influence in the eighties.' The report adds: 'The bank accepted Tanzania's road to socialism enunciated in 1967 as a fait accompli.' Since 1967 and at least until 1980 the bank had viewed Tanzania 'as coming close to being a model developing country.'</p>

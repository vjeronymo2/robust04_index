			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Recovery 'still buoyant': Managers report a record increase in manufacturing activity The recovery is still buoyant, say two reports published yesterday - the day before the full impact of the government's tax rises starts to hit consumers. There was a record increase in manufacturing activity last month, the purchasing managers' index found, while a survey of investment intentions indicates that almost two out of three UK companies intend to buy a substantial asset over the next three months. The two reports will sustain hopes that the corporate sector can maintain the strength of the recovery by increased investment, even if consumer spending flags in the face of the tax increases. The purchasing managers' index rose from 55.5 per cent in February to 56.6 per cent in March, its highest recorded level. The index, compiled by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, is based on a weighted survey of variables such as new orders and suppliers' delivery times. Any level above 50 per cent represents an increase over the previous month. Mr Peter Thomson, director-general of the institute, said: 'Output and new orders have soared in the face of strong demand from the domestic market. There is every indication that the acceleration in activity will continue.' The companies surveyed also reported an increase in employment. The one discouraging note reported by the institute is that upward pressure on prices from suppliers' annual price reviews continued last month. The Lombard Business Investment Survey, conducted by NOP, finds 61 per cent of businesses likely to buy an important asset over the next three months, the same level as in December. About 68 per cent of the companies surveyed say that the tax increases will make no difference to their investment plans. However, there is a slight downturn in the proportion of businesses planning to acquire a substantial asset over the next 12 months. This has fallen to 77 per cent from 83 per cent in December. Mr Paul Gee, marketing director at Lombard Business Finance, said: 'Our overall assessment of the survey results is that, although investment intentions remain high, general business confidence is levelling off.' About 63 per cent of companies surveyed expect their turnover to be higher in real terms over the next three months than it was a year ago, while 12 per cent expect turnover to be lower. This positive balance of 51 per cent compares with 53 per cent in December. The Lombard survey shows a continuing pick-up in confidence in construction, but the transport and distribution sector seems to have been most affected by the prospect of tax increases. The sector's investment intentions and its expectations of increased turnover have declined sharply since December. The assets most likely to be purchased over the next three months are manufacturing equipment, construction equipment and information technology. There has been a decline in the proportion of companies intending to purchase telecommunications equipment, cars and commercial vehicles. The survey is based on telephone interviews with 451 finance directors.</p>

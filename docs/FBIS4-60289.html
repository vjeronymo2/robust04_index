			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] 22 May, SPA [dateline as received] -- King Fahd  Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz Al Sa'ud, the custodian of the two holy  mosques, and His Royal Highness Prince 'Abdallah Bin-'Abd  al-'Aziz Al Sa'ud, crown prince, deputy prime minister, and  commander of the National Guard, sent an exhaustive address to  the pilgrims on the occasion of the pilgrimage season of 1414 AH  corresponding to 1994. Here now follows the text of this  address.    In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. We  thank Almighty God for having bestowed on us the religion of  Islam, and for having guided us on the right path and made us  the best nation on earth that preaches good and avoids evil.  [passage omitted]    Brothers, delegations to the holy house of God, brother  Muslims everywhere! The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is pained by  the tense situation in most of the Islamic land nowadays. The  bloody situation in Afghanistan, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and  elsewhere causes regret, pain, and also worry. We have made  considerable and consistent efforts at all levels, through all  channels, and by all means to bring an end to the current  tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We pinned hope on the recent move  provided for in the agreement signed on 1 March 1994, concerning  the establishment of a unified state between the brother Muslims  in Bosnia-Herzegovina and their Bosnian Croat friends and  compatriots, which would end in the setting up of a  confederation with the neighboring Republic of Croatia. This  was thought to be a practical step acceptable to the parties to  the conflict, which would bring about security, peace, and  concord. [passage omitted]    However, this optimism did not last long because the Serbs  continued their aggression, defied the international community,  stood up in front of the successive UN Security Council  resolutions to halt the aggression and protect Bosnian safe  zones, and refused and continue to refuse to heed international  legality. This high-handedness and messing about can be  deterred only by a decisive international determination that  will move the efforts of the United Nations from the stage of  caution and courtesy to other states, and from hesitation over  the risk of an extension of the war zones into an energetic and  decisive military measure against all those who practice  high-handedness and injustice and challenge the international  will. Just as it has affirmed what is right and refuted  injustice and aggression, such a will can do away with the  arrogance and defiance of the Serbs, entrench equitable rights,  and impose peace that will ensure security and stability for all.    As an Islamic nation with more than 1 billion Muslims, we  must bear our responsibilities and apply pressure to impose  peace and stability in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and we must strive to  secure the safety of its people and come to the help of the  latter. [passage omitted]    Brothers, Muslims in all corners of the world. With hearts  filled with sadness and pain, we are following the gradual  deteriorating situation in Afghanistan. This is unacceptable by  any Muslim who is aware that shedding the blood of another  Muslim is prohibited by God. What is more, shedding the blood  of a Muslim by his brother is not only prohibited, but is also a  human tragedy and a historic precedent that is taking place in  an era of knowledge, education, understanding, and the promotion  of the values of mankind.    Despite all the justifications that are provided for the  continuation of the bloody situation there, fighting among the  sons of one people is an unacceptable tragedy. The destruction  of the country and the exhaustion of the Afghan achievements is  an irresponsible act by any material, ethical, and human  standards. Above all, it is unacceptable by the standards of the  pure Muslims jurisdiction that is against the squandering of  peoples capabilities and the violation of their rights to live  in security and stability.    We in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia did not expect to see  happen what has happened and is still happening in Afghanistan,  because we were convinced that the sons and leaders of  Afghanistan were aware that the shock of fighting in  Afghanistan, its motives, and circumstances would be disastrous.  [passage omitted]    What is happening in Afghanistan has tarnished the true  image  of the genuine Islamic Jihad that is carried out in the name of  God; yet this Jihad is driven by individuals' whims,  affiliations to groups and gatherings, and the conflict between  the sons who share the same faith and land.    Not only that, but what is happening there gave the  impression that individual ambitions that had emerged there had  become bigger than Afghanistan, and that the attainment and  achievement of these ambitions and interests take precedence  over everything else, even if this meant a long war between the  bellicose parties and turning the country into ruins because of  the spread of a civil war. [passage omitted]    Today, however, and three years after the Afghan state had  recovered its identity and sovereignty, we cannot find any  justification for what is happening there. The only  justification we can find is that this situation forms a part of  a huge plot that targets not only Afghanistan and the Arab and  Islamic states, but it also targets Islam and Muslims inside a  Muslim land that had witnessed the greatest acts of heroism and  gave rise to some of the greatest men in Islam.    What causes us real pain and real suffering, and what really  frightens us is to see Afghanistan, and for some long years, as  a source of concern, disturbances, and instability in the whole  world; after it had been a source of amity and peace on earth.  Do the leaders of Afghanistan really accept this situation?.  [passage omitted]    The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia does not blame any party at the  expense of another party for what is happening there, it  considers them all responsible for the continuing explosive  situation. It appeals to everybody to show a responsible stance  through which an end to the bloody phase can be reached; they  should look to the future with open minds and hearts; they  should put the interest and the people of Afghanistan above all  other considerations.    Only then we will open our hearts to all of them and welcome  them once again in Mecca, and for the last time, to agree the  foundations that they deem suitable to bring about peace and  stability to Afghanistan.    Brothers in God, Muslims everywhere: In spite of the  relative  calm in Somalia after a difficult period of conflict and  fighting among its various sections, nationalities, and leaders,  the situation is still vague and threatens danger at any moment.    The final reconciliation has not happened. Therefore, the  lying in wait by some sections for the others still constitutes  a danger to stability in that country. [passage omitted]    We thank God that our sons in Somalia have successfully  discharged their humanitarian duties in the best way, and they  are meeting with all appreciation and respect from all the  Somalis who have seen their efforts and benefitted from their  food and medical aid. What we have always hoped and wished for  is to see the brothers in Somalia arrive at a formula acceptable  to all of them, so that all parties get together in the service  of the Somali homeland, and all potentials and capabilities may  be put in the hands of a state able to save the country from the  causes of division and dispersion. [passage omitted]    Brother heads and delegation members, brother Muslims  everywhere. There are three basic issues that are now giving us  a great deal of concern and to which we attach considerable  interest. These issues are: First, the peace process; second,  security in the Gulf region; third, the situation in Yemen.    We in Saudi Arabia look forward to, and strive continuously  for security and stability everywhere in the world, and  particularly in our region, for our brothers and for all states  and peoples of the world. We thank God that the peace process  has gone ahead satisfactorily, and that on 5 May the Palestinian  brothers managed to attain with the Israelis a final agreement  in Cairo to hand over the authority in Gaza and Jericho and the  start of a new era of coexistence, and turn the peace efforts  into practice. We are happy to see the Palestinian brothers  begin a new era of exercising their legitimate rights on their  land, and Saudi Arabia will continue to stand on the side of the  just Palestinian cause until it gains victory.    At the same time, we look forward for more sincere and  constructive efforts by His Excellency President Bill Clinton of  the United States and his government to complete the peace  process and arrive at a just, comprehensive, and complete peace  in the region, and to define the remaining tracks so as to  arrive at the desired objective. We are convinced that the  remaining Arab brothers [Syria, Lebanon, Jordan] want peace and  seek to realize it, and no doubt they will find in the clear and  encouraging determination of the U.S. President to put an end to  the state of war in the region, with the help of all parties, a  sign of a wish for peace and an investment for the current peace  momentum as well. For our part, our efforts here in the Kingdom  of Saudi Arabia will continue in all directions to serve this  objective, whether in cooperation and coordination with his  excellency the U.S. President and his administration, or with  the Arab brothers, or with the other states and international  quarters interested in the cause of peace in the Middle East.    Regarding the situation in the Gulf, this country is very  eager to achieve a tangible cooperation between all the parties  concerned in sincere and constructive endeavor to remove the  causes of dispute between the six GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council]  member states and Iran. The beginning and end of these causes  lie in the fact that the brothers in Iran should commit  themselves to observe international conventions and standards  based on mutual respect and noninterference in the domestic  affairs of states, and give back the three islands [Lesser Tumb,  Greater Tumb, and Abu Musa] to the United Arab Emirates. We are  convinced that such a firm commitment will provide the factors  of trust required to establish constructive cooperation with  Iran for the good and interest of all.    Concerning the situation in Iraq, the fact that its regime  continues to cheat on the UN resolutions will prevent any change  in the regional and international positions to it. The Iraqi  regime must carry out the UN resolutions in full without  cheating, and when the current situation in Iraq comes to an  end, it is expected that the region will witness a stage of  stability and prosperity, and the Iraqi people will be the first  to reap its fruit.    When we review the current situation in fraternal Yemen, the  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia feels deep regret at the deterioration  of the situation there. We expressed our frank and fraternal  position on 5 May, when we urged the parties to the conflict to  seek arbitration in reason and logic, and to put the interest of  Yemen and the people of Yemen at the forefront of priorities.  We have said this and we continue to affirm it because the  security of Yemen and the stability of the situation there  interest us before others, and it is in our interest to see the  situation stable there.    Today, we reaffirm that realism in thinking and  understanding  between the parties to the conflict are liable to bring the  elements of security and stability to Yemen, and to spare it  dangerous wars and complete destruction.    Brothers in God, Muslim brothers everywhere. The oil  markets are living in changeable and unstable conditions, as a  result of which the producing countries within OPEC, at the fore  of which is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, have sustained great  sacrifices due to the drop in prices during last year, the  reasons and motives of which are not unseen by those who follow  up the circumstances of the commodity and the production levels  inside and outside OPEC.    We in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia firmly believe that this  situation will not serve anybody, on the contrary it will harm  us all producers and consumers and will be sharply reflected in  the world economic situation.    We do not need to warn against the absence of full  understanding between the producing countries inside OPEC and  the producing countries outside it, and also against the limited  level of coordination and cooperation between the member states  within the organization, that falls short of the level that  ensures the interests of all. However, we need to emphasize  that the time has come to draw up a firm policy and clear  strategy that will ensure the stability of the commodity and  spare it the changing political whims and climates and the  special considerations and circumstances through which some  countries are passing, which prompts them to pursue practices  harmful to everybody. It is in the interest of everybody to  seek the judgement of reason and logic, to consider everybody's  interests, and agree upon a new basis and criteria that is  dictated by the realities of the market, the production levels,  and the world consumption needs of energy and nothing else.  [passage omitted]    O brothers in God; O Muslims everywhere! Almighty God has  granted us the honor of being able to serve this country, of  assuming responsibility for the affairs of its loyal people, and  of being vigilant over their comfort, peace, and security and  promoting their interests.    We praise God the almighty and all-powerful that he has  enabled us to exploit the resources and potentials of this  country so that our dear country has achieved its present  position, to raise the standard of living and of the services  provided to the sons of our homeland, and to achieve prosperity  and development, both of which we are proud of. [passage  omitted]    Recently, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has planned extensive  and serious steps in the fields of organization and  administration and God has made us successful in issuing the  basic statute for the system of government, the statute for the  new Council of Ministers, the statute for the Consultative  Council and its establishment, and the statute for the regions  and attached regulations and complementary procedures in order  to put these statutes into effect and achieve more benefits and  progress for our people and our nation in the future.    The Consultative Council has begun to bear fruit and  participate in developing the various organizational means in  our country, and is playing a positive and effective role  alongside the Council of Ministers in serving and promoting the  homeland and its people.    The regional councils have begun to carry out their work in  such a way as to give rise to happiness and optimism. [passage  omitted]</p>

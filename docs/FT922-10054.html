			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Workers of the world disunite over holidays: Richard Evans explains why the standardised Eurobreak is still some time away THE COMPLAINT is no longer heard that the UK has fewer bank holidays than anyone else, although this remains broadly true. The difficulty now is to cope with those we have. The arcane formula used by the churches to fix the date of Easter has produced a closer bunching of public holidays than usual this spring. Having just returned from the late Easter break we are about to celebrate May Day, and then the spring bank holiday - previously Whitsun - will loom at the end of the month. The main culprit is the May Day holiday, which was introduced in 1978 by Mr Michael Foot, then employment secretary, in honour of organised labour and the right to strike. It remains a mystery why so symbolic a gesture to proletarian internationalism survived the Thatcher years. An added confusion over May Day is that while it is celebrated throughout most of continental Europe on May 1, in the UK the holiday is on the first Monday after May 1. There could now be a revival of pressure for a more even distribution of holidays, either with the introduction of another bank holiday in the autumn or the transfer of one from the spring. This idea is backed by the tourism and leisure industries as it would extend the holiday season and encourage people to take an autumn break in Britain. The suggestion of an October bank holiday was put forward last August by a National Economic Development Council committee, but it was received coolly by both the government and the Confederation of British Industry. The Department of Employment said an extra day could damage the country's competitiveness. The CBI said employers favoured the unbroken production run between late August and Christmas. The government's reluctance to transfer or to add another bank holiday may surprise other European countries, which manage to remain competitive while having more public holidays. The world league table is headed by Egypt with 22 public holidays and Brazil with 19. Even the dedicated workaholics of Hong Kong have 16, followed by Belgium with 13 1/2 , Japan, Spain, Portugal and Greece with 13, Luxembourg with 12, Germany, France and Italy with 11, the US and Denmark 10, and Holland and the Irish Republic nine. The UK has a modest eight, but here again there is confusion, with variations between England and Wales on one hand and Scotland on the other. In England and Wales there are New Year's Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, May Day, the spring bank holiday, August bank holiday (the last Monday in August), Christmas Day and Boxing Day. The Scots dispense with Boxing Day and Easter Monday but add January 2 to their Hogmanay break, and generally take the August bank holiday on the first Monday of the month. Some Scottish cities pick differing dates for their spring and August breaks, however, which make them less disruptive nationally. The phenomenon of bank holidays started to relieve the tedious grind of desk-bound clerks. There were as many as 40, usually in honour of saints, until 1830, when they were pruned to 18. In 1834 there was a further reduction to four - Good Friday, May 1, November 1 and Christmas Day. The idea of holidays by order was then formalised by Lubbock's Act of 1871, which enabled the banks to shut on four days a year without suffering any penalty for not paying bills which fell due on those days. Different traditions developed across Europe, and harmonisation of public holidays has not been seriously discussed within the European Community. The problems are apparent: For example, VE Day commemorating the end of the Second World War is a holiday in France, Belgium and the Netherlands, but not in Germany. Similarly, some religious holidays are rated very differently in Roman Catholic and Protestant countries. Whatever else might be standardised, the era of the Euroholiday is not yet in sight.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From Paul Cleary, AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW correspondent </F> in Hanoi and Geoffrey Forday]    [Text] Australian construction and engineering firms in  Vietnam have failed to make an impression on initial  international tenders for major infrastructure projects, despite  the Government's policy of using aid money to help them enter  Asia.    In the first international tender for major road building  projects in Vietnam, not one Australian company has been  successful in getting past the first round and being invited to  submit a formal tender.    The World Bank and Asian Development Bank projects to  rebuild  Vietnam's Highway 1, worth $US355 million, mark the first  instalment of an expected $US10 billion to be spent over the  decade on major capital works.    Ministerial documents show that out of a field of 150  companies, about 75 were asked to tender for both projects.  They include companies from South Korea, Malaysia, China,  Europe, Japan and the US. The results of the tender are yet to  be made public.    Leighton Asia has confirmed that it failed to prequalify for  the tender, although the company has established a presence in  Vietnam only recently.    John Holland's application, made in conjunction with the  Japanese firm Itochu, has also missed out.    Thiess decided not to enter because the tender was  considered  too competitive. A spokesman for Transfield declined to confirm  whether the company had applied to tender, although one company  source had earlier said it would take part.    To qualify, the companies were asked to submit detailed data  about their financial position, the amount of current work they  had on their books and the projects they had worked on in the  past.    The results of this major international tender raise  questions about federal government efforts to showcase  Australian construction companies in Asia. The recently opened  Friendship Bridge between Thailand and Laos, and a proposed $100  million bridge over the Mekong in Vietnam, are in part aimed at  putting Australian engineering on show in Asia.    Thiess Contractors' general manager for South-East Asia, Mr  Robert Logan, denied the company had lodged an expression of  interest in the Highway One project and pointed to the large  number of applicants the project had attracted.    Describing the tender process as a "free-for-all", Mr Logan  said that with 200 or more companies bidding for the project  "the competition was too great and too intense".    The general manager of Transfield's international division,  Mr John McGarry, said he was not aware of any unsuccessful  tender made by the company in Vietnam.    Mr Ross Baldwin, director of John Holland's Asian  operations,  confirmed that an expression of interest had been lodged for  some of Highway One's bridge work, and said that the company was  still waiting on news of the outcome.</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Unions threaten to ground BA in a summer of discontent BRITISH AIRWAYS faces a damaging summer of industrial disruption on three fronts, starting with a possible shutdown of its UK operations by its ground staff during the spring bank holiday weekend. The 18,000 ground staff and clerical workers are being balloted by the TGWU general union to support strike action against contracting out and the creation of subsidiary companies with what the staff say are inferior terms and conditions of employment. That result will be known on May 27, the eve of the holiday weekend. The union made clear yesterday that if it got the yes vote it expected, it would seek to ground BA's operations during the holiday. Yesterday voting also started among BA's 3,000 pilots on whether to strike over alleged threats to their pay and employment conditions. Their union - the British Airline Pilots Association - is warning that BA pilots could ground the company's entire fleet for the first time in 14 years. The result will be known on June 4. To add to BA's mounting troubles its cabin staff at London's Gatwick airport have already voted to take disruptive action. Their first strike was on May 2 and further 24-hour stoppages are expected in the next few weeks in protest at what the cabin staff believe is a threat to worsen their terms and conditions of employment. All three conflicts share a common theme, the belief among its staff that BA intends to drive down costs at their expense. The point at issue in the pilots' dispute concerns the future of short-haul flights from Gatwick airport since the airline took over Dan-Air last November. Dan-Air's pay rates and conditions of employment were markedly inferior to those at BA. But the unions fear the troubles at Gatwick have a much wider significance - that new agreements could undermine staff's benefits. Earlier this year BA established a new subsidiary at Gatwick for the former Dan-Air staff, European Operations Gatwick. BA then decided from May 1 to move three of its existing short-haul European routes between Gatwick and Frankfurt, Copenhagen and Malaga to the new company. The pilots and cabin crew affected have been offered alternative work during the next three years by either working on long-haul routes from Gatwick or moving to London's Heathrow airport to work on BA's short-haul routes from there. Cabin crew, and not pilots, have also been offered severance pay. Mr Jock Lowe, BA's director of flight operations, said yesterday that there was no question of any worker being forced to accept worse terms and conditions of employment. He added that the 116 former Dan-Air pilots at Gatwick would be brought into BA's master seniority list, enabling them to enjoy existing BA wage rates and benefits if they move to work in other parts of the company. The pilots' association said that it was prepared to work with BA on reducing its costs. Mr Chris Darke, association general secretary, pointed to the agreement reached 18 months ago, which he said had made savings worth Pounds 17m on BA's routes out of Birmingham, Glasgow and Manchester. He added: 'We are prepared for BA pilot's work to be transferred to the new subsidiary company at Gatwick and negotiate a realistic cost base for its operations there, just as long as none of our members is forced to accept inferior pay and conditions.' Yesterday Mr Lowe said he was confident the pilots would be 'sensible' and not back their union's strike call. BA pointed out that last year it lost as much as Pounds 35m on its Gatwick short-haul services. On top of that BA inherited a Pounds 48m financial liability as a result of its takeover of Dan Air.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, Feb. 16, IRNA -- A spokesman for the Atomic  Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), Ali Shirzadian, here  Wednesday strongly denied the recent allegations by London-based  Arabic daily 'AL-SHARQ-AL-OWSAT' on Tehran-Madrid nuclear  cooperation for military purposes.    Interviewed by IRNA, Shirzadian stressed that Iran's nuclear  program aims at peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and its  activities are within the framework of the rules and regulations  of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    The daily which is simultaneously published in London and  Beirut, in its Monday edition alleged that a Spanish nuclear  firm is to provide Iran with necessary technology to transform  its two nuclear installations for peaceful utilization of that  energy into plants with military purposes.    The daily claimed that the Spanish company is to sell  diversion technology to IRAN under a 80 million dlrs [dollars]  contract signed by an Iranian nuclear delegation in Madrid last  month.    The Islamic Republic of Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear  Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and has repeatedly announced its  firm adherence to it.    The official noted that Iran has always proclaimed that its  nuclear facilites are open to the IAEA and the agency's  inspection teams have repeatedly confirmed that Iran's nuclear  program is for peaceful purposes.    Despite the fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran has  repeatedly rejected such wild reports, some segments of the  western media are trying to portray Iran as a country which is  in quest for nuclear arms, regretted Shirzadian.    In a separate statement today, the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs also rejected rumours circulated by 'AL-SHRAQ-UL-OWSAT'  daily accusing Iran of seeking nuclear weapons.    The statment dismissed as "baseless" the daily's allegations  and called it part of the psychological war against Iran by the  arrogant countries and the zionist regime.    Certain media often lauch such fabrications of Iran's  cooperation with a third party, in a bid to poison world public  opinion against Iran's peaceful nuclear program and the peaceful  ends of its foreign policy and they want to undermine its  friendly relations with Spain, the Foreign Ministry said.    On December 2, Iran's permanent representative at the United  Nations, Kamal Kharrazi, announced at the general assembly  meeting that Iran is firmly committed to the establishment of  the Middle East as a nuclear free zone (NFZ).</p>

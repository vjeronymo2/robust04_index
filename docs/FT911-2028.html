			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Taking a gamble on BSkyB blockbuster deal: A look at the consortium's hopes for the satellite venture after yesterday's financing WHEN Mr Frank Barlow talks about just how much money he believes British Sky Broadcasting is going to make, he instinctively lowers his voice in case anybody should overhear. Has another hard-headed executive - in this case, the new chairman of the Pounds 1.4bn satellite television venture - succumbed to the lure of television and begun seeing imaginary crocks of gold? Mr Barlow, who is also chief operating officer of Pearson, which publishes the Financial Times, and his chairman, Lord Blakenham, are increasing the group's BSkyB stake to 16 per cent as part of a Pounds 200m financing agreed yesterday. Mr Peter Davis, chairman and chief executive of Reed International, is an equally hard-headed businessman who has concentrated Reed's focus on publishing and information. However, Mr Davis and the Reed board have decided not to participate in the financing, diluting the company's BSkyB stake from 10 to 3.7 per cent - although the group has more than Pounds 180m in equity, guarantees and loans still riding on the five-channel consortium. Mr Barlow and Mr Davis cannot both be right. If BSkyB, as Mr Barlow believes, will be making several hundred million pounds a year profit within the foreseeable future, then Reed's decision - the unanimous view of the board - will in time prove overly cautious. Yet, on the face of it, Mr Davis would seem to have a strong case for not throwing good money after bad. Since the merger of British Satellite Broadcasting and Mr Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television last November, combined losses have fallen from Pounds 9.7m a week. But they are still running at Pounds 6m a week - Pounds 3m in operating costs and Pounds 3m in financing charges. The consortium, which is probably bringing in revenues of about Pounds 100m a year, has still to reach its target of an annual cost base of Pounds 280m compared with the combined Pounds 590m at the time of the merger. The Pounds 200m new money is needed to take BSkyB to the end of 1992, still some way short of the publicly stated break-even point in 1993. There could be, as Reed fears, further calls on cash. Raising the money has not been easy for some other BSkyB shareholders. Pearson and Chargeurs, the French transport and communication company, are taking up the slack left by Reed. Granada, the television, leisure, and computer services group, will put in its share, about Pounds 25m. However, the company is under pressure from institutional shareholders because of its exposure to BSkyB and a Pounds 200m foray into the computer services industry. Mr Rupert Murdoch, fresh from a more than Dollars 7bn refinancing for his News Corporation, cannot easily put his hands on the Pounds 100m he needs to keep his end up. It is a measure of Mr Murdoch's commitment to satellite television and his determination that future profits should not be diluted that he has scraped together a package of cash and value, including film rights, to meet his commitment. 'BSkyB is an uneasy alliance of competitors; a marriage of News Corporation's operational management skills with the financial resources of BSB's major shareholders. Without both contributing to its future, BSkyB will fail,' argues Mr Terry Povey, analyst with stockbrokers ANZ McCaughan, who has made a detailed study of the satellite venture. But what sort of horse is it that apparently sensible people are putting their money on? BSkyB is, in effect, a subscription television film monopoly. Two of its five channels show only films and can only be seen by those who pay Pounds 9.99 a month for one, or Pounds 14.99 for two. The consortium has exclusive UK pay television deals with all the leading Hollywood studios and subscribers also get access to main sporting events. The BSkyB package also includes general entertainment and news channels. BSkyB channels are now available to about 2m UK homes through individual dishes or cable networks. An advertising campaign and special offers are boosting sales to 75,000 a month. More than 60 per cent of satellite viewers are also film channel subscribers. Recent market research for Satellite Finance, a specialist FT newsletter, forecasts that 54 per cent of existing film channel subscribers will buy the two-station, Pounds 14.99 package and 22 per cent have already contracted to do so. Home Box Office in the US and Canal Plus in France have already proved that pay television based on films can be a serious business. If Mr Sam Chisholm, BSkyB's tough managing director, can get costs down, if the business is not crippled by law suits from manufacturers left holding BSB's squarials and the shareholders keep their nerve, UK pay television might become an equally serious business. Continental Research group forecasts that by the end of the century 7m of the UK's 21m homes will have a satellite dish - not counting cable connections. It also predicts that ITV's share of television advertising will fall from 83 per cent to 70 per cent, with the Sky One channel taking a 10 per cent share. Independent analysts have created financial models for BSkyB's longer-term future, if it overcomes its short-term difficulties. ANZ, which based its scenario on an average growth of 40,000 dishes a month, forecasts an annual net cash inflow of Pounds 1.18bn by the year 2000 for BSkyB. A computer model constructed by European Media Business &amp; Finance, a new specialist publication, predicts operating profits of Pounds 375m a year by 1995, with dividends coming on stream by 1998. Finally, a study by Zenith Media Worldwide estimates that almost 40 per cent of UK homes will have satellite dishes by 2000. If those forecasts are even nearly right, BSkyB executives may yet be able to smoke the large cigars of genuine television moguls.</p>

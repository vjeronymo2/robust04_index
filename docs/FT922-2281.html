			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (7): Applying the brakes - Spain has gone from frenzy to second gear SPAIN'S CONSTRUCTION industry fell to its nadir just when it appeared to be at an all-time frenzy. In April the paint was still drying on the battery of new buildings at Expo '92, the world exhibition that opened that month in Seville and signposts were still going up on the 70 kilometres worth of city ring roads that had been built for the event. In Barcelona, where the Olympic games will be staged next month, a final sprint was on to complete stadiums, more expressways and a custom-built village to accommodate the athletes. Then, Seopan, the construction industry's association, delivered the bad news. Its newsletter said that - though it had little data to go on so far this year - everything indicated an 'alarming' mid-term future for its members. Cement consumption in January had dropped by 12 per cent against the first month of last year and construction jobs had fallen by 10 per cent in the first quarter. The most worrying statistic of all was that official tenders in the first two months of this year were 58 per cent down on the same period in 1991, totalling Pta108.9bn (Pounds 59.67m). It was the worst two opening months for the past five years. Mr Leonor Aresti, an analyst at Madrid brokers FG Inversiones Bursatiles, believes the construction sector will find the going very tough until 1993 as the depressed market, illustrated by the collapse of tenders, works its way through the balance sheets with an 18-month time lag. 'Tenders started coming down in the second half of last year' he says, 'and they will not begin to rally until the second half of this year.' The construction companies are already feeling the pinch. The Public Works Ministry, a notorious late payer in an administration that is not noted for the urgency with which it settles its accounts, has traditionally taken between five and six months to pay its contractors. Now the process is taking between eight and nine months and officials are hinting that delays might get longer still. Overall money owed to the sector is independently calculated at Pta700bn. The big companies can survive - the administration will pay in the end - but many of the small ones are in trouble. Small construction firms, which make their living from sub-contracts and which borrowed heavily during the boom years of the late 1980s, are the last in line to receive payments. The Spanish economy has changed down fast from overdrive to second gear. It has braked so sharply that the effect on some sectors, such as construction, is more punitive than it would be in economies that had never known such high growth in the first place. GDP, the gross domestic product, grew at an average 5.2 per cent in 1986-89. In 1990 growth was down to 3.6 per cent and last year it slowed further to 2.4 per cent. Growth this year is expected to be barely above the 2 per cent mark. Internal demand stood at 2.9 per cent last year, nearly two full points down on 1990. The Finance Ministry has in the meantime unveiled a convergence plan, which aims at righting economic imbalances and so have Spain ready to meet the Maastricht summit's criteria for Economic and Monetary Union within Europe in 1997. The bad news for the construction sector is that under the plan the budget deficit, which currently stands at 4.4 per cent of GDP, will be reduced annually by 0.5 per cent over the next five years. If there is a silver lining for the Spanish building industry, it may be found in government statements which indicate continued efforts to improve the nation's infrastructure. Finance Ministry officials say money will be saved on health and social security benefits but will continue to spent on education, on job training and on infrastructure, the three main areas where there is a clear competitive deficit with the richer EC economies. The investment programme that has now been completed with Seville's Expo '92 and the Barcelona Olympics has brought into sharp focus the pressing need for continued investment elsewhere. Thus Seville and Barcelona have revamped airports but Madrid's airport is woefully deficient; Seville now has a high speed train link with Madrid, but Madrid urgently requires one with Barcelona; there are four-lane highways linking Barcelona, Madrid and Seville but great swathes of these are already near saturation point. The Finance Ministry has said although the budget deficit will be cut, investment in infrastructure will go up by as much as 5 per cent a year until 1997. Unfortunately, the increase is to a large extent dependent on EC structural funds, the amounts of which are in doubt, and on private sector financing which so far has not been forthcoming. The construction sector is keeping its fingers crossed.</p>

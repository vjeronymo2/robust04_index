			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PAY BUCHWALD, STUDIO TOLD;  </P> <P> HUMORIST WINS FIGHT OVER MOVIE  </P> <P> Paramount Pictures Corp. was ordered today to pay humorist Art Buchwald for the  script idea that Buchwald said formed the basis for the hit movie "Coming to  America."  </P> <P> In a 34-page, tentative decision handed down in Buchwald's $5-million breach of  contract lawsuit against Paramount, Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider  decided that Eddie Murphy may have been given screen credit in 1988 for writing  the story that became the movie, but it was based on an eight-page treatment  written by Buchwald in 1982.  </P> <P> The decision, which most likely will become final within 10 days, opens the way  for a second phase in the trial, during which Buchwald and co-plaintiff Alain  Bernheim, a veteran Hollywood producer who worked with Buchwald on producing  the treatment, will be able to demand a complete accounting of the more than  $300 million that the movie has earned thus far.  </P> <P> Schneider did not specify a dollar amount for damages, so it was not  immediately clear how much money Buchwald and Bernheim stand to collect for  their role in the film. But Pierce O' Donnell, Buchwald's attorney, said the  figure could be between $5 million and $10 million. Paramount officials,  however, put their liability only at $250,000 -- the figure contained in their  contract with Buchwald.  </P> <P> "The court concludes that 'Coming to America' is a movie that was 'based upon'  Buchwald's treatment, 'King for a Day,' " Schneider wrote.  </P> <P> He added that the final movie, however, "is no less the product of Eddie  Murphy's creativity because of the court's decision" and reserved sole blame  for Paramount in breaching its contract with Buchwald and Bernheim.  </P> <P> "Finally, the court wishes again to emphasize that its decision is in no way  intended to disparage the creative talent of Eddie Murphy," he wrote. "It was  Paramount and not Murphy who prepared the agreement in question."  </P> <P> Paramount attorney Bob Draper said the studio will appeal immediately and  added: "Basically they (Buchwald and Bernheim) spent $1 million in attorneys  fees to make $250,000." He called the decision a "financial victory" for the  studio.  </P> <P> Paramount optioned Buchwald's story "It's a Crude, Crude World" seven years ago  as a possible vehicle for Murphy. The treatment was later renamed "King for a  Day."  </P> <P> The comedy about an African king who comes to Washington in the hope of getting  nuclear arms and winds up taking a bride home with him bears little resemblance  to the "black fairy tale" that Murphy said he was responsible for bringing to  the screen.  </P> <P> In the Murphy story, an African prince comes to New York in search of a bride.  Like the Buchwald character, Murphy's Prince Akeem winds up in the ghetto,  where he has a series of comic misadventures before he finds his queen and  returns to his homeland.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the contract called for Paramount to pay Buchwald and Bernheim if  a movie was based upon the columnist's original story.  </P> <P> The 1983 contract between the studio, Buchwald and Bernheim calls for them to  receive 19% of the net earnings of any movie that resulted from Buchwald's  story treatment. Paramount officials maintain, though, that the movie has not  yet earned any net profits.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL FOCUS ON GUATEMALAN ILLITERACY  </P> <P> Six-year-old Carlitos arrived on time for his first day of primary school in  San Juan, Comalapa, a small town 50 miles northwest of Guatemala City. But  despite his desire to learn and the full attention he gave his teacher, he  couldn't understand a word that was said. The instructor spoke only Spanish and  Carlitos spoke only Kaqchikel. The teaching method was repetition, not  participation.  </P> <P> Carlitos, who is now 22 and an economist, remembers that "it was like being in  a box without an escape."  </P> <P> Fifty percent of his classmates had to repeat first grade. Many took two or  three years to pass each grade until they reached sixth. Many more gave up.  Although Guatemala is not the poorest nation in Latin America, it is the second  most illiterate (Haiti is first) and has the second-highest dropout rate. Less  than 10% of those who enter first grade graduate from sixth.  </P> <P> "The school itself is the source of illiteracy; it is a center of failure, not  a center of learning," said Mario Leyton, an education consultant sponsored by  the United Nations Development Program and the U.N. Educational, Scientific and  Cultural Organization. "It is the scene of a confrontation of cultures."  </P> <P> The Guatemalan educational system is going through a radical change with the  support of the almost 3-year-old democratic government of President Vinicio  Cerezo. The curriculum from preschool to sixth grade is being transformed to  respond to the needs of the long-neglected Mayan majority of the population.  </P> <P> The Mayan Indians, more than half of whom do not speak Spanish, are further  distinguished from the mestizos (mixed Spanish descent) by their darker skin,  their practice of Mayan religion as well as Roman Catholicism and their  brightly embroidered, traditional clothing.  </P> <P> "Rather than promoting the current cultural confrontation and attempting to  integrate Mayan children into a dominant Western culture, the new curriculum  will integrate all children into a Guatemalan nationality that is  pluri-cultural and respects diversity," Leyton said.  </P> <P> Because there are 23 languages and cultures within Guatemala and further  diversity throughout the various regions, teachers in each school will have the  freedom to design a curriculum that responds to the needs of their particular  community.  </P> <P> For example, students in one region may learn mathematics in terms of  coffee-growing, the occupation most prevalent in the children's families.  </P> <P> The ambitious project began with $200,000 in seed money from United Nations  Development Program, the financial motivator for further donations, including  $1.6 million from the Netherlands, $600,000 from the World Bank and $180,000  from the United States Agency for International Development, in addition to $1  million from the Guatemalan government.  </P> <P> When the project is completed, teachers from all over the country will have  participated in the formation of basic but flexible curriculum guides for each  grade; they will know the language of the students and gradually introduce  Spanish as a second language while using the native language for instruction in  the first grade; more participation and practical activities will replace rote  learning; more visual aids will be used, and the entire process will reflect  individual community needs, such as classes being held in non-harvest seasons  when children are not required to work in the fields.  </P> <P> There are many reasons that parents do not keep their children in school. Some  Mayans see learning Spanish as surrendering to the Spanish conquerors. Others  lose patience after children repeat the same grade several times. The  repetition of grades also means a first-grade classroom has students from ages  6 to 15.  </P> <P> By reducing repetition, the project will make room for more students without  the need for building new classrooms. At present, the average Guatemalan  between the ages of 6 and 12 has 2.5 years of schooling; the project hopes to  raise that to 4 years.  </P> <P> "Success will guarantee economic, social and cultural development of all  sectors and will thus strengthen the democratic process," Leyton said.  </P></p>

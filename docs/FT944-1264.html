			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Observer: Toddling on In what possible circumstances would the UK government keep quiet until after last week's calamitous Dudley by-election the little fact that 100-plus jobs would be moving in the direction of the west Midlands constituency? For the Department of Social Security left it until yesterday to reveal that the headquarters of the Child Support Agency would be moving from London to Dudley - presumably with consequent positive, if modest, effects on the unemployment register. So does this signify a sudden bout of high ethical standards with regard to buying voters' support? The DSS says it would indeed have made the announcement earlier 'but for the by-election'. More likely explanation: acute awareness of the agency's dismal reputation.</p>

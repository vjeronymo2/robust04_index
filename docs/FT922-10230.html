			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities lower after profit-taking A HALF-HEARTED attempt by London's equity market to gather itself for an assault on the all-time high ran out of steam within minutes of the opening, and share prices remained on the retreat for the rest of a rather disappointing trading session. The FT-SE 100-share Index ended the day 10.8 down at 2,654.1. Behind the slide in share prices were earnings downgrades on some of the blue chip companies, and worries that the emergence of the UK from the recession may take longer than expected. A sizeable sell programme by one of the leading marketmakers also put equities under pressure. In the background, institutions were believed to be holding off from the market ahead of an expected rush of rights issues or cash-raising exercises. Trading got off to a bright start, with dealers marking prices higher in response to a 25-point gain on Wall Street overnight and the successful outcome to Tuesday's record-breaking gilts auction. Early minor gains were quickly wiped out, however, as the Footsie future began to lose ground. The expiry of the Footsie futures option saw prices drift off, stabilise briefly in mid-morning, and then resume their downward path for much of the rest of the day. A strong opening by Wall Street provided only marginal relief for London. At its worst, the Footsie index was almost 24 points off at 2,641, but it rallied to recoup half of that amount by the close. Equities were given no lead by a rather tired gilts market, where the longer dated issues closed with losses of around  1/4 . Index linked stocks, on the other hand, posted good gains. ICI's first-quarter figures were around the middle of the range of forecasts, but the shares lost ground in the wake of sustained profit-taking. The oil sector, among the market's worst performing areas over the past couple of years, showed signs of attracting domestic funds after strong US demand over the past few weeks. BP, especially, was very heavily traded. Turnover in equities was strongly boosted by another big individual placing. Smith New Court, the securities house widely acknowledged to be the UK market's bought-deal specialists, acquired 19.6 per cent in Transport Development from Swedish group Proventus and placed the stock with a number of institutions, taking a 4 1/2 p turn on the shares, according to dealers. Overall turnover in equities amounted to 720.7m shares. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew remains bullish of UK equities. The broker maintained its forecast that the Footsie will achieve 3,000 this year. 'Healthy levels of cash flow and liquidity should allow domestic institutions to maintain a reasonable commitment to UK equities,' said UBS. JP Morgan, the US investment bank, lifted its year-end Footsie forecast by 100 points to 2,900 to 2,950. 'Downside is limited while the potential for gains on our forecasts appears substantial,' said strategists at the US investment bank. BZW is more cautious and sticks with its year-end forecast of 2,750: 'The degree of sustainable upside is looking more limited after the swift post-election rerating.'</p>

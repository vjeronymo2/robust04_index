			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Nekrasova] </F>   [Text] Lvov 24 June TASS -- The Ukrainian National Assembly  (UNA), which has a combat paramilitary organisation UNSO  (People's Self-Defence), has become the initiator of the  formation of an anti-fascist committee and appointed Oleg  Vitovich, a nationalist from Lvov and people's deputy to the  Ukrainian parliament, as committee chairman.    UNA leader Anatoliy Lupynis, in an interview with the UNIAN  news agency, said the democrats and liberals were the  locomotives of political fascistisation in Ukraine.    It is noteworthy that it is precisely the selfsame democrats  and liberals who refer to the UNA-UNSO organisation as a modern  neonazi one, because its militants participated in the recent  military conflicts in the Dniester region, Georgia,  interconfessional strife inside the state, and now leave for the  Crimea for summer "holidays."</p>

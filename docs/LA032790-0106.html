			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMY CALLED CHINA'S BEST DEFENSE;  </P> <P> COMMUNISM: IT IS CALLED THE 'PILLAR OF THE PROLETARIAN DICTATORSHIP.' THE PARTY  CHIEF SAYS IT MUST PLAY A GREATER ROLE.  </P> <P> China's army must do more to defend the Communist Party's dictatorship, while  efforts should be boosted to eradicate the influence of Western-style liberal  ideas within the military, Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin said  Monday.  </P> <P> "No matter what changes may happen in the international situation, it is of  paramount importance for China to maintain stability," Jiang told army  delegates to the National People's Congress in remarks paraphrased by the  official New China News Agency.  </P> <P> The army is "a bastion of iron in defending the motherland and can and should  play a still greater role in ensuring stability," Jiang said, according to the  agency's paraphrasing. The army must "give better play to its role as the  pillar of the proletarian dictatorship," he added.  </P> <P> Jiang's comments reflect the current leadership's dependence on the military to  preserve dominance for themselves and the Communist Party and their  determination to solidify this power base.  </P> <P> "So long as China has the People's Liberation Army as its powerful backup,  attempts by these (Western) hostile forces are doomed to failure," Jiang said,  according to the official news agency, "and there is absolutely no way for the  socialist system to be abolished on the Earth."  </P> <P> Jiang, who heads China's 48-million-member Communist Party, sharply attacked  "bourgeois liberalization," a phrase referring to the spread of Western ideas  of democracy, civil liberties and capitalism. He warned against allowing the  "peaceful evolution" of China into a democratic, capitalist society.  </P> <P> "He pointed out that the high sense of organization and discipline of the  people's army is the main cause for the fact that the army is combat-effective  and can win over the enemy," the agency reported. "Therefore, he called for  more education in this respect and more effort to eliminate the influence of  bourgeois liberalization on some people in the army and the resultant laxity."  </P> <P> The People's Liberation Army played a major political role in restoring order  after the chaotic early years of the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung's 1966-1976  Cultural Revolution.  </P> <P> But for more than a decade after Deng Xiaoping emerged as paramount leader in  late 1978, stress was placed on building the army's professionalism and cutting  down its role in politics.  </P> <P> That trend was reversed when a hard-line group of mostly elderly leaders led by  Deng, President Yang Shangkun and Premier Li Peng called in the army last June  to violently suppress student-led pro-democracy demonstrations. Hundreds,  perhaps thousands, of Beijing residents and students seeking to block the  army's path were killed when troops shot their way into the city the night of  June 3-4.  </P> <P> Diplomats and other foreign observers in Beijing believe that many military  officers are angry about the loss of the army's prestige resulting from the use  of force against the people of China's capital city. But military leaders such  as President Yang and his younger brother, Yang Baibing, who ranks fourth in  the military hierarchy, have achieved increased political power.  </P> <P> Jiang, while lacking in military experience, heads the Communist Party's  Central Military Commission, a post that normally carries authority similar to  that of commander in chief. President Yang, however, is believed to exercise  greater real authority over the army.  </P></p>

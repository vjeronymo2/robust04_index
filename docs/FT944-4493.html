			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Banks urged to extend code The Code of Good Banking Practice, revised earlier this year, still fails to go far enough in setting standards, the banking ombudsman said yesterday. Presenting his 1993-94 annual report, Mr Laurence Shurman welcomed improvements in the second edition but was disappointed that the code had not been extended to small business customers as well as personal customers, as is the ombudsman's scheme. He called for a requirement that terms and conditions imposed by banks should be 'fair in substance' and hoped for more customer safeguards, such as an end to the acceptance of unlimited personal guarantees. The code of banking practice is a voluntary scheme, drawn up in 1992 on the principle that banks should 'act fairly and reasonably in all their dealings with their customers'. Complaints against banks fell last year but Mr Shurman found in favour of a higher proportion of complainants compared with the previous year. There were 8,027 preliminary complaints, a fall of 16 per cent. The number accepted for full investigation also fell - by 25 per cent - to 833. Full investigations completed numbered 1,095, of which 44 per cent were resolved in favour of the complainant with compensation demanded of the bank, compared with 36 per cent last year. The average award rose to Pounds 1,464 from Pounds 1,352 last year. Awards ranged from Pounds 5 to Pounds 53,250. The single biggest category of complaint requiring full investigation was mortgages and lending, followed by automated teller machines. The complaints investigated were much more complicated than in the past, especially the 21 per cent involving business accounts. Mr Shurman said that banks had to take more action against cash machine fraud, even if the cost of more safeguards outweighed the probable savings. A code of lending would help to prevent some of the bank complaints and customer misunderstandings about mortgages.</p>

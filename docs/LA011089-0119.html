			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING/FINANCE;  </P> <P> NATIONAL BANK OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NAMES EXECUTIVE VP AS NEW PRESIDENT  </P> <P> Mark H. Stuenkel has been named president of National Bank of Southern  California, a Santa Ana bank that saw its assets increase nearly 45% in the  last year.  </P> <P> Stuenkel, who was the bank's executive vice president, took over a position  relinquished by William H. Jacoby, who remains as the bank's chairman and chief  executive.  </P> <P> "We've been expanding rapidly, and we're continuing to expand," Jacoby said.  "So we needed to broaden the management base. It was nice to have a guy who has  been with us since we opened in 1982 ready to take over."  </P> <P> Stuenkel, who had been promoted through the ranks, will continue with some of  his most recent duties. His position as executive vice president was  eliminated, Jacoby said.  </P> <P> Stuenkel of Diamond Bar had worked at Security Pacific National Bank for 8  years before joining National Bank of Southern California.  </P> <P> The new executive post will free Jacoby to spend more time on policy matters  and growth plans, including future acquisitions.  </P> <P> Last year, the bank acquired Pacific Regency Bank in El Toro, which had  exhausted its capital after constant losses over its 4-year existence.  </P> <P> Jacoby said National Bank ended the year with nearly $200 million in assets; it  had $137.2 million in assets a year earlier.  </P></p>

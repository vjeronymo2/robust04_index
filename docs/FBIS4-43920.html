			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- The coalition crisis in  Berlin has been resolved. Following separate meetings of the  CDU [Christian Democratic Union] and SPD [Social Democratic  Party of Germany] parliamentary groups making up the coalition,  governing Mayor Eberhard Diepgen (CDU) told journalists today  that the two sides agreed that in the interests of the capital  they will continue their cooperation until the end of the  legislative period in the fall of 1995.    The differences of opinion over Interior Senator Dieter  Heckelmann (CDU) however have not been fully settled, it was  stated. The SPD still objects to the senator's behavior in the  affair concerning the contacts maintained by his spokesman,  Hans-Christoph Bonfert, with right-wing groups.    According to Ditmar Staffelt, the SPD's regional and  parliamentary leader, the SPD will not, however, submit a formal  no-confidence motion in the [Berlin] House of Representatives.  The majority of the SPD parliamentary group will abstain in the  vote on motions of no-confidence brought against Heckelmann by  the Alliance 90/Greens and the FDP [Free Democratic Party].    The coalition compromise allows Heckelmann to remain in  office. However the regional Office for the Protection of the  Constitution is to be separated from the Interior Ministry and  placed under the jurisdiction of the governing mayor. [passage  omitted]</p>

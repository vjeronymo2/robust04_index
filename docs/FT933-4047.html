			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Real world of stock valuations Sir, Tony Jackson, in his interesting article, 'Peril of losing touch with the real world' (August 13), concerning the fact that stock market valuations reflect economic expectations implicit in all the available economic and political data rather than current industrial performance, makes a fundamental error and is guilty of an important oversight. He declares, incorrectly, that dividends are paid from profits when they are clearly a cash cost of running a business and as such are paid out of cash flows. It is true that it is unusual that dividends exceed post-tax profits. It is by no means unheard of, though, in an age when institutions such as M&amp;G would prefer dividends to be paid even if a rights issue is required to repair the damage to the balance sheet from the cash outflow. He rightly notes, however, that the price/earnings ratio is 'one of the simplest methods of (share) valuation'. Indeed, in the US more attention is paid to the ratio of share price to cash flow, even if EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) is merely a proxy for the latter and thereby omits the cash-flow implications of capital expenditure and changes in working capital. His oversight lies in his failure to discuss the importance of the increased supply of capital to the stock market from investors, thereby boosting share prices and their multiples, when they find the yields available from cash and bonds relatively unattractive.

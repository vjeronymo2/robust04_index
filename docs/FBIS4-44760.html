			<p>CSO     [Text] A great future is being predicted for the mobile  telephone. By the year 2000 around 10 million Germans could be  mobile telephone subscribers. The entire telecommunications  field should by then have a greater importance in the national  economy than the automobile industry. Provided that the federal  liberalization and the elimination of monopolies proceeds  rapidly. And, not least of all, the natural, comfortable use of  the mobile phone--that is, its development from luxury item into  consumer good--should contribute to such rates of growth. At the  current time, however, being constantly accessible [by  telephone] remains a luxury. There are approximately 1.8 million  mobile phone subscribers in Germany who treat themselves to this  still costly freedom. It is primarily business customers then  who are acquiring [phones by] the only two competitors currently  in this market, the Telekom subsidiary DeTeMobil and the private  Mannesmann Mobilfunk.    That is supposed to change in May when E-plus wants to start  [operating]: this new company, under the management of Thyssen  and Veba, was officially granted a license for a second private  mobile phone network last May and was founded in April. New  focus groups, like the young, singles and regionally active  business people, will be targeted. The goal of the newcomer is  to conquer the mass market.    And without a doubt the structure of the market will change  greatly with the entry of E-plus: the buildup of the network  will be forced; the use of mobile phones will develop more  quickly into a consumer good; the initially strongly regional  company E-plus will bring about a change in the rate policies,  also in those of the competition, and thus a mid-term reduction  in price.    With the start-up of E-plus the market will finally be  opened  up. Since the new company does not want to present itself--next  to DeTeMobil and Mannesmann Mobilfunk--as the "third in the  alliance" of those who have been granted a lucrative license.  E-plus wants to act. We can well be curious about the marketing  mix. The suspicion that the two other licensees, to the  detriment of their initial customers, are trying in a "secret  alliance" to amortise their network as quickly as possible is  unresolved. Customers can hope that when E-plus enters the  market, then this often criticized "alliance" will break up.    If we look at the head start that DeTeMobil and Mannesmann  Mobilfunk already have now with the build-up of the network and  the acquisition of customers, then E-plus's strategy seems born  of necessity. The past year and a half have shown that the  market actually is growing more quickly than the optimistically  intended forecasts made at the start of D1 and D2 predicted: for  1993 the two [service] providers counted on 300,000 to 350,000  subscribers. Nearly a million customers, however, were actually  signed up by the end of last year. And the number increases  daily by two thousand. The reason is first and foremost the  unexpectedly large decrease in the price of the mobile phone.  The strategy of the newcomer could thus bear fruit, although it  will not be able to reach the profit zone until after the two  established [companies].    The rapid development in the mobile phone occurs, however,  in  the face of increased competition which is to the detriment of  some private providers of equipment and services. The price of  the equipment has dropped dramatically, and it is here that the  struggle for customers is already being waged. The calling  charges are actually relatively stabile. That leads to the  "English sickness" in Germany, too: the equipment is to some  extent sold below cost in the hopes that customers will be  industrious about booking "air-time," that is, will use the  telephone. The success of this strategy is hampered by the high  prestige value of the mobile phone. For many, the possession of  this phone is more important than the telephoning, especially  since that is very expensive. These customers, however, do not  make the business profitable for the now 13 private service  providers.    But also the three network providers are struggling with  starting difficulties. The old burden of structural difficulties  is giving DeTeMobil a great deal of trouble; Mannesmann  Mobilfunk cannot keep up with the high level of advertising  activity by DeTeMobil, which is written off as cross  subsidization by the parent [company]; and the newcomer E-plus  must after all start out with high investment costs [coupled]  with a simultaneous late start compared to the established  competition. Since in spite of some still existing "phone  service gaps"--the DeTeMobil and Mannesmann Mobilfunk networks  already almost blanket Germany now--E-plus must make due at  first with patchwork solutions. On the other hand, the start-up  costs are lower than for the two D-networks operators. The costs  for the infrastructure are estimated to be between twenty and  thirty percent more favorable than in 1990.    The way to the mass market is, however, also being smoothed  over by the newcomer. The new network is laid out in such a  close-knit fashion that telephones can be used which have a  substantially lower transmitting power than the phones in use up  until now, which also means the batteries will last longer. And  the smaller and more compact that the telephones are, the  greater will be their acceptance by the public. Experts predict  that in a while around 90% of the end units will be pocket  models.    When all networks are so built up that units with low  transmitting power are sufficient, the decisive [factor] in the  market success of the product will no longer lie with the  technology of mobile phones but rather and especially with the  marketing and thus also with the price. The Pan-European digital  GSM standard does not permit a great deal of differentiation. If  the price over the mid term approaches that of the [landline]  network, however, it will become clear that mobile communication  offers not only a complement by rather an authentic alternative  to location-bound telecommunication. Only then will the mobile  telephone enjoy the future which is being predicted for it.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Election post-mortem kept short - Delegates want to avoid dwelling on the defeat THE LABOUR conference's post-mortem on the election took less than an hour yesterday, squeezed between a European policy debate and the drama of National Executive Committee election results. Some delegates might have preferred it not to have taken place at all. The media, voters' distrust, a lack of appeal to women, misleading opinion polls, and campaign strategy mistakes were identified as the main culprits for what Mr Larry Whitty, party secretary, admitted had been 'a crushing disappointment from which we have yet to recover'. But conference delegates appeared unwilling even to discuss whether a fourth successive election defeat justified a more wide-ranging re-think. The shadow Budget or links with trade unions did not figure. The shadow communications agency - hated by the Labour left - was only mentioned obliquely. The only decision was to instigate a study of attitudes of women voters. 'The feeling is that the tide has come in and gone out again; it (the election result) is no longer relevant,' said Mr Phil Cole, a London regional organiser. He has just completed an analysis of Labour's difficulty in winning in prosperous areas of London. A lunchtime fringe meeting, 'Did proportional representation lose Labour the election?', offered hope of a more considered appraisal. PR was a focus of campaigning in the last week of the election campaign. But Mr Roy Hattersley, former deputy leader and the main speaker, was dismissive. 'Of course PR didn't lose us the general election. We lost the general election for a number of other reasons,' he told the thinly attended assembly. A frontbench spokesman, drinking late at night in the Imperial hotel, spoke as if the election result had been a personal bereavement; he had re-appraised his life but decided he had to go on as before. All this fuels the impression that the 'One more heave-ers' - those believing only a little more effort is needed for Labour to win the next election - are in the ascendancy. But there are many willing to play on what is perhaps the subconscious fear of many delegates: that the review of strategy, policy and organisation has to be far-reaching. Mr Giles Radice, the Labour MP, warned in a Fabian Society pamphlet this week that the party needed a radical shift in policy if it was to achieve the breakthrough in the south-east needed to defeat the Conservatives. 'There is a general view that we don't want to look back. Looking back is a dangerous thing for a political party - but I believe it is necessary,' he said. The lack of open debate is partly a product of the conference format. Mr Radice describes it as a 'sentimentalist' occasion, rather than an institution for careful analysis. Avoiding recriminations is also a good short-term tactic; too much introspection would only distract from turmoil in the Conservative party. Labour's standing in opinion polls is rising, boosting confidence and reducing the apparent need for change. At the same time there has yet to emerge a coherent programme for institutional or policy change that can command support among more than a handful of members. Even the voice of the left wing is marginalised - restricted in yesterday's debate to one complaint that the party manifesto had been just 'capitalism with a nice Labour face - it was political suicide,' from the Wirral West delegate. For many supporters of the leadership, Mr John Smith's election in July was a change in itself. As he left the conference platform last night, it must have been clear that the form and pace of reform will be largely up to him.</p>

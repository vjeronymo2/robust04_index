			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Gardening: When the garden goes to pot FLOWER beds are still ahead of themselves: for the rest of the year, I am pinning my garden's hopes on pots. In a pot, you can plant, plant late, re-plant, or move flowers to and fro wherever they are needed. You can sink potted lilies into borders and remove them, substituting Michaelmas daisies for a later season. When the roses have already peaked and the agapanthus are in bud late in June, half a dozen strategic flower pots lift the garden out of premature death. But they are best used with an art which we are still exploring. For years, I thought in terms of one or two varieties only, segregated pot by pot: a mimulus in one, a pelargonium in another, and envy for the very dark purple strain of petunias which seemed to be grown only in Sissinghurst's front courtyard. Segregation is still the rule if you want to grow shrubs or train climbers in a single pot. Many good roses will flourish in confinement, as you can infer from Peter Beales' fine book, Classic Roses, where they are marked with a symbolic P. Probably, we should all grow roses more often in pots, but the excitement has shifted elsewhere. A few brave spirits had always experimented, especially in great gardens like Powis Castle or Kiftsgate Court where the large pots housed mounds of mixed flower and foliage. In the 1980s, the art became bolder, propelled by amateurs but not by horticulturalists, whose handbooks still ignore the possibilities. Like others on the circuit, I learned most from Mrs Merton of The Old Rectory, Burghfield, near Reading. She massed dozens of different varieties into 27-inch pots, broke the rules triumphantly - and earned a colour photograph in the FT for June 1990. I return to the subject because we all have more experience now. We also have another book on the subject. Rupert Golby is an able garden-planter in the younger generation and his Container Garden (Headline, Pounds 16.99) has just appeared, illustrating 16 garden schemes for pots. The very best part is the final section where he prints a key to the plantings shown in each of the photographs. Some of his sentences read like captions for postcards to which I find myself putting an image. 'In summer, the garden at the Old Rectory has subtle hints of Mrs Huntington's past . . . ' and 'Mike was interested to discover which of several blue daisy flowers would perform best in the tazzas.' The most important section for us all, though, is a two-page interview with Susan Dickinson, who stands in the top flight of Britain's head gardeners. Service at Sissinghurst runs in her past, together with Hatfield and a long duet with Mrs Merton in which the two of them brought pot-planting to a new extravagance. She has now been signed up by Jacob Rothschild, although this book is rather coy about this unquestionable acquisition. In his grand garden plans, pots are still a priority and she has lost none of the old panache. I find that she agrees on the ignored secret of success: it relies on heavy feeding. She feeds the Rothschild daturas every day with a high-liquid nitrogen fertiliser: in dry weather, she also waters them three times a day, noting that it reduces the risk of red spider ravages. She even feeds the big-leaved sparmannia in a similar way although I have always found that it grows very freely, turning yellow - perhaps from starvation - on the lower branches. In 1992, she also fed all the petunias, heliotropes and lemon verbenas with a high nitrogen fertiliser once a week: 'They responded by producing deep green leaves and flowering madly until mid-October.' Everything else is fed on a high potash feed and the results confirm my own beliefs. The new style is to over-plant wildly in pots between 2ft-2 1/2 ft wide. Begin by placing a tall plant in the centre and then cram in more softly-coloured summer perennials than others would believe possible. It works like a dream if you follow the Dickinson principle and use concentrated fertilisers until mid-September. I have heard people say that designer-gardening in pots is very expensive and that it is an endless nuisance. On both points, I disagree, but readers of Golby's book may not immediately see why. He lists good sources for hand-made pots, but I hope that this high standard will not deter you from diving down-market. Last year, I made up the numbers with several Far Eastern imports, on sale for less than Pounds 10 each at the Hampton Court flower show. I have just found some thin 'terracottas,' nearly 2 ft wide, selling at Pounds 6 each in the local garden centre. They will probably split in a very hard winter but, at that price, who cares? Golby reiterates a tip which I, too, find useful for toning down the brightness of the cheapest type of pottery. Wet the surface; rub it with dry garden lime; spray it lightly with water again and, after several attempts, it will lose the colour of a pot on a patio on the Costa Brava. As for the bother, watering is the worst of it. Here, Golby recommends lining each pot with a polythene bag to limit loss of water through its walls. He does not mention a trick which saved me even more trouble last year. When preparing the soil, mix in some water-retaining crystals, following the instructions about watering them first. The most widely-marketed is Swel Gel, which is satisfactory if you need to buy only in small quantities. It swells into long-lasting lumps of jelly and cuts down the watering of flower pots by as much as a half. You can even go away for a long weekend without fear. Lastly, what exactly were those 'blue daisy flowers' which Mike was so interested to discover? Mike is busy discovering at Kew, and he has come to the conclusion which most gardeners share, anyway: that the longest-lasting half-hardy little blue daisy on the market is Felicia Santa Anita. Perhaps he has also discovered that you can easily train it with one central stem into the shape of a small standard: if not, you and Mike might like to try it, because it adds a touch of height in a family which otherwise sprawls.</p>

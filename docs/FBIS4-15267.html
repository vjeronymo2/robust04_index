			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "FITUR Urges People To Form Columns"] </F>   [Text] May Day -- the day of working people's solidarity --  is approaching. We are greeting it at a difficult time for  Russia. The overwhelming majority of working people, an appeal  by the FITUR [Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia]  to the country's trade union organizations and labor collectives  says, are concerned at the unstable socioeconomic and political  situation, the wholesale slump in production, and the growing  unemployment. Voices are being heard increasingly loudly  protesting at the improverishment of vast sections of the  population and at the very flagrant violation of people's  constitutional rights in view of the failure to pay wages for  many months, the reduction of social programs, and the rampant  crime.    The president, parliament, government, and various  sociopolitical forces are calling for the attainment of  universal civil accord in Russia as the chief condition for  extricating the country from the profound economic and social  crisis. The FITUR supports the idea of civil peace, the appeal  states, seeing this as a real way to resolve very acute social  problems. At the same time, expressing the will of working  people, we demand the adoption of urgent measures to ensure:    the ending of the production slump, support for Russian  entrepreneurship, and the resolution of problems of reciprocal  nonpayments;    guarantees of the full and timely payment of wages;    the adoption of a state employment program to avert the  threat of mass unemployment;    citizens' security on a firm legislative basis.    The FITUR urges working people actively to support these  demands and to display the solidarity of working people in the  struggle for their rights by participating in the May Day events.</p>

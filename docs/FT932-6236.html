			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Russian gold mines seek foreign cash PLANS ARE being drawn up for the partial privatisation of Russia's under-capitalised gold mining industry at a time of continuing uncertainty for potential foreign investors, according to Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, chairman of Russia's committee for precious stones and metals. Mr Bychkov said gold output had fallen 6 to 7 per cent last year to 146 tonnes, a level of output which he hoped would be maintained this year. He also said he believed the level of exports would 'not significantly' change from the 98 tonnes sold abroad last year, the proceeds of which were paid to producers. He said official reserves held by his committee came to 200.5 tonnes in May while those held by the central bank had totalled 133 tonnes in January. Mr Bychkov said the specifications for privatisation of gold production would be contained in a decree now being drafted for President Boris Yeltsin. But he ruled out large-scale transfer of shares to workers because the industry needed big capital investment which employees could not afford. The only items to be excluded from privatisation would be sorting and refining operations, he said. He did however reverse an earlier statement saying that no foreign companies should be able to exploit Sukhoi Log, the country's biggest hard-rock gold deposit.</p>

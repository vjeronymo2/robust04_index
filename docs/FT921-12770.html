			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Battle for hearts and minds in Central Asia: Fundamentalist and mainstream Moslems, writes Tony Walker, are fighting for influence in new nations NOWHERE is the creation of a clutch of new central Asian states from the old Soviet Union being watched more obsessively than in the capitals of moderate Arabs fearful that the balance of influence in the Islamic world may be altered to their disadvantage. While the moderates held sway at a recent meeting in Dhakar of the Islamic Conference Organisation, they cannot be at all confident that Islamic institutions will remain firmly in their grip in light of a restless Iranian challenge and the addition of new and possibly militant members. Beyond worries about control of Islamic institutions, the moderate Arabs, plus Turkey, are also concerned that the newly formed Islamic states of central Asia will provide moral and political support for fundamentalists throughout the Middle East at a time when political Islam appears again to be on an upswing. Intriguingly, Egypt and Saudi Arabia have joined in an attempt to counter developments in the former Soviet republics possibly detrimental to their own interests and to Sunni (mainstream) Islam. Saudi money and Egypt's abundant ulema, or religious guides, are being mobilised to spread the word in central Asia in competition with the militant Shi'ism of Iran. Religious notables from the former Soviet republics have also been invited to Cairo for what is known as 'Preacher's Day' early next month, and Islamic teachers will participate in courses on contemporary Islam run by the al-Azhar religious authorities in the Egyptian capital. Mr Mohammed Mahjoub, Egypt's religious affairs minister, was quoted last week as saying pointedly that 'we are approaching a very critical stage. In this stage, Egypt, representing religious moderation, must lead in showing the magnanimity of Islam.' Mr Mahjoub's remarks coincided with worrying (for Arab moderates) developments in Algeria, where the military felt obliged to cancel democratic elections that would have resulted in an overwhelming victory for the Islamicists. The constitutional coup in Algeria and reaction to it across the Middle East exposed tensions and differences between moderate and militant regimes in the wake of the Gulf crisis, adding further to the region's unsettled mood. Algeria's new military rulers reacted bitterly to criticism voiced by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who declared that Algerian Moslems would defeat 'Satanic plots'. Algiers recalled its ambassador to Tehran and asked Iran's representative to leave. Algeria also announced that it would stop representing Iran in the US because of the 'virulent Iranian press campaign seeking to hit (Algeria's) vital interests'. The argument between Algiers and Tehran might be dismissed as one of the region's periodic spats, but Iran efforts to play a more conspicuous role regionally invests it with greater significance. Mr Fahmi Howeidi, Egypt's leading Iran specialist, believes, however, that worries among moderate Arabs about Iran's intentions are exaggerated. He says its present activism should be viewed against a background of coming elections for Iran's parliament. Mr Howeidi says that manoeuvring for control of the Majlis, which was elected in 1988 and therefore the militant sway of the late Ayatollah Khomeini, has obliged Mr Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the pragmatic president, as the upholder of the Ayatollah's crusading vision, to act in order to outflank the extremists and secure victory for his own people in the election. The Egyptian specialist said it would make no sense for Iran, which has invested much recently in wooing moderate Gulf regimes and improving its profile in the west, to appear to be fomenting trouble in the Arab world. But, while concern about Iranian intentions might be exaggerated in Arab capitals, it seems inevitable that competition in central Asia will cause tensions with both the moderate Arabs and with Turkey, which is also understandably staking its claim for influence. Iran's own concern about developments in the six new states to its north and especially in neighbouring Azerbaijan (the only one of the six where Shia predominates) stem partly from worries about possible separatist tendencies of its own minorities. While Turkey was the very first country to recognise Azerbaijan, Iran delayed. This caution also extended to Tehran's recognition of the other newly independent states. Evidence of Iranian sensitivity about developments on its borders came recently with criticism in the English-language Tehran Times, close to President Rafsanjani, accusing Turkey of seeking to inflame nationalist sentiment in central Asia. Diplomatic wariness has not, however, stopped Iran from seeking actively to woo these states. In December, Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister, visited all six: the five Moslem-dominated republics of Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kirgizia, and half-Moslem Kazakhstan. Arab moderates not only want to try to ensure that the newly formed central Asian states become part of a pragmatic and western-leaning Islamic axis, but, perhaps more importantly, they wish to counter transfers of advanced military technology, and possibly even nuclear know-how, to Middle East radicals. (Kazakhstan is home to part of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal). Writing in the Kuwaiti daily Sawt al Kuwait, Mr Hassan Abu-Taleb, of Cairo's al Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, voiced some of the alarm felt when he observed: 'In the chaos accompanying the disintegration of the communist superpower, the chances are high that what lies ahead is a period of uncontrollable nuclear proliferation that could transfer the arms to a number of other states and - even more dangerously - to 'unknown groups' that could use them to blackmail the entire world.' Other Egyptian commentators have taken up a similar theme. The weekly publication Rose el-Yousef, commented that: 'Whereas the Arabs once needed to deal only with the central Soviet authority, they must now establish urgent and energetic contacts with all the independent states .. If we don't move now, those (Iran and Turkey) will beat us to close relations with the new countries.'</p>

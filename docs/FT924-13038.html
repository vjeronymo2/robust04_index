			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Letter: Salt in wound for engineers Sir, I was incensed by your article 'Engineers' salaries outstrip inflation' (October 8), which states that the average annual earnings of a chartered engineer are Pounds 31,768. My colleagues and I at Rolls-Royce are earning between a half and two-thirds of this sum; somewhat less than the figure quoted for support technicians. I do not believe that our company's salaries are that much below the average. It is galling enough to earn half as much as our European counterparts without having the results of what appears to be an unrepresentative sample rubbing salt in the wound. As as for recommending the profession to young people, I know of no one who would do so unless the person concerned was fluent in a foreign language and could work abroad.

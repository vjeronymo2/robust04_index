			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (31): Farmers seek fairer deal - The government's food policy is blamed for depleted food stocks INDIA IS again, after more than two decades, shopping abroad for foodgrains, reviving memories of the 'ship-to-mouth' days 30 years ago when emergency imports had to be made from the US. The situation is clearly not so bad now, but that the country is once again planning to import 1m tonnes of wheat after attaining surpluses for the past 20 years must raise questions about what has gone wrong with Indian agriculture and the green revolution. It also raises questions about India's food policy, a related issue, and whether the farmers are getting a fair deal at a time when they are organising themselves after centuries of passive docility. Do farmers get the right incentives? The government has raised procurement prices (the price at which official agencies buy grain from the markets) progressively by more than Rs100m over the past four years. Despite this, the depleted food stocks have not been replenished this year. Wheat stocks stand at the level of around 11m tonnes after the procurement season is virtually at an end. Official agencies will clearly not buy enough to meet the target of 9.5m tonnes of wheat from the farmers, simply because the latter are getting more than the minimum support price (or the procurement price) from private traders. Traders have offered stiff competition to the official agencies. They are believed to be hoarding their purchases (as also are rich farmers, who have not brought all their surplus wheat to the market) because they expect shortages to occur in the near future and are waiting for prices to rise. Such speculation is possible because the food policy has not been recast to cope with the shortages. Belatedly, the government offered a 'bonus' of Rs25 a quintal above the minimum support price when farmers fought shy of selling wheat to the official agencies. This still does not match the prices offered by private traders and hence the poor procurement that will fail to make up depleted stocks. Much of the farmers' resistance to the government's policies have come from the northwestern states of Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. This is where the green revolution took root and enabled the country to raise total foodgrain production from a low 82m tonnes in 1960-61 to 176m tonnes last year. Even this impressive growth in production is now not enough. Food- grain production has increased at an average of 1.7 per cent a year while the population is rising at around 2.2 per cent. Far from providing surpluses for export, as the government had hoped for, present produc- tion is not enough for the population. Last year, the monsoon arrived a month late and this upset sowing and harvesting plans in the northwestern states. The fall in production that followed underlines the fact that Indian agriculture, for all the progress the green revolution has made, is still dependent on timely and ample rains, particularly during the monsoon season. Only a third of India's arable area is irrigated. This raises questions about irrigation pol- icy and whether dependence on large projects was the right answer. Far more has been achieved by successful exploit- ation of ground water res- ources in Punjab and Haryana, where easy availability of minor irrigation schemes has gone a long way towards better use of fertilisers and high- yielding varieties of seeds, the basis of the green revolution. At the same time, it must be emphasised that the current crisis should not detract from the undoubted progress that Indian agriculture has made. Even in a bad monsoon year - and this year will probably record another poor rainfall season and cause fresh problems of food management - a minimum potential has been built up and this is growing every year. Unfortunately, the population is growing faster - and the farmer is getting wiser - and production in good monsoon years is not sufficient any longer to make up the shortfall in bad years. The situation is made more serious by the lack of an agriculture policy, which three successive governments have promised but failed to produce. Political pressures are behind this since the farmers, after all, are an important vote-bank. The policy will have to secure a better deal for the farmers and the government's economic reforms do not provide one, at least in the short term. Fertiliser prices have been raised and are to be raised further as the subsidy on fertilisers is withdrawn. Electricity charges are to be economic and seeds will cost more. All this cannot be spelt out in the policy for political reasons, especially when the farmers are organising themselves and seeking that the rural masses should be treated as 'equal citizens'. At present, they believe they are not and clearly the terms of trade operate in favour of urban dwellers. As the farmers have discovered, if they hold out against the official procurement agencies which, they believe, pay them a much lower price than is their due, they can win better prices. The present shortages - and the expected fall in production next year because a good monsoon is not expected  -are working in their favour. Farmers' leaders point out that in the last five years, only 21.8 per cent of total development expenditure was spent on agriculture, rural development, irrigation and special area programmes. Even if social services are included, not more than 24 per cent of the total went to improve the lot of the farmers, who constitute nearly 80 per cent of the population. They also point out that between 1970-71 and 1988-89, production of wheat went up by 71.4 per cent but the support price of wheat compared to wholesale prices of all commodities went down by 44.7 per cent. The result was that the real income per hectare of wheat growers went down in spite of the substantial increase in production. Farmers believe that the present crisis, which they are undoubtedly exploiting, caused by inadequate availability of foodgrains, is not due to any deficiency in agricultural practices or the laziness of the farmers but because of flawed price and trade policies. Unless farmers are thought of as human beings and not as machines, production will continue to fall behind the growth of population. Unfortunately, the economic reforms have nothing to say about their problems.</p>

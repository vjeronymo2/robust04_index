			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / An elegy to young graduates - Summer rites THERE IS more than a hint of the passing-out parade on graduation day. As they watch their charges march beyond the gentle garrisons of academia, most lecturers are glad not to be going where the graduands are bound: it is an altogether rougher place. Gilded youth is not, these days, uncluttered. The Volvos are out in force, to gather up the baggage of learning: the TV, the CD, the ice hockey pads, the mountain bicycle not yet nicked. It is a labour that most parents undertake gladly, for they see this as a coming of age, of sorts. The hand that takes the degree waves goodbye to the paternal chequebook. That is how the arrangement ought to function. Fathers may be seen happily capering under college portals at the thought of it, though soon, no doubt, some will find the arrangement only honoured in the breach. Gilded youth shimmers out to parade through town so as to show local New Agers and vagabonds what it is to be an Adequately Launched Young Adult. Thence to a ceremony made numinous by a coalition of three ingredients. First, it is essentially for the benefit of spectators. Second, it is staged in such a way that the spectators shall understand none of it (Latin, Welsh or Gaelic are commonly used, furthering the fiction of dons at ease in all the ancient languages). Third, all the protagonists wear the garb of crows or bats. Some carry floppy black fishcakes on their heads, others sport crests of bright plumage. As a general rule, the gaudiness of the plumage correlates inversely to the distinction of its awarding institution. Once upon a time, a dose of hocus-pocus and a tap on the head with the Bible was enough to send gilded youth on its way. This is not so now. The managerial navigators of today's universities have an eye to the future: graduands are assiduously cultivated from the moment their diploma is in the bag. Indeed, they may even be handed their degree certificate in a (heraldic) plastic carrier bag, which contains all the necessary paperwork for the imminently prosperous to unload the burden of their prosperity on to the alma mater. She stands there with open arms, or at least an extended palm. At some juncture a speech must be made. Whether witty or dull, it must be portentous. It must mention straitened prospects, reduced circumstance and hostile forces on the margins of the campus or the cloisters. Latin will not be used: this is a message that has to get across. The graduands - and for that matter their great-aunts and younger sisters - are being mobilised for the advancement of learning. One day, perhaps, one of them will hold the purse-strings, and since holders of purse-strings habitually get third-class degrees, the speaker will make a point of congratulating everyone present, even if they got through three years without ever distinguishing the university library from the local fire-station. Ordeal by sherry or something Liebfraumilky follows. Strawberries pop up, as they will on such occasions. Stilettos plunging nicely in the learned turf, mothers who could all be the Duchess of Kent lose their offspring and find themselves either next to the don with no small talk or the don struggling with the periphrasis of polite conversation. 'Oh yes, Jason was well to the fore on the rugby field' (meaning: if Jason ever did turn up to a seminar, it was breathlessly, and wearing repellent lycra shorts). Or: 'Samantha is something of a rara avis, isn't she?' (meaning: Samantha, having arrived as a convent-reared English rose, now trudges around under a pile of matted pink hair and a crucifix through each nostril). Ah. To those who have suffered all - mortgage, marriage, equity, negative equity, marriage again - this ritual, sometimes likened to the processing of sausages, is hedged about with an elegaic sadness that sausage-makers surely never feel. But the sadness is short-lived. Clear the graduates out. Tomorrow, new applicants arrive.</p>

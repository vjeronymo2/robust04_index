			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FDIC would have the discretion to disqualify any or all contracts from netting treatment for risk-based capital purposes if the bilateral netting contract, individual contracts, or associated legal opinions do not meet the requirements set out in the applicable standards. In the event of such a disqualification, the affected individual contracts subject to the bilateral netting contract would be treated as individual non-netted contracts under the standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a general matter, relevant legal provisions for banks in the U.S. make it clear that netting contracts with close-out provisions enable such organizations to setoff included individual transactions and reduce the obligations to a single net amount in the event a counterparty fails to perform due to default, insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or similar circumstances. The FDIC notes that pursuant to section 11(e) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), 12 U.S.C. 1821(e), the FDIC, in its capacity as conservator or receiver of a failed insured depository institution, may transfer all or none of a failed institution's qualified financial contracts (QFCs) <FOOTCITE> <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> </FOOTCITE>  with a given counterparty and its affiliates to an assuming insured depository institution. Such a transfer by the FDIC as receiver, if accompanied by the statutorily mandated notice, overrides any contractual right the counterparty might otherwise have to terminate, close-out, and net its contracts by reason of the appointment of the FDIC as receiver. Further, the FDIC as conservator may, under section 11(e) of the FDI Act, enforce continued performance of QFCs without transferring them, even if the contracts contain clauses that would otherwise enable the counterparty to treat them as in default, and hence to terminate and net them, by reason of the appointment of a conservator. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The scope of this transfer power is established in the FDIC Statement of Policy on Qualified Financial Contracts adopted December 12, 1989. The term QFC is defined in section 11(e)(8)(D)(i) of the FDI Act. It includes securities contracts, commodity contracts, forward contracts, repurchase agreements, swap agreements, and any similar agreement that the FDIC determines by regulation to be a QFC. Interest and exchange rate contracts, as specifically referred to in the risk-based capital guidelines, are generally QFCs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Fed), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) (collectively, the other banking agencies) either have published or are in the process of publishing notices of proposed rulemaking amending their risk-based capital guidelines which are similar to the FDIC's proposal. The other banking agencies are not addressing the scope of the FDIC's transfer and enforcement powers under section 11 of the FDI Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FDIC is of the opinion that its transfer and enforcement powers under the FDI Act are consistent with the netting provisions of the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). Those provisions specifically sanction the enforceability of bilateral netting contracts (12 U.S.C. 4403(a)); so do the FDI Act's QFC provisions (12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(8)(A)(iii), (E)(iii)). The FDIC's transfer and enforcement powers, described in the text, are associated with its power to override a different kind of contractual provision_the so-called ``ipso facto'' clauses that permit a counterparty to terminate a contract by reason of the appointment of a receiver or conservator even if there has been no default in performance. Although such clauses may activate netting clauses, they are not themselves specifically addressed in, or protected by, the FDICIA netting provisions. Thus, there is no conflict of language between the FDI Act's QFC provisions and the FDICIA netting provisions. Nor is there any inconsistency in the statutes' underlying policy. The policy of the FDI Act's QFC provisions, like that of the FDICIA netting provisions, is to preserve a counterparty's net position: If the FDIC does not transfer or enforce a counterparty's QFCs, then the contracts may be terminated and netted to the extent provided by their terms; and if the contracts are transferred or enforced, then the netting provisions continue in force as a part of the entire complex of contractual obligations. The transfer and enforcement provisions of the FDI Act do no more than to preserve the continuity of contractual relationships in cases of receivership and conservatorship, an effect that the FDIC believes to be consistent with the letter and spirit of the FDICIA netting provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event that QFCs are transferred from a failed institution to a new depository institution, the amount of credit risk the non-failed counterparty is exposed to remains the same. Thus, the netting provisions in the contracts may be enforced against or by the assuming insured depository institution in the event of a subsequent default. Therefore, the FDIC would not regard a netting contract as unenforceable, for risk-based capital purposes, simply because the FDIC as receiver might transfer it within the limited circumstances prescribed in section 11(e) of the FDI Act. In the case of QFCs enforced without transfer by the FDIC as conservator, the counterparty would continue to enjoy its contractual rights to terminate and net such enforced contracts by reason of a default in performance (as distinct from a contractually defined default by reason of appointment of a conservator). In this regard, the FDIC would not regard a netting contract as unenforceable simply because the FDIC as conservator might enforce the underlying contracts within the circumstances prescribed in section 11(e) of the FDI Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> To facilitate the utilization of risk reducing bilateral netting contracts which will permit institutions to take advantage of the new capital standards prescribed in this proposal, the FDIC has determined not to exercise any potential power as a conservator selectively to enforce or to repudiate QFCs with the same counterparty that are subject to a bilateral netting contract. The FDIC would not regard bilateral netting contracts as unenforceable solely by reason of the apparent presence of such a power in section 11(e) of the FDI Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

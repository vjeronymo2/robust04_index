			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOTUS TO BUY ATLANTA TECH COMPANY FOR $65 MILLION  </P> <P> Lotus Development Corp., trying to fill a gap in its product line, announced  Thursday that it would buy an Atlanta software firm for $65 million.  </P> <P> Lotus said it signed a merger agreement with Samna Corp., which makes word  processing products. Samna's software operates with the increasingly popular  Windows graphical system made by Microsoft Corp., Lotus' main competitor.  </P> <P> Windows makes it easier for computer users to operate personal computers made  by International Business Machines Corp. and compatible models.  </P> <P> If completed, the deal would mark the first acquisition by Lotus since a  proposed $1.5-billion merger with Novell Inc., another software maker, fell  apart at the last minute in May.  </P> <P> Lotus officials said the $18.84-per-share buyout of Samna would represent an  important step for the company, which saw earnings plunge by 63% in its most  recent quarter.  </P> <P> Lotus has been known more for its 1-2-3 business spreadsheet program. But  Richard Eckel, a company spokesman, said word processing is the leading segment  of the software industry, and Lotus has been largely absent from that area.  </P> <P> At the same time, customers have been shifting to software that operate with  graphics, he said.  </P> <P> Buying Samna will allow Lotus to take advantage of both those trends, Eckel  said.  </P> <P> Samna will become the word processing division of Lotus, operating from  Atlanta.  </P> <P> Samna had sales of $10.3 million in the first nine months of 1990, compared to  $11 million for all of 1989. But the company posted a $1.2-million loss over  the first three quarters, largely due to its transition to the graphics-based  system.  </P> <P> Lotus had sales of $556 million in 1989. The Cambridge company said it would  take a one-time charge of $40 million to $50 million against quarterly earnings  when the transaction is completed. It hopes to complete the transaction by the  end of the year.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has reviewed the Linkage Plan for the northbound linkage between the BSE and ME to ensure that it will provide U.S. investors with protection against fraudulent and manipulative acts. The Commission believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between markets proposing to develop linkages for order routing purposes is an essential element to any Linkage Plan. Such agreements ensure the quality of information necessary to detect or deter potential manipulation and other trading abuses. In this regard, the BSE is a member and the ME is an affiliate members of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG''), which provides for the exchange of necessary surveillance information. ISG coordinates surveillance and investigative information sharing arrangements in the stock and options markets. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  The Commission believes that this structure should enhance the level of cooperation between the BSE and ME surveillance departments with regard to transactions executed through the northbound linkage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ISG was formed in July 1983.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, July 14, 1983. The most recent amendment to the ISG Agreement, which incorporates the original agreement and all amendments made thereafter, was signed by ISG members in January 1990.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Second Amendment to the Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, January 29, 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the Commission notes that each northbound trade will be entered into the ME's electronic book, and will therefore be subject to the ME's on-line stock trading monitoring system (``SECMA''). <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  Furthermore, the BSE and ME have developed a trade execution monitoring program for the surveillance of orders directed to the ME from the BSE's BEACON system. These surveillance procedures should also help to detect as well as deter any potential manipulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The ME currently focuses its trading reviews on insider trading, trading on non-public market information (``front running''), price manipulation (market fraud of various types, short squeeze, short sales down ticking, normal course issue of bid up ticking, and restrictions on trading by members involved in a distribution. In conducting these types of trading reviews, the ME utilizes price alerts, volume alerts, exception reports based on high-lows and closing prices, as well as other technical information analysis and graphics that are available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In summary, the Commission believes that the BSE has set forth a reasonable proposal. In particular, by limiting the northbound linkage to securities that are traded on the BSE and registered under Section 12(b) of the Act, the linkage will provide customers with access to executions on the ME, while ensuring that such customers continue to receive the protection of the federal securities laws and the rules thereunder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the rule change prior to the thirtieth day after publication of notice of filing thereof. Amendment No. 1 restricts the securities that may be traded through the northbound linkage to securities that are registered under Section 12(b) of the Act <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  and therefore limits the scope of the rule change as originally proposed. The broader proposed rule change was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for the full statutory period and no comments were received. <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34456 (July 28, 1994), 59 FR 39802 (August 4, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V.

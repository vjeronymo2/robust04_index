			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The largest Tamil militant group in Sri Lanka rejected a one-week cease-fire  offered by President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who sought to end six years of  ethnic violence that has claimed 12,500 lives. "The government is only  interested in getting our weapons and has not put forward anything worthwhile,"  said a leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Foreign Minister Ranjan  Wijeratne had told reporters Monday that during the truce, the rebels should  give themselves up at 228 centers across the country. Tamil rebels in Sri Lanka  launched a campaign in 1983 for an independent homeland, citing discrimination  by the Sinhalese in employment and education.  </P></p>

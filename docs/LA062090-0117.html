			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: PUNCHLINE IN TRUMP JOKES ISN'T SO FUNNY  </P> <P> The whole country is having a good laugh at Donald Trump's expense, but the  smiles will fade when people realize that the loudmouth New York developer's  financial troubles are only a symptom of a much more serious national problem.  </P> <P> Trump, with roughly $2 billion in bank loans (plus $1.3 billion in bond issues)  on his casinos, office buildings and hotels, has borrowed only a tiny fraction  of the $365 billion in bank loans to commercial real estate developers. The  1980s saw an unprecedented explosion in such lending; today's level is nearly  three times what it was in 1982.  </P> <P> And unnecessary. "Excess lending exacerbated already overbuilt conditions,"  says David Shulman, head of real estate research at the Salomon Bros.  investment firm. The result is rising vacancy rates in office and apartment  buildings in almost every part of the country and a big increase in delinquent  loans at banks.  </P> <P> The problem is potentially huge for U.S. banks, which have loaned more to  commercial developers than they have to developing countries, or to oil  drillers and real estate projects in Texas and Oklahoma in the 1970s and early  '80s.  </P> <P> Ironically, Texas is recovering after a decade of economic depression. But  elsewhere problems are widespread. From the Northeast down through the  Washington, D.C., area to Florida, real estate values are falling -- as they  are in Arizona.  </P> <P> Vacancy rates are rising in the Midwest, and in the West conditions are mixed.  Commercial real estate is not a problem in the Northwest or in Utah, says Jeff  Thredgold, chief economist of Key Bank in Salt Lake City. However, he adds,  hotels are overbuilt in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> And in California bankers cautiously acknowledge that commercial office space  is overbuilt in Orange Country and Los Angeles, but say rental-rate decreases  are "modest to date." Last week, the Home FedBank of San Diego caused a stir by  raising loan-loss reserves because of troubled commercial loans in its home  market.  </P> <P> One thing is certain: Because the overbuilding of offices, apartments and  shopping centers has been so extreme, real estate problems will be more than  short term.  </P> <P> "With few exceptions, almost every community has a sufficient supply of  commercial real estate for the foreseeable future," says Benjamin Lambert, head  of EastDil Realty, an affiliate of Nomura Securities. How long is foreseeable?  "That depends on how fast the economy grows," Lambert says.  </P> <P> And right now the U.S. economy is hardly growing at all. "We're in for a real  tough time," says a real estate dealer glumly. "A lot of big people are hanging  on by their fingernails -- a lot more out there like Trump."  </P> <P> So what does it mean to you? The decline in real estate values and troubles in  the banks could tip the economy into a recession.  </P> <P> Construction shutdowns will lead to layoffs in businesses from architecture to  cement; insurance companies -- the long-term real estate lenders -- will see  growing defaults in commercial mortgages starting next year, says Shulman of  Salomon Bros. Declining real estate values will be deflationary.  </P> <P> It should be noted that home prices are not yet widely affected -- although  values have come down sharply in the Northeast, less so in California. But if  there is a general deflation, home prices won't be immune.  </P> <P> So Trump's troubles are no joke.  </P> <P> Now let's put it in perspective. A recession -- a period usually of a year to  18 months when the economy declines -- isn't the end of the world. Indeed, the  U.S. economy is almost in recession now, with growth of less than 2% and retail  sales falling as people spend less, save more.  </P> <P> But it is unlikely to be a deep recession. As noted, savings are increasing and  banking experts predict that there will be no shortage of money for home  mortgage and consumer loans in the years ahead. Small businesses suffer as  banks cut back on loans, but benefit as lower commercial rents encourage new  ventures -- as they're doing in Houston.  </P> <P> So the nation will probably avoid a long and severe recession such as Texas  went through in the 1980s, when almost every bank in the state failed.  </P> <P> But that's small consolation for the current peril to jobs and home values. And  questions arise: Why did the banks lend so much to real estate developers?  Because they wanted to expand their business just like everybody else. U.S.  banks collectively may have earned more than $6 billion in fees, not to mention  what they earned in interest, on $365 billion in real estate loans. "You never  lost your job for lending to Donald Trump," says a sage former banker, "you  probably got a promotion."  </P> <P> Simply put, bankers like most everybody else got caught up in the cycle of  economic enthusiasm; as the economy grew, so did the illusion that more people  with more money would need more condos and shopping malls and offices. Now the  building has stopped, and we find we don't need as many condos or malls or  offices. And we probably don't need as many banks either.  </P> <P> Maybe that's why bankers see no humor in Trump's troubles.  </P></p>

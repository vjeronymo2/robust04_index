			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Markets: Smaller companies still hope for big revival - The Bottom Line THOSE who believe in the smaller companies revival have had a long wait. At the end of 1990, it was widely remarked that small company shares, as measured by the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index, had lagged behind the market for the second year in a row. This had only happened once before, in the mid-1960s; at no time since records began in 1955, had small company shares underperformed for three years. Surely this was a sign that small companies had to revive? It was not to be. In 1991, the total return on the FT-A All Share Index was 20.8 per cent; the HGSC achieved a respectable, but lower, 18.5 per cent. The reason is simple: the recession. Small companies are more dependent on the UK economy than their larger brethren, many of which have overseas subsidiaries and substantial export businesses. Enthusiasts argue that the minnows will be the biggest beneficiaries when the UK economy eventually revives. Accordingly, small company shares performed well in the first quarter of 1991, when a recovery seemed imminent. They lost some of their lustre in the fourth quarter, when it became clear that the recession had continued. The impact of the recession was such that a record number of HGSC components went bust in 1991. In 1987, there were only two companies in the extended HGSC whose shares became worthless; last year, there were 79. Professors Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh, who produce the HGSC Index, note that when the economy last emerged from recession, in 1982, the number of bankruptcies increased. The corollary is that '1992 may well witness a continued increase in the number of company liquidations even if there is an early recovery.' Recent failures have been concentrated among the smallest of the small companies, and this highlights the unusual nature of 1991. In good years for the stock market, the convention has been that the smaller the company, the better, on average, the stocks performed. The average annual return since 1955 of the smallest 10 per cent (by market capitalisation) of companies is a staggering 35 per cent. In 1991, by contrast, it was medium-sized companies which performed best; the smallest 10 per cent actually produced a negative return. One reason for this, say the professors, is lack of liquidity. The marketability of small company shares has continued to deteriorate and there is a widespread expectation that some smaller companies will soon be traded on a 'matched bargain' basis. This would adversely affect the share price of many so-called 'shell' companies whose main value is their stock market quotation. Whatever the reason, the poor performance of the smallest stocks has helped those fund managers who specialise in small company investments. They tend to focus on the larger end of the small company spectrum and thus were able to outperform the HGSC Index in 1991. Certainly, the enthusiasm for small company fund launches continues. Last week, there was an investment trust, with a split capital structure, from Lloyds; this week, Scottish Amicable followed suit with a conventional investment trust and Clerical Medical with a unit trust. It is unusual for a sector to be 'flavour of the month', in fund launch terms, after it has underperformed. But fund managers, and other small company enthusiasts, are relying on the long term effects highlighted by the HGSC. Over the 37 years since 1955, the index has produced an annualised return of over 18 per cent, beating the return on the All-Share by 4.5 per cent per year. The sum of Pounds 1,000 invested in the HGSC in 1955 would have grown (with gross dividends reinvested) to more than Pounds 512,000 by 1992. The dividends on HGSC companies have grown, in real terms, at around twice the rate achieved by larger companies. Can this long term trend repeat itself? One irony is that, though the HGSC figures date back to 1955, the index itself was launched in 1987 just as the long run outperformance of smaller companies was beginning to end. This seems to confirm the old rule that, as soon as a potentially profitable market anomaly is noticed, the anomaly disappears. Nevertheless, there is evidence that small company shares are undervalued. The average price-earnings ratio on HGSC companies was 12.1 at the end of 1991, against 13.2 for the All-Share. Similarly, HGSC stocks traded on a slightly higher yield than those in the All-Share - 5.1 per cent to 5 per cent. Those figures may not be conclusive proof that the small company revival is on its way, but try telling that to the sector's enthusiasts.  --------------------------------------------- SMALL CO INDICES  ---------------------------------------------                   % chg                   on wk  --------------------------------------------- CSCI    950.88     +0.4 HGSC*  1191.48     +0.7  --------------------------------------------- * Capital gains version.

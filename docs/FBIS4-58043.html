			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Standpoint" column: "Ending Intervention Is the </F> Solution" by 'Isa Isma'il al-'Abbadi]    [Text] The incident involving the shooting down of two U.S.  helicopters by two missiles fired from two U.S. F-15 aircraft in  northern Iraq reveals the evils and dangers of continued foreign  intervention in the affairs of Iraq. Those evils and dangers  have harmed and are harming not only Iraq, but also the  intervening sides themselves and the neighboring country of  Turkey, on whose territory the foreign intervention forces are  stationed.    The U.S. Administration has tried to mislead many people by  saying that its intervention in Iraq's internal affairs and the  presence of the coalition forces in Turkey are aimed at  enforcing a security zone in northern Iraq and maintaining the  security and stability of the region. So, what are the results  of this aggressive U.S. intervention?    One main result of this intervention is that it has  undermined Iraq's sovereignty, although the U.S. Administration  and the coalition forces say that they support Iraq's unity and  territorial integrity and oppose any action that is prejudicial  to its sovereignty.    Another result of this aggressive intervention is what we  see  happening in northern Iraq today; acts of murder, destruction,  plunder, and sabotage of all that the 17-30 July Revolution and  the autonomy institutions have built for the well-being of our  Kurdish people in the Autonomous Region.    Incidents are reported every day in which government  officials and foreign news correspondents become victims due to  the lack of security and the physical liquidations taking place  between numerous foreign elements and agent parties in northern  Iraq.    Some U.S. quarters have tried to blame Iraq for the  incidents  taking place in that region, where conditions are unnatural and  unsafe due to the continuous foreign intervention and where  gangs of agents, vagabonds, and robbers have taken over control  under foreign protection. Let us ask: How can any country in  the world guarantee security in a region which is not under the  direct control of its security organs?    Whoever follows events will discover that foreign  intervention is not in anyone's interest.    This intervention, which directly affects Iraq, since it is  taking place on its territory and undermining its national  sovereignty, is also detrimental to the interests of the  coalition states themselves, especially the neighboring country  of Turkey, which Iraq has never tried to harm, and with which  Iraq has sought good-neighborly relations and strong economic  ties.    What has the United States gained from its continuous  intervention in northern Iraq and the continued presence of its  forces in Turkey?    The United States and some of its Western allies have gained  nothing but disappointment and failure. As for Iraq, it  overcame its ordeal a long time ago when it confronted the  coalition aggression and when its struggler people resisted in  the Mother of Battles and reconstructed what was destroyed by  aggression.    Washington and its Western allies reaped failure and losses  and its hostile program witnessed repeated defeats. Perhaps,  the shooting down of the two U.S. helicopters by two U.S.  fighter bombers is best proof of this disappointment and the  failure of the policy of intervention in Iraq's affairs.    All the claims about safeguarding security and human rights  which President Bill Clinton's advisers bragged about have all  fallen at once.    Of all Iraqi territory, the region witnessing the  intervention of the aggressor states is the only one lacking  security.    As for the question of human rights, it is a ridiculous  issue  of U.S. foreign policy, because the Clinton administration,  which talks about human rights, did not hesitate to kill 15  Americans and others of different nationalities, including  Kurds, thinking the helicopters were Iraqi.    The U.S. Administration needs to make a general revision of  its entire policy in the region, especially toward Iraq. Iraqi  national unity has all the historical bases and means of  continuity and viability in the present and the future.  Washington itself admits this fact. Therefore, the recent  incident must sound the alarm concerning the continuation of  intervention. The recent U.S. decision to suspend flights over  northern Iraq does not offer a solution. The correct solution  which responds to the interests of Iraq, Turkey, and other  states in the region is withdrawing the coalition forces from  the region and building correct relations which will meet  everyone's legitimate interests.    Therefore, what is correct is for the United States to stop  intervening in Iraq's affairs, pull its forces out from the  region and adopt new relations with Iraq based on accommodation  and achieving common interests, and abandoning the policy of  saber rattling and threats of intervention, because developments  and facts have proven the futility of this policy.</p>

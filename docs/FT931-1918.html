			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Spring Ram Spring Ram Corporation's forced conversion to the kitchen sink school of auditing must count as a triumph for the rigorous new accounting regime. It was always improbable that a company manufacturing kitchens and bathrooms could have maintained pre-tax profit margins at around 20 per cent throughout the recession. Its aggressive accounting policies now emerge as one of the main reasons. Last year's cleaned-up results emerged some Pounds 13m below what the market had expected. Spring Ram blithely suggested this provided a solid new base from which to progress. Its irrepressibly optimistic fan club sensed a buying opportunity following the company's share price collapse. This shows remarkable forgiveness for a company which has developed a nasty habit of disappointment. There must be grave doubts about the quality of Spring Ram's previously stated earnings. Its in-bred culture and the delay in appointing non-executive directors continue to give grounds for concern. Should shareholders be burned again they have nothing to blame but their own myopia.</p>

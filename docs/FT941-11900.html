			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Council's reform plans in chaos Cambridgeshire councillors' attempts to agree a new local government structure for the county collapsed in chaos yesterday, John Authers writes. Five of six districts said that they had agreed to split the county into four unitary authorities. However, the leaders of all three political parties on the county council denounced the proposal as 'a marriage of self-interest'. Cambridgeshire is the only county so far to recommend its own abolition, but it has proposed that it should be replaced by only two unitary councils. The county says this option would be less costly.</p>

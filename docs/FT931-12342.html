			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / German bank chief dismisses fast-track Emu idea THE BUNDESBANK president yesterday dismissed an idea, promoted by French and German leaders, that a select group of European Community countries could establish monetary union ahead of schedule. Mr Helmut Schlesinger also warned that monetary stability had to be restored in Germany before there could be any further progress towards Emu. The Maastricht treaty 'states clearly that Emu can only start, in 1997, if a majority of the member states meet the required entry criteria', he said in a speech in Brussels. 'I am sticking to the text . . . The next time is 1999. I have no intention of shortening the period,' he told a press conference later. Mr Schlesinger said he had been 'surprised about some public speculation envisaging the start of a far more narrowly defined Emu, for instance, without the Benelux countries'. While he did not name the source of the speculation, he was apparently responding in part to recent statements from Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand. They agreed in a television interview that it could be possible to accelerate progress towards union. Recent French media reports have suggested the possibility of a Franco-German monetary pact. Mr Schlesinger underlined his opposition to his chancellor's ambitions with a sharp reminder of the economic difficulties to be overcome in united Germany. The country suffered from huge regional income differentials and structural problems unequalled anywhere else in the Community. Such difficulties had affected inflation rates, but stability had to be regained. It was in the interests of all EC member states that the country with the anchor currency - the D-Mark - should be able to return to full stability. This was 'a prerequisite for any move forwards on the road towards Emu', said Mr Schlesinger. He added that in the run-up to the establishment of a European central bank, national central banks had to retain responsibility for monetary policy. Currencies, Page 25</p>

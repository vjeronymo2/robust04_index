			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Tapie fends off Credit Lyonnais The beleaguered Mr Bernard Tapie yesterday won a rare victory against Credit Lyonnais, his bank which is pressing him over his FFr1.3bn (Pounds 156m) debts, when a Paris court decided that the left-wing entrepreneur did not have to repay a FFr300m loan. Credit Lyonnais had claimed that Mr Tapie, a Euro-MP, had breached the terms of the loan, which the bank made last year to Olympique-Marseille, his football club. However the court concluded that there was no reason to force Mr Tapie to redeem the loan given that, under the terms of the original agreement, repayments are not due until September this year.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Union Discount shares fall after warning of Pounds 15m loss SHARES in Union Discount, one of the City's leading discount houses, plunged from 115p to 64p yesterday following a warning that interim results would reveal a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 15m. Union, which traded at 445p 12 months ago, also said it would pass the interim dividend and review the final payout. Mr George Blunden, who was appointed chief executive on June 1 following the departure of Mr Graeme Gilchrist in February, said it was unlikely that the group would make a profit in the full year. He said he was determined 'to clear out the stables' so shareholders 'don't get any more bad news'. The warning was accompanied by an announcement on the sale of part of Union's dental equipment leasing business, Herald Financial Services, for Pounds 18.2m cash. Yesterday's statement was seen as a further blow to the group's hard pressed money market operations. Last year Union announced its first loss on discounting operations in 29 years. The chief executive said the discount house had an 'excessive' cost base in relation to its reduced capital base. Steps had been taken, however, and further redundancies were expected. The City was shocked at the warning and news of more provisions on the Sabre Leasing office equipment business. 'It is just short of disastrous,' said Ms Karen Bennett of BZW. 'Herald was the only saleable asset they had left. The longer the recession continues, the more pain Sabre is going to inflict.' Union fell into the red in 1991 with a Pounds 23.6m pre-tax loss. Sabre accounted for most of the Pounds 16.25m operating deficit on leasing. Mr Blunden said Union would in future concentrate on its money market and equity operations, in effect reversing the ill-starred move into leasing begun in 1986. However, he refused to be drawn on whether there were any buyers for Sabre. Ms Bennett said BZW was forecasting a Pounds 17m loss for the full year. However, there were still questions over the valuations of two properties. Mr Blunden refused to comment on possible property provisions. He was also unable to disclose the amount of provisions for Sabre because of reporting restrictions. Observer, Page 19</p>

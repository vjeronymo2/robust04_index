			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / People: Founder of Arlington to retire Raymond Mould, the founder of Arlington, the property company that was bought by British Aerospace, is retiring from the company on March 31. Mould, together with Patrick Vaughan, another senior Arlington executive who will retire on March 31, is moving to a new European property consultancy in Brussels, called Business Park Consultants, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Richard Ellis Holdings. George Simpson, the BAe director responsible for Arlington, will take over as chairman of Arlington Property Holdings from Mould. He will also become chairman of Arlington Securities, a post currently occupied by Vaughan. Simpson says the resignations recognise 'the changes now taking place as the Arlington business develops'. BAe had agreed with Mould and Vaughan that it would have access to their advice for as long as necessary. 'In many ways, these new arrangements give us the best of both worlds,' he says. Arlington was bought for Pounds 278m in 1989 to add value to BAe's surplus landbank, which had grown after its acquisitions of Rover and Royal Ordnance. However, it has incurred losses during the property downturn and BAe has stated that it wants to introduce outside shareholders once the property market improves. Mould says: 'It is obviously sad to be leaving Arlington after so many years but I am pleased with the way the company's future has been secured. We have both agreed that if we should return to the UK some time in the future, and if at that time BAe wished us to be available in some capacity, we would be delighted to work with them.' Mould resigned from the main board of BAe last August. His resignation coincided with the expiry of his three-year service contract although the contracts were rolled over until the end of the year.</p>

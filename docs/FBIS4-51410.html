			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by Lin Yuwen (2651 6735 2429): "Migrant </F> Workers Are Swarming Into Xinjiang"]    [Text] Urumqi, 3 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The spring  is over and wild geese have flown to the north again.    Following these wild geese are tens of thousands of migrant  workers, who are swarming into Xinjiang like tides.    Statistics provided by the Urumqi railway station's  passenger  transportation department indicate that the railway station  transported 200,000 migrant workers in the autumn and winter of  last year, and more than 100,000 migrant workers have come to  Urumqi from 20 February of this year to the present.    These migrant workers are only staying in Xinjiang  temporarily, but more have settled down in the region.  According to a report by XINJIANG JUNKEN BAO [Army Reclamation  Newspaper], there is a production team on a vegetable farm in  the southern part of the Taklimakan desert that consists of 430  members, all of whom are migrant workers. Zheng Bangjun came to  Xinjiang from Sichuan's Qiuling County. As soon as he found a  plot of land for development in the Tarim basin in 1987, he  immediately helped move six of his eight brothers and sisters to  this place.    Incomplete statistics show that there are more than 300,000  migrant workers in Xinjiang now.    Migrant workers keep coming to Xinjiang despite its  remoteness in location.    The emergence of migrant workers' thronging into Xinjiang  has  been due to China's reform and opening up and to the  breakthroughs in rural economic structural reform. Contracting  land to each household and linking remunerations to output have  boosted the initiative of the 800 million peasants, thus  emancipating the productive forces and making it possible for  many peasants to leave their farmlands for cities. The reform  of China's grain policy, which was introduced in 1993, enabled  the peasants to stay in cities. In the past, commodity grain  was not available without urban domicile. This domicile  registration system tightly restricted the peasants to the rural  areas. The overall lifting of control over grain prices had a  great impact on the domicile registration system and made it  possible for surplus rural laborers to move to cities.  Therefore, in a sense, the emergence of a large number of  migrant workers at present is a sign of social progress.</p>

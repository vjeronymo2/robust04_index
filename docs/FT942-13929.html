			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / The Lex Column: SmithKline Beecham First quarter figures from SmithKline Beecham demonstrate why the pharmaceuticals sector has been so thoroughly de-rated. Earnings growth looks healthy enough, but underlying sales growth in pharmaceuticals slowed to only 1 per cent. There are special factors at work, such as healthcare reform in Italy. But such set-backs are becoming an increasingly regular feature of results in this sector. The expiry next month of the US patent protecting Tagamet, SB's ulcer treatment, is another reason for caution. Having underperformed the equity market by 10 per cent since mid-March, SB's shares now stand on a multiple of around 11 times this year's forecast earnings, against a market average of 14 times. Such a rating is consistent with the valuations applied to Glaxo, Wellcome and US pharmaceutical stocks. Even on such lowly multiples, though, it is difficult to argue that the sector is cheap. Profit margins are being eroded by competition from cheap generic drugs and the tough attitude of healthcare buyers, including governments. Until investors have a better idea of where margins might settle, the sector will remain vulnerable. At least SB is taking its medicine early. By this time next year the impact on margins of Tagamet's patent expiry should be easier to judge. If SB can drive its new drugs forward in the meantime, it could be among the first to bounce.</p>

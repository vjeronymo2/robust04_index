			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE PRESIDENT FAVORS TAYLOR RANCH UNIVERSITY  </P> <P> As an educator for the past 33 years (27 at Ventura College), I strongly  support the development of a CSU campus on the Taylor Ranch property. I am  writing this letter as a citizen of this county and as the Ventura College  president, but not representing a college or district position.  </P> <P> The development of a CSU campus is a higher education opportunity for the  region, rather than just for the city of Ventura. The CSU campus will influence  the lives and expand the educational opportunities for all Ventura County  citizens, especially those residing west and north of the Conejo Grade and  particularly those who do not have the resources or the time to commute or  relocate to another four-year college campus in the state.  </P> <P> Recently the Legislature passed and the governor signed AB1725. Among other  items, this important reform bill re-established the mission of the community  college, with transfer education being the No. 1 priority. A university in  close physical proximity to a community college is essential to carry out this  mission. If offers the opportunity for thousands of students who work and  attend college to compete and complete baccalaureate requirements. The vast  majority of people currently attending the overcrowded CSU University Center on  Alessandro Drive are former community college students, and most of these are  working women.  </P> <P> CSU Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds supports the purchase of additional property in  order to provide a wilderness area for wildlife that may or may not be affected  by a college on the Taylor Ranch site. This should help allay the fears of  those concerned with the destruction of wildlife.  </P> <P> The global world that we live in cannot and should not be ignored. I urge all  citizens to speak out and support the Taylor Ranch proposal now. We in Ventura  County send more than $600 million in taxes to Sacramento annually and get less  than $1 million in return for higher education beyond the community college  level. Currently more than 4,000 students are commuting outside the county to  take higher education classes. Ventura County is the largest county in the  state of California without a CSU campus. The future is now!  </P> <P> ROBERT W. LONG  </P> <P> Somis  </P></p>

Over the past 24 hours the cosmonauts checked the  hermeticity  of the spaceship compartments and the operation of onboard  systems. The first two-burn manoeuvre was performed to bring the  spaceship closer to the Mir station.    The parameters of the spaceship orbit are now as follows:    - maximum distance from the earth's surface -- 335 km,    - minimum distance from the earth's surface -- 244 km,    - orbital period -- 90.1 minutes,    - orbital inclination -- 51.6 degrees.    Mir cosmonauts Vasiliy Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov are  preparing to meet the crew of the 15th main space expedition.    According to reports from orbit and telemetry data, the  flight of the Soyuz TM-18 spaceship and the orbital complex Mir  is proceeding normally. The two spacecraft are expected to dock  at 14.50 on January 10.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Urban underclass is challenge, Clarke says THE growth of the 'underclass' in decaying inner-city areas was identified by Mr Kenneth Clarke last night as the most formidable challenge facing western democracies during the 1990s. In a speech designed to set out Conservative solutions to poverty, deprivation and racism, the home secretary said that 'society cannot afford to alienate and exclude significant numbers of the poor, the black and the young'. But he rejected outright the dependency culture offered by 'bleeding heart' liberals as a solution. He accused 'local leftwing politicians' of seeing the poor as victims and dependants to be permanently excluded from the wealth-creating process. He also dismissed the 'authoritarian' approaches being pioneered in the US in which substantial numbers of disadvantaged citizens were made, in effect, 'wards of the state'. Instead the government would seek the extension of the 'free-market solutions' which were levering up standards across the public sector. 'Public expenditure is not enough. Lateral thinking aimed at changing the culture of deprived groups and deprived areas towards the enterprise economy and active citizenship is required.' Mr Clarke acknowledged in a lecture to the Tory Reform Group that even when the economy was growing 'it is not automatically the case that it will trickle down so that the inner-city resident will get a fair share of it'. Government help was needed but no single policy could solve the problems of the urban poor. The long-term answer lay in a partnership between statutory and voluntary agencies and private companies and 'active citizens' that would allow local communities - with government help - to find their own solutions: 'It is enormously important that people work out how to do things for themselves and that they believe that what they get from their own efforts is really theirs.' But he acknowledged that legislation designed to empower local citizens  - by giving them greater control of their schools, housing and environment - would not produce instant results. Changing the attitudes of inner-city residents towards enterprise, work, choice and responsibility would take time, he said, and it would need to be sustained throughout the 1990s.</p>

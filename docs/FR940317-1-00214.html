Such approval shall be granted in accordance with the issuance criteria of this section. All approved species and countries of export will be listed in section 15.33.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Requirements for scientifically-based sustainable use management plans. Sustainable use management plans developed by the country of export shall include the following information, and any other information that may be appropriate:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Background information, including the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The scientific and common name of the species;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Letters from the country of export's Management and Scientific Authorities transmitting the management plan of this species;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A summary of the country of export's legislation related to this species and legislation implementing the Convention, and, where appropriate, a summary of implementing regulations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) A summary, from the country of export's Management Authority, of the country's infrastructure and law enforcement and monitoring mechanisms designed to ensure both enforcement of and compliance with the requirements of the management plan, and that the number of birds removed from the wild or exported will be consistent with the management plan;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Recent information on the distribution of the species within the country of export, including scientific references and maps, and historical information on distributions, if relevant; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) The species' status and its current population trend in the country of export, including scientific references.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Habitat information, including:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A general description of habitats used by the species for each portion of the life cycle completed within the country of export;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Recent information on the size and distribution of these habitats throughout the country of export and in each area or region of take, including scientific references and maps. The approximate location of any reserves that provide protection for this species should be indicated on the accompanying map(s);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Status and trends of the important habitats used by the species in the country of export as a whole and within each area or region of take, whenever available, including scientific references;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Factors, including management activities, favoring or threatening the species' habitat in the foreseeable future throughout the country of export and within each area or region of take, whenever available, including scientific references; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) A list of management plans that have been or are being planned, developed, or implemented for the species' important habitats, if any.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Information on the role of the species in its ecosystem, including:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A description of the part(s) of the species' life cycle completed within the country of export;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For a species that breeds in the country of export, a description of nest sites and/or plant communities that are most frequently used for placement of nests and, if applicable, nesting habits;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A general description of the species' diet, where the species forages (aerial feeder, tree canopy, tree trunk, midstory, understory, open water or other), and seasonal changes in foraging habits, including, when available, scientific references; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Information on any species or plant community which is dependent on the occurrence of the exotic bird species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Population dynamics of the species, including:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Recent population data of the population of the species in the country of export, as derived from indices of relative abundance or population estimates, along with documentation for each estimate;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Within each area or region of take, documentation for recent population data or estimates, conducted for at least three separate years or one year with a description of survey plans for future years. These population assessments should have been conducted during the same season (breeding or non-breeding) of each year for which documentation is submitted;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) If a species belongs to the avian families Columbidae, Fringillidae, Ploceidae, Estrildidae, Sturnidae, Tinamidae, Podicepedidae, Burhinidae, Scolopacidae, Tyrannidae, Pittidae, Emberizidae, Zosteropidae, Vireonidae, Atrichornithidae, Sylviidae, Oriolidae, Meliphagidae, or Icteridae, the management plan shall include the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) For a species that does not breed in the country of export, documentation or a letter from the Convention Scientific Authority that the species occurs in the country of export only during the nonbreeding season; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) For a species that breeds in the country of export, estimation (with documentation) of recent reproductive success. Where apppropriate, this assessment could include number of young produced per egg-laying female per year, or pre-breeding and post-breeding surveys conducted within the same annual cycle; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Estimation (with documentation) of annual mortality or loss including natural mortality and take for subsistence use, export trade, and domestic trade in each area of take; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) In lieu of paragraphs (a)(4)(iii) (A) and (C) of this section, documentation of long-term population and offtake trends based on indices of relative abundance, and measures of offtake and description of any long-term changes in other mortality factors (including subsistence use, domestic trade, and capture or transport mortalities). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) If a species belongs to an avian family other than those listed in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, the management plan shall include the following information: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

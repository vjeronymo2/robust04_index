			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Protection pledge for state sector MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, last night fired a warning shot at those of the Tory right seeking to further reduce the role of the state. Taking a sideswipe at supporters of 'permanent revolution' he stressed the government's commitment to respect as well to reform the public sector. His comments were reinforced by a re-affirmation by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that the government's overall strategy should be based on an 'American approach to free-market economics and a European approach to welfare'. In a speech which followed a series of attacks from right-wing ministers and Tory activists on the public sector, Mr Hurd said the party should not give the impression that we 'believe in a permanent cultural revolution, in the style of Trotsky of chairman Mao'. His comments, carefully prepared after close consultation with colleagues, were seen as a signal that the centrist majority in Mr John Major's cabinet, is unwilling to surrender the public services agenda. Mr Hurd told the Tory Reform Group: 'We do not want to break the mould of every public service afresh in every Parliament. We must show that we are not driven by ideology to question every function of the state, to make impossible the life of our public servants, or to depreciate the worth and quality of the different public services.' He defended strongly the need to overhaul key public services like education, the health service and prison system to ensure that they functioned more like a sophisticated and responsive market. But he coupled that with a warning that the policies of the Thatcher era did not fit the priorities of the 1990s: 'We spent much of the 1980s cutting back on the overblown responsibilities of the state. Our task now is to strike the right balance in working out the role of the state in the 1990s.' The government's commitment to deregulate and to introduce market disciplines in the public sector should not be mistaken for a 'vendetta against the state in the areas of national life where its role must remain central'. That sentiment was echoed by Mr Clarke who told reporters that the prospect of public spending cuts should not be taken as an attack on the basic principles of the welfare state.</p>

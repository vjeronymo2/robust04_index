			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Travel: Rilke, Dali and El Cid slept here - As tourists pour in to Spain, Jimmy Burns explains how to escape Expo and Olympic hype I BEGAN to find what I was looking for just a few kilometres south of Seville on a narrow road off the motorway to Cadiz. It was a village called Cabezas Blancas (White Heads), appropriately the first stop along what Spaniards have termed the 'route of the white towns.' I had left behind me a city that was cracking up under the strain of Expo and found a little village of white-washed houses where old men lounged in doorways and children chased each other in and out of trees. The atmosphere had been transformed. There was no hurry, just a seemingly endless time to talk and drink under the sun. Beyond, the road took me through fields of cotton and sunflowers gracefully bowing to the light, with not a human in sight. In spring these fields are speckled in yellow and red: sunflowers in full bloom and poppies. It is hard to imagine that such a pastoral scene was the setting for some of the bloodiest battles between infidel and El Cid during the Moorish occupation of Spain. The villages and towns that line the route, and the castles in between, are nevertheless very Moorish indeed; the white towns are perched high on hills, clinging to the landscape defensively. There are more than a dozen white towns to visit. Among them, Arcos de la Frontera deserves its reputation as one of the most picturesque towns to be found in Andalucia. The town is perched high on a ridge, overlooking a river. Its narrow streets are flanked by small squat houses. Gothic churches, friendly tapas bars and little palaces are hidden in the labyrinth of whitewashed alleyways. There are plenty of cheap hotels on the route, but after a couple of hours' driving through the hills I opted for the graceful Reina Victoria Hotel in Ronda because the poet Rainer Maria Rilke drew his inspiration there. I booked a room just beneath his and from there watched the swallows swoop over the valley as the sun set, like a melting gold coin behind the granite hills. Rilke likened the dramatic gorge which separates the old and new town to St Christopher carrying the baby Jesus on his shoulders. Crossing the bridge, we left behind the bustle of the new Ronda with its busy commercial life, and entered a part of the town which had survived the years largely untouched and unaltered. We followed the path deep into the gorge, to the Moorish baths. They were closed to the public but we convinced Juan, an old gardener, to let us in. He told us that the baths had been closed because a young tourist had tripped on the narrow path, fallen, and broken a leg. While my companion stayed at the top, I followed Juan along the fateful track, peering ahead as best I could. Juan was anxious to show me the fountain because it was here that they shot the scene of Carmen washing herself in Rossini's film of the opera. Clutching his hand scythe, Juan told me that his job now was to clean away the brambles and weeds where lizards lurked. As we stood under the surviving arches, I surveyed the remains of the drainage, the simple but logical way the baths had been laid out, the use of shadow and thick walls to create a perfect mild temperature for us to lounge in. Juan looked up at the ramparts: 'You know they built that without concrete and it's still standing after all these years. I dont know how they managed it.' On our walk to the baths we had passed a couple of English girls. 'Cross-breeding seems to be a Spanish trait', one of them remarked as they walked past a bundle on the cobble stones. The bundle was a litter of kittens, of various sizes and shades ranging from ginger to black. They had been abandoned in the heat. When we were bidding our goodbyes, I pointed to the cats and remarked that they would die unless someone packed them up. 'Hay que ver', Juan said. 'These people who take away the children from their natural mother. They should be ashamed of themselves.' Juan promised to take them with him to his village high up in the sierra where other cats lived amidst the hills. And so we left Juan gazing beyond the Morrish baths at the kittens on the cobblestones, and headed back towards the new town built by the Christians. We visited the bullfight museum. Here bullfighting was elevated to the realm of ritual, the garments and instruments of the toreadores laid out like relics: a glorification of death. There was a ticket to the bullfight the day Manolete was killed. Some exhibits were pure pastiche: a cape with an Aztec sun and a naked body of the tortured Christ rising up into the sky. There were portraits of Ordonez with Orson Welles and Hemingway. The director of the museum was as protective of his exhibits as the curate of his local Virgin. Indeed, there is a similarity that links the two cults - ritual and unquestioning devotion. Near the bullring there is an old Carmelite church. We went there to buy some cakes. Next to a picture of the Virgin Mary a price-list referred to a variety of sweet delicacies: polvorones (crumble cakes), pestinos (sweet fritters), cocadas (coconut cakes) magdalenas and mudagas (cup cakes). I made out my order for a quarter of a kilo each. I communicated with an anonymous nun through a dumbwaiter encrusted in the medieval stone. The nun's muffled, slightly ageing voice repeated each order like a litany before quoting the total price. I deposited the money. The dumbwaiter twirled and for a few moments I was without cakes and without money. But there was faith in the air. The dumbwaiter twirled again and the cakes appeared neatly packaged in plastic. Each bag carried the inscription (in Spanish): 'How beautiful it is to have an ideal in life.' A noble sentiment, indeed, although it was difficult to forget that every sweet morsel made by these Christian nuns had its origins in Moorish kitchens, before the Moors were booted out. We had been told that one of the curiosities to glimpse along the route was the Spanish fir - the pinsapo  - a rare tree not found anywhere else. We would have seen several hundred as we made our way along the mountain road were it not for a large forest fire, caused by a stray piece of rubbish, which for two days engulfed an entire sierra. We saw thick sandy-coloured smoke rising over the horizon. The local radio described the fire as the worst ecological disaster to hit the area in 25 years. After his wanderings round Europe, Rilke had found his peace here. Writing to Rodin in November 1912, he had reflected on how much Spain had to give him. 'Ronda is incomparable', he had marvelled. Rilke's room in the Reina Victoria was a poet's room, simple and contemplative: a small desk with two fountain pens, a small library of books and a window giving out to the sunset. Yes, Ronda with its sense of timelessness, its beauty, its hidden mysteries, poets and bullfighters, was difficult to beat. We left Seville shrouded in the pink of dawn, its new airport a monstrous carbuncle of futuristic architecture, a kind of 21st century hangar with blue arches made of some undesirable synthetic material. The spirit of Expo chased me all the way down the runway like a rampant bull. At Barcelona airport I was greeted by the Olympian bull. Redesigned and expanded into a bubbling international rendezvous, the airport now provides another futuristic nightmare made worse by an inexplicable shortage of toilets. There was a quickened pace about the airport which grew in intensity as we drove on to the motorway. There were places to eat but all that was being sold was fast food. Over the motorway a computerised clock marked the countdown to the opening day of the Olympics, lest anyone forgot. At this pace, I thought, there will be a collective burn-out before anyone gets to the starting line. At Blanes, the Costa Brava's first frontier town, I got stuck in a terrible traffic jam. The heat was sweltering. We diverted to the nearest fast food snack bar. An assortment of chickens, french fries and hamburgers were displayed in coloured photographs behind the bar. I pointed to each in turn, only to be told that nothing was available. I pointed to some bars of chocolate and some crisps. I was served crisps and Fanta reluctantly, and the man glowered when I spilt the Fanta. I told him that I would complain to the Olympics board - and I did. We were soon driving along the Costa Brava. The road between Blanes and Lloret de Mar became increasingly twisty, meandering through spectacular pines, the sea luminous. Unfortunately, one of my passengers was sick all over the back seat. Lloret de Mar and neighbouring Tossa were crowded with tourists - mainly British, arrogant and badly dressed, lounging in cafes. To think that this was a quaint fishing town before Ava Gardner made a film here in the 1950s, I lamented. San Feliu was anti-climatic. It was here that I had spent five idyllic summers as a child, and was revisiting for the first time in 30 years. We stopped for lunch by the quayside. It was much as I remembered it as a boy - the oil on the water's surface, the bits of rubbish floating between the rocks. Yes, there was pollution in those days, but no one seemed to mind so much. Now there was a self-conscious sign by the local authorities declaring the port to be a green zone. Beyond San Feliu, the developers had bulldozed my memories. The fields of corn had sprouted apartment blocks. It was lucky that we had rented a house in Aiguabrava, the most beautiful and secluded spot along the Costa. The house was set up high on a hill. Its construction was a veritable rabbit warren of paths and patios and hidden rooftops. Plants and creepers of every kind and colour covered it. Mornings and evenings were the best times to admire the beauty of the scene. At night under a yellow moon the pines swayed, and the wind swept the hills. The air was heavily perfumed with the smell of thyme and pine. The next day we went down to the nearest beach as the sun rose. There was already another couple. She was massaging her partner's back with lascivious intent. As the morning wore on, the beach got crowded with more and more topless women massaging their partners and vice versa. There was an array of differing human forms I scarcely imagined possible. I thought it all most natural, this baring of breasts in and out of the water, among the sun-shades, ice-creams and suntan lotions, the children struggling with their flippers like unruly penguins. My female companion dismissed it all as a mix of exhibitionism, male chauvinism and menopause. We left the beach by mid-day. By then all sense of individuality had been surrendered. The aspect of nakedness struck me as one enormous expanse of flab, as immobile under the sun as a beached whale. After a day of this, I felt it was time to search for Dali. We drove to the village of Cadaques which the painter thought embodied 'the most incomparable beauty on earth.' It was at Cadaques, Dali tells us in his autobiography, that he had perfected his awareness of his situation. As we drove down from the hills, Cadaques looked unlike any other town that straddles the Costa Brava. It is not really a town, more a village; unlike the others it has not spread its tentacles along the coast. Its compactness strikes one immediately, as does its whiteness. The local Dali museum has a wonderful model of a 1920s bus. Dali sits in red hat and red scarf in the driver's seat, looking quite lunatic, of course; his wife Gala is beside him, bewitching in a purple velvet dress. Behind them are Picasso (the man Dali most thought about after his father), Marcel Duchamp (the man who painted a moustache on the Mona Lisa), and Lorca (who let Dali fondle his knee once), looking thrilled as schoolboys on an outing. In Cadaques there is no beach worthy of mention. But there are friends and boats and we took both a few miles up the coast to the bay of Port Ligat. There the house where Dali had spent most of his life stood in an overgrown olive grove, closed to the outside world. Next to it was the villa belonging to Captain Moore, the man who was Dali's personal secretary. And next to this a mock Moorish castle painted sand red. It, too, was closed to the public, but it was rumoured to have once contained a load of Dali paintings. We anchored the boat and went diving for mussels and oysters in the bay Dali had painted into the most popular of his religious works, the Christ of St John of the Cross. When we re-emerged, the naked outline of a woman was silhouetted against the sky, near to Dali's house; by her a man in red underpants was fishing with a bamboo stick. All around us the sea swayed with erotic motion, as if moved by some primaeval force. From Cadaques we went to Figueras and the Dali museum, which holds the distinction of being the most popular museum in Spain after the Prado. There were crowds circling the block, mainly of young people with long hair or older people pretending to look surrealistic. Inside there was something for everyone or everything for some of us. Every secret recess of Gala's body was on display in a dozen or so pen drawings and paintings. But it was to the Mae West room that the crowd was converging as to an erogenous zone. The room had a sofa shaped like a pair of bulbous lips, a long mane of bleached hair draped from the ceiling and two lithographs - one of an eye winking, the other of an eye staring vacuously. The visitors' ultimate destination was the top of a wooden staircase. There, under the testicles of a wooden camel, one was required to look at the Mae West room through a piece of glass. For 20 minutes, and out of sheer curiosity, I waited my turn. I had been told that if I looked through the glass I would see Mae West's face. In fact what I saw was a sofa shaped like a pair of bulbous lips, a long mane of bleached hair hanging from the ceiling, and two lithographs. Only the crowd looking down below had their bodies distorted into fantastological shapes by the glass. I realised then that Dali had achieved his ultimate tease: to make us part of the frame while exploiting our gullibility. 'The clown is not I', Dali wrote once, 'but rather our monstrously cynical and so naively unconscious society that plays at the game of being serious, the better to hide its own madness.' I was ready to escape from the circus. Jimmy Burns flew from London to Seville and thence to Barcelona c/o Iberia. Tel: 071-437-5622.</p>

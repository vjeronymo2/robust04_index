			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Nevenka Levak: "Osijek--In First Place"] </F>   [Text] We are in fact no longer the rich Slavonia of  immeasurable natural beauty and endless fields of grain, but  rather the disfigured vestibule to Croatia which many people are  sweeping under the rug because of peace in their own home.    "Osijek is the best!" the residents of this city finally  shouted, but the excitement subsided when they realized that  Osijek is in fact at the top of the welfare and unemployment  list. This was the effective conclusion drawn by Ivan Parac,  minister of labor and social welfare of the RH [Republic of  Croatia], during a visit to our city and vicinity. Still, such a  situation is normal, he continued, because this city was on the  front line of the fighting, but since we know that we are still  in that position, this situation is hardly likely to change.    The city has been razed and it is necessary to invest in  reconstruction, it was said at the meeting between Mr. Parac and  the zupanija administration. This is because it is obvious that  given the lack of economic capacities, the people who are  employed have nothing to do, so that those who have had the good  fortune to find work at private but nonproductive businesses are  losing their jobs as those businesses close due to unprofitable  operation. Since the end of May 1992, i.e., two years ago, we  have not seen a single crane in Osijek, except the one at the  Drava Bridge, and even that one is scarcely used.    Production capacities in Osijek are being rebuilt only  slowly  or not at all because there is no influx of fresh capital, and  there is uncertainty about whether certain outdated technologies  should even be rebuilt or whether the economy should be fully  reconstructed and adapted to the needs of the contemporary  market. But the basic precondition for that--which is still  called capital--is not present. Mr. Parac also contends that  Slavonia is at the top of the list in terms of the threat to  social welfare, which is illogical for this (once) rich region.  But we are no longer rich. The entire city is supplied by  several private gardens in Tvrdjavica and Podravlje, while  everything else that arrives is rinsed like fresh lettuce in a  pile of taxes and surtaxes for fools. This time, the conclusion  has emerged that the rest of Croatia should help Slavonia, which  once fed all of Croatia and then some, but it is already too  late for such a conclusion. We have already swallowed our share  of heavy wartime and postwar calamity, and now we are coping  practically on our own. For two years we have survived on rice  and noodles, but now, in any event, we also have vegetables.  Indeed, Minister Parac emphasizes that it is illogical that  Osijek and Slavonia are in this position, and says verbatim  "that there have been structural dislocations in the overall  economy, infrastructure, education system, health care, and  elsewhere in this region." What interests us in particular is  the question of what should be done after the city was  systematically shelled for a year and a half by "acquaintances"  who knew very well where they were aiming. Perhaps someone could  call the sweeping destruction of the Osijek economy a  "structural change," but at the very least that is a ludicrous  academic buzzword for what has happened to us, about which  Croatia has remained silent for two years now. It cannot even be  said that the people in Zagreb knew nothing about this, because  we have made plenty of noise, but until it became more or less  popular to descend on Slavonia and individually shudder at the  situation, which Croatian ministers have been doing lately, no  one recognized this about us out loud. If this results in  action, and not only reaction, then we will be satisfied with  that, because better late than never; but if it has become  fashionable to visit Slavonia and experience revulsion, then  that is worse than the blissful ignorance demonstrated thus far  by individuals from the metropolis. We are in fact no longer the  rich Slavonia of immeasurable natural beauty and endless fields  of grain, but rather the disfigured vestibule to Croatia which  many people are sweeping under the rug because of peace in their  own home. Unfortunately, we are not able to do that, because we  live here.</p>

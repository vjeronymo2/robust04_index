			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLOSING OF HERALD EXAMINER ENDS COLORFUL NEWSPAPER ERA  </P> <P> The Times pompously declares in its Nov. 2 editorial that the Herald Examiner  folded, in part, because "the public's appetite for such reportage is satisfied  by lesser television talk shows." In this same editorial phrases such as  "working-class tastes" and "entertaining sensationalism of yellow journalism"  are used. This display of arrogant elitism will make the loss of the Herald all  the more painful.  </P> <P> The Herald considered its readers as peers writing for them and to them not at  them as a didactic parent. Come on Times, don't take yourself so seriously,  none of us do.  </P> <P> BARRY BOSSCHER, Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Fair trade sought in tea The Fairtrade Foundation, an organisation supported by leading development agencies and consumer groups, yesterday launched a fair trade label for tea. The foundation said its label would ensure better conditions and social benefits for workers on tea estates in developing countries. 'The arrival of these teas marks a watershed,' said Mr Phil Wells, the foundation's standards manager. 'It is the first time that independent inspection of tea estates, on behalf of consumers, has been allowed to take place.' The first teas come from two estates in Sri Lanka and the Nilgiri mountains of southern India. They are produced by Clipper Teas and will be sold by Sainsbury, the biggest UK supermarket group, as well as smaller food shops. Mr Wells said the foundation hoped initially to capture about 3 per cent of the British market - which consumes 70bn cups of tea a year.</p>

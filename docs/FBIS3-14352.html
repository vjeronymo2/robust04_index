We can never back any attempt to separate  southern Sudan from the north.    Speaking to reporters following the closed session of the  Arab League ministerial council, Musa said the council decided  to postpone discussion on the amendment of the league charter  and relevant issues until Arab conditions improve and consensus  is obtained on the amendment and its terms.    He noted that the seven-member committee will hold a meeting  this evening to discuss the Lockerbie crisis and developments in  Libya's crisis with the West.    Touching on a meeting among the foreign ministers of cordon  states on the sidelines of the foreign ministers session, 'Amr  Musa said: We did not discuss this subject and there are no  arrangements to hold such a meeting on the sidelines of the  ministerial council session.    Sudanese Foreign Minister Husayn Abu-Salih praised Musa's  remarks on southern Sudan, saying: We thank Egypt for this  strategic stance, which seeks to preserve Sudanese unity,  because Sudan's security is the same as Egypt's and is part of  the pan-Arab security.    He described his meeting with 'Amr Musa today as  "fraternal".    The Sudanese minister hoped official dialogue will continue  between the Egyptian and Sudanese sides in Khartoum. We welcome  Minister 'Amr Musa in Sudan to resume dialogue on disputed  issues and resolve them, he said.    Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said that the Arab  boycott of Israel was not raised during the new session of the  Arab foreign ministers council that started today. What we  discussed is the report submitted by the Damascus-based Arab  Bureau on the Boycott of Israel, he explained.    Al-Shar' added that Arab parties have agreed to postpone the  issue of amending the charter until an Arab summit is held, in  view of the importance of the topic.    Saudi Foreign Minister Sa'ud al-Faysal stated that the  council's discussions today were constructive and that an  agreement was reached to postpone discussion on the amendment of  the charter because of its importance.    He added that a number of remarks were made on that topic,  including the view that this important matter should be  discussed when the Arab atmosphere is more favorable so that the  charter can be reviewed after due consideration and away from  side issues that can affect Arab solidarity.    Ibrahim al-Bishari, Libya's delegate to the Arab League,  said  today that he will submit a full report to a seven-member  committee that includes the foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria,  Libya, Mauritania, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia.</p>

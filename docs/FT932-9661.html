			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Yeltsin tries to speed new constitution RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin yesterday signed a decree calling for a special assembly of the Council of the Federation for June 5 to 'consider and finalise preparation' of a new Russian constitution. Mr Yeltsin's plan is that the council would adopt a new constitution, thereby bypassing the federal parliament. Under the present amended Soviet-era constitution, it is parliament's responsibility to pass any new constitution. The council will be composed of two representatives from each of Russia's 88 regions and autonomous republics as well as representatives of the president and parliament. Simultaneously yesterday the Russian parliament launched its own timetable for a new constitution. The announcements marked the beginning of a process certain to divide the country between the conservative parliament and its regional allies on the one side and President Yeltsin and his supporters on the other. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, parliamentary Speaker and Mr Vitaly Zorkin, chairman of the constitution, both told meetings of the regional council representatives that Mr Yeltsin would be guilty of 'a crime' if he pressed ahead with his plans to adopt a new constitution. In a speech of pointed ferocity, Mr Khasbulatov said that Mr Yeltsin's 'political games' would cause the disintegration of the Russian federation. He also warned the regional leaders - whom Mr Yeltsin has been wooing - that 'those high officials want to make you all equally guilty in this.' From a less predictably hostile position, Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, a centrist deputy who is the secretary of the parliament's constitutional committee, warned of the dangers to democracy from Mr Yeltsin's version of the constitution, which he described as ushering in a 'super presidential regime.' The parliament's version, which Mr Rumyantsev's committee drew up and which called for the establishment of a parliamentary republic with a relatively constrained president, is to be discussed throughout this month with the elected regional and republican councils - with a final version due to be approved on July 6. The adoption of Mr Yeltsin's constitution would mean immediate elections, since it abolishes the present parliament which is composed of a Congress of Peoples' Deputies and a Supreme Soviet in favour of a bi-cameral assembly with the Council of the Federation of the Upper House and a State Duma - the name taken from the pre-revolutionary Russian assembly - as the lower house. This wooing of the regions will be largely based on promises to increase their economic autonomy and lighten their tax and other obligations. Mr Yeltsin's control of the government and of the armed forces and security ministries give him the edge in the struggle against his conservative opponents and there already appears to be signs that the administrative leaders, and even some local councils, are inclining towards him.</p>

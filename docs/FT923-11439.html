			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Motorola to spend Pounds 40m on Scots microchip plant MOTOROLA, the US electr-onics group, yesterday announced plans to expand its East Kilbride semiconductor plant in Scotland to make it the biggest of its kind in Europe. It was the second large investment in Scotland to be announced by a US electronics group in the past three months. Motorola proposes to spend Pounds 40m to increase manufacturing capacity at East Kilbride and to enable the plant to produce a new generation of microprocessors now manufactured by Motorola only in the US. National Semiconductor, another large US microchip manufacturer, announced plans in May to spend Pounds 49.5m expanding its plant at Greenock in Scotland, creating 250 jobs over two years. Motorola expects to create 150 jobs at East Kilbride, increasing the plant's workforce to nearly 2,000 and making the company one of Scotland's biggest private employers. Mr Allan Stewart, industry minister for Scotland, welcomed the decision which he said would enhance the country's position at the forefront of the European electronics industry. Scotland accounts for about a fifth of European semiconductor output and more than half of UK production. The more than 450 companies involved in the electronics industry in Scotland employ almost 50,000 people and account for almost a fifth of its manufacturing output. Just over half of all production is exported to continental Europe. Mr Barry Waite, general manager of Motorola's European semiconductor division, said that it was indicative of the company's commitment to Europe and East Kilbride that the latest investment was being made when the UK was fighting to recover from recession. Motorola has already spent Pounds 230m at East Kilbride since it set up in Scotland in 1969. The latest investment will allow the plant to manufacture some of the new 68,000 range of microprocessors which are capable of holding far higher amounts of data on each tiny piece of silicon. Motorola said: 'We will be able to etch on a piece of silicon measuring 0.5 sq cm a street map of the whole of the UK. Those semi-conductor streets, 0.5 microns wide and 160 times thinner than a human hair, will connect together more than 6m transistors on the silicon surface.' Microchips produced at East Kilbride are used in a wide range of products from cars and CD players to computers and washing machines.</p>

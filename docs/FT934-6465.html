			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / (CORRECTED) Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (3): Banking enjoys a shake-up - The balance is shifting from the public to the private sector Correction (published 26th November 1993) appended to this article. Few Turkish industries have welcomed the government's commitment to Europe quite as readily as the banks. A new decree, passed with the effect of law in September, brought Turkey into line with its European competitors in a number of important areas and marked a further deepening of the financial sector. The confidence is readily apparent. On the Istanbul stock exchange the banks listed are among the most profitable and heavily traded stocks. For the first time a Turkish bank has floated shares internationally, with Garanti Bankasi selling Dollars 103m worth of stock through an American Depositary Receipt in November. With growing frequency, the private sector banks are able to tap international debt markets. A whole host of banks have successfully ventured into the markets including Korfez, Turkey's most profitable bank, which raised Dollars 25m in a one-year loan arranged by Bank of New York. In November Akbank, Turkey's largest family-owned bank, was due to conclude its first-ever foreign syndication - a Dollars 100m one-year borrowing. Mr Erol Sabanci, the bank's chief executive, said that at point 85 over London Inter Bank Offered Rate, the deal underscored Akbank's standing as the best rated bank in Turkey. The Turkish banking industry is still dominated by the state with the five state banks accounting for close to half the total assets, which at the end of 1992 were around Dollars 67bn. The largest private sector banks are run by family holdings, including Sabanci's Akbank, Cukurova's Yapi Kredi, Pamukbank and Interbank or the Dogus Holding's Garanti. But the new law should help shift the balance in favour of the private sector. For the state banks, like others, are being forced to improve their capital ratios. With the government reluctant to inject new capital into the state banks, the only way to meet the targets is to run down their equity participations and reduce their loan book. Troubled banks can be forced into liquidation, where before they were absorbed by a state bank. 'It's a long overdue signal that depositors will have to take the risk of a bank into account,' says Mr Ibrahim Betil of Expresbank. In the case of a failed state bank, the government will continue to step in. Last year, the government announced that Tobank, the teachers' bank, was to be merged with the Halk Bankasi and Denizcilik Bankasi, the maritime bank, was merged with Emlak, the state housing bank. The wholesale privatisation of the big state banks, such as Ziraat and Emlak, may be some way off. Ziraat is more like an arm of the treasury, dispensing credits to farmers and using its extensive branch network to pay civil servants and other government employees in rural areas. But on a smaller scale, the banking operations of Sumerbank, the textile manufacturing and general retailing outfit, have been offered for sale. Similar moves have been made to allow for the disposal of the banking side of Etibank, the minerals concern. A more promising prospect is the government's planned sale of its 12 per cent stake in Turkiye Is Bankasi, the country's largest commercial bank. The shake-up in the state sector is mirrored by a rapid restructuring among private banks. Banks are closing branches and laying off staff while enhancing electronic banking. In less than a decade, Turkey has moved from a relative lack of sophistication to become a modern industry. But for most Turks, the plastic card is not so much an instrument of credit as a way to obtain cash. Most transactions are still done on a cash basis. The main thrust for introducing automatic teller machines (ATMs) was 'to keep the customers out of the bank,' says Mr Akin Ongor of Garanti. His bank is leading the way in computerisation, with all 201 Garanti branches now using real time clearing systems. The development of electronic banking has also forced banks to improve their credit supervision. 'Today you can go to 10 different banks and get a card from each one and no one will know,' says Mr Ongor. The foreign card companies like Visa are said to be concerned by the growing number of defaults. In parallel with these moves, many banks are boosting their consumer lending business, still a fairly small share of most banks' asset books. Garanti says consumer credit currently accounts for around 4 per cent of its total loans - corporate loans making up the lion's share. But as interest margins on corporate lending have narrowed, banks are turning to consumer loans. Garanti says it intends to increase its operations. Consumer credit is particularly attractive for the banks with links with big corporations, which can then offer customers hire purchase financing. Koc, the largest holding company, is boosting its banking services, in part to take advantage of the booming car sales and sales of consumer durables, two sectors where it has a dominant position. Akbank is developing its consumer credit facilities to finance Toyota's joint venture with its parent, Sabanci Holding. In 1992 the government liberalised the rules on the issue of asset-backed securities. The securitisation of various debt instruments such as car and housing loans has been a popular practice in recent months, providing banks with a cheaper source of funds. By shifting the risk of default to new investors, it also reduces the onerous capital adequacy requirements set under the new law. But the broader economic impact is potentially more dangerous. 'The banks have now been given an incentive to lend to customers for consumption,' says a foreign economist. In a related issue, in October a number of banks applied to the Capital Markets Board to be allowed to issue commercial paper. Again, like securitised loans, this is seen as a cheap funding for banks as it would not incur liquidity requirements set by the central bank. However, under the current rules only investment banks, which are restricted from taking deposits, municipalities, corporations and state enterprises are allowed to issue commercial paper. No decision has been made to allow banks to issue commercial paper. Nonetheless, the issue has thrown into relief the tension between the need to deepen the financial markets and the perhaps more pressing concern of the banking authorities to keep a hold on money supply. Currently for every 100 lira put on time deposit with a bank, on average 46 lira has to be held as reserve or liquidity requirements - in effect, it is a tax on the banking system. Call deposits are a slightly cheaper way to raise funds. As a result, the intermediation costs - the spread between deposits and credits - keep interest rates high. Another result is that rates between different banks can vary as much as 15 per cent. 'Nowhere in the world are interest rates quite as free as in Turkey,' says Mr Erol Sabanci, disapprovingly. Inflation continues to make it difficult to assess bank performance. IBCA, the London-based rating agency, estimates that most major banks in Turkey saw a negative return on equity in 1992. Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, has pledged to reduce banks costs in a bid to bring down interest rates. However, there is little possibility of that while the government deficit continues to grow. The sector has other more urgent problems. The banking authorities are watching closely the foreign exchange exposure of many private sector banks as they seek to fund their lira business by borrowing offshore. Given high real interest rates offered in lira deposits, the attractions of borrowing offshore are enormous. Garanti estimates that currently 27 per cent of its profits result from trading on its short positions. Garanti was the most profitable of the large privately owned banks in 1992. The bank, however, remains cautious. 'We have a policy that the open position should not exceed the equity of the bank,' says Mr Aclan Acar, a director. 'That means the shareholders take the risk, not the depositors. We've suggested to the central bank that they should make this rule applicable to all banks.' But the danger, particularly with the government indicating that it favours a more rapid depreciation of the lira, is that it could result in a massive one-way currency flow as banks seek to close on their foreign exchange positions. CORRECTION Equity capitalisation on the Istanbul Stock Exchange is currently estimated at just under Dollars 30bn. The figure given in an article in the Financial Times survey on Turkish finance and industry, published on November 25, was incorrect.</p>

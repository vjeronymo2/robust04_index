			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia `ideologue' Giuliano Urbani by </F> Antonio Preziosi in Perugia; date not given: "We Are Stronger  Than the League and the MSI"-- first paragraph is L'INDIPENDENTE  introduction]    [Text] Perugia -- Forza Italia's boat has the wind in its  sails, and the ideologue in Berlusconi's party, the party's  "second fiddle," strongly believes in it. He was awarded his  daily round of applause, this time in Perugia. He discussed  programs and alliances, and made no secret of his optimism,  pointing to the results of opinion polls. "Forza Italia's  success," Urbani enthused, "proves in my mind that there was a  huge gap in the center of the Italian political landscape."    [Preziosi] What about Martinazzoli [Italian Popular Party,  PPI, secretary]?    [Urbani] I hope he finds the role he seems to be looking for  . Of course electoral trends are little puzzling at the moment.    [Preziosi] Your decision to form an alliance with [League  Secretary Bossi] and [National Alliance coordinator] Fini was  also a little puzzling. How do you answer such criticism?    [Urbani] This is a delicate moment in our country's history.  I think that in the past few years important changes have taken  place in the Northern League and the MSI [Italian Social  Movement -- now National Alliance], as well as in other parties  and movements. I prefer to encourage these changes rather than  highlight past mistakes.    [Preziosi] The League in the North, the former MSI in the  South: It looks rather like a pincer. Could this embrace not  prove lethal for Forza Italia?    [Urbani] I would not say so because, judging by the  electoral trends expressed by the Italian people, we are  stronger than both of them. I am afraid of other things.    [Preziosi] Such as?    [Urbani] The immense problems Italy has right now. Of  course we cannot kid ourselves, after what we have gone through  in the past two years, that our country will become like  Britain's Westminster in a matter of a fortnight. I think we  are all called upon to make our contribution.    [Preziosi] At the forthcoming elections for example.    [Urbani] This election is an important test, because if we  end up in the hands of the wrong surgeons, we will draw further  away from rather than closer to good government.    [Preziosi] You are already tipped as one of the future  Berlusconi government's key ministers.    [Urbani] Those are merely journalistic predictions. The  formation of governments will be decided by votes and majorities.</p>

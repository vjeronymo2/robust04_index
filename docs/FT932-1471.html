			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Fresh round of profits warnings flatten Dow Wall Street A FRESH round of profits warnings from major corporations left US stock prices easier yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 13.29 at 3,497.53. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, however, lost only 0.29 at 445.93, while the Nasdaq composite was off 1.97 at 686.77. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 258m shares. In recent weeks a string of big companies have issued warnings unexpectedly about their immediate earnings prospects, many of them the result of disappointing sales. Additionally, some have said they believe future business conditions will be less favourable than originally expected. Taken with recent data which has shown a struggling economy, the spate of corporate profits warnings suggests that the outlook for stock prices may not be as bright as it appeared at the start of the year, when economic growth was accelerating sharply and profits improving substantially. Consequently, investors fear that equities may have to give back some of the gains of this year before valuations return to more justifiable levels. Among the latest companies to issue downbeat earnings prospects were Kmart and Chemical Waste Management. Kmart, the country's second largest retailer, fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 20 1/8 (a new 52-week low) in volume of 5.1m shares after the company's management warned that, because of poor recent retail sales, its second-quarter earnings would come in significantly below the 37 cents a share reported a year earlier. The news from Kmart hit other retail shares. JC Penney tumbled Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 44 1/4 , Gap Stores Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 30 3/8 , The Limited Dollars 1 to Dollars 21 7/8 and Federated Department Stores Dollars 1 to Dollars 21 1/4 . WMX, parent of Chemical Waste Management, which announced on Monday that it expects to report second-quarter earnings well below those achieved in 1992, dropped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 33 1/8 after stating that its own second-quarter earnings would also come in below the previous year's level. Chemical Waste fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 10 1/8 in volume of 2.06m shares. Tambrands was initially buoyed by hopes that management will find a buyer for the company, but after rising Dollars 1 the stock finally ran into profit-taking and fell back to end Dollars  3/4 off on balance at Dollars 45 1/2 . News of a fresh round of price cuts in the long-running air fares war depressed airline issues. AMR, parent of American Airlines, lost Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 60 1/2 , UAL Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 118, USAir Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 15 3/4 and Delta Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 47. On the Nasdaq market, technology shares continued to decline, Novell shedding Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 23 3/4 and Adobe Systems Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 61 1/2. Canada THE real estate sector led the Toronto market into higher ground yesterday in heavy trading. The TSE 300 index ended a further 13.3 ahead at 3,935.7 and rises outscored declines by 392 to 360 after volume of 78.8m shares valued at some CDollars 836m. Eleven of the 14 stock groups rose, with the real estate index gaining 2.06 per cent. Golds were modestly firmer.</p>

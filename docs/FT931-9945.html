			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Barre sounds the alarm over Anglo-Saxon ambush of franc THE CURRENCY markets will launch a heavy but unsuccessful attack against the franc next month, during the French parliamentary election, according to Mr Raymond Barre, former prime minister of France. Mr Barre, a leading proponent of the hard franc policy and a senior ally of the UDF centre-right party, said the attack will be inspired by Anglo-Saxon financial institutions unwilling to see the creation of a European currency which could rival the dollar. He does not suspect any government influence, he emphasised. The attack will be beaten off by joint intervention by the Banque de France and the Bundesbank. 'I am not among those who see plots everywhere. It's not at all my temperament. But I really think there is a will in a certain number of economic and financial circles not to promote - in fact to do everything to prevent - the creation of European monetary and economic union, and in consequence to blow up the EMS,' said Mr Barre. He would not be drawn further, beyond saying that he knew of a research study by (unidentified) financial institutions analysing the risks posed by a single European currency for their own businesses. 'It's my absolute and objective conviction. I expect, as a result, that there will be a strong assault on the franc before the elections, or in the period of the elections or just after the elections,' he said. The vote, on March 21 and 28, is likely to produce a record parliamentary majority for the opposition centre-right alliance of the RPR, which is divided over the Maastricht treaty on political and monetary union, and the pro-European UDF. 'When these foreign circles see that a strong part of RPR is hostile to the Maastricht treaty and to French monetary policy, they ask themselves if a government of the new majority tomorrow would be unified enough to hold the political line.' The right-wing leaders are so firmly in favour of holding to the franc fort policy that the new government would find it very difficult to let the franc float or to go for devaluation, he argued. 'Absolute determination' will be required of the new administration. If monetary union succeeds in some form, as Mr Barre believes it will, he argues that the new European currency will have the status of a widely used commercial, financial and reserve currency, similar to sterling at the end of the 19th century. 'The day you have a European currency which is used in the trade exchanges of the first commercial power in the world, the European Community, the day when it's possible for Community banks to use the Ecu, and when their reserves will be held in the Ecu, we will have the real alternative to the dollar. Money is power - that's what it's about,' said Mr Barre. He believes that the future currency, possible towards the end of the decade, will initially include seven (France, Germany, the three Benelux countries, Spain and Italy) or eight members. The Bundesbank will again support the French currency in the speculative attack likely next month, partly because 'it won't want to take the risk of letting the EMS collapse. The Bundesbank cannot take this responsibility.' But, just as important, said Mr Barre, is that 'the Bundesbank considers that the fundamentals of the French economy are satisfactory. I am convinced that, if the fundamentals had been negative, the Bundesbank would never have supported them, even in taking into consideration the political factors.' Editorial comment, Page 19</p>

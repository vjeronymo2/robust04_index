			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RECORD AMOUNT WITHDRAWN FROM S&amp;LS NATIONWIDE  </P> <P> Depositors withdrew a record $15.1 billion from the nation's savings and loans  in April, the government said Friday in another confirmation of the rapid  retrenchment gripping the industry.  </P> <P> The net withdrawal, which was somewhat offset by $2.9 billion in interest  credited to savers' accounts, reduced deposits at the 2,839 S&amp;Ls to $916  billion, the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision said.  </P> <P> The previous record of $13.4 billion was set three months earlier. Before that,  the record was $10.8 billion set in January, 1989.  </P> <P> Analysts attributed the outflow, the 22nd in 23 months, primarily to the need  to meet stiff capital standards imposed by last year's S&amp;L bailout law,  among other reasons.  </P> <P> Few S&amp;Ls are earning much in profits, and they are having difficulty  attracting new capital from investors. Thus, they must shrink their operations,  analysts said.  </P> <P> S&amp;L assets totaled $1.21 trillion, down $12.9 billion from March and $133  billion from a peak of $1.34 trillion in May.  </P> <P> Other reasons cited include the normal April outflow as depositors pay federal  tax bills, S&amp;Ls' reduced need for funds in a depressed housing market and  government sale of S&amp;Ls to commercial banks.  </P></p>

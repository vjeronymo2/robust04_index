			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, June 24 (AFP) -- NATO airplanes have  fired warning flares against Serb forces attacking UN troops in  northern Bosnia, the first such action since a truce became  effective June 10, a UN spokesman said Friday [24 June]. Dutch  UN armoured vehicles were hit by Serb shells Thursday at the  village of Teocak, east of Tuzla, while escorting a humanitarian  aid convoy, United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman  Major Rob Annink said. "Air presence was requested and aircraft  dropped flares as a warning signal," he explained. There were  no injuries.    The request went to the UNPROFOR commander in Bosnia,  Lieutenant General Michael Rose, who asked one of the regular  North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air patrols in the region to  approach and fire the flares, said Annink. He did not request  full-scale air intervention which would have required the  agreement of General Bertrand de Lapresle, commander of UN  troops in all of former Yugoslavia, and UN special  representative Yasushi Akashi. Both Serb and Moslem artillery  have remained active despite the truce around Mount Ozren, in  northern Bosnia, with UN observations posts among the targets,  the major said.    In particular, he referred to an attack on a post in  Moslem-held territory east of the mountain, which was hit by  Serb artillery, and a Nordic Battalion attacked by light arm  fire. There were no injuries or damage, he said. Fighting in  the Bihac enclave in western Bosnia, between the mainly Moslem  Bosnian Army and a breakaway Moslem group, has died down but  Serb forces had fired 160 shells against the army in the region,  he said.    There were fewer ceasefire violations in the Bosnian capital  Sarajevo, most of them at the airport. A Serb policeman was  killed by a Bosnian sniper and two Bosnian soldiers were wounded  by Serb bullets in the town, he said. The Bosnian Serb agency  SRNA quoted a local radio report saying the Bosnian Army had  launched an artillery attack against the strategic Serb-held  town of Doboj Friday. "Several shells" had fallen on the town  which was under general alert, the agency said.</p>

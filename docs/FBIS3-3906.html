Chen Huangyou said: In his government work report  develivered  at the current NPC session, Premier Li Peng, in accordance with  the basic work principle decided by the party Central Committee,  set forth the various tasks for 1994. The report fully  manifests the "general principle for the work of the whole party  and country" -- "seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up  wider, promote development, and maintain stability" -- set by  the CPC Central Committee. The work for this year of the  Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee and government will conform to  and serve this principle; we will rely on the common efforts of  people across the province and do a better job in our work in  all areas.    "How will Jiangsu accommodate and serve the work of the  whole  party and country to promote its own development?" Chen Huanyou  said the first thing to do is to continue to deepen reform. He  said: The scope, depth, difficulty, and intensity of the major  reform measures adopted by the state this year are all greater  than those of the past. Although there are risks and  contradictions in making reforms, now is a favorable time for  making reforms -- a good job in reform this year will lay a good  foundation for our future reform and development. According to  the central authorities' plan, this year Jiangsu will give  prominence to making reforms -- we will promote  mutually-supportive reforms in all areas, with the focus on  building a modern enterprise system and on promoting reform of  the macroeconomic management system. We will do specific work  in detail and in a down-to-earth manner, and will properly  publicize, explain, organize, coordinate, and carry out the  adopted reform measures to ensure practical results. He added:  The task of this year's reform and development is very heavy.  By seizing the opportunity of this year's reform of the foreign  trade system and the foreign exchange management system, Jiangsu  will promote opening up to the outside world within a larger  scope and sphere and at a higher level, and will interweave its  economy with the international economy at a faster pace and in a  better way. We will further expand the capacity for and raise  the level of utilizing foreign funds, make positive efforts to  expand foreign economic and technological cooperation, and build  up various kinds of development zones starting from a high level  and using high standards. Chen Huanyou stressed: The heavier  the task of reform and development is, the more we need to work  hard to improve the quality of economic growth. This year, the  focus of Jiangsu's economic work will be placed on improving the  quality and efficiency of and on raising the level of its  economic growth. We should bear in mind that "development is  the last word." We should develop at the highest possible speed  those export-oriented projects producing marketable products  with good efficiency. Of course we should make the best use of  our subjective initiative and attach special importance to  relying on technological progress and on raising workers'  educational levels in readjusting the economic structure, in  improving the quality of economic growth, in raising the entire  economic level, and in improving the overall economic results.    Chen Huanyou also explained how Jiangsu will accommodate and  serve the work of the whole party and country and promote  regional economic development by further improving the  province's infrastructural facilities, by stepping up the  development of its basic industries, and by further ensuring its  social stability.</p>

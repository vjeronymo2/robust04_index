			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: WEW firms 16% to Pounds 5.2m WEW Group, the discount retailer formerly called Amber Day Holdings, yesterday reported a 16 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.2m in the six months ending January 29. WEW, which has 61 stores trading under the What Everyone Wants banner, was refinanced last December by a placing and Pounds 15.5m rights issue which allowed Warburg Pincus, the US investment institution, to raise its stake from 17 to 25 per cent. The US investment house is backing the group's aim to double the number of WEW stores to about 125 over the next five years, in the process of expanding across the whole country from its current strongholds in Scotland, the north of England and the Midlands. Mr Peter Carr, chairman, said that despite the anticipated impact of tax increases, the company was still on course to realise the real potential of its retail format. Turnover rose from Pounds 61.3m to Pounds 66.4m. The group said Christmas trading was encouraging and the performance of its then six newest stores had exceeded initial expectations. Trading at the beginning of the second half was poor and only started to improve in late March, ahead of tax increases in April. Mr Carr said that the buying and merchandising functions, critical to the group's ability to improve merchandise ranges and allocations, were being strengthened. Three new stores opened in time for Easter - in Inverness, Wishaw and Oldham  -were already trading ahead of budget. Together with a further store intended to be opened before the end of July, new store openings during the current financial year would reach 10. Earnings per share rose by 9 per cent to 2.72p (2.54p), but the interim dividend is cut to 0.35p (1.1p).</p>

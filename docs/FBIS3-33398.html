We have many reasons to seek  the strengthening of Cuban-Chinese relations of friendship and  cooperation, because the two countries have the same principles  and ideals uniting us closely, Xu Yicong said.    The Chinese ambassador added that political relations  between  the two countries are also growing closer every day, trade is  increasing, and economic cooperation is developing quickly. He  said that the Joint Commission for Cuban-Chinese Cooperation  will meet in March in Havana to study trade prospects between  the two nations.    In Santa Clara, Xu Yicong visited the installation of what  will be the largest Cuban bicycle factory with Chinese  technology. This factory will be able to produce 150,000 units  annually.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 18 May (NOTIMEX) -- An official source has  reported that Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro today  contacted former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez to  express her solidarity with him. A Presidency document states  "Chamorro contacted Perez this morning to express her solidarity  with and fondness for him."    The Venezuelan Supreme Court of Justice issued today in  Caracas an arrest warrant for the former president as part of  his trial for allegedly embezzling $17 million between 1989 and  1992. The Presidency communique recalled a message by Perez in  which he said he "never" embezzled the secret $17 million fund,  part of which reportedly was transferred to the current  Nicaraguan Government to "reinforce democracy." Perez was  impeached on 20 May 1993 when the Venezuelan court found  sufficient evidence to try him for allegedly committing  embezzlement.    Chamorro recently deemed the allegation that Perez  financially supported her government "false," but she  acknowledged the efforts of the former president to "defuse the  spiral of warlike tension in Central America."</p>

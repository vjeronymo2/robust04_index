			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: PACIFIC PALISADES;  </P> <P> SUNSET PROJECT APPROVED  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council has given initial approval to the widening of a  1,700-foot stretch of Sunset Boulevard, despite complaints from some residents  that the project will increase traffic.  </P> <P> By an 11-0 vote Tuesday, the council approved a report that found the  $1.8-million proposal would have no significant effect on the environment.  </P> <P> The proposed project must still be endorsed by several state and federal  agencies, and eventually must return to the council for funding.  </P> <P> Some area residents, including members of the Pacific Palisades Residents  Assn., urged the council to delay approval of the project because of concerns  about the environment. The residents predicted that the widening would create  major noise, traffic and pollution problems.  </P> <P> "It will become a speedway," resident Michael Franklin said. "There is no need  for this project."  </P> <P> But Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the area, said the improvements  are needed to make the corridor safer for motorists and pedestrians.  </P> <P> The project calls for creating several left-turn pockets, as well as a center  median between Baylor Street and an alley just east of Las Lomas Avenue.  </P></p>

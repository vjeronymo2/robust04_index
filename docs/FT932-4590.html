			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Offer for Univa dropped CONTROL OF Canada's second largest food distributor, the Montreal-based Univa, with sales of more than CDollars 5bn (USDollars 3.9bn), is again in play. E. M. Warburg Pincus, the New York investment group, has dropped its offer to buy 26 per cent of Univa from Montreal entrepreneur Bertin Nadeau's Unigesco. The price was to have been CDollars 8.85 a share or about CDollars 200m. This would have allowed Unigesco to repay debt due in the next year. Unigesco said it has begun negotiations to sell its Univa holding with unidentified Quebec institutions. The second biggest holder of Univa is the Sobey family of Novia Scotia with 25 per cent. However this block is potentially for sale. The next biggest holder is the Caisse de Depot, Quebec's CDollars 42bn public pension fund, with 13.5 per cent. The Caisse has already indicated it wants to keep effective control of Univa in Quebec. Earlier this year the Caisse opposed a CDollars 11 a share bid from New York investment bankers Blackstone Group for all Univa shares totalling about CDollars 1bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Republican Party Secretary Giorgio La Malfa </F> by Roberto Petrini; place and date not given: "La Malfa: They  Have Lost Their Bearings"]    [Text] Rome -- The first power-sharing deals are  taking place, privatization is being slowed down, reorganization  plans, such as Alitalia's, are being blocked. Giorgio La Malfa,  during a pause between the rallies of the European election  campaign, drew up a balance sheet of the moves made so far by  Berlusconi's new government, three weeks after its birth and 24  hours after the rapping on the knuckles from the Bank of Italy's  governor. "Liberalism? I believe not a trace of it is left,"  the Italian Republican Party secretary said. "But, above all,  there is no trace of the coherent economic policy which the  country badly needs."    [Petrini] Deputy La Malfa, let us start with what the Bank  of  Italy's governor had to say. Do you approve?    [La Malfa] I should say so. Fazio's words were a polite but  firm way of urging the government to make its economic policy  clear.    [Petrini] Judging from its platform, the majority should be  pursuing a policy inspired on liberal principles: fewer taxes,  deregulation of the labor market, individualism. Is this so?    [La Malfa] These were the principles inspiring the election  campaign. Before the elections, the majority proposed an  economic expansion policy to be implemented by reducing taxes.  However, a problem has now arisen: Such a policy does not  accord with the necessary reconstruction of public finances.  What does the government intend to do? Will it pursue the  liberalism it proclaimed during the election campaign or will it  follow [former Prime Minister] Ciampi's road, trying to  reconcile support for economic recovery with the attempt to  reduce the debt?    [Petrini] In your opinion, what path is it following?    [La Malfa] In my view, it is making a U-turn, going back on  the liberal intentions vaunted during the election campaign.    [Petrini] Does this mean that the "gap" in public finances  will force the government to take back its promise of reducing  taxes?    [La Malfa] Most probably. I do not have any precise figures,  but I know from my own experience that, every year, an  adjustment in the region of 15 to 20 trillion lire [L] is  necessary. This is without taking account of the fact that  possibly certain figures were underestimated in this year's  budget too.    [Petrini] What is your assessment of Berlusconi's first  steps  in the past three weeks?    [La Malfa] As regards privatization, the government stepped  heavily on the brake. It decided to retain 51 percent of the  INA [National Insurance Institute] for the Treasury and to  continue government control through the "golden share" mechanism  in public-sector companies. In these companies, it has not  hesitated to appoint its own people to the boards of directors,  as the Rasi-Telecom case shows. As regards the Alitalia issue,  [Transportation] Minister Fiori immediately blocked the company  reorganization plan which had been prepared by two capable  managers such as Riverso and Schisano.    [Petrini] Still, a first decree on employment has been  drafted.    [La Malfa] The law on employment is a copy of [former Labor  Minister] Giugni's. As far as the South is concerned, I have  noticed a contradiction in relation to the approach advocated  during the election campaign, and I see nothing new in relation  to the past.    [Petrini] What do you think of Gasparri's remarks on  Bankitalia?    [La Malfa] Gasparri, the National Alliance's chief  economist,  vetoed the appointment of Padoa Schioppa who, among other  things, is Bankitalia's senior director and therefore the most  natural successor to Dini's post [at the Bank of Italy]. This  stance is creating enormous embarrassment for the Bank of  Italy's governor. If he appoints Padoa Schioppa, he will be  challenging the government, and if he does not, then it means  that the Bank of Italy has given up its own independence. At  this point, I can only hope that what is involved is just an  untimely remark, and that Berlusconi will immediately distance  himself from it.</p>

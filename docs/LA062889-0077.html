			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOSPITALS' REFUSAL TO TREAT PATIENT FACES STATE INQUIRY  </P> <P> Two state Health Services divisions on Tuesday began investigating the death of  a Westminster man who was refused admission to nine hospitals in Orange, Los  Angeles and San Diego counties.  </P> <P> Also, another state agency, the Emergency Medical Services Authority, will  review the case in an effort to avert a similar tragedy, Director Bruce Haynes  said.  </P> <P> The man, ex-boxer Juan Jimenez Collado, was severely injured May 30 in an  Imperial Valley traffic accident. He died June 18 in an 80-bed Brawley hospital  after that facility, acknowledging that it lacked the staff and sophisticated  equipment to care for Jimenez properly, repeatedly tried and failed to get him  moved to a larger hospital.  </P> <P> Jimenez's family has charged that the other hospitals refused him because he  did not have private insurance. But some of the hospitals involved claim they  did not have any empty beds or a contract to accept state Medi-Cal patients.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, investigators from both the state health agency's licensing  division and Medi-Cal were actively reviewing the circumstances leading to  Jimenez's death.  </P> <P> Medi-Cal investigators will study whether any contract hospitals violated their  agreement with the state by rejecting Jimenez, said Joe Kelly, chief of  Medi-Cal contract operations.  </P> <P> "In general, a Medi-Cal contract hospital is required to accept any patient who  needs services at their hospital," although if no doctor there was willing to  admit Jiminez, there may be no breach of contract, Kelly said.  </P> <P> In addition, licensing investigators in Orange, San Diego and Los Angeles  counties will look at whether any state regulations were violated when nine  hospitals declined to accept Jimenez, said Joan Dowling, regional administrator  for licensing and certification based in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "At the present time, it does not appear from (newspaper accounts) that there  is a violation, based on what we know about the dumping issues (in which one  hospitals seeks to unload an indigent patient on another)," Dowling said. "But  we want to ensure there was no violation of our regulations."  </P> <P> Medi-Cal investigators will look at the following seven contract hospitals that  declined to accept Jimenez: UCI Medical Center in Orange, Fountain Valley  Regional Hospital and Medical Center, UCLA Medical Center, UC San Diego Medical  Center, Sharp Memorial Hospital in San Diego, Mercy Hospital in San Diego and  Grossmont Hospital in San Diego County.  </P> <P> State licensing officials will review records at those hospitals, as well as at  two hospitals without Medi-Cal contracts that also declined to accept Jimenez:  St. Joseph Hospital in Orange and United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana.  </P></p>

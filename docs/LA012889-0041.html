			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS  </P> <P> The inauguration speech of President Bush was filled with lovely words,  promising thoughts and spirited allusions to new breezes. Over the years,  however, I have seen that words are cheap, kept promises rare, and the breezes  have often been an ill wind. Politicians have distorted the truth for so long  that citizens now expect less than ethical behavior from them. When compassion,  justice and truth prevail in our government, I will regain my faith in  inaugural promises.  </P> <P> In the meantime, others tell me to give President Bush a chance even if no one  really expects him to reduce the deficit, feed the hungry, house the homeless  and eliminate drug abuse in the U.S. It occurs to me, however, that if we have  the money and will to engage in the Iran-Contra deal and build 132 Stealth  Bombers at $500 million apiece, then we certainly have the ability and the  money to feed the hungry, house the homeless and effectively fight drug abuse.  It is all a matter of what we choose to do.  </P> <P> Saying that the U.S. is the best country when compared to others in the world  is no excuse for complacency, for we should always strive to improve. There is  always room for improvement. I pray that President Bush uses his power to  perpetuate "truth, justice and the American way." If President Bush wants to  inspire a thousand points of light, he must be a beacon for all Americans,  revealing a "kinder and gentler nation" through integrity and a renewed respect  for government institutions.  </P> <P> CAROL DAVIDSON BAIRD  </P> <P> Solana Beach  </P></p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Judgment deals blow to Merrett Names The legal action brought by almost 2,000 Lloyd's Names against the Merrett syndicate 418 suffered a setback yesterday when a High Court judge dismissed the claims made by almost half those who sustained losses. Mr Justice Gatehouse ruled that the claims of almost 1,000 of the Merrett Names had been made 'out of time' and therefore could not go to a full trial. Lawyers acting on behalf of the Names said they would appeal. The Merrett Names are one of the three biggest groups of losers, along with those belonging to the Gooda Walker and Feltrim syndicates. Names on syndicate 418 sustained substantial losses in the 1985 year over asbestosis and pollution claims. To date these losses total Pounds 135m but the account has not yet been closed because of uncertainty about the scale of liability claims. Names estimate their losses could rise to about Pounds 765m. The position of the Names affected by yesterday's ruling has always been in doubt because they failed to register their claims within the statutory six-year limitation period. They became members of the syndicate before 1984 but did not issue their writs until last year. In a preliminary hearing the Names said that they should be exempted from the six-year rule. They said that they did not have sufficient information to bring a claim until May 1990 and that important knowledge that affected their actions was deliberately concealed from them. The judge dismissed their applications, ruling that a letter from the Merrett managing agents sent in April 1985 and subsequent reports and accounts gave claimants enough information for the six-year period to start then. The main action in which the remaining Merrett Names are suing Merrett Syndicates, its auditors, the then Ernst &amp; Whinney, and the members' agents is set to start in March next year. Although the damages sought have never been quantified, a figure of Pounds 160m was thought probable. However, Mr Simon Roper of Oswald Hickson, solicitors for the members' agents, said the ruling had reduced both the scale and the scope of the trial. The damages sought would be less and the issues would be restricted to questions of reinsurance rather than whether the original contracts should have been written.</p>

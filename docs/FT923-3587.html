			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Row over return of EETPU avoided THE Trades Union Congress yesterday cleared the way for readmission of the EETPU electricians' union, which is now a section of the merged AEEU engineering workers' and electricians' union. Delegates accepted a formula that allows considerable room for manoeuvre in affiliation talks. A damaging row over the the union's reaffiliation was avoided when the NUJ journalists' union agreed not to table a motion which might have led to the AEU engineering workers' union, the EETPU's partner in the new AEEU, quitting the TUC. Nonetheless, Mr Colin Bourne, an NUJ delegate, was given one of the warmest receptions of the week-long conference when he made a speech that included strong criticism of the EETPU. He accused the electricians of trying to build an alternative to the TUC and basing it on 'every tiny scab union they could lay their hands on'. The electricians would be welcomed back only if the issues that 'have made them such pariahs are resolved to the satisfaction of the members of the club they seek to join'. The NUJ's motion would have imposed tough conditions on the talks, requiring the EETPU to give up members it has recruited from other unions. The debate was watched from the visitors' gallery by Mr Paul Gallagher, EETPU general secretary. Afterwards he said he was not surprised at the strength of feeling shown in the debate. But in areas where it matters 'people have forgiven and forgotten'. He said the EETPU would obey TUC rules if it rejoined.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: Sony struggles with the rewind button - The deterioration in the electronics company's balance sheet Sony, the Japanese electronics company, is having trouble winning friends in the investment community these days. The company enjoys one of Japan's most famous brand names. And it probably deserves its reputation as one of Japan's most innovative companies. Yet Sony is having trouble turning all of this into profits, and suspicions are growing that Sony may have been simply too ambitious for its own good in recent years. Yesterday's dismal third-quarter results, with a 35.9 per cent decline in pre-tax profits - excluding extraordinary items - along with official projections that the parent company would lose Y20bn (Dollars 156.25m) at the operating level in the year to end-March, have driven this message home with startling clarity. 'The company really does look overstretched,' said Mr Barry Dargan, electronics analyst at James Capel. Mr Dargan calculated that Sony has Y1,000bn in net debt, and that if goodwill was taken out of the balance sheet, its ratio of debt to shareholders funds was 150 per cent. 'Clearly they need equity financing,' he concluded. The ultimate cause of the deterioration in Sony's balance sheet was the purchase in recent years of CBS Records and Columbia Pictures Entertainment, the film studio, for more than Dollars 5bn. Sony is now having to manage the debt it accumulated to make those acquisitions, while it copes with a recession in the US and a decline in the Japanese market that have stunted sales, fired competition and whittled away margins. Profits it has been able to generate overseas have been further pared back by the strength of the yen. On top of this, Sony, in common with all the electronics companies, is having to cope with a lack of new, hit products of the sort that have kept the electronics industry bubbling along almost non-stop since the 1950s, when Sony started with pocket-size transistor radios. 'The consumer electronics industry is dead in the water,' said Mr John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer, during a visit to Tokyo yesterday. Mr Sculley was commenting on why consumer electronics companies such as Sony were seeking partners in the computer industry in an effort to generate new types of products. Traditional products, he argued, had little growth left in them. In many ways, Sony's troubles are the result of its aggressive efforts to keep the company growing in an environment that has become progressively more difficult, and it may yet succeed with a surprise hit product. Sony began a broad restructuring in 1986 when the rise of the yen following the Plaza Accord provided a strong incentive to move operations overseas. As a result, the balance of Sony's operating profits have gone increasingly toward its subsidiaries, and away from the parent company. While this makes good business sense, and makes the group stronger, Japanese investors tend to focus mainly on the results of the parent company, which must pay the dividend. The income-generating ability of the parent has to some extent even been eroded by the expansion of the group, since the parent shoulders a good chunk of research and development costs for the whole. Thus the expected plunge into the red by the parent this year, following Y72bn of profits last year, may overstate the difficulties of the group, even though Sony's projection of a 45 per cent decline in consolidated operating profits to Y165bn is hardly good news. The other important move to restructure the company was the expensive diversification into the recorded music and film industry. This was based on a recognition that reliance on electronic hardware alone may be insufficient to secure a good future for the company. While analysts have criticised the acquisitions as being too expensive and ill-advised, Sony can at least be credited with helping to foster a turnround at Columbia Pictures, renamed Sony Pictures Entertainment. The motion picture group finished 1991 with 20 per cent of US box office receipts. Sony film revenues in the three months to December were up by 65.4 per cent to Y112.6bn compared with a year ago. Film profits - excluding interest taxes, depreciation, and amortisation - rose by two and a half times from the first to the third quarter of the fiscal year to Y47bn. Sony's operating profits from its entertainment business, at Y32.7bn, were only 30 per cent less than profits from electronic hardware. Sony is no longer just an electronics company. There are also bright spots in the results. Sales in the US rose by 16.4 per cent, while sales in Europe rose by 13.7 per cent even when translated back to yen. In Germany local currency sales were up by 34 per cent. Similarly, worldwide sales of 8mm camcorders for the fiscal year are projected to rise from 3.8m to 4.1m units, colour televisions from 6.1m to 7m units, compact disc players from 9.5m to 13m units, and even video tape recorders from 3m to 3.5m units. While this may appear positive, none the less, Sony is not managing to make much of a profit on the sales. And the most severe difficulty the company faces is at home, where sales declined by half a per cent during the quarter and are expected to be off much more severely in the current quarter. Sony is counting on new product launches, including its Minidisc recordable CD player, to stimulate growth. But at the same time Sony is pulling in its horns. The company will slash capital spending by 36 per cent to Y280bn in the next fiscal year, and as the burden of depreciation costs begins to recede, the financial results should at least look healthier. Whether Sony can re-ignite the sales growth of years past and keep profits on the rise too is another question.</p>

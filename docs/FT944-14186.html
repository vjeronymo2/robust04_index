			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Jury clears Walker of Pounds 19m fraud: Collapse of case seen as further blow to credibility of Serious Fraud Office Mr George Walker, the one-time professional boxer turned leisure entrepreneur, was cleared yesterday of orchestrating a Pounds 19m fraud at Brent Walker, his former company, after a trial costing Pounds 5m and lasting four and a half months. 'The case ruined three years of my life,' he said, expressing his relief at the verdicts after leaving the courtroom in an annexe of the Old Bailey in London's Chancery Lane. 'It is amazing,' he added. 'This is all too quick for me to feel happy. I don't feel like celebrating because of the tension which has been too much - more for my family than for me.' Mr Walker, who had been accused of masterminding the fraudulent boosting of Brent Walker profits by Pounds 19m during the 1980s, was cleared of all charges of theft, conspiracy and false accounting brought against him by the Serious Fraud Office. The jury returned its verdicts after deliberating for seven days. It cleared Mr Walker of three charges alleging the theft of Pounds 17m from Brent Walker, the property and leisure group; one of conspiring to falsify the company's accounts; and two of false accounting. Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director, was convicted by a 10-1 majority on one charge of false accounting relating to a Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.5m) payment by Brent Walker to an offshore company, but cleared of four other charges of theft involving Pounds 9.5m and conspiracy to falsify accounts. Mr Aquilina was released on bail and will be sentenced at Southwark Crown Court on November 10. His lawyers are considering an appeal against his conviction. The case was widely seen in both City and legal circles as a further blow to the credibility of the SFO, the future of which looks uncertain. Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, is considering proposals to place the SFO under the control of the Crown Prosecution Service, as recommended by an official government review. With his decision expected within two months, the high-profile failure to secure the conviction of Mr Walker has come at a highly sensitive time for the SFO. Of the charges brought against him, Mr Walker said: 'It was just a story backed up by 'ifs'.' He said that a lot of the time in court it was 'impossible to know what the SFO was on about'. Mr Walker said he was contemplating rebuilding his business career in the leisure industry. 'I do think I have something to give,' he said, adding that he had already been contacted with business propositions. Mr Walker was made bankrupt in 1993 after being dismissed from Brent Walker. He was particularly vitriolic about the role of the company's bank creditors in dismissing him, having him declared bankrupt and encouraging the SFO to prosecute. 'It was the banks who wanted me bankrupt,' he said. WALKER ACQUITTAL Page 12 Heavy blow for Serious Fraud Office Debt-laden group with questions to answer Bloodied but unbowed</p>

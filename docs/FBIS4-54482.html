			<p>BFN     [Text] After a two-day break, the radio bridge with  Gorazde and Esad Ohranovic, chairman of the Executive Council of  the Gorazde Region, and Dr. Alija Begovic, (?director) of the  Gorazde hospital, has been established again. Here is a report  by Senada Cumurovic:    [Begin recording] [Cumurovic] At the beginning of the radio  link Sead Ohranovic said that it is mostly calm in Gorazde today  although there are some chetnik provocations. A fighter of the  Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina was killed by a sniper bullet.    [Ohranovic] Well, the chetniks have not withdrawn [words  indistinct] 3 km and, in a way, we in Gorazde are not satisfied.  There is now the problem, and an acute problem at that, of  (?water), food, all that comes in the wake of the situation in  which we find ourselves, and particularly the accommodation  problem.    [Cumurovic] This is how Ohranovic commented on the recent  statement by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] spokesman Eric  Chaperon that our forces fired on UNPROFOR.    [Ohranovic] These reports are in no way correct. The  chetniks have recently been using some ammunition, that is,  explosive ammunition that has [words indistinct] to shoot behind  one's back. Therefore, this is not true, and our forces are  still positioned along the lines on which they were [words  indistinct] the UN forces. It is exclusively members of the  chetnik forces who are carrying out provocations in this area.    [Cumurovic] As regards weapons, even after the ultimatum  expired, the chetniks did not withdraw their artillery from the  20-km zone. As Ohranovic put it, there is confirmation that  there is still some aggressor heavy artillery at Jabucko Sedlo,  (Miljan), Mount Kozara, at the foot of Mount Kozara, and on the  roads leading from (?Foca) and Pale. As regards the  humanitarian situation, the food supplies are somewhat improved.    [Ohranovic] However, the greatest problems that the citizens  of Gorazde are now facing are is the accommodation of the  population that has been streaming from the occupied regions  into the town and the problem of water. We are seeking the best  solutions here and are insisting that the international  organizations help solve the problem. The International Red  Cross has tried to do something and has brought some equipment  to supply at least the hospital with drinking water, that is,  water for cleaning. However, the problem of the entire town has  still not been solved. We are working together with the  international organizations to solve the problem, but this is  nevertheless going slowly. Gorazde's people are having a real  problem with water and are using the murky waters of the River  Drina.    [Cumurovic] Thanks to the packages of the International  Committee of the Red Cross and Medecins Sans Frontieres, the  supplies of Gorazde and its hospitals with medicines have been  improved, Dr. Alija Begovic said. However, he indicated a major  health problem.    [Begovic] It seems that we are facing an epidemic of  infectious hepatitis. We already have several cases of it in  different parts of the town. In such unhygienic conditions,  this will be fatal if something is not done urgently.    [Cumurovic] In three days, 265 wounded people have been  evacuated from Gorazde but the need for further evacuation is  still great. At this moment, UNPROFOR teams are visiting  villages in the commune in order to transport people to Gorazde  and then further on. Besides, in the town itself, 400 to 500  wounded people are awaiting evacuation, Dr. Begovic said.    Journalists have wanted to know about the situation in the  villages of (Zupcici) and [name indistinct] where the aggressor  has brought in Serbian people. This is what Ohranovic had to  say about this:    [Ohranovic] Yes, Serbian people have been settled in these  villages that you mentioned. They are now living there under  the excuse that these are their flats and their houses. [words  indistinct] UNPROFOR to solve this problem but they have not  helped us.    [Cumurovic] Apart from the civilians, so-called Serbian  police have been deployed in (Zupcici) and [name indistinct].  In fact, what is involved are aggressor's soldiers who had been  destroying Gorazde and who have now just changed uniforms.    At the end of the radio bridge, Ohranovic said that the  security situation in Gorazde has nevertheless been stabilizing.  A curfew between 2100 to 0400 has been introduced and life is  returning to normal. [end recording]</p>

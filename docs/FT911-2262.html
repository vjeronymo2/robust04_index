			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Water companies in rationalisation pact APPROVAL HAS been given for three water supply companies in south-east England to rationalise their day-to-day operations under a single management team. Eastbourne Water, Mid Sussex Water and West Kent Water are to retain their separate identities and continue to supply water to 650,000 customers under their existing company names, but there should be significant cost benefits. This year's average K figure - the amount above the rate of inflation the companies are allowed to increase their charges - will be about 2.7 per cent lower. Mr Ian Byatt, director general of water services, the industry's economic regulator, has agreed that a single licence will be issued to a new holding company, South East Water, to cover all three companies. Water company mergers are not welcomed by the regulator because of the need to make cost and efficiency comparisons with as many operators as possible. However, the new arrangements do not involve a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission as the three companies are already controlled by Saur Water Services, which acquired its controlling interest before January 11 1989 when merger references were made compulsory. Mr Byatt said yesterday: 'I would argue strongly against any reduction in the number of independent water companies if it affects my ability to make comparisons of their efficiency . . . but there is a strong argument in favour of grouping the three companies under a single management team. It will mean customers will stand to benefit from lower charges.'</p>

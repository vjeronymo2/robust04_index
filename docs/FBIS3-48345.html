Mun Ik-hwan,  a pro-reunification patriot of South Korea, on his death from a  sudden illness.    President Kim Il-song in the message said the death of the  reputed pro-reunification patriot who devotedly struggled for  the independence and democratisation of South Korean society and  for a peaceful reunification of the country was a big loss to  our nation.    Though he passed away to our sorrow, not seeing the day of  national reunification which he aspired after in his lifetime,  the feats performed by him on the patriotic road of  reunification will always remain in the hearts of the  compatriots at home and abroad, said President Kim Il-song.</p>

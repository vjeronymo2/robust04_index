			<p>BFN     [Text] Ho Chi Minh, May 22 (YONHAP) -- The former Korean  Community Center in Ho Chi Minh is expected to be returned to  South Korea next month, an official at the Korean Embassy in  Vietnam said Sunday. The consulate general in Ho Chi Minh has  been demanding quick return of the property and the city has  recently notified that it will hand over the building within the  first half of the year, the official said.    The government reportedly plans to use the site as cultural  center and school for Koreans in Vietnam. An estimated 800  Koreans, including diplamats and expatriates, live here and  education problem for their children may be resolved to some  extent if the center is turned into a school, the official said.  The 162-pyong [one pyong is six square feet] two-storey building  had been used as a school and Taekwondo gym until 1975 when  Korean troops withdrew from Saigon after if fell to communism  and broke diplomatic ties. Seoul and Hanoi restored full  relations in December 1992.    Koreans here have to send their children to expensive  international schools in Malaysia, Taiwan or Singapore because  there are no Korean schools in Vietnam.</p>

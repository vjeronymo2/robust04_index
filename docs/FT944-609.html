			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Books: Political grief and poetic fire - Arkady Ostrovsky on two women whose memories survived the Gulag THIS I CANNOT FORGET by Anna Larina Hutchinson Pounds 25, 384 pages THE AKHMATOVA JOURNALS 1938-1941 ed. by Lydia Chukovskaya Collins Pounds 20, 320 pages For Russians, to mention one of the years 1937, 1938, 1939 is to evoke pictures of arrests, tortures, and death. Anna Larina's memoirs and Lydia Chukovskaya's journals are accounts of two who survived. At the centre of Anna Larina's memoirs is the politician Nikolai Bukharin, a leader of the Bolshevik party. The focus of Chukovskaya's journals is one of the most brilliant Russian poets of the 20th century - Anna Akhmatova. But these books are also the sagas of two women, Anna Larina and Lydia Chukovskaya, who lived in the presence of great people and who devoted their memories to them. Born in 1914 and adopted by Yuri Larin, an old Bolshevik and Lenin's close ally, Anna Larina grew up in the luxurious rooms of the Metropol Hotel, the residence of the party elite. It was here that, at the age of 11, she wrote her first love-letter to Nikolai Bukharin, then 41 and 'favourite of the entire party'. Too embarrassed to deliver it herself, she gave it to a stranger. This 'stranger' was Stalin. Nine years later Anna Larina married Nikolai Bukharin. Three years after that, in 1937, Bukharin was arrested, tortured and destroyed both mentally and physically. His 23-year-old wife was also arrested and sent to the Gulag, where she spent almost 20 years. The first few chapters of Larina's book show us camps, humiliating interrogations and KGB cells. But her account reveals that Stalin had decided to destroy Bukharin, one of his strongest opponents, back in 1928. Only in 1937 had Stalin gained enough power to implement his plan. By this stage, simply to kill Bukharin was not enough: Stalin needed a show trial. The most powerful part of Larina's book describes the last months of Bukharin's life in the Kremlin before his arrest. The slow and sadistic demolition of the human will, the detailed description of the 'theatricality' of Stalin's methods of moral destruction, are more disturbing than any of the Gulag scenes. The book reads as though Larina is still defending Bukharin in the interrogator's office. The western reader may 'regret Larina's loyalty to the Bolshevik's Revolution of her childhood', writes Stephen Cohen in his introduction. Yet the book is strikingly honest; it was written by one of the generation of devoted idealists, and it takes us into the very depth of a revolutionist's mentality. In 1986 Bukharin was rehabilitated and Anna Larina was able to deliver his letter, 'To A Future Generation of Party Leaders'. Yet his vindication did not last long. As one of the initiators of the New Economic Policy in the 1930s, Bukharin is now blamed as a communist and one of the discredited founders of the Socialist system in Russia. While the court drama unfolded in the corridors of the Kremlin, in a small flat in Leningrad Akhmatova was composing some of her most powerful poems. Akhmatova and Lydia Chukovskaya, daughter of a famous Russian children's poet, were brought together by the arrests of the poet's son and Chukovskaya's husband. Since she was aware that her diary could be confiscated at any time, most of the entries are concerned with conversations on literary matters and the arrests are not mentioned. Russians of this generation had to have good memories because everything that it was unwise to write down had to be mentally recorded. Anna Larina had memorised Bukharin's last political testament. Chukovskaya, who had a photographic memory, recorded by heart many of Akhmatova's poems. Akhmatova would write parts of her Requiem down on scraps of paper, and give them to Chukovskaya to memorise. Afterwards they would be burnt. Many of these poems are printed at the end of the book. Akhmatova had been educated in the same prestigious lyceum as Pushkin, had married a man who was both an officer of the White army and a brilliant poet, and was a member of the most elite literary circles in Russia. Then, during the 1930s, she was locked into a small room in a communal flat in Leningrad, and denied all opportunities to write and publish. 'Her face is grey, drawn, her feet are swollen. She does not leave the house' recorded Chukovskaya in 1939; a sorry comparison with the portrait painted of Akhmatova by Modigliani in Paris in 1910. Chukovskaya's accounts do not contain horror stories about camps and prisons, but record the doomed, paranoid atmosphere of Akhmatova's life in Leningrad. Perhaps the poet's real name, 'Gorenko', contained a prophesy about her tragic life: in Russian, the name contains the roots of two words  -fire and grief.</p>

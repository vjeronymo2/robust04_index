			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Nigeria cancels land deals Nigeria's military regime has cancelled last year's allocations of land to top members of the government, in an effort to prove it is dealing with corruption at all levels of officialdom. Gen Sani Abacha, head of state, and his number two, Lt-Gen Oladipo Diya, were among 130 prominent Nigerians including cabinet ministers and top military officers allocated plots of prime land for less than one-tenth of their market value by former president Gen Ibrahim Babangida after he annulled last June's presidential elections. When the private property developers who claim to own the land took legal action, the government tried to justify the move last September by producing a backdated decree which, in turn, threatened all land tenure on Nigeria's coastal land. The trial was due to come before the high court on April 26. 'It is not clear who will repay the money for the plots or whether they are withdrawing from next month's court case,' a spokesman for the developer said yesterday. The land scandal has damaged the claim by Gen Abacha, who seized power in November, to root out the corruption of the Babangida regime. Information minister Jerry Gana intends next month to launch a 'war against indiscipline and corruption'. The government plans to investigate the oil and other state industries, the central bank, the judiciary and the police, but not the armed forces.</p>

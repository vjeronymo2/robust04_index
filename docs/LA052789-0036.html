			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAN SPEAKER HAS AYATOLLAH'S TRUST;  </P> <P> RAFSANJANI READY TO TAKE MANTLE FROM KHOMEINI  </P> <P> A decade ago, when the brooding Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini swept triumphantly  into Iran on the heels of the departed Shah, his coterie included a  hard-working cleric in a white turban, Hashemi Rafsanjani.  </P> <P> It was a tumultuous time. From the ashes of monarchy the ayatollahs, supreme  religious leaders among the Shiite Muslims, set about building an Islamic state  under Khomeini's guidance, not without dispute or violence. Amid the struggle,  Rafsanjani, then as now bearing the lower clerical rank of hojatoleslam, was  never far from the sleeve of Khomeini, his former teacher.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Uncertain Times  </P> <P> Iran is once again in difficult straits, its economy ruined by the eight-year  war with Iraq that ended with a forced truce last July. Its pugnacious  government remains largely isolated by its Muslim neighbors and the West. And  the aging Khomeini, while still calling the important shots, has been making  provisions for the succession of power.  </P> <P> An announcement that the 89-year-old ayatollah underwent surgery Tuesday for  bleeding in his digestive tract underlined the uncertainty of the times.  </P> <P> The 54-year-old Rafsanjani, in his third term as Speaker of the Iranian  Parliament, acting commander of the armed forces and the only declared  candidate for the August presidential election, is widely regarded as the man  to watch.  </P> <P> "He has the trust of Khomeini," said Shaul Bakhash, a former Tehran journalist  now with the Wilson Center in Washington, underscoring Rafsanjani's most  formidable political attribute.  </P> <P> In addition, Bakhash observed in a telephone interview: "He has ability. He's  managed Parliament very well. He adjusts."  </P> <P> However labeled -- liberals and conservatives or pragmatists and radicals --  Iran's politicians seem to be performing in a house of mirrors. Rafsanjani has  been put down as a pragmatist, a man who has spoken of the need to open up to  the West in order to bolster his country's attempts at postwar economic  recovery.  </P> <P> But on May 5 he appalled and outraged Western governments by calling on  Palestinians to kill Americans, Britons and Frenchmen to avenge Palestinian  dead in the uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza  Strip. A few days later, he said his remarks had been misinterpreted and that  he "did not mean to condone the killing of innocent civilians."  </P> <P> Despite the shock waves, many analysts put Rafsanjani's inflammatory words down  to domestic political maneuvering. No Iranian leader is openly campaigning to  succeed Khomeini, but nearly all follow his fundamental line on issues about  which the old man feels strongly. Before Rafsanjani's clarification, the  Iranian newspaper Islamic Republic said his remarks were "well within the  framework of the imam's (Khomeini's) firm stance that Israel must be  eliminated."  </P> <P> Last February, Khomeini set the tone for political debate and what he  apparently saw as wavering on the spiritual underpinning of the Islamic state  by seizing on Salman Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses," which he labeled  blasphemous. He demanded the execution of the Indian-born British author as an  apostate.  </P> <P> A month later, Khomeini moved more directly into the political arena by  withdrawing the mantle from the Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, his designated  successor as Iran's supreme leader. He instructed Montazeri, who had been  critical of the current wave of arrests and executions in Iran, to "clean his  house" of liberal influences.  </P> <P> "There has been a real shift in what Khomeini is willing to tolerate," Iran  analyst Bakhash noted. He said the old man was disappointed in the Western  countries' tilt toward Iraq at the end of the war, when Rafsanjani and others  expected more support for what they considered Iran's just cause.  </P> <P> The Montazeri episode left Iran's future power structure uncertain. The  remaining senior ayatollahs, those with sufficient prestige to ascend to  Khomeini's singular position, are too old or "their qualifications are not  quite right," Bakhash said. A possible option, he said, would be the  establishment of a council of Islamic leaders to take over the spiritual reins  of the state. The present constitution provides for such a council, of either  three or five members.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Political Maneuvering  </P> <P> On the political side of the power structure, meanwhile, Rafsanjani has  reportedly sought a constitutional amendment to abolish the post of prime  minister, currently held by Hussein Moussavi, his longtime rival in Parliament.  Instead, a more powerful president -- the post Rafsanjani is seeking -- would  administer government through a group of presidential deputies.  </P> <P> If Rafsanjani is now the second-strongest leader in Iran, he would emerge -- as  president with centralized powers, and with Khomeini succeeded by a council of  clerics -- as the country's foremost political personality.  </P> <P> His candidacy has already received the blessing of the incumbent president, Ali  Khamenei, who is barred by the constitution from seeking a third term. But  Rafsanjani's bid for extraordinary power is not expected to go unchallenged.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Moussavi and others opposed to his pragmatic tendencies will  oppose him issue by issue. But neither Moussavi nor Interior Minister Ali Akbar  Mohtashemi -- nor any other political strongman -- has made a move to seek the  presidency.  </P> <P> Another possibility could be the succession of the ailing Khomeini's son Ahmad,  43, the reclusive ayatollah's closest confidant, his ears and voice outside the  family home. But the old man has imposed a legalistic formula for succession  and a dynastic appointment would run against the procedures he is setting in  place. Nevertheless, Ahmad has become a power in his own right and in the  confusion that will follow the ayatollah's death he will have a circle of  influential followers.  </P> <P> Rafsanjani's power base would be difficult to challenge. He controls a large  bloc of votes in Parliament. Over the years in government, he has managed to  place important allies in important positions (a brother runs the broadcast  media). He commands the military and the Revolutionary Guards, but his support  there may be less certain.  </P> <P> But in any political or ideological difficulty, Rafsanjani's well-demonstrated  agility will serve him, as it did when he survived the implications of his  direct role in the Iran-Contra affair.  </P> <P> Besides the shape of a future government and ideological questions, political  tensions revolve largely around the national economy, which is a mess. The  government concedes a 23% annual inflation rate on basic items, while outside  analysts say it is many times higher. The price of potatoes, cigarettes and  cooking oil has gone up sharply, and subsidized rations for the poor have dried  up. Lines for subsidized commodities begin forming before sunrise. The salaries  of government workers have been frozen for a decade.  </P> <P> So-called radicals are pushing explosive issues like land reform and  nationalization of foreign trade. Rafsanjani, who has the support of the  bazaari, the merchant class, might be more inclined to go slow on economic  reforms, although he supports change.  </P> <P> At the podium, in command of Parliament, Rafsanjani has a reputation for  polished control, a conductor with a well-trained orchestra. He likes a joke,  it is said, and smiles readily, although perhaps not at the nickname his  critics have given him -- "the beardless one." Among a host of Shiite clerics  with bushy whiskers, Rafsanjani wears only a thin mustache.  </P> <P> Born in the southeastern province of Kerman, Rafsanjani went to the shrine city  of Qom at age 16 to study religion. By the late 1950s, he was a student in  Khomeini's class in Islamic jurisprudence and had developed a flair for  preaching.  </P> <P> In the struggle against the rule of the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, he was  jailed a number of times and drafted into the army. "He used to go around  converting fellow conscripts, most of them from peasant families like himself,  to the Islamic thought and revolutionary teaching of Khomeini," a contemporary  told a European reporter last year.  </P> <P> Alarmed, the army sent him back to Qom. There he set up a property firm -- he  is a rich man today -- which tithed its proceeds to Khomeini's movement. When  Khomeini went into exile in Iraq and later Paris, Rafsanjani followed.  </P> <P> He remains a loyal acolyte, and still owes his powerful position to the  ayatollah. But as the Montazeri dismissal proves, the ayatollah can change his  mind. Ahmad, a gatekeeper for his father, has given Rafsanjani unusual access.  But Ahmad too has accumulated political power, and other politicians are  knocking at his door.  </P></p>

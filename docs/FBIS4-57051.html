			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raul Gutierrez from the "24 Hours Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The Colombian Government decided to lift the state  of internal disturbance decreed on 1 May. However, in order to  prevent the release of an overwhelming number of inmates, the  government also decided to extend the judicial emergency decree.  The decree, which was signed by the president and all his  cabinet ministers, stipulates that the emergency will be  extended for an additional 90 days.    The government justifies the measure by indicating that the  Prosecutor General's Office and the courts will now have  sufficient time and resources to complete investigations still  under way as well as to render a decision.    As of today, all circuit judges will be allowed to become  involved in cases which up until now were restricted only to  special judges. Ten days ago, 42 regional judges were  responsible for handling 4,500 cases dealing with drug  trafficking, terrorism, and kidnapping. This backlog prevented  them from completing the cases within the period stipulated by  law, the reason for which the judicial emergency was declared.</p>

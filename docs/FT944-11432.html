			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / 'Deadlock' over WTO chief The contest to head the future World Trade Organisation appears to be deadlocked, Mr Kim Chul-su, the South Korean candidate, said yesterday. In Geneva to lobby Gatt ambassadors for his cause, Mr Kim said he did not know how the deadlock would be broken but 'I am in this race to the finish'. With only a month to go before a formal decision is due to be taken by the 124 members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, support for the three contenders is split along regional lines. Japan and most of Asia are backing Mr Kim, South Korea's trade and industry minister, while the US and Latin America are firmly behind Mr Carlos Salinas de Gortari, outgoing Mexican president. European support has gone to Mr Renato Ruggiero, a former Italian trade minister. Soundings last month among 80 or so countries showed Mr Kim in third place, slightly behind Mr Salinas, who was trailing Mr Ruggiero. All three candidates are now jostling for support from 'non-aligned' regions such as Africa and for 'second-preference' votes in the hope of improving their chances as the consensus candidate.</p>

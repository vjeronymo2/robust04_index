			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Lloyd's - a callous act Sir, Members of the Names Defence Association are like other embattled and worried Lloyd's Names. They are honourable people who will meet their legal and contractual obligations and who will pay their legal debts to the limit of their abilities. Material breaches of contracts can and have been made by persons at Lloyd's other than Names. Before Lloyd's can expect to collect its debts, it will have to prove them in court. There is considerable reason now to believe that it will be unable to do so. Calling in debt collectors will accomplish nothing ('Lloyd's set to hire debt collectors to chase Names', August 5). It is a callous and shameless act to terrify thousands of scared and innocent victims. It is a personally demeaning gesture by Mr David Rowland, the chairman of Lloyd's, and it will rebound to the detriment of that once great institution. J Finlay, chairman, Names Defence Association, Great Missenden, Bucks</p>

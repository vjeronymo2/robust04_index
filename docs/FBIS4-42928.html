			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Guest commentary by Pekka Tiainen, special investigator in </F> Labor Ministry statistics unit: "Our Debt Burden Will Grow in  EU"]    [Text] Pekka Tiainen estimates that Finland will be paying  the European Union [EU] over 3 billion markkas more than it  receives from it but, as a result of membership in the EU, there  will be a total deficit of 55 billion markkas for the public  sector to cover between 1995 and 2000.    Membership in the European Union will be considerably more  costly for Finland than those responsible for the negotiations  have so far publicly stated it will be. An error produced by  counting subsidies for disadvantaged areas twice was discovered  later. Therefore, Finland will be making net payments to the EU  right from the start. However, the net cost to Finland is also  estimated at too low a figure in a report, "The Impact of the  EU, a Summary," published on 29 March 1994. Neither the funds to  be paid to the EU Development and Cohesion Fund nor the 6.1  billion markkas for funding to be granted to the European  Investment Bank (EIB) and loan commitments are included in the  summary figures. They too must be counted as expenses since none  of the funding representing solutions to problems is for  Finland; quite the contrary, the EU will try to use these funds  to finance its East European ventures. The permanent EU farm  subsidies (CAP [Common Agricultural Policy] subsidies) will  presumably still remain the same, even though they are tied to  production, which is decreasing.    When we make these adjustments and use estimates of economic  growth and inflation rates that correspond to the basic tenor of  the Finance Ministry's latest "Economic Policy Line" report, we  get a Finnish payment to the EU for the years 1995-2000  averaging 9.5 billion markkas a year and funding for Finland  from the EU amounting to about 6 billion markkas a year. Over  these years Finland will pay the EU a total of 57 billion  markkas and receive 36 billion markkas from it; that is, it will  be paying it over 20 billion markkas more than it receives from  it.    Conservatively estimated, a fifth of our domestic demand for  food products will be covered by additional imports worth about  20 billion markkas between 1995 and 2000. Our net payments to  the EU and the additional imports will burden our trade balance  with a total of 40 billion markkas. If EU participation in the  marketing of Finland's agricultural surplus at first compensates  for this to the tune of a billion a year and EEA [European  Economic Area] expenditures are reduced, we will still be in the  hole to the extent of over 30 billion markkas. In addition to  that there will be the expenditures for interest.    From the standpoint of the Finnish public sector deficit,  the  situation looks even much worse. We will be contributing 9.5  billion markkas a year to the EU budget, 300 million markkas of  which we will be spared because of the elimination of EEA  expenses. In addition to this, 6.3 billion markkas a year will  be expended for national limiting conditions stemming directly  from the EU agreement and for northern subsidies.    We will lose nearly 13 billion markkas a year in excise  taxes  and taxes and duties on farm products. During the first year we  will also suffer 2.5 billion markkas in grain storage losses. If  the domestic demand for farm products declines by a fifth and  structural changes result in about 1 percentage point more  unemployment elsewhere, that will cost us 4 billion markkas a  year in expenditures for unemployment and in loss of tax  revenue. This will result in a gross sum of 32 billion markkas  to be covered.    Current farm subsidies will be reduced by the gross sum of 7  billion markkas a year. After deducting this, there will still  be 25 billion markkas a year to be covered. If reductions in  excise taxes are covered with new taxes, we will be able to save  an average 11 billion markkas a year. By cutting current funds  for employment as well as regional and construction subsidies by  an amount equivalent to what comes in from EU funding or  national subsidies stemming directly from the EU agreement, we  will be able to save 4 billion markkas. Funds from these sources  amount to 23 billion markkas a year.    But over 10 billion markkas a year on average will still not  be compensated for. The public sector will be left with a total  deficit of 55 billion markkas to cover between 1995 and 2000 as  a result of EU membership.</p>

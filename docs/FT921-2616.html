			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Isosceles There was a touch of desperation about yesterday's announcement from Isosceles that its Herman's and Wellworth chains are up for sale. The group has long wanted to reduce its debt, although there is no formal requirement to do so until next year. Perhaps its bankers are nervous. Selling Wellworth, perhaps by a trade sale or management buy-out rather than the suggested flotation, might bring in Pounds 150m. That looks mean given that Northern Ireland's leading food and mixed retailer made Pounds 17.7m pre-tax profit last year, but buyers have to consider the unique location. As for Herman's, it looks increasingly as if Isosceles was wrong not to go for an immediate fire-sale in 1989. While the sporting goods chain has been improved and is apparently now profitable at the operating level, the market for US retailing assets has crashed. Herman's book value was Pounds 194m at the end of Isosceles' last financial year, but whether it will fetch that is an open question. In theory, paring its operations down to mainland UK food retailing ought to enhance the attractions of a flotation. The problem is that there is no end in sight to Gateway's suffering in the high street, and the Food Giant and Somerfield shops are far from established. Investors might indeed find Isosceles easier to understand. The danger is they will understand it all too well.</p>

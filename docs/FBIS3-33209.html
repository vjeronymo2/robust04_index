			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Quito, 18 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Ecuadoran President Sixto  Duran-Ballen and Argentine President Carlos Menem signed in  Quito today four cooperation agreements and one financial  protocol worth $45 million to build three roads in Ecuador.    The economic, trade, sanitation, and academic agreements  were  signed in the Carondelet Palace, seat of the Ecuadoran  Government, at the end of the Argentine president's official  visit to Ecuador.    Both presidents highlighted the excellent level of  diplomatic  relations between their countries during an act in which a  consortium of Argentine banks granted funds to build three roads  in the Amazon region.    The governments established an agreement for reciprocal  investment promotion and protection, which became effective  immediately. They also agreed on the mutual recognition of  academic grades, certificates, and titles.    In a political declaration, Duran-Ballen and Menem  highlighted increased bilateral links in all fields during the  first official visit of an Argentine president to Quito. Both  governments ratified their pledge to bolster and consolidate the  democratic system in Latin America, defend human rights, and  boost peace in the area.    Both presidents spoke in favor of dialogue and the peaceful  solution to territorial and political problems that involve  Latin American countries. They reiterated their support and  assistance to UN and OAS efforts to maintain world and regional  peace.    In a joint news conference, President Menem denied he  intends  to impose an economic model that "has been so successful for  Argentina," but expressed his willingness to cooperate with  other governments' modernization efforts. He also downplayed  the "circumstantial" social outbreak his government had to face  in Santiago del Estero, which he attributed to the "incapacity"  and bad administration of local authorities.    Menem and his retinue, about 30 people including officials,  legislators, and businessmen, were seen off by Ecuadoran  authorities at the Mariscal Sucre Air Force Base in Quito at  1530 (2030 GMT), bound to Cartagena, Colombia.    The Argentine president will rest during the weekend at this  beach resort, and on Monday he will begin his official visit to  Colombia.</p>

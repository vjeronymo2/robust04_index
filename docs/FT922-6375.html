			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / BBC to move up-market as Birt strategy wins approval MR JOHN BIRT, deputy director general of the BBC, has won agreement for his strategy to redefine the programme output of the corporation and take it up-market. The aim is to ensure the BBC provides something unique for its audience and does not compete head on with ITV and the growing number of satellite channels. The decision was taken at this week's conference of the BBC's governors and top management at Lucknam Park hotel near Bath which ended yesterday. The approval for the general overall strategy will have potentially radical implications for many parts of the corporation from light entertainment television to Radios 1 and 2. The governors have not decided to turn the BBC into an elitist broadcasting ghetto producing only worthy and serious programmes. All present programme types including comedy, popular drama and soap operas will continue. In comedy there will be greater emphasis on Victoria Wood, say, than Les Dawson. The future strategy of the BBC will be to justify the continuation of the licence fee by offering something to all sections of society while emphasising the corporation's distinctive public service role. The conference set the strategy but did not take specific decisions on whether Radio 5 is to survive. Detailed policy proposals will be drawn up between now and the autumn. At a dinner on Thursday evening, Mr David Mellor, national heritage secretary, said he planned to publish a green paper in September. The BBC intends to wait until it has been published and its contents absorbed before coming up with a detailed blueprint for its own future. The BBC's Royal Charter runs out at the end of 1996.

Development of the technology started in the previous fiscal  year, and so far, basic cutting tests using a 1 square meter  (sqm) concrete specimen were carried out and they confirmed good  cutting capability. During this fiscal year, additional  performance tests using a 2 sqm specimen will be carried out and  test manufacturing of a cutting system will begin.    The performance tests are scheduled to be advanced by using  increasingly larger specimens. The final technical goal is doing  a good job of cutting a 5 sqm concrete piece.      The blade of the wire saw is a wire made of pressed diamond  powder. It is rotated for cutting by a drive mechanism. It is  said to be useful for cutting thick concrete structural  material, for example, and is being used in the construction  industry.    In the cutting process, a hole is drilled in the material to  be cut and the wire is passed through it. Two cutting methods  are being considered; one in which the wire is connected to the  drive mechanism through a guide pulley, and cutting is done by  pulling the wire back, and the other is in which guide pulleys  are installed at both ends and cutting is done by pushing the  wire through the material.    Although there are limits to the wire's capability, in  principle, it can deal flexibly with the target object's  thickness as long as the wire length is extended and it has the  merit of little secondary waste material.    To apply this to nuclear energy related facilities, the  cutting system, in addition to the basic composition of wire saw  and drive mechanism, must be able to deal with radioactive  materials, so the external side of the cutting equipment has to  be shielded, there must be equipment to cool the wire during  cutting, and a device to collect cuttings must be provided.    The type of coolant used is related to the amount of  secondary waste generation, and is being studied as a major  problem. Water or gas are being studied as possible wire  coolants.    The plan is to continue to study such problems as well as  remoting technology, and build an optimum system.</p>

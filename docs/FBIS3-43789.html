The government decided late Friday at an emergency cabinet  meeting devoted to the devaluation issue to postpone until  further notice the proposed 20-to-35 percent reduction in  salaries of state officials, spokesman Gabriel Matsiona told  state radio.    The government also decided to suspend customs taxes on  salted and fresh sea fish, poultry and vegetable oil, the  spokesman added.    Matsiona also announced the creation of a "guarantee" fund  to  ensure importers of staple goods are able to buy fresh stocks,  adding that rents and prices of petrol, bread, sugar, and other  essentials were frozen until further notice.    The measures aim to counter inflation in the wake of  Tuesday's [11 January] devaluation of the CFA franc, the main  currency in francophone central and West Africa which has been  pegged to the French franc.</p>

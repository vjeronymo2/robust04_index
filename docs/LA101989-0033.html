			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL VIEW: THE GRAVE CASE OF THE MISSING BODY  </P> <P> It almost reads like an episode of "L.A. Law" -- a lawsuit over negligent  mishandling of a corpse.  </P> <P> In fact, the popular NBC television series did have an episode last season in  which a wife successfully sued a funeral home because her husband's corpse was  dismembered and shipped to various hospitals for research.  </P> <P> Now, a real-life California Court of Appeal has heard a similar case and  decided that close family members can sue for emotional distress when a funeral  home misplaces the corpse.  </P> <P> The factual allegations in the suit are not pleasant. Lupe Quesada died on  December 9, 1979. His body was taken to the Santa Clara County Recorder's  office for an autopsy and was then to have been transferred to a funeral home  for burial. Instead, another body was delivered to the mortuary.  </P> <P> The widow, sister and niece of the deceased insisted that the body was that of  a stranger. But despite their protests, the stranger's body was buried in  Quesada's grave. Five days later, the mix-up was confirmed, the stranger's body  was exhumed and the body of Quesada was put in its proper place.  </P> <P> The funeral home settled the suit filed by the wife for an undisclosed amount  but contended that it was not liable to the sister and niece.  </P> <P> One of the critical questions for the court was who had the right to sue. Or as  Justice J. Ardaiz put it in his majority opinion: "In that the body itself  suffers no legally recognizable damage by virtue of a defendant's claimed  negligence, the question becomes to whom is the duty owed to abstain from such  negligent behavior."  </P> <P> Whether a result is foreseeable is a key component in determining how far to  allow a tort recovery of this type. And the court concluded that those who have  custody of the remains of a deceased should know that surviving friends and  family will be emotionally vulnerable and may develop severe mental trauma if  they are shown another person's body instead of the proper one.  </P> <P> "Concerns about the loss or misplacement of the deceased's body, the failure to  provide religious or spiritual rites to the deceased and improper interment of  another would understandably preoccupy those close to the deceased," Ardaiz  wrote.  </P> <P> But there are public policy concerns besides the foreseeability of harm. The  court needed to set limits on who could sue and how extensive the emotional  distress might be to warrant recovery. The court was reluctant, for example, to  let anyone who attended the funeral file a lawsuit, especially in light of  recent California Supreme Court cases that have limited the expansion of  emotional distress-type claims.  </P> <P> In one recent significant case, the California Supreme Court limited emotional  distress claims to someone who is closely related to the victim, is present at  the scene of the injury-producing event and suffers distress beyond what would  be anticipated in a disinterested witness.  </P> <P> Using that analysis as a base, this appellate court ruled that only close  family members, usually (but not necessarily only) those residing in the same  household, or parents, siblings, children or grandparents, could sue for the  negligent handling of a corpse.  </P> <P> Assuming that the Supreme Court does not clarify this unusual case, the  existing ruling would seem to make it difficult for the niece to win her case,  but the sister has a better chance.  </P></p>

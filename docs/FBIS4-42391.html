			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, 1 June (MTI) -- Although the prospect of  Hungarian-German military-industry cooperation will sooner or  later be raised, concrete plans have not yet taken shape,  Hungarian Deputy State Secretary of Defense Sandor Turjan told  reporters in Bonn today.    Turjan mentioned electronics as a possible field of  cooperation, which would facilitate communication and the  adjustment of Hungarian military technology to NATO standards.    The deputy state secretary signed a new complementary  agreement on a list of German military equipment to be delivered  to Hungary by late September from the arsenal of the former East  German Army.    This year Germany will deliver 400 wagonloads of components,  worth 150 million German marks, to Hungary -- free of charge.  Germany handed over the same amount to Hungary last year.    In February of this year, Budapest and Bonn signed an  agreement on the delivery of German parts for Hungarian combat  helicopters.</p>

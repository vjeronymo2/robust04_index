According to SSE sources, the measures include listing a  batch of Shanghai enterprises, issuing their B-stocks on  overseas bourses, providing agency services and establishing a  system of B-stock terminal trading.    The SSE intends to enroll members from foreign securities  companies, which will enjoy the same treatment as domestic ones.  And a state bond market open to overseas investors is in the  making.    Several big-name conglomerates, including Germany's  Daimler-Benz Group, are holding discussions with the SSE,  seeking to be listed on the Shanghai equity market.    In addition, the SSE is to improve its dealing system and  communications network with hi-tech equipment.    Now it is negotiating with relevant companies on purchasing  a  special telecommunications satellite which may go into use in  this year's third quarter.    The SSE will also connect its computerized dealing terminal  with those in Hong Kong, the United States and Britain.    Experts hold that at the end of this year the SSE will meet  international requirements for worldwide competition.</p>

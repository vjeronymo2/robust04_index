			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Robert J. Saiget] </F>   [Text] Beijing, Feb. 10 KYODO -- China's environment is  seriously threatened and a system of law and enforcement is  urgently needed to prevent pollution and protect natural  resources, the chief of the country's environmental watchdog has  warned.    Qu Geping, chairman of the environmental protection  committee  of the National People's Congress (NPC), made the call in a  speech given at a closed meeting of an NPC conference on the  environment last December 15 and only recently made available.    Qu methodically laid out the serious problems of growing  pollution emissions and overexploitation of natural resources as  China's economy develops.    Air pollution is steadily increasing in China's 500 major  cities, as smoke and dust emissions have grown at an average  annual rate of 7.6 percent and sulfur dioxide emissions increase  by 3.5 percent, making several cities "invisible to satellites,"  Qu said.    Although industrial emissions may be controlled by 2000, he  said, sulfur dioxide emissions, the leading cause of acid rain,  will rise from 16 million tons per year now to up to 23 million  tons in 2000.    Such increases will come as China's annual coal consumption  grows from the present 1.2 billion tons to a projected 1.6  billion tons early next century when experts predict China will  be the largest single producer of both carbon dioxide, the  leading cause of global warming, and sulfur dioxide.    Qu said China presently produces 100 million tons of  wastewater a day, leaving several rivers "in a state of crisis."  By 2000 China will produce between 30-32 billion tons of  industrial wastewater annually and 17 billion tons of organic  wastewater, he said.    During the 1980s, acid rain was limited to the provinces of  Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou and Sichuan, but now has appeared in  Jiangxi, Fujian and Shandong, and if not controlled will greatly  harm the agricultural, livestock and fishing industries, he said.    Nearly six billion tons of solid wastes cover an area of  more  than 50,000 hectares around China and by 2000, industrial solid  wastes will grow from the present 180 million tons a year to 250  million tons annually, Qu said.    Qu also described an increasingly unbalanced ecological  situation which includes diminishing forest cover, soil erosion  due to excessive mining and road-building and an average loss of  some 2,100 square kilometers of arable land per year to  desertification.    Water sources are also diminishing faster than they can be  replaced as more than 300 of China's 500 large cities are short  of water, with more than 40 seriously lacking water, he said.    China's per capita arable land is two-fifths the size of the  world average and is shrinking due to mining, road construction  and economic development, as well as the hazards of increase  chemical use in fertilizers, he said.    As much as 10 million hectares of arable land are affected  by  pollution, which Qu said costs up to 12 billion kilograms of  grain in economic losses a year.    Uncontrolled mining, low rates of mineral recovery at  existing mines and low utilization ratios were quickly depleting  resource reserves that, using China's present day technology,  are readily exploitable.    The unusually frank speech, while stressing the  interrelation  between ecological imbalances and economic development, called  for the perfection of China's legislative system and  authoritative laws capable of enforcing environmental  legislation.</p>

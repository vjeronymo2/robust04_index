			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "How To Obtain Fund Loans; Regional </F> Offices To Serve You, Secretariat General Awaits You"]    [Text] Getting a job is every young person's dream; each  craftsman should own a productive workshop. Social Fund loans  are the hope to achieve this dream and security. In order to  spare young graduates and craftsmen the worry of searching out  ways to obtain these loans, we shall review both the terms for  obtaining loans and the documents required.    Before going to the Social Fund, one must first define the  specific type of project that you want to establish and have a  suitable place available in which to carry it out, either within  or outside the Cairo Governorate, where the fund's loans are to  be spent to purchase tools, equipment, and production  requirements. After that, you go to the Social Development  Fund's Secretariat General if you are a resident of the  governorates of Cairo, al-Jizah, al-Fayyum, al-Shariqiyah, or  Alexandria.    If you are from another governorate, you go to the nearest  Social Fund office subordinate to your governorate. There are 10  regional offices in Ismailia, which serve the youth of the  governorates of Ismailia, Port Said, Suez, and North and South  Sinai. There are also the Shibin al-Kum office, covering  al-Minufiyah Governorate; the Aswan office to serve the citizens  of Aswan, Halayib, and Shalatayn; the Qina office to cover the  Qina and Red Sea Governorates; the al-Mansurah office to serve  the youth of al-Daqahliyah, Damietta, and Kafr al-Shaykh; the  Asyut office, covering the Asyut and New Valley Governorates;  the al-Minya office, serving the young people of al-Minya and  Bani Suwayf; the Damanhur office, to meet the needs of the youth  of al-Buhayrah and Musa Matruh; and the Suhaj and Tanta offices,  serving the young people of the Western Governorate.    After going to the fund or a regional office, fill out the  form pertaining to the project and its economic feasibility. You  will find someone there to help you enter this data at no charge.    After evaluating the study to ascertain the project's  feasibility by means of the fund, and it is found to be  acceptable, you will get an official letter to one of the banks  that are under contract with the fund, according to the  project's location. This letter will obtain the loan, which  ranges in value from 35,000 to 50,000 pounds for one individual,  or 200,000 pounds if there are multiple partners in one project.    Interest on the loan is 9 percent on a new project and 12  percent for an existing one. The loans are disbursed through  banks, because the Social Fund does not deal with individuals,  but through responsible intermediate agencies, such as banks,  businessmen's associations, and national associations.    The loan's term is five years, of which one and a half to  two  years is a grace period, depending on the project.    In order to facilitate the task of searching for a small  project, the Social Fund has prepared examples of small projects  ready for implementation for those who are serious about work  and love craftsmanship.    Those who will benefit from the Social Fund's loans include  proprietors of small projects, graduates of practical institutes  and colleges, or graduates of theoretical institutes and  colleges after training, and proprietors of new projects who  have expertise, as well as workers who will be relocated as a  result of privatization under the economic reform policy that  the state is pursuing, and workers returning from abroad.    Required documentation includes commercial register, tax  card, and permit. In order to make it easier for young graduates  who have new projects, it was decided to issue temporary permits  when the loans are disbursed.</p>

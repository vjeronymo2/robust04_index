			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Lloyds could face Midland tax penalty IF LLOYDS Bank succeeds in buying Midland, the combined banks will be forced to pay Pounds 246m in tax which would not be paid if Midland is bought by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, it was claimed yesterday. The allegation was made by Hongkong Bank's merchant bank adviser, Schroders, in the escalating war for control of Midland. However, Lloyds last night issued a strong assurance that the matter had been considered and it does not believe it will incur this penalty, while other independent tax experts said the question of whether the tax would be paid was open to doubt. Hongkong Bank launched an offer for Midland last month, while Lloyds has proposed a rival bid at a higher value if certain conditions are met. Midland's most recent accounts show that the company has tax credits worth Pounds 207m against trading losses and Pounds 39m in advance corporation tax for the last financial year. These losses could be offset against future profits of nearly Pounds 740m under UK corporate tax rates. However, tax legislation states a 'major change in the nature or conduct of a trade' within three years of a change of ownership would lead to these tax benefits being disallowed. Schroders suggests that the public documents released on the proposed bid by Lloyds appeared to commit the bank to rapid and fundamental restructuring of Midland within three years. 'Lloyds' proposals represent a major change in trade,' it said. 'It would be very difficult to imagine even an optimistic broker thinking the tax losses would survive.' Schroders also stressed that Hongkong Bank's proposals would be unlikely to incur the same penalties as Lloyds, because it intended to maintain the bank virtually intact as a separate business. Lloyds is believed to have already consulted the Inland Revenue on the issue. A source involved in the discussions said: 'The markets are the same and the changes are pretty mundane. We have looked at this fully.' David Barchard writes: Midland Bank's shareholders were told yesterday by Sir Peter Walters, chairman, the bank's board believes a merger with Hongkong and Shanghai Bank is the right strategy for the bank's future, while a merger with Lloyds Bank would result in a combined group narrowly focused on UK banking and involving retrenchment rather than growth.

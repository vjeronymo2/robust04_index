			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Argentine move on freed drugs suspect Federal prosecutors in Argentina have demanded the arrest of a leading suspect in the country's largest ever drug seizure, following his release on bail at the end of December. The freeing of Mr John Arroyo Arias on Dollars 30,000 bail has again thrown a spotlight on the government's inept drug control policies and the inadequacies of Argentina's judiciary. Prosecutors have only now asked for Mr Arias to be detained again. A Colombian, he was arrested in July 1988 with eight other suspects accused of attempting to smuggle 585kg of cocaine from Bolivia. The drugs were to be sent on to Europe and the US. A further 1,124kg were seized in the US as part of the same operation. Mr Arias was released because he had spent more than five years in custody. Prosecutors only finished submitting evidence last year and now fear more suspects could be freed. International agencies say Argentina has grown in importance as a drug transshipment corridor and as a money laundering centre.</p>

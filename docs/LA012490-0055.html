			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ADELIZZI IS NAMED CEO AT HOMEFED  </P> <P> HomeFed Corp. President Robert F. Adelizzi has been named chief executive of  the savings-and-loan holding company, taking over day-to-day management from  Kim Fletcher, who will remain board chairman.  </P> <P> Adelizzi joined HomeFed, the parent of HomeFed Bank, in 1962, and has been its  president since 1981.  </P> <P> He is also a board director. Adelizzi, 54, is a graduate of Dartmouth College  and the University of San Diego School of Law.  </P> <P> In an interview, Fletcher said his primary reason for vacating the chief  executive's job at the $18-billion thrift is to give Adelizzi the opportunity  to "move up and assume more responsibility and be rewarded in title at the same  time."  </P> <P> "Bob has done an outstanding job as president and chief operating officer,"  Fletcher said. "We have worked together as a team for over 20 years, and it's  only right that he be given the recognition."  </P> <P> Fletcher, 62, said HomeFed has no mandatory retirement age and age was not a  factor in his decision to step down. He will remain on certain of HomeFed's  board committees and keep an office at the S&amp;L. Fletcher, a yachtsman, also  said he expects to devote more time to his work on the America's Cup organizing  committee.  </P> <P> Fletcher has been HomeFed chairman since 1979 and chief executive since 1969  and owns about 1.7% of outstanding HomeFed shares.  </P> <P> HomeFed has been strongly identified with the Fletcher family ever since  Charles K. Fletcher, Kim's father, founded Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan in  1934. The elder Fletcher retired as chairman in 1963 and died in 1986. The  S&amp;L changed to its name last year.  </P> <P> But Kim Fletcher said his family's involvement in HomeFed management will end  with him, as none of his children plans to make a career at the S&amp;L.  </P></p>

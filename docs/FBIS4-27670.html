			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 3 (YONHAP) -- China virtually expressed  its opposition to UN sanctions against North Korea despite the  breakdown in nuclear inspection talks, advising more dialogue in  a meeting with South Korean officials Friday.    Tang Jiaxuan, Chinese deputy foreign minister, was quoted as  telling his South Korean counterpart Pak Kon-wu that Beijing  does "understand that Seoul has to seek other methods than  dialogue to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue," a Foreign  Ministry official said after their three-hour meeting.    "But Tang advised diplomatic negotiations no matter how  difficult the situation may become," the official said.    The North Korean nuclear crisis has taken a turn for the  worse during Tang's visit. The International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) declared that it has now become impossible to  measure the fuel rods from the North's nuclear reactor and thus  to verify whether or not the communist state diverted plutonium,  the core ingredient in making nuclear bombs.    Washington immediately announced it would seek UN sanctions,  and South Korean officials said the direction has now turned  from diplomatic negotiations to punitive measures.    Tang's remarks are the first from Beijing since this latest  development. China, a permanent member of the Security Council,  remains the uncertain variable as the council prepares to adopt  a resolution sometime next week against North Korea.    "South Korea implied that there is a limit to dialogue  efforts," said the Foreign Ministry official, who declined to be  named.    Tang agreed with Pak that the current North Korean situation  is urgent and of great concern, but the Chinese official advised  further dialogue, he said.    "Tang emphasized the importance of peace and stability on  the  Korean peninsula, the importance of a nuclear-free Korea," said  the official. "He said diplomatic negotiations would be a far  better option since pushing North Korea may only complicate  matters."</p>

The location of  the remaining five bases should be confirmed by the government  in March. Caslav and Namest nad Oslavou (supersonic aircraft),  Prerov (helicopters), Pardubice (training base), and Kbely  (transportation base) will obviously be involved. According to  Defense Ministry officials who attended a meeting with local  mayors, the airfields' fate was determined by strategic-economic  considerations and by the willingness of towns and communities  to live in their proximity. Caslav is still putting up  resistance, but, despite this, has not rid itself of the  aircraft. "We will probably have to come to terms with this,"  adds Mayor P. Prochazka. "The soldiers are appealing for our  understanding, and, of course, they have presented us with a  fait accompli. How are we then supposed to convince citizens  that the base is in the defense interests of the state?"  Operations at military airfields that do not meet health  standards should be legalized at the end of the year by a law  incorporating health-care programs for citizens affected by air  operations. It is envisaged that noise-protection zones, the  frequency and periodicity of measuring noise levels around  airfields, construction-free zones, and financial compensation  to alleviate the consequences of air operations will also be  determined.</p>

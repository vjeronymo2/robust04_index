			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Minister announces Pounds 500m warship work THE government yesterday confirmed plans worth some Pounds 500m to replace and update ships required for amphibious military operations. The announcement in the Commons by Mr Alan Clark, defence procurement minister, was seen as a move to offset the impact of recent job cuts in the defence industry, including those at British Aerospace and the shipyards VSEL and Vosper Thornycroft. It was welcomed by warship builders struggling for new orders, and by the Navy because it secures the role of the Royal Marines. Ministers have authorised the opening of a competition to design and build a helicopter carrier to take on the role previously assigned to HMS Hermes before the Navy sold it to India in 1986. Invitations to tender are due to be issued this month, with an order expected in the second half of next year. Fierce competition is expected between Swan Hunter of Tyneside and Yarrow Shipbuilders of Glasgow, a subsidiary of GEC. The ship will be designed to be able to lift ashore a commando of 500 marines. Tenders for a new ship were invited in 1988, but the Ministry of Defence put a limit of Pounds 104m on the project at the time and was not satisfied with the proposals it received. The MoD is also pressing ahead with 'project definition' work on two new assault ships to carry troops, their equipment and landing craft. They will replace the Navy's ageing vessels Intrepid and Fearless, which played a vital part in the Falklands campaign. Mr Clark said contracts for these studies had been awarded to YARD, part of a joint venture between British Aerospace and Sema, to VSEL and to Dowty-Sema. The first ship is expected to be ordered in 1994. Three logistic support ships, Sir Bedivere, Sir Geraint and Sir Percivale, belonging to the civilian-manned Royal Fleet Auxiliary, are to be overhauled and re-equipped. A sister vessel, Sir Tristram, has already been rebuilt after being badly damaged in the Falklands. All were built in the 1960s. The Navy has one more modern ship in this category, Sir Galahad, a replacement for the vessel of the same name which was sunk as a war grave after suffering an Argentinian air attack.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / People: WEW loses another top man Ian Grabiner has resigned as managing director of WEW, which runs 61 What Everyone Wants discount stores, in what the company says is an 'amicable arrangement'. His departure will nevertheless come as a blow to the Glasgow-based group which is trying to restore stability after a series of departures  - the company has had three chairmen in less than two years - and is engaged in a rapid expansion programme following December's refinancing. Peter Carr, executive chairman since last year, says Grabiner's contribution in his five years at WEW, previously known as Amber Day, had been 'considerable', but Grabiner had now decided to look at new opportunities. Carr says reports suggesting differences of opinion between Grabiner and the company's new management were unfounded. 'We are going through a period of great change here, moving into a new gear. Ian felt he had made his contribution and wanted to move on to other things.' What Everyone Wants, previously owned by Gerald and Vera Weisfeld, was acquired by Amber Day in 1990, but has been dogged by problems since then with the departure of chairman Philip Green in September 1992, and of his successor Stacey Ellis seven months later. Chief executive David Thompson resigned last year. The group now plans to double the number of stores to 125 over five years, and will be opening 12 in the next three months. Peter Carr says recent trading has been encouraging, with like-for-like sales increases  - which exclude new stores - of 5 to 6 per cent in recent months. Carr is taking over the managing director's responsibilities for the foreseeable future, but says a new MD may be appointed eventually.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Pounds 466,000 profit for electric chief Mr James Smith, chairman of regional electricity company Eastern, has made a profit of Pounds 466,867 by cashing in share options awarded to him after privatisation. It brings to more than Pounds 12m the profits made by directors of the UK's privatised water and electricity companies exercising their share option perks. Many of the executives are sitting on substantial profits from share options they have not yet exercised and also from options they have exercised but have not yet sold. On April 5 Mr Smith, who at privatisation earned a salary of Pounds 62,270, exercised 121,107 share options. He immediately sold 60,554 shares at 6.69p each and 60,553 the day after at 6.80p, to give him a total profit of Pounds 466,867. Three other Eastern directors recently exercised share options bringing them a combined profit of Pounds 143,000. The company said that it was 'a private matter for the directors whether they exercised the share options'. A spokesman said that 'in order to attract and retain senior executives of the right calibre and degree of specialist talent Eastern has to be prepared to offer a remuneration package which is comparable with the rest of industry'. Eastern's recently published annual report gives some details of directors' share options but does not reveal the actual profit Mr Smith made. This practice is in line with several other water and electricity company reports. Stock Exchange disclosures compiled for the Financial Times by The Inside Track, an Edinburgh-based consultancy, reveal the actual gross profits made by directors when exercising share options. Mr Tony Coleman, group finance director of Yorkshire Electricity, made a profit of Pounds 152,550 by exercising 61,957 options in April and then selling on 45,000 shares. That left him with 16,957 shares which are currently showing a paper profit of Pounds 49,854. Water company directors have made total profits of about Pounds 4.5m by exercising options and selling shares since January last year. Cashing in, Page 8</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Birt joins staff with Pounds 200,000 package MR John Birt, director-general of the BBC, this week joined the staff of the Corporation more than six years after coming to the organisation from London Weekend Television, Raymond Snoddy writes. Mr Birt signed a staff contract including a Pounds 200,000 pay package. His predecessor Sir Michael Checkland, who retired just before Christmas, was paid more than Pounds 140,000 until three months before his retirement but he then received an increase to around Pounds 160,000. It is believed that Mr Birt's deal was agreed in January and that negotiations were effectively complete before a row broke about his employment status in March. Mr Birt had been a freelance consultant while deputy director-general. Independent Television News has called for an independent audit of BBC World Service Television in its response to the government's green paper on the future of the corporation. It says although WSTV is meant to support itself financially its present funding arrangements are too opaque to judge whether this happens.</p>

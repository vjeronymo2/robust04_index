			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Dollar at record low against yen THE DOLLAR closed at an all-time low of Y119.23 in Tokyo yesterday, down 0.74 yen from Thursday, with the Japanese authorities showing little sign of attempting to break the yen's rise against the US currency, writes Charles Leadbeater. The dollar reached Y119.25 in October when the yen surged amid the speculative turmoil in European currency markets. The yen has strengthened throughout the week, apparently on rumours that a meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers later this month might attempt to engineer an appreciation of the yen to choke off the rise in Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the US. The dollar has also weakened in Tokyo on worries that President Bill Clinton's economic programme, which involves increased taxes and cuts in federal spending, might undermine the US recovery. However, the surge in the yen is also likely to be due to companies repatriating funds from abroad to improve their finances before books close on March 31. Most Japanese companies are facing their third year of declining profits. Mr Mamoru Ozaki, the finance ministry's vice minister and most powerful bureaucrat, said there was no need for policy changes to address the strengthening of the yen. The Japanese government would be happy for the yen to appreciate gradually, in part because this might help to correct the trade surplus. However senior officials at both the finance ministry and the Bank of Japan rule out any concerted effort by the G7 to manipulate exchange rates to reduce the surplus.</p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Civil service fast stream probed The government revealed yesterday that it is reviewing one of the cornerstones of the British civil service, the fast stream entry system that assures a glittering career for an elite of young high flyers. For nearly 140 years the fast stream has picked out a small group of civil servants at the start of their careers and virtually ensured that they are Whitehall mandarins some 20 years later. The system has been regularly attacked for ensuring that the civil service is run by a like-minded group of white, middle-class males educated at Oxford and Cambridge universities. The Cabinet Office said yesterday that the review 'would look at the strategic question of whether the civil service needs a fast stream system at all'. In a parliamentary written answer, Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, announced that a review of the system was being carried out and it would be completed by June. The review follows calls - from inside and outside Whitehall - for changes to the top structure of the civil service to bring it into line with the management reforms of the last six years. The creation of executive agencies to deliver central government services has led ministers to look for private-sector skills in those who run them. A recent Whitehall report into career management also claimed that the fast stream system 'could encourage the worst aspects of elitism and, without care, might perpetuate a set of skills more suitable to the past than the future'. Mr John Garrett, Labour MP for Norwich South and a former member of the Commons Treasury and civil service committee, said the announcement was the first time ministers had admitted that the system needs changing. 'A crack has appeared in the facade,' he added. He claimed that civil service reforms could have a big impact on elite career management in the private sector. Cabinet Office staff were more downbeat about the announcement. 'It shows we are a good, sensible employer, and this is a regular review of whether our recruitment is up to best practice,' said an official. The Cabinet Office is to review the future of Recruitment and Assessment Services, the civil service recruitment agency. The agency recruits civil servants and administers the fast stream system on behalf the Civil Service Commissioners. The review, which comes three years after the agency was created, will consider privatisation and contracting-out as well as a continuation as an agency. The views of outside organisations are to be sought on the options.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Survey of Management Consultants (2): Life still tough for the IT consultant - Growth is slow in the industry's richest sector INFORMATION technology (IT) consultants are 'finding life a little difficult,' says Mr Patrick Whale, president of the Computing Services Association and senior IT consultancy partner at KPMG. Rapid growth in IT consultancy has slowed and the fight for market share is fierce. A survey conducted by industry magazine Management Consultancy shows the average growth projection by IT consultancies for this year is 6.8 per cent  -a big drop from the halcyon days of the 1980s when it was often above 30 per cent - and even this figure may prove over optimistic. With the exception of the continuing success story of Andersen Consulting, the market leader, business is tough. IT is management consultancy's richest sector, but establishing the size of the market is not easy. Boundaries are blurred between IT consultancy and other areas of management consultancy, and between consultancy and other computer services. And as well as big consultancies, myriad small operators need to be tracked. Calculations based on figures supplied by the Computing Services Association would give a market size at the end of last year of around Pounds 400m, down from Pounds 460m in 1990. However, corresponding estimates based on figures from the Management Consultancies Association give an increase from Pounds 485m in 1990 to Pounds 520m last year. More significant than market size is the slackening off of business in certain areas. According to Mr Whale, the IT strategy consulting market is far from booming. 'There aren't the number of large contracts in that arena that there were.' The picture is not much better in generalist IT consulting. Work is still being undertaken, but the number of big turnkey consultancy projects has declined, says Mr Whale, although he says work from the public sector is bolstering the marketplace. Health is one public sector area he sees as offering promise, although competition in this sector is fierce, he adds. Large scale job losses in IT consultancy have slowed. Staff are still trickling away, but are also being recruited in dribbles. Andersen Consulting is the notable exception. This year it is taking on 250 graduates and 50 to 100 professional staff, most of them in IT or IT-related consultancy. 'Last year was a disaster,' says Mr Christopher Sale of recruiters Michael Page Technology. 'This year things are distinctly more buoyant. I'd put more emphasis on recruiting in the current market than I would on losing people.' Systems and software houses continue to restructure their consultancy activities. In spite of the fact that Logica abandoned a separate consultancy arm over two years ago - although consultancy still represents 20 per cent of turnover - this year Hoskyns has redeployed its consultants into a new division and Sema Group has also launched an independent consultancy. Meanwhile SD-Scicon, now known as EDS-Scicon, has been radically restructured by its acquirer, Electronic Data Systems. 'I don't think that the systems houses in these times have been able to sustain the image that they held of also being consultants,' says KPMG's Mr Whale. He says the systems houses have been unable to match the development of the big accounting firms' IT consultancy divisions as 'one stop shops' offering a complete solution from strategy to design and implementation with subsequent support. Corporates continue setting up their IT departments as consultancies selling expertise to other businesses. Recent entrants include Lucas Industries, the Post Office and British Rail. At present these operators do not constitute a big presence in the market. More of a force for established IT consultancies to reckon with are the hardware manufacturers. Among others, IBM, Digital, Bull and Unisys are beefing up their efforts in the services sector. IBM has substantial numbers of consultants in action. In the past two years the number of staff deployed in its services division has grown from around 400 to 2,000. Mr John Clyde, IBM's manager for IT strategy consulting, estimates that, on a broad definition, about two-thirds of these are IT consultants. He bullishly says competitors 'have reason to be nervous as we're growing faster than the industry. That means we're gaining share and that has to come from somewhere'. According to Mr Clyde, revenue growth is 'dramatic', although he declines to give actual figures. The standard criticism from the rest of the industry of hardware manufacturers' consultants is lack of independence - they recommend their own hardware first. Mr Clyde's response is threefold. He estimates that around 20 per cent of fee income comes from projects that do not involve IBM products. The fact that the remaining bulk of his clients use IBM hardware he sees as hardly surprising, since most large corporates buy some of IBM's products. Finally, he says important consultancy areas, such as strategy, are independent of products. 'It's only really at the bottom level, which is help with implementation, that you're down to the specifics of products,' he explains. Many IT consultants have left the larger firms and set up small niche consultancies. What is life like for the smaller IT consultancy in the midst of recession? Mr Bob Cossey is a consultant at Parkwell Management Consultants, whose particular niche is the selection and implementation of accounting systems. Parkwell has six staff, down from nine at the beginning of the recession, and Mr Cossey says that business is better than last year. In Mr Cossey's view, Parkwell can offer the same service as a big consultancy at a lower cost, since it doesn't carry the same level of overheads. Mr Cossey has noticed significant fall-out: 'Surprisingly, a lot of the small consultancies set up by staff from the big consultancies have gone out of business. It's difficult to see why, because in theory they can control their costs much quicker.' This is leading to atomisation of consultancies. 'They don't actually go out of business because the individuals start as independent consultants,' he says.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP 20 FIRMS SUPPLYING MANAGEMENT CONSULTANCY SERVICES 1991  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Firm                 European     Professionals/                             Revenue      Consultants                            Dollars M        No.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1     Andersen Consulting     908          7,750 2     KPMG                    420          2,800 3     Coopers &amp; Lybrand       400          2,800 4     McKinsey &amp; Co           336          1,110 5     PA Consulting Group     267          1,450 6     Price Waterhouse        260          2,297 7     Cap Gemini Sogeti       232          1,740 8     Ernst &amp; Young           227          1,300 9     Alexander Proudfoot     175            600 10    DRT                     150          1,070 11    Gemini Consulting       150            450 12    Bossard Consultants     126            800 13    Boston Consulting Group 120            400 14    P-E International       119            465 15    IBM                     117          1,000 16    Digital Equipment       115          1,000 17    Roland Berger           113            375 18    Towers Perrin           105            600 19    Hay Group                96            411 20    CMG                      93            650  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Alpha Publications  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

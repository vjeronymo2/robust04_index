			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Takeovers From the rubble of the 1980s, a familiar question is emerging: whether takeovers in the UK are by their nature a bad thing. A House of Commons committee has been hearing from such as the chairman of Pilkington and Sir John Clark, the erstwhile head of Plessey, on the iniquities of the present system. The Guinness appeal has revived memories of the most notorious takeover of the decade. Some of the arguments deserve careful consideration. The snag has to do with the examples. Sir John Clark blames the loss of his company on short-termism. But the real issue in the Plessey bid was whether long-term research and development could be achieved by a company of Plessey's size, not whether it would be undertaken by GEC and Siemens. In the case of Guinness, the central problem of the old Distillers Company before the takeover was that it was bogged down in short-term expedients such as price-cutting and overproduction. It is now perhaps the most successful drinks company in the world, not least by virtue of its long-term strategy. As for Pilkington, its shares have underperformed the London market by 40 per cent in the past 20 years. How long a term does its chairman have in mind? There may well be scope for reform at the detailed level; it seems generally agreed, for instance, that the 29.9 per cent bid threshold is set too high. But the whole argument belongs within a larger one of corporate governance, which as yet is scarcely being addressed except by those investing institutions which industry regards as being at the root of the problem. More fundamentally again, British boardrooms are split between those who want protection from predators and those who want freedom to prey. The same Commons committee session which heard from Pilkington was told by Kingfisher, whose bid for Dixons was blocked on competition grounds last year, that policy should be clarified to make takeovers simpler. If the captains of industry do not know what they want, the rest of us cannot help them.</p>

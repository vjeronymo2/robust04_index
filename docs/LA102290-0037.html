			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'PICTURES': TIRING BUT TANTALIZING  </P> <P> Filmforum presents tonight at 8 at LACE Richard Myers' "Moving Pictures," the  latest work from the outstanding Ohio surrealist filmmaker. Myers' "Akran"  (1971) was biographical, his "Deathstyles" (1972) apocalyptic and his  "Floorshow" (1975) an attempt to break down the barriers between the conscious  and subconscious, the making of the film and the film itself, and in turn, the  filmmaker and the audience.  </P> <P> As it tries to make film and dream one and the same, "Moving Pictures" is at  once one of the simplest of his films and one of the toughest, alternately  tantalizing and wearying.  </P> <P> For 90 minutes Myers keeps his camera continually moving slowly from right to  left, capturing his usual images of Midwestern Americana, considering the  nature of mime and spectacle, contrasting the beauty of nature and of derelict  urban structures.  </P> <P> Myers will appear in person. (213) 276-7452. KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

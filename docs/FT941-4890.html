			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Manufactured excuses Two worries hit UK equities yesterday. One was the possibility that January's strong industrial production figures might deter the authorities from cutting interest rates again; the other was that some large rights issues were in prospect. If true, the latter would indeed be cause for concern. There is limited new cash going into the market at present. Any that is steered towards equities is meeting a plentiful supply of new issues. Yesterday's 41 point fall is thus partly a measure of how the equity market, like gilts, has become prey to fears of over-supply. By contrast interest rate worries look overdone, at least on the basis of the output figures. These showed output of investment goods rose nearly 4 per cent in January while that of consumer goods fell slightly. That hardly represents a trend, and investment goods output may simply have been snapping back after two weak months in November and December. But at least the picture is consistent with a shift towards investment-led growth that is needed to make the recovery sustainable. That should not stand in the way of interest rate cuts. Political pressures for lower rates are likely to intensify as next month's tax increases bite. Paradoxically, stronger output figures might even help by signalling rising productivity. The UK's actual inflation performance is what really counts for interest rates. The chancellor's life will be harder, though, if gilts and sterling weaken further because of Germany's reluctance to accelerate its own rate cuts.</p>

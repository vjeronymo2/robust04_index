			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Confusing advice I AM receiving conflicting advice over pensions. In 1981, I became self-employed and started a pension policy with Equitable Life. This policy is funded to the maximum allowed by the Inland Revenue. In February this year, I took on a full-time job in addition to my self-employed work, and I joined my employer's superannuation scheme. This scheme is funded 6 per cent by me and 9 per cent by my employer. Equitable tells me that I cannot continue to subscribe to my policy there as well as my employer's scheme, but others tell me I can have a pension for each of my employments. If you belong to one employer's pension scheme but also have a second job with a different employer which is non-pensionable, or if you have freelance earnings, then it is usually possible to obtain tax deductibility on personal pension contributions for the this second job or freelance earnings. Most of the problem areas we have examined seem to have arisen where second-job or freelance earnings have been received from the same organisation that pays the salary for the first, even if the contractual relationships with the organisation are totally unconnected. We suggest that you set out in writing the source of your separate non-pensionable earnings, showing their separation from your pensionable employment, and ask the Equitable representative to refer your case back to his head office. If need be, you can yourself approach your local inspector of taxes. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

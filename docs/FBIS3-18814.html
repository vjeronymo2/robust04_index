			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- The Berlin police has stated that a  report, according to which the authorities are preparing for a  "hot and bloody spring" in the capital city, is "pure  panic-mongering." There are "indications and individual  statements from the left-wing extremist and right-wing extremist  camps concerning planned disturbances," Police President Hagen  Saberschinsky said on Tuesday [8 March]. However, the  responsible state protection department of the police does not  know anything about an analysis by the Office for the Protection  of the Constitution about an "escalation of violence."    Referring to a confidential analysis by the Office for the  Protection of the Constitution, today's edition of the daily DIE  WELT reports that Berlin is facing an escalation of violence.  According to the paper, the authorities fear an increase in the  number of political murders. Riots are expected in particular  during the international soccer match between Germany and Great  Britain on 20 April, Adolf Hitler's birthday.    The Office for the Protection of the Constitution did not  confirm the newspaper report, either. Its spokesman, Eberhard  Kruschke, told DPA that no "specific plans" for disturbing the  soccer match are known. It is still too early to analyze the  situation. Office for the Protection of the Constitution and  police stressed that they are in close contact. The police will  "do everything so that extremists from the left and the right do  not have a chance in the city," Saberschinsky stressed.    According to DIE WELT, the leftist autonomous scene in  Berlin  considers the holding of the soccer match "on the Fuehrer's  birthday, in the stadium built by the Fuehrer, in the capital of  the Fuehrer's Reich" as a provocation. At first the match was  supposed to take place in Hamburg, but then it was canceled for  fear of riots. Subsequently, the Berlin Senat declared its  readiness to have the soccer match take place on the Spree  river. The number of violence-prone autonomous activists is  estimated at 5,000 all over the country. The stronghold is  Berlin, where more than 1,000 people belong to this scene.</p>

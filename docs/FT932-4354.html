			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: US selling halts attempt to advance RENEWED selling of the drug stocks from across the Atlantic put an end to an attempted rally in London's blue chip issues last night, although fresh demand for the second line stocks took the FT-SE Mid 250 Index to a new closing peak. Rights issues in the property sector came as no surprise, but the stock market again proved unable to move far from the Footsie 2,850 mark, which has established itself as the middle of the current trading range. The market at first brushed off Wall Street's overnight fall and some Pounds 119.4m in fund-raising moves by two UK property groups. At best the Footsie was ahead by 10 points, helped by a momentary flicker of demand for stock index futures. However, Footsie 2,854.9 proved the best the market would accept and share prices drifted down in London towards the close when a fall of 16 Dow points as Wall Street opened, coupled with selling of Wellcome as first reports from a medical conference in Berlin reached London, took the shine off the UK stock market, taking it briefly into negative territory. At the close, the FT-SE 100 was a net 0.4 off at 2,844.4, having rallied from an earlier 2.4 loss. But the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which takes in a range of second line issues, jumped by 13.2 to a new all-time high of 3,198.1, comfortably surpassing the previous peak reached only a week ago. Trading in non-Footsie stocks made up around 60 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 551.7m shares, which compared with 456.78m on Monday. But retail or customer business activity on the previous day fell to only Pounds 884m, the second recent daily session to fall well short of the Pounds 1bn figure regarded as the basis for profitable trading by the London securities industry. With the stock market clearly unwilling to break away from its current trading range, the search for the investment traces of the big institutions continued. Traders believed these large investment houses were not sellers of UK equities but were ready buyers - but only at prices just below market levels. 'They are certainly not chasing prices,' said Mr Michael Hicks at Strauss Turnbull. Hopes for a base rate cut have been placed on hold, at least until nearer to the Mansion House speech in the City of London by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new UK chancellor of the exchequer. The market also continues to await clearer evidence that the recovery in the UK economy is beginning to show through into company trading results. On this front, there was a significant response to the continued recovery in shares of British Aerospace, with several leading broking houses pointing to the outperformance of the stock. But the outlook for the market as a whole is now clouded over by the persistent selling of drug stocks from the US. In addition to unsettling leading market indices and the rest of the blue chip sectors, this is now casting clouds over the progress of Zeneca, the new bioscience formed by the former interests of ICI. The Zeneca issue, although carried off successfully at first, has now become a serious uncertainty for a stock market which is itself in doubts over its own high valuation at a time when it has lost all the gains achieved since the beginning of the year.</p>

According to Klaus, the difference between his and Havel's  statements merely lies in a sterner and a less stern  formulation. The prime minister believes that, had one not  started to "dissect" these formulations, the Czech Republic  definitely would not suffer any damage.    Klaus is "fully convinced that there will not be any [NATO]  air strikes." He characterized his view that the core to the  settlement of the conflict lay in an internal agreement as "the  sole correct approach."    During the weekend, President Havel supported NATO's threat  of air strikes in the event of the Bosnian Serbs' failure to  withdraw their heavy artillery deployed around Sarajevo by 21  February. Prime Minister Klaus, on the other hand, said last  Thursday [10 February] that the Czech Government and the Civic  Democratic Party were afraid of an external intervention in  Bosnia.    Klaus noted at his briefing on Monday that the situation in  Bosnia remained a subject of discussion all over the world.  "When we emphasize that the core of the solution lies in a  domestic agreement and that any external involvement can only be  a supplement, this is not, I think, in contradiction with  anything [Havel says] and is the sole correct approach," he said  literally.    Deputy Prime Minister and Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA]  chairman Jan Kalvoda said on Monday, in reply to a question from  RUDE PRAVO, that the [Czech Government's] position on the  Bosnian conflict ought to be discussed by the coalition's  Foreign Policy Coordination Council, which comprises, among  others, the president, the chairmen of coalition parties, and  the minister of foreign affairs. Prime Minister Klaus rejected  this proposal the same day when talking to reporters. He said  that a united stand on Bosnia was a problem only for those who  were trying "to find at any price a contradiction where there is  not any."    According to Kalvoda, the body for foreign policy  coordination was established to deal precisely with issues such  as this one. "In matters such as this, no constitutional body  can implement a policy different from the coalition," Kalvoda  said. Replying to another question from RUDE PRAVO--whether the  government should adopt a statement of principle on  Bosnia--Kalvoda said that it was a supremely political issue  which constitutional body delivers its opinion on the matter.  "However, any constitutional body should always do so on the  basis of the coalition's decision. I do not think right now  that the government should adopt a statement [at its next  meeting] on Wednesday [16 February]," he said. According to ODA  Deputy Chairman Daniel Kroupa, such a statement of principle  could be adopted by parliament.    The statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on  Bosnia on Friday [11 February] is not a statement that would be  changed from one day to the next, M. Skolil, chief of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs Press Section, said on Monday when  responding to RUDE PRAVO's question of whether differences  existed in the interpretation of the government's talks on the  NATO ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs. "Our diplomats have been  instructed in accordance with the ministry statement. It is not  the task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to comment on a  discussion that may be taking place among our constitutional  officials. We present the official stand of the Czech Republic  per se. It is the binding standpoint of both the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs and the Czech Republic," Skolil said. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Recession 'slow to end' in south-east The south-east lost one in 10 of its jobs in business and financial services during the recession, the region's local authorities say. The authorities say in a report that the recession has ended the traditional north-south divide, and the south-east will not lead the country out of the downturn. Essex, Bedford and west Sussex have the poorest growth, while Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire and Berkshire are expected to grow fastest.</p>

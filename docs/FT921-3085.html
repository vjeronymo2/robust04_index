			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (17): Flaring monuments to a wasting resource / Review of the gas industry THIS promises to be an active year for Nigeria's gas industry. But much of the activity remains in air-conditioned offices in Lagos and the world's financial centres while most of the gas produced burns away in solitary flares, monuments to the wasting of a resource the country desperately needs to exploit. Nigeria has proven gas reserves estimated to be more than 2.8m cubic metres, with a further 1,800bn cu m of probable reserves. Nearly two thirds of the gas reserves are in the Niger delta, the heart of the oil industry. Yet the oil companies do not actively explore for gas. Discovered fields are left untouched; while the associated gas produced as a by-product of the oil industry is burnt away. Production in 1990 was estimated to be 27.6m cu m, of which 77 per cent was flared. The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has been trying for some years to persuade the oil companies to tap this natural gas production for export or to supply the domestic market. So far, only Shell has done so. But the final decision on a number of large-scale projects will be made over the coming months. The Nigerian Gas Company (NGC) has a monopoly for buying gas from producing joint ventures. About 72 per cent of its sales are to the four thermal power plants of the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA). The other main customer is the National Fertilizer Company of Nigeria (NAFCON). Commissioned 1988, NAFCON is highly profitable and plans are afoot to build a Dollars 500m replica of the existing plant. NAFCON will remain an important consumer of domestic gas. The main obstacle to supplying gas to the domestic market has been the very low price of gas, set by the government at N5.24 per thousand standard cubic feet. This price, the oil companies have traditionally argued, has acted as a disincentive for the oil companies to invest in gas facilities. Yet the government policy remains to exploit the gas reserves. Over the past year the Shell joint venture, which supplies non-associated gas from two gas plants, has negotiated new 20-year sales agreements with NGC, replacing an earlier informal understanding. The agreements have rationalised the existing gas contracts and supply arrangements, explains Philip Watts, managing director of Shell's Nigerian subsidiary. 'We are going to get the gas business on to a proper commercial footing,' he says. But the terms on which the gas will be sold are still being negotiated. Shell expects an agreement to be forthcoming over the next few months with fiscal concessions compensating for the low supply price. 'People will only invest hundreds of millions of dollars in the utilisation of associated gas if there is a stable fiscal framework,' says Mr Watts. Chevron also expects to agree terms with the government which will enable it to go ahead with a Dollars 500m project to build a plant at its Escravos terminal. The plant will recover 300 cu ft per day of associated gas which is currently being flared. NNPC has been keen for Chevron to tap this associated gas, but the project has been held up for more than a year because the supply price on offer did not make it profitable to recover the gas, a more expensive process than tapping non-associated gas wells. Chevron is already doing preliminary work on the proposed site and hopes to draw up a short-list of six construction companies, with engineering work beginning by June. The plant would begin production in 1995. But the project is premised on a favourable deal with NNPC. 'Neither NNPC nor Chevron is willing to get into a project that is not economic,' says Donald Mahura, managing director of Chevron's Nigerian subsidiary. Nigeria has also pursued plans to use its gas reserves for export. Mobil is believed to be considering a gas project to follow its successful Oso condensate venture. There are also plans to use some of the gas produced by Chevron as a feedstock for an export-orientated Dollars 400m methanol plant. Chevron says that its plant should still be economically viable if it supplies the domestic market only. The methanol plant, with a daily output of 2,000-2,500 tonnes, would be a joint venture between NNPC, the UK-based company Penspen and the German company Mannesman. Chevron has also been invited to become an equity partner, but Mr Mahura says the proposal is still under consideration. Sources close to Penspen say that ICI, the UK chemicals company, has guaranteed to buy the methanol for at least 10 years after production begins in 1995. The methanol will be used to make MTBE, a replacement for tetra-ethyl lead in petrol, with the US the main final destination. Nigeria's largest and most ambitious gas project, however, is a multi-billion dollar plan to produce liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export to the US and Europe. In 1989, Nigeria LNG (NLNG) was established to construct and operate the plant and market the gas. The company is owned by NNPC (60 per cent) Shell (20 per cent), Elf (10 per cent) and Agip (10 per cent). The project is now reaching its critical stage. Cost projection over-runs and the difficulties of negotiating buyer contracts in the highly competitive world LNG market have delayed the project. If a financing package can be agreed by the end of this year then production could begin in 1997. The central issue on which the success of the project depends is the price agreements that NLNG can negotiate with its buyers. Last September, the company agreed a memorandum of understanding with each of its four potential buyers: ENEL (Italy, 3.5 cu m per year), ENAGAS (Spain, 1.0 cu m), Gaz de France (0.5 cu m), and Distrigas Corporation (US, 0.7 cu m). But the precise terms of the contracts, which will fix the formulae linking the LNG price to the world crude oil and crude product prices, have yet to be signed. NLNG sent an information memorandum to selected financial institutions last November. But the institutions were not provided with any information about the likely supply prices for the LNG. A source close to the institutions described the project as 'unbankable' until this information is supplied. NLNG hopes to sign two of the four contracts this month, and the rest in April. This would enable the International Financing Corporation, the World Bank's private sector finance arm, to complete an independent assessment of the viability of the project by April to be sent to the institutions. A positive response from the IFC report is crucial for the success of the project. If all goes well, construction could begin by the end of the year. Two international engineering consortia have been invited to bid for the contract. But if the IFC concludes that the supply price agreed with the buyers is too low or uncertain, the Dollars 2.4bn financing package will not be forthcoming and the project will fold. 'We need some encouragement for the financial community,' says Mr Giovanni Pedaci, corporate planning manager at NLNG. 'Our project is complex, it is difficult; but in the end it will be worth it.' Whether the banks and export-credit agencies agree with his assessment will be revealed over the coming months.  ------------------------------------------------------------      NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION (MILLIONS OF CUBIC METRES)  ------------------------------------------------------------                           1989        %       1990       %  ------------------------------------------------------------ Gross production        24,831      100     27,593     100   Gas flared            18,237       73     21,341      77   Gas re-injected        1,993        8      2,175       8   Gas used in field        769        3        807       3   Marketed production    3,883       16      3,233      12   Natural gas liquids       47       -          37      -  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Nigerian National Petroleum Corproration and Central Bank of Nigeria  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

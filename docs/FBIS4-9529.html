			<p>BFN     [Text] Olsztyn, 26 April--In a conversation with a PAP  journalist on 26 April, Ewa Spychalska, chairwoman of the OPZZ  [National Trade Union Alliance], ruled out the possibility of  the OPZZ joining in the Solidarity strike action but did not  rule out cooperation under conditions that will be determined by  the presidium. She announced that if the strike wave did not  stop by noon on 27 April, the OPZZ Presidium would make a  decision about what the union will do in the prevailing  situation.    Spychalska believes that the demands put forward by  Solidarity during the strikes are "in general compatible with  those put to the government by the OPZZ." She has doubts about  the "road chosen by Solidarity." "I cannot imagine the OPZZ  choosing a paralysis of the country as its objective," she  added, asked by the PAP journalist to comment on the strike  action. On Tuesday, Spychalska took part in a precongress  meeting with OPZZ members in Olsztyn.    According to Spychalska there are more and more flashpoints  between the government and the OPZZ. The greatest controversies  are aroused by the government draft labor code and the trade  union acts, which, she said, "push the unions into a corner."  Speaking about this, she did not rule out the possibility of  the OPZZ leaving the coalition.    According to the OPZZ chairwoman, after four years of  Solidarity in power, the situation in Poland is "critical,"  while that union was striving for "confrontation and  overthrowing the government," disregarding the results of the  last elections.</p>

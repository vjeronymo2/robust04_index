			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-san: "Force-Oriented Policy Never </F> Works With Us"]    [Text] International reactionaries led by the United States  are more wildly engaging in pressure tactics over the issue of  refueling our experimental nuclear power reactor.    As it has been reported, the UN Security Council adopted a  president's statement on 30 May. The president's statement,  which is written according to a premeditated plot by some member  states of the UN Security Council, consists of absurdities,  finding fault with us by stating that the fuel rods should be  replaced only in compliance with the practical demands of the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], and that the  opportunity of selected separation and preservation of fuel rods  might be lost.    This is written based on the IAEA's unjustifiable and unfair  evaluation and we cannot accept this.    In concurrence with the announcement of the president's  statement, there have been voices emerging from the United  Nations and the United States in succession raving about UN  sanctions and multinational sanctions.    On the other hand, backed by such a situation, U.S. Defense  Department spokesman Dennis Boxx declared on 2 June that the  ultralarge carrier Independence, which is participating in the  Rimpac military exercise, could change its route and be  mobilized somewhere else if necessary.    In the meantime, an announcement was made in concurrence  with  the president's statement that the Ulchi Focus Lens joint  military exercise to be conducted by the U.S. forces and South  Korean puppet Army will begin in August.    It is clear that such political and military moves stem from  the maneuver to make us yield to the unfair demands of the  United States and the IAEA. However, this will not work. As  shown in earlier DPRK-U.S. relations and the process of the  negotiations and dialogue between us and the IAEA, pressure and  force just do not work with us and cannot solve the problem.    In any case, it is truly a regretful deed staining the UN  history that the UN Security Council, which has a weighty  responsibility for the world's peace and security, is finding  fault with us following the IAEA's groundless scheme and  conspiracy. It proves that the UN Security Council is seriously  violating the principle of fairness, which is the basis for its  existence.    Therefore, we regard the president's statement against us as  utterly unjust and we thoroughly reject it.    For things to proceed on the right track, the UN Security  Council should have first taken up the issue of the IAEA  Secretariat's unfair conduct. Before the refueling began, our  Republic had asked the IAEA many times to take the necessary  steps, including the observation and replacement of the seals,  but it never sent an inspection team until the refueling began.  It is none other than some quarters of the IAEA Secretariat  that intentionally disregarded the UN Security Council  president's statement dated 31 March by refusing the additional  inspection [chuga sachal] even though we had allowed it.    Next, picking a quarrel by writing in the presidential  statement that the opportunity to select, separate, and store  the fuel rods may be lost is also a stubborn insistence that is  not feasible.    At the recent negotiations between the agency's negotiating  team and our side in Pyongyang, discussions were basically  carried out on the technical possibility of preserving for later  measurement the replaced fuel rods, and in particular,  sufficient discussions were held on the feasibility of such a  method, which we are currently applying. If there is a package  settlement between the DPRK and the United States regarding the  nuclear issue in the future, this method makes it possible to  sufficiently verify our past nuclear activities. Therefore, the  agency said that it would seriously examine this method and  decided to continue the discussion later.    Nevertheless, even before arriving at the Vienna  headquarters, the agency's negotiating team distorted the  situation as if the negotiations were broken without giving a  clear explanation and presented our issue to the UN Security  Council. It goes without saying that such an action by the  agency stems from the dirty intention of driving us into the  nuclear dock in accordance with the scenario it drew up in  advance.    Our work of replacing the fuel rods at this time is being  carried out under the presence of the agency's inspection team  and strict control of the surveillance equipment. Regardless of  these facts, picking a quarrel by saying that the opportunity to  select, separate, and store the fuel rods may be lost shows that  the UN Security Council is intentionally joining forces with the  IAEA's unreasonable claim.    As we are currently under a special status in which we have  temporarily suspended the effectuation of the withdrawal from  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, we have no legal duty  whatsoever to receive regular and irregular inspections [chonggi  mit pichonggi sachal] in accordance with the nuclear safeguards  accord. We can by no means respond to the agency's demands that  we accept such inspections. This can be realized only at a  period when our special status is dissolved.    Nevertheless, the true intention of carrying out tactics of  political oppression against us regarding the issue of replacing  the fuel rods, is to make an excuse to crush [apsalhal] us  militarily.    If the UN Security Council attempts to unreasonably carry  out  sanctions against us regarding our nuclear issue, we will justly  exercise our sovereign rights, and it will be inevitable to take  decisive corresponding measures. This is our people's firm will.    The United States and its insidious following forces must  not  misjudge the situation. We treasure peace but we will not beg  for it if the nation's dignity is infringed upon. We are  prepared for both war and dialogue.    The international reactionary forces under the initiative of  the United States must by no means see our tolerance and  patience as weakness.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Economics Notebook: Retail prices index comes under fresh bout of scrutiny ONCE AGAIN Britain's retail prices index is coming under official scrutiny. In a press release, which was quickly lost from sight in the aftermath of the Budget and the excitement surrounding the fixing of the election date, the Central Statistical Office last week announced the membership of its retail prices index advisory committee. Nineteen economists and experts, including the FT's chief economic commentator Mr Samuel Brittan, will advise Mr William McLennan, the CSO's recently appointed head, about the implications for the RPI of the abolition of the poll tax and its replacement by the council tax. Also on the agenda will be the inclusion of holiday spending in the index and the way the RPI tracks the prices of new cars. The decision to reconvene the committee was announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, last month. But it is unlikely that it will meet before the election. It could then find its brief radically altered in the event of a Labour victory which could lead to the scrapping of the council tax. However, there are some who would argue that the RPI needs more careful scrutiny than that envisaged by the committee's terms of reference. Two market researchers, Mr Pym Cornish and Mr Mike Waterson, have published a paper which maintains that the index, as presently constituted, overstates UK inflation in conditions of recession. They add that it probably understated inflation in the economic boom of the late 1980s. The RPI is a vitally important indicator. With reason, Mr Nigel Lawson said in the 1980s that inflation was the 'judge and jury' of British government policy. The economic pain involved in reducing the annual rate of retail price inflation from its recent peak of 10.9 per cent in October 1990 will dominate the election campaign. The index has an impact on many aspects of everyday life. It acts as a base level for wage negotiators; influences the pricing decisions of companies; determines how state retirement pensions and certain social security benefits are upgraded, and directly affects savers of index-linked National Saving certificates and indexed gilt-edged government securities. The assertion of Mr Cornish and Mr Waterson that the current true rate of retail price inflation could be as little as 1 per cent compared with January's 4.1 per cent official inflation rate is, therefore, disturbing. The two argue that the RPI substantially overstates the true average levels of many prices paid because the prices making up the index are those on a list of goods, that is revised annually and taken from a fixed panel of outlets. Unlike ordinary shoppers, the officials who gather prices for the index cannot shop around for the best bargains. Because they are not actually buying goods, they cannot haggle for discounts on big ticket items. The index does not capture special offers of the type common in supermarkets, where big savings can be obtained by purchasing more than one example of a specific item. Moreover, the RPI cannot take any account of vouchers issued by manufacturers to encourage the purchase of specific products. It can only take account of increases in the size of a product for a given price when these are lasting. There are some serious implications for the government in this. For example, recent assessments of high street activity may appear excessively gloomy because trends in retail sales volumes are calculated by deflating the value of total sales by selected components of the RPI. However, it has to be said that the writers' assessment of the over-recording of current inflation is no more than an estimate. The two authors have backgrounds in market research rather than economics and statistics. Mr Waterson also makes clear that he believes there could be business opportunities for market researchers in developing an alternative to the RPI based on transacted prices. On the other hand, the RPI probably deserves more examination than that planned for the CSO's advisory committee, if only because some government officials have also expressed doubts over whether the index is accurately reflecting the real state of inflation. German outlook The retail prices index used to be a key factor determining British interest rates. But since Britain became a member of the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990, German inflation has been more important. This point was acknowledged by Mr Lamont in his Budget speech when he said he expected to see reductions in European interest rates 'as the underlying level of German inflation abates'. But what is the outlook for German inflation? According to one leading German bank economist, price developments in Germany will be 'on a roller coaster' in the coming months, reflecting tax changes. Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist of Bayerische Vereinsbank in Munich, told a meeting in London last week that inflation was likely to rise to about 4.5 per cent in April and May then fall to 3.5 per cent in July before increasing again at the end of the year as a planned increase in value added tax translates into a 0.5 percentage point rise in consumer prices. These trends would not justify any further increase in German interest rates. But cuts would be unlikely before mid-year and the subsequent downward trend would 'probably be very slow'. Looking further ahead, Mr Hufner's analysis contained both good and bad news for the UK. The current slowdown in the German economy would be temporary and the 1990s would be a period with strong growth of about 4 per cent a year as supply side improvements boosted the German economy and it benefited from German and European unification. That would be good for UK exporters. On the other hand, high fiscal deficits meant that Germany's discount rate was unlikely to fall below a range of 4 per cent to 5 per cent compared with 3 per cent or less in earlier cycles. As Germany's discount rate is currently 8 per cent, that could suggest a future floor of around 7 per cent for UK base rates in conditions of rough price stability. The UK Retail Prices Index.

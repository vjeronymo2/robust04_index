			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 402(o) of the Act stipulates that NPDES permits may not be reissued to contain effluent limitations that are less stringent than comparable water quality standards and technology based effluent limitations in the previous permit. EPA has determined that this general permit complies with these anti-backsliding provisions of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. Technology-Based Limitations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mechanical Operations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CWA requires industries to apply treatment technology representing BAT that is economically achievable. The BAT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements specify the use of settling ponds plus total recirculation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process wastewater as the selected treatment technology. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulation does allow the discharge of incidental waters (including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waters that enter a mine through precipitation, snow melt, drainage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water, ground water infiltration and the melting of permafrost) which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have commingled with process waters, provided that these incidental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waters are in excess of the make-up water required, are treated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> settling ponds and do not exceed 0.2 ml/l settleable solids prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purpose of this permit, discharged wastewater consists of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incidental waters commingled with process waters used to move the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ore to and through the beneficiation process, water used to aid in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classification, and water used in gravity separation. Pursuant to 40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR 440.143, BAT requirements are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The concentration of settleable solids in wastewater discharged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from an open-cut mine plant or a dredge plant site must not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceed an instantaneous maximum of 0.2 ml/l.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. The volume of wastewater which may be discharged from an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> open-cut mine plant or dredge plant site must not exceed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume of infiltration, drainage and mine drainage waters which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in excess of the make-up water required for operation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiation process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These technology-based requirements are specified in Parts II.A.1.a.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and b. of the proposed permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The effect of requirement II.A.2. of the proposed permit is to prohibit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the discharge of any wastewater during periods when new water is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed to enter the plant site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Water Quality Based Limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the BAT effluent limitations, the permit includes effluent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitations which are required to ensure compliance with WQS (Alaska  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations 18 AAC 70). These standards vary with the beneficial use they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are established to protect. In water bodies with more than one designated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficial use, the more restrictive criteria apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The WQS protect most fresh water sources for use in drinking, agriculture,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aquaculture and industrial water supply, contact and secondary recreation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the growth and propagation of fish, shellfish, and other aquatic life  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Alaska Regulations 18 AAC 70.050). All permits being issued in this round  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of permitting must protect for all the above uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has concluded, based on review of the WQS and available sampling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data, that the parameters of turbidity and arsenic must be limited in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the State WQS. Also, the sediment standard must be applied to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharges from operations utilizing the hydraulic removal of overburden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The arsenic, turbidity and sediment limits were established pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 301(b)(1)(C) of the CWA, which requires imposition of ``*&blank;*&blank;* any more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent limitation, including those necessary to meet water quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards, *&blank;*&blank;* or required to implement any applicable water quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard established pursuant to this Act.'' The NPDES regulations, at 40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR 122.44(d), require NPDES permits to include conditions to ``Achieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water quality standards established under section 303 of CWA  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> *&blank;*&blank;*.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Turbidity:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Mechanical and Hydraulic Removal of Overburden According to the WQS, the most restrictive turbidity criteria applies to fresh water sources classified for water contact recreation uses. These criteria (18 AAC 70.020(b)(1)(B)(i)(4)) state that turbidity *&blank;*&blank;* ``Shall not exceed 5 NTU above natural conditions when the natural turbidity is 50 NTU or less; and more than 10% increase in turbidity when the natural condition is more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 50 NTU, not to exceed a maximum increase of 15 NTU.'' The proposed draft permit contains a turbidity limit that would assure compliance with water quality standards under worst case conditions. That is, the turbidity in the effluent must not exceed 5 NTUs above the background turbidity level in the receiving stream. This condition accounts for naturally occurring turbidity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the receiving water and allows the effluent to contain an additional 5 NTUs of turbidity where the receiving water is naturally turbid. The permit condition does not account for those situations where naturally occurring turbidity would allow an increase of up to 15 NTUs, nor does it account for the dilution effects of the receiving stream. The reason for assuming worst  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case conditions is that EPA does not have current site-specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to establish end-of-pipe limitations for each of the permits being processed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although worst case conditions are assumed in the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> draft permit, EPA will consider modifying the NTU limitation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account for the dilution effects of the receiving stream. EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach in setting higher turbidity limitations is dependent upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt of the NOI with information from the permittee or from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alaska Department of Natural Resources (ADNR) acting on behalf  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the permittee demonstrating that the dilution effect of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receiving water justifies a less stringent limit. EPA is operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the assumption that the permit applicant bears the burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of providing information necessary to issue the permit (40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 124.85(a)(1)). Where the applicant does not provide the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site-specific information that would justify a less stringent turbidity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit, the permit issued to a site will contain the turbidity limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed in the draft permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comment Summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on the economic methods for computing compensable values generally took the form of question or dialogue. There was some dialogue among members of the public and NOAA presenters concerning the appropriateness of including contingent valuation as a method for estimating nonuse or ``passive'' values. One commenter queried whether trustees could do inexpensive contingent valuation surveys for smaller spills. Another participant wondered how the trustees would respond to a situation where a contingent valuation study used to measure total compensable value resulted in damages less than necessary for restoration. Conversely, the commenter queried how the rule would guide the trustee for whom a contingent valuation survey resulted in total compensable values of 100 million dollars when habitat replacement would result in damages of 100 thousand dollars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Habitat replacement was the subject of significant interest as commenters inquired whether it was a compensable values methodology or a restoration methodology. One commenter recommended NOAA provide a more clear explanation of the habitat replacement method in the rule and distinguish between habitat replacement and acquisition of the equivalent. In addition, it was suggested that NOAA clearly identify the possible double counting issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested better guidance be made available on the ``benefits transfer'' methodology. Of particular concern was the situation where baseline studies failed to be reliable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lastly, the question of whether trustees should apply ``offsets'' when calculating damages was a topic of extensive discussion. Several commenters felt that in some circumstances a discharge of oil will cause an improvement in conditions for some natural resources or increase the services of other natural resources. These commenters felt that the responsible party should receive a positive offset against the injury to other natural resources or loss of their services. The ``offset'' concept was viewed by some commenters as particularly appropriate for direct uses vis a vis passive uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Specific questions on which NOAA is seeking comment:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. What should be the role, if any, of the requirements for site-specific CV studies measuring passive use value in determining whether the quality of a CV study is adequate for use in benefits transfer? How would the extent of the market be determined for benefits transfer using CV studies? Should the conditions be different for valuing direct use losses and for valuing passive use losses?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Government expenditures (per unit of services injured) have been suggested as a proxy for the value of those services lost as a result of an incident. Should the OPA rule suggest that government expenditures may be used as a proxy for the value of a resource? Under what circumstances would use of this method be appropriate? For example, should the trustee be directed to consider whether the following two conditions be met in determining appropriateness of the method: changes in the quality/quantity of the injured resources can be related to the (change in) level of government expenditures; the government programs for which expenditures have been accounted are the major cause of the changes in the quality/quantity of the affected resource?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed OPA rule specifies that the trustee is to use the U.S. Treasury rate to discount for all three categories of damages: restoration costs, interim lost value, and damage assessment costs. Following the guidance in OMB Circular A&hyph;94 (for cost-effectiveness analysis and for federal leasing), nominal interest rates are to be used with damages in nominal terms (for example, past costs) and real rates (with an adjustment based on the Administration's prediction for future inflation published in the President's budget) are to be used for damages in real terms. ``Nominal terms'' refers to calculations expressed in the dollars of the year in which the damages accrued; ``real terms'' refers to damages expressed in dollars of a base year (such as the year in which the claim is presented).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For restoration costs, what if the return on accounts available to the trustee(s) for placement of recovered funds is lower than the U.S. Treasury rate, so that the present discounted value of future restoration costs will not support the full restoration project?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The proposed OPA rule provides that the trustee must document the method used to calibrate hypothetical willingness to pay to actual willingness to pay. In the absence of such documentation, the trustee must divide by two. This calibration procedure is to ``correct'' for the combined effects of two countervailing potential biases: the mandated elicitation of willingness to pay (WTP) measures may understate the correct measure of damages [willingness to accept], whereas the elicitation of hypothetical WTP in contingent valuation studies may overstate ``true'' WTP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Is calibration appropriate? If so, is the proposed default calibration factor appropriate?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. On what basis could ``calibration'' factors be developed for individual cases?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. If reliable calibration of hypothetical to actual WTP is not feasible, would it be reasonable to rely on unadjusted WTP results of CV studies as a valid measure of nonuse values/use values?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The proposed OPA rule states that two independent ``scope'' tests are to be conducted, showing significant changes in respondents' WTP in response to variations in the scope of injuries (from the injury scenario to be proved in the case), unless the trustee(s) can show creation of two alternate scenarios to the base case is infeasible due to considerations of cost or lack of plausibility of scenarios. The tests are to be conducted with an additional sample for each additional scenario, (a ``split sample'' test). Procedures are outlined for limiting the differences in scope between the base case and alternative scenarios.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

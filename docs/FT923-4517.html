			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Ferry order for Tyne yard SWAN HUNTER, the Tyneside shipbuilder, announced yesterday that it had won an order worth almost Pounds 1.4m for a new cross-Tyne ferry. The 200-tonne vessel's size is modest by the standards of the warships Swan Hunter is known for, but its clinching of the deal signals the company's entry into the small ships market where it hopes to win further work. Swan Hunter Engineering, part of the Wallsend-based group, overcame stiff competition from six UK yards and one in Germany. It will be the smallest vessel to be built by the company since privatisation in 1986. The Tyne ferry will be among the first to incorporate safety measures developed by the Department of Transport following the sinking of the Marchioness on the Thames in London in 1989. Fifty-one people died in that incident. The contract, placed by the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive, will provide work for 40 men for eight months at Swan Hunter. Work starts next month but will not stave off job losses.</p>

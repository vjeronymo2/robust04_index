			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: All-round growth at ICI but still below target Mr Ronnie Hampel, ICI's chief executive and chairman-designate, yesterday proudly boasted that every division had reported higher operating profits. Nevertheless, the overall performance remained well short of an acceptable target, he said. The most profitable division was industrial chemicals where trading profits rose from Pounds 59m to Pounds 109m, on lower sales of Pounds 1.87bn (Pounds 1.89bn). The fall in turnover followed the sale of the polypropylene business to BASF, the German chemicals group. Taking this into account sales volumes were up 5 per cent. Mr Hampel said strong demand for polyester fibres and plastic bottles had boosted demand for PTA and PET. However, pricing of Klea 134a, the CFC-substitute, remained a problem in Japan, although sales growth was excellent, said Mr Alan Spall, finance director. The company was selling its Dollars 100m (Pounds 64.5m) US polyols business to a Canadian company. The profit from the disposal would be included in third quarter results. Trading profits at the paints business rose from Pounds 49m to Pounds 52m on sales down at Pounds 848m (Pounds 856m). Sales volumes were up 6 per cent but the decorative paint sector remained subdued, said Mr Hampel. The materials division reported trading profits up from Pounds 16m to Pounds 47m on sales up at Pounds 856m (Pounds 723m). Turnover was boosted by the acquisition of Du Pont's acrylics side, while profits were helped by the sale of the lossmaking fibres business. Overall, volumes were up by 11 per cent, but margins were under pressure from rising raw material costs. Prices of polyurethanes also remained under pressure. Trading profits at the explosives division were Pounds 30m (Pounds 19m) on sales of Pounds 386m (Pounds 318m) including a Pounds 65m contribution from AECI Explosives, the 51 per cent owned South African subsidiary. The regional business contributed trading profits up from Pounds 28m to Pounds 35m on turnover of Pounds 702m (Pounds 690m). The economic recovery in Australia and reduced losses in Argentina helped lift the results.</p>

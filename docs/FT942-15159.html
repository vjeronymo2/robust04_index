			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Banks weak Banking stocks were in a market backwater as bearish stories dampened sentiment. The main pressure focused on HSBC whose shares fell 15 to 781p. The selling of the leading far eastern bank was initially prompted by comment on the resignation of four senior executives from Midland Global Markets, the treasury and capital markets arm. Dealers added that one of the Sunday newspapers was preparing a feature on losses in fixed income departments as bond dealers were caught unawares by the recent hike in US interest rates and subsequent slide in bonds. Midland Global is considered the leading bond player among clearing banks. NatWest Securities, also suspected of suffering because of bond losses, dropped 3 to 474p. Talk of an imminent interest rate cut boosted the regional electricity companies, with good advances also being made by the generators. Strong performances came from London, which jumped 21 to 621p, South West 20 to 645p and Norweb 23 to 673p. Eastern, which announced after the market had closed that it had purchased 250,000 of its shares at 648p, added 3 1/2 to 647 1/2 p. NatWest was recommending the generators after their recent underperformance. PowerGen moved up 12 to 495p and National Power 13 to 443p, while Scottish Hydro, up 12 at 364p, was said to be favoured by UBS. Water stocks were mixed in low volume. A stock overhang depressed Northumbrian, the shares coming off 12 to 623p. There was good demand, however, for North West, ahead 6 at 517p. The pressure on Vodafone continued, underpinned by competition fears and US selling. The shares slipped a half-penny lower to 517p in a perky telecoms sector. Cable and Wireless was the best performer, gaining 17 to 469p as the group announced a joint venture in China. BT added 3 1/2 to 390 1/2 p. BAT Industries fell 6 1/2 to 443 1/2 p as it was announced that its US insurance subsidiary Farmers estimated that their range of probable losses from the Northridge earthquake was between Dollars 600m and Dollars 800m before any recoveries from reinsurance arrangements, against original expectations of around Dollars 600m. Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo was weak in early trading as US investment bank Lehman Brothers told clients one of the leading US health maintenance organisations (HMO) was to use a new ulcer eradication treatment. This would hit ulcer depressant treatments Zantac, Glaxo's leading product, and Astra's Lose. Glaxo shares were off 6 at worst, but ended the day 7 better at 575p after the company announced that its Japanese subsidiary had begun marketing Zofran, its anti-nausea drug for cancer patients. News and financial information group Reuters Holdings performed well on its last day as the heavyweight stock in the Footsie. The shares lifted 19 to 1993p on turnover of 1.8m. On Monday morning a four-for-one share split comes into effect. Exploration and production company Lasmo improved 8 to 132p as it was announced that Mr Joe Derby, the chief executive, had put his money behind the company and bought 10,000 shares at 123p each. Aran Energy was one of the most heavily traded stocks in the market. The shares rose 2 1/4 or 10 per cent to 26 3/4 on turnover of 12m. Clyde Petroleum improved 2 to 35p as it was confirmed that PDFM, the investment institution, had bought 12m shares, boosting its stake to 18.8 per cent. Hotel group Forte fell back following an overall poor reception to the group's figures on Thursday. The shares closed 8 off at 234p on 5.3m traded. Stadium owner Wembley reported heavy losses, although anticipation of these saw the shares rise 1 1/2 to 12p. Interest rate sentiment also boosted several of the larger stores stocks. Boots advanced 7 to 546p, Sears 4 to 126 1/2 p, Kingfisher 9 to 606p and Marks and Spencer 4 1/2 to 426 1/2 p. Brewing and retail group Whitbread was lifted by a recommendation from Lehman Brothers, the shares advancing 7 to 555p. News that new car demand in western Europe has began to show some recovery boosted stocks in the motors sector. Shares in GKN recently supported by broker's recommendations jumped another 15 to 594p, while BBA advanced 5 1/2 to 226p. Lucas Industries moved 7 ahead to 211p as turnover rose to 5.9m; and T&amp;N raced 11 ahead to 251p with Hoare Govett also reported to have recommended the shares. Inchcape jumped 25 to 563p after a Robert Fleming recommendation. British Steel ended a buoyant week by closing at a five-year high as a clutch of brokers' recommendations continued to encourage active buying. The shares firmed 2 3/4 to 155 1/4 p, as turnover soared to 14m.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: 3i cuts its involvement in US venture market 3I, the venture capital group which is preparing for a stock market flotation later this year, has withdrawn from active involvement in the US venture capital market because of poor returns. The company, which is the largest venture capital company in the UK, has stopped making later-stage investments in the US. It will provide follow-on finance to the 40 companies in its Dollars 70m (Pounds 38m) US portfolio but will not make any new investments. The move follows the announcement in the middle of 1991 of its decision to spin off 3i Ventures, its US start-up and seed capital investment company. 3i transferred its early-stage portfolio to Aspen Venture Partners, a new venture management company in which it was sole general partner. 3i said then that it would provide extra funds to Aspen Ventures to allow it to make follow-on investments taking the total capitalisation of the portfolio to Dollars 150m, made up of investments in about 80 companies. 'We won't lose money over there but the returns won't be as good as we would have wished,' said Mr Neil Cross, managing director of international investments. 'We did not have a huge business in the US but the recession went on and on. 'The decision to de-emphasise the US was part of the continuing process of looking at all our activities.' 3i had not made a secret of its decision, said Mr Cross. Its 1991 annual report said it planned to limit the resources provided to US investment capital and reduce its involvement in the early-stage, high-technology market. But the scale of its withdrawal from the US market has not been widely appreciated in the UK. 3i has always emphasised the international nature of its activities and two years ago formed a joint venture with Industrial Bank of Japan to provide funds to small and medium-sized Japanese companies. The Japanese project is still at an early stage but is going well, Mr Cross said. It has made investments in 60 companies. The emphasis of 3i's overseas activities is now in continental Europe. It has operations in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and, through associate companies, in the Netherlands and Portugal. New US investments amounted to Pounds 28m in the year ended March 1991. All overseas investments were Pounds 93m out of total new investments of Pounds 382m.</p>

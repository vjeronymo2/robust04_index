			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: PHARMACY OPERATOR PLANS 'POISON PILL' DEFENSE  </P> <P> Syncor International Corp., a Chatsworth operator of high-tech pharmacy service  centers, said it adopted a shareholder rights plan -- a common takeover defense  often referred to as a "poison pill." The company said the plan is designed to  ensure that its stockholders get a fair price for their shares should the  company be the target of a hostile takeover attempt. But it said the move was  not in response to any specific takeover threat.  </P> <P> Gene McGrevin, Syncor's president and chief executive officer, said under the  plan, shareholders would receive one "right" for each share owned. If a party  acquires 20% or more of Syncor's shares without the consent of the company's  board of directors, each right would give the holder the option to buy a Syncor  share at half its market price.  </P> <P> In September, Syncor received an unsolicited, $77-million buyout bid from the  Lisle, Ill.-based investment banking firm Van Kampen Merritt, which said it  made the offer on behalf of a client identified only as OSW Funding. Syncor  rejected the bid, which expired a few days after it was offered. ICN  Pharmaceuticals of Costa Mesa, which owns 8% of Syncor's stock, has also been  rumored as a possible suitor.  </P></p>

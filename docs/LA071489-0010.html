			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Hundreds of striking union miners were arrested for blocking a road to a  non-union mine in West Virginia, and rock-throwing pickets in Kentucky injured  the president of a coal company. Coal officials criticized Gov. Gaston Caperton  and state police, charging they had let strikers in West Virginia get out of  hand. "There is a total state of chaos," said A.T. Massey Coal Co. spokeswoman  Deborah Herndon. In Prenter, W. Va., state police arrested 277 of the 500  strikers who blocked the road leading to the non-union Elk Run Coal Co. Elk Run  is a subsidiary of A.T. Massey. Rocks were thrown at another A.T. Massey  subsidiary, Sidney Coal Co. in Sidney, Ky., and company president Charles  Snavely was hit in the face with a rock. The strike began April 5 when 1,900  United Mine Workers members walked out in a contract dispute with Pittston Coal  Group.  </P></p>

Ocampo's designation to the powerful finance  portfolio has been floated around for quite sometime.  Apparently, Malacanang has received favorable feedbacks on him,  especially from the business community.    The finance post was vacated in May 1993 when the nomination  of then Finance Secretary Ramon del Rosario Jr. was rejected by  the Commission on Appointments [CA]. Leung, a competent  technical man who shuns publicly, was not keen on being named  the permanent finance secretary, a Malacanang source said.    Leung has been an old hand in the finance department having  served as assistant finance secretary during the Aquino  administration.    President Ramos scouted for candidates for the finance  portfolio from the private sector. But his efforts were  unsuccessful because of the sad fate of Del Rosario at the hands  of the CA.    The president appointed Leung to two important positions --  as president of the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation  (PDIC) and chairman of the Central Bank board of liquidators  effective 1 February 1994.    The Board of Liquidators has the task of disposing of the  assets and liabilities of the old Central Bank. The president  also designated DBP Vice Chairman Alfredo Antonio as officer in  charge of the DBP, effective 1 February, said Ocampo.</p>

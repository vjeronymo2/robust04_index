			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Gardening: In praise of the common camellia - The development of a popular flowering shrub IN THE great acid-soil gardens of Britain, camellias usually are grown side by side with rhododendrons, and these two families of flowering shrubs often are spoken of together; but their differences are at least as notable as their similarities. Both share a dislike for alkaline soils (which, in Britain, means for limestone and chalk). There are many more wild species of rhododendron than of camellia and a great many of the rhododendrons have been brought into cultivation, which means there is a much greater range of types, flower colours and shapes, and foliage types from which to choose. From a practical point of view, only five camellia species and their hybrids are available at all readily, and their flower colours range from white and palest pink to deep crimson, with various combinations of these. Yellow exists in the family and might one day be available to gardeners, perhaps maybe with intermediate colours such as orange and apricot, but this still seems a long way off. Camellias tolerate drought much better than most rhododendrons, which can suffer severely in dry summers when camellias, growing side by side with them, continue to look green and content. Their excellent foliage is one of their best qualities. By far the most common camellias in Britain are descended directly from C. japonica and hybrids between it and C. saluenensis; these common camellias are known collectively as C. williamsii. Japonica was introduced as long ago as 1739 although its varieties long were grown almost exclusively under glass (or, at least, with winter protection) as all were believed to be tender. The williamsii hybrids have never suffered from this mistake for they have been made only since the 1930s, and for 20 years after that they were grown mainly by specialists. But once they became available widely, they soared in popularity. One of the first of the williamsii camellias to appear was named Donation and today, I believe, it has the largest sales of any camellia. All these hybrids differ from the old japonica varieties in having narrower leaves, more slender stems and the ability either to drop their faded flowers or to allow them to be brushed off easily, leaving the bush looking clean and tidy. A great deal of present-day camellia breeding is centred on this group of hybrids. The williamsii varieties have another advantage that is not often mentioned. They are more tolerant of long days and short nights than the japonicas and so are likely to flower well even in the more northerly parts of Scotland. because they continue to produce flower buds even when the nights are very short and the days very long. Camellia reticulator has the largest flowers of any species and Captain Rawes has semi-double flowers which are even more spectacular. But this wonderful plant is seen much too rarely except in the gardens of specialists, and is available from only a few nurseries such as Hilliers at Ampfield, near Romsey, Hampshire; Trewidden Estate, Trewidden Gardens, Penzance, Cornwall; and James Trehane and Sons, Stapehill Road, Hampreston, Wimborne, Dorset. The reasons for this scarcity are that it is a little tender and can occupy a lot of space - up to tree size in the mild Cornish gardens. There is also a hybrid between C. reticulator, Captain Rawes and williamsii, named Leonard Messell. It also has very large, rose-pink flowers and is fairly hardy. It is certainly easier to buy and can sometimes be picked up in garden centres. Another species is sasanqua, which has the useful habit of flowering in October and November. The plant is hardy but its varieties need to be given a sheltered place or grown in a conservatory (which need not be heated). The flowers of the wild plant are pink and white like large, single dog roses, but there are garden varieties which give a selection of colours from white to deep rose. All are said to tolerate lime better than other camellias. This is another species which must be sought from specialist nurseries, such as Trehane and Trewidden. An attractive and unusual camellia with a very long flowering season is Cornish Snow. It is a hybrid between saluenensis and a species named cuspidata, and it has innumerable small, single white flowers which go on and on. Even today, after all the intensive breeding of the past 40 years, there are still more varieties and a greater range of flower colours and forms among the japonica varieties than in any other race. But the williamsii varieties are overhauling them fast as a great range of flower shapes and colours is produced.</p>

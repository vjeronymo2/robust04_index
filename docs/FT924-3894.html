			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian orange boost THE 1992-93 orange harvest in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo should be 18 per cent higher than last season at 289.6m boxes, 6 per cent above previous expectations, according to an industry study. Sao Paulo accounts for 98 per cent of Brazil's orange output. The increase in Brazilian production and a 34 per cent jump in Florida output are primarily responsible for the lowest juice prices in 16 years, said Mr Ademerval Garcia, president of the Brazilian Association of Citrus Exporters. Brazil's higher yield results mainly from high rainfall.</p>

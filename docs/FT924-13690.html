			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Westinghouse hit by Dollars 155m provision WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate, turned in third-quarter net income of Dollars 14m, or zero cents a share, on essentially flat revenues of Dollars 3.4bn, reflecting a sharp drop in order rates and a big provision largely for losses related to an investment in Phar-Mor. The Dollars 155m pre-tax third-quarter provision included Dollars 100m for the Phar-Mor investment, and covered increased credit reserves and valuation allowances at Westinghouse Financial Services. A year earlier, Westinghouse had a third-quarter net loss of Dollars 1.48bn, or Dollars 4.86 a share, including charges of Dollars 1.68bn. Analysts had expected third-quarter earnings to fall below second-quarter levels of 35 cents a share, but the erosion was greater than expected. Westinghouse continues to suffer from the impact of the weak US economy on many of its sectors, but its financial services operations have been its greatest weakness.</p>

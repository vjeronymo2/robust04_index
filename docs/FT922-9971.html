			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Political battle for Midland hots up LLOYDS BANK'S political advisers have been taking advice from Mr Keith Hampson, the Conservative MP with close links to the President of the Board of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine, in its battle with Hongkong Bank to take control of Midland, it was disclosed yesterday. Mr Hampson's role will be seen in the City of London as important since the struggle for control of Midland is increasingly being played in the political arena. Mr Heseltine has the central role in deciding whether Lloyds' or Hongkong Bank's plans to acquire Midland should be scrutinised by the UK competition authority, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Mr Hampson has for several years been on a retainership with GJW, the firm of political lobbyists hired by Lloyds. He said yesterday that Mr Andrew Gifford, GJW's founder, had spoken to him about the bid. But Mr Hampson said he would not describe himself as an adviser to Lloyds. 'I haven't had a cheque from GJW since last summer', he said. Mr Hampson, a co-manager of Mr Heseltine's unsuccessful campaign to become leader of the Conservative Party in 1990, will be used as a 'sounding board' by Lloyds, a Lloyds adviser said, though it is unlikely he will do any high profile lobbying for Lloyds. Lloyds is also employing Mr Tony Carlisle, of public relations firm Dewe Rogerson, who has close links with the Treasury, having worked on most of the UK government's big privatisations. Meanwhile, Hongkong Bank has taken on Sir Tim Bell, the public relations adviser who worked for Mrs Margaret Thatcher, and his firm Lowe Bell, as a political lobbyist. It is also employing Mr Francis Maude, the former treasury minister, as an adviser to its chairman, Mr William Purves. Even Midland has taken on a politician lobbying firm, Ian Greer Associates. The first important political decision to be made in the battle for Midland is whether DG4, the European Community competition authority in Brussels, has jurisdiction over Hongkong Bank's offer.

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Frustrated or furious? Charterline will answer all queries FURIOUS with the local council? Wild about your water bill? Hopping mad with a hospital? Livid with the taxman? Help could soon be only a telephone call away according to the government, which yesterday put a face - or a voice - behind Mr John Major's cherished Citizen's Charter. Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, announced details of Charterline, a new telephone helpline 'designed to help people who find it daunting or frustrating to get information from large bureaucracies'. The announcement came at the end of the third six-monthly Downing Street seminar on the charter, intended to ensure that the impetus behind the initiative is not lost. Once Charterline goes nationwide from the end of the year, the full resources of the Citizen's Charter will be at the disposal of the ordinary citizen - and all for the price of a local telephone call. A call to Charterline will give access to details of the complaints procedures of more than 1,400 public organisations, from British Rail to Basildon district council, from the Inland Revenue to the Apple and Pear Development Council. The well-groomed operators - to be known as Customer Service Representatives  -will tell you what standards of service you are entitled to and how to get re-dress when these are not met. CSRs will be under instructions to answer the phone in four rings. They should be sympathetic but never give an opinion on a public service. And they must never lose their tempers. And if you cannot find satisfaction through the usual channels, Charterline will tell you which ombudsman to approach. If there is no ombudsman, there will be someone else who can take up your case, such as the independent adjudicator announced yesterday to deal with complaints about the Inland Revenue. Apart from providing useful information for complaints, Charterline will allow Mr Waldegrave to see those public services which do not make the grade. They will be 'helped' to upgrade their customer handling procedures and perhaps even install their own helplines. A pilot study, which will be contracted out to a private telephone services operator, is to be launched in May. It will cover Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, three counties which research indicates are a microcosm of the UK. Tax watchdog, Page 10</p>

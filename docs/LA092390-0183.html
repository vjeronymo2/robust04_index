			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAVIGATING A FRIENDSHIP;  </P> <P> CHLOE AND OLIVIA BY BELL GALE CHEVIGNY (GROVE WEIDENFELD: $18.95; 355 PP.)  </P> <P> Friendship. It's hardly a modern invention. For centuries, women have enjoyed  the luxury of this special human attachment. While they may have bonded in town  squares and drawing rooms, friendships between women were frowned upon in  literature. In her 1929 feminist work, "A Room of One's Own," Virginia Woolf  pondered the shock waves such a literary friendship might cause: " 'Chloe liked  Olivia.' Do not start. Do not blush. Let us admit in the privacy of our own  society that these things sometimes happen. Sometimes women do like women."  </P> <P> Bell Gale Chevigny borrows the title of her novel from this literary "what if"  posed by Woolf. "Chloe and Olivia" offers an update on friendship, and  chronicles 14 years in the lives of two complex women living in difficult  times. Just as the hypothetical Chloe and Olivia reflect the mood of their era,  the contemporary Chloe and Olivia mirror the tumultuous '60s and '70s.  </P> <P> Chloe likes Olivia immediately. They meet in Rome in 1961. They're both  graduate students, yet in all other aspects they're complementary opposites, a  contradiction in personalities. Chloe is short, blond and 24 years old. Olivia  is tall, dark and 21. Chloe is from a Mom-Dad-and-three-children family in  Syracuse, N. Y. Olivia was born in Italy. Her father was an American soldier  killed in the war, and her mother was an Italian opera singer who worked with  the underground resistance. Chloe is fiercely independent, while Olivia is  attached to a handsome artist named Karl. "I'm a better painter than I am a  person," he ominously admits to Chloe.  </P> <P> The bond between the women is instantaneous, and as they talk through the  night, the ground rules that will sustain their friendship are established:  "Olivia had told so much, and if Chloe didn't respond in kind, friendship would  be impossible. It was like a law: You had to take your turn."  </P> <P> Following their idyllic months together in Italy, Chloe moves to New York and  begins teaching. Olivia's plans are vague. She impulsively marries Karl while a  stunned Chloe watches in "awe." Karl accepts a teaching assignment in Arizona.  Olivia promises to write.  </P> <P> A year-and-a-half passes, and Olivia visits New York with Hannah, her infant  daughter. Chloe feels anything but maternal and attempts to match Olivia's  show- and-tell with a pet snake: "She's exactly 5 foot 4, like me." Their lives  have veered in opposite directions. The mood is understandably tense. This is  not to be their last crisis. The conflicts in their friendship are as frequent  and as intense as the struggles in their separate lives and in the world around  them.  </P> <P> Olivia returns to her new home in Oregon, where Karl has taken a position with  a museum art school. Thus begins a cross-country friendship, punctuated with  brief visits, sporadic letters and infrequent phone calls. Whether it's on  Chloe's turf in New York (where she involves Olivia in an anti-war  demonstration and a night-on-the-town in Harlem with her social-worker  boyfriend, Gabe) or on the West Coast with Olivia, their hours are packed with  unrestrained dialogue that quickly cuts to the core of their lives. As Olivia  explains to Chloe, "No one knows me better than you. I realize it when I see  you. You go so far back and remember so much, it's sometimes a burden. You know  what I hoped for and you've seen me fail and fail . . . but you hang in. Even  when you're not there."  </P> <P> If only distance was their greatest obstacle! It's a wonder the friendship  survives, considering it must constantly compete with such major outside  distractions as marriage, infidelity, divorce, graduate school, careers, death  of parents, miscarriage, abortion and illness. When the civil-rights struggle,  Vietnam and the women's movement are added to those traumas, there isn't a  whole lot of time for chit-chat. While Chloe wages a personal war on behalf of  her political and social causes, Olivia grapples with an unhappy marriage and  the difficulty of rearing a daughter alone.  </P> <P> Time and the multitude of events that shape the years serve primarily as a  backdrop for the friendship. A professor of literature at the State University  of New York at Purchase, Chevigny effectively uses the passage of time like a  microscope to re-examine important experiences and conversations. An incident  will occur in the present, then immediately the dialogue will flash ahead  several years to a discussion in which Chloe and Olivia look back on that same  moment. The image thus becomes clearer as the characters move farther away.  </P> <P> "Chloe and Olivia" captures the complex give-and-take that is a friendship. The  novel offers a rich glimpse into the reasons why women form these bonds, why  some last and others fail, and why the participants work so hard to sustain  these vital connections.  </P> <P> When I finished the story of Chloe and Olivia, I was compelled to put aside my  chores and nagging deadlines, pour myself a cup of tea, sink into a comfortable  chair, pick up the phone and leave a message on the answering machine of my  "Chloe," about 2,596 miles away.  </P></p>

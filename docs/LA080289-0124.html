			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> RECALL AGAINST FOUNTAIN VALLEY COUNCILMAN QUALIFIES FOR BALLOT  </P> <P> The campaign to recall Fountain Valley City Councilman Fred Voss, convicted in  March of soliciting sex, has succeeded in qualifying for the November ballot,  the city clerk said today.  </P> <P> The county registrar's office has verified at least 6,174 signatures on recall  petitions, which contained 7,028 signatures, said City Clerk J. E. de Sevren  Jacquet.  </P> <P> The petition is expected to be certified by the registrar, and Jacquet will  present it to the City Council at a special meeting at 12:15 p.m. Friday. The  council is expected to order that the recall be placed on the November ballot,  Jacquet said.  </P> <P> Robert Moss, a spokesman for the Fred Voss Recall Committee, said today, "We  were expecting it, but it's still good news to hear that we did it."  </P> <P> The group of Fountain Valley residents launched the recall drive against Voss,  52, after he was convicted of trying to solicit sex from a Santa Ana  policewoman posing as a prostitute. Voss stepped down as mayor but has  continued as a councilman.  </P> <P> More than 75 volunteers worked for weeks to obtain the needed signatures.  </P> <P> Jacquet said at least 6,154 signatures -- 20% of the registered voters in the  city -- were required to qualify the petition for the ballot.  </P> <P> Voss, who could not be reached for comment, has decided to fight the recall and  has formed a No on Recall of Fred Voss Committee to raise funds.  </P></p>

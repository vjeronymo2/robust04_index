			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Arts: Time at Easter for the agnostics - Radio EASTER Sunday gave the agnostics a run as well as the Christians. Radio 1's A Damn Good Lie examined the truth of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection, but the programme, presented by The Man Ezeke, was so elementarily Christian, songs and all, that doubters would remain doubters and believers believers, leaving us where we were. Radio 4 gave Easter Enigma, a more serious debate chaired by a dubious Ludovic Kennedy, in which such contentious figures as the Bishop of Durham and Don Cupitt examined the Easter story from a realistic angle. And on BBC 1, for TV addicts, Joan Bakewell grilled some C of E parsons who showed little respect for the Nicene Creed. Radio 4's Monday play, Are Friends Electric? by Lesley Davies, was a still life of a 15-year-old boy's death from cystic fibrosis, presented not to celebrate Easter Monday but to remind us that this was Cystic Fibrosis Week. Ben is ill throughout, and Richard Pearce's ghastly coughs and spits are a horrid part of his effective playing. As he lies in bed, he plays a computer game with an imaginary Gene, his enemy, and scenes from his life are called up. His two siblings Chas and Alex also have CF, as they call it; and if this seems a dramatic exaggeration, the dreadful fact is that the play is based on an actual case. There is indeed dramatic exaggeration in some of the talk, but the situation can take it. John Rowe and Jennie Linden are Ben's patient father and impatient mother, and Peter Whitman the antagonistic Gene, that Ben conquers in his last supreme effort. We end at Ben's funeral, attended by 'all these people we didn't know about,' symbols of the complete life Ben lived in his 15 years. The play was touchingly directed by Cherry Cookson, and one must hope it will have met its object. Still with drama, a six-part adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's Decline and Fall plays at 12.35 on Wednesdays. The adaptation by Jeremy Frost stays close to the novel, though pacing through it fairly fast. By lunchtime this week, a rather mature Paul Pennyfeather (Alistair McGowan) had been sent down, deprived of his inheritance, begun work at Llanabba Castle, and got drunk with Captain Grimes (Jim Broadbent). Howard Barker's A Hard Heart was repeated on Tuesday on Radio 3. I wrote about it a month ago, but I mention it now because Radio 3 is only to have one play a week after the Proms. This seems to me idiotic, for this is where the best of the new drama is usually presented or repeated, and a new Radio 3 drama editor, Jeremy Howe, has only lately been appointed. In the Radio Authority's complaints bulletin for January to March, only seven complaints out of 40 are based on political bias - four from the Andrew Neil programme on LBC, only one of them upheld. (Two other biases dealt with hunting and with fighting in Israel.) This was a fair record in the quarter before the election. Forty programming complaints were sorted under five heads - bias, accuracy, taste and broken undertakings, together with six miscellaneous. Nine altogether were upheld by the Authority, whose reports, and subsequent reference to the stations concerned, seem notably sensible - especially in view of the frivolity of some of the complaints, such as dislike of music policy or jokes that 'might offend lesbians'. The advertising complaints tend to be pretty trivial. If a phrase like 'Columbus discovered America' offends American Indians, they must have been offended ages before North West Airlines got hold of it. Too many complaints are better than too few, though - better for listeners, that is, even if they are agony for the Authority.</p>

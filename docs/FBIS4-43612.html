			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, June 19 (A.A.) -- President Suleyman  Demirel sent a letter to his Iranian counterpart  Hashemi-Rafsanjani and Greek counterpart Konstandinos Karamanlis  on prevention of the separatist terrorist PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] organization's activities in their countries, it was  reported on Sunday [19 June].    Presidential Press Center, in a written statement, said  Demirel sent a letter to Rafsanjani on May 31 and expressed  pleasure on Turkish-Iranian cooperation against terrorism.    Demirel said joint struggle on the issue is for the benefit  of the two countries `we call for Iran to take necessary  measures against the PKK terrorists who were reported to be  existing in Iran.'    The Press Center said Rafsanjani replied the letter by  sending a message with Iranian Interior Minister 'Ali Mohammad  Besharati.    The message said Turkish-Iranian cooperation on security is  contributing to the two country relations adding that Iran is  determined to take measures against PKK.    The statement also said Demirel had sent a letter to  Karamanlis on June 2 saying that necessary measures should be  taken against the separatist terrorist organization.    Demirel said France and Germany banned the organization's  activities and the other countries are closely following the  activities `however' he added `we learned that PKK has opened a  bureau in Athens under another name and terrorists caught in  Turkey said they were trained in camps in Greece.'    The statement reported Demirel as saying `Turkish-Greek  relations would be destroyed if these come true.'    Karamanlis in reply said Greece did not allow PKK's  terrorist  activities on its territory adding that it seriously condemned  terrorism to continue good neighboring [as received] relations.    The Foreign Ministry earlier summoned the Greek ambassador  and asked for information from Athens on confessions made by a  number of PKK members.    The terrorists, during their interrogation said that they  received training in Greece.    Athens had denied the statements of terrorists.</p>

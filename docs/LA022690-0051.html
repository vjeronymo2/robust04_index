			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MARTIN FINED $40,000 BUT WINS  </P> <P> NASCAR handed out the biggest fine in stock car history Sunday night when Mark  Martin's Ford Thunderbird was found to have an illegal engine part three hours  after it won the Pontiac 400 at the Richmond (Va.) International Raceway.  </P> <P> The team was fined $40,000 and 46 points in the standings when a spacer between  the carburetor and intake manifold was found to be a half-inch too tall. NASCAR  rules limit the height of the spacer to two inches. Martin's was 2 1/2 inches.  </P> <P> "We don't know if it's an advantage or not," said Winston Cup Competition  Director Dick Beaty. "The rule is to make sure the carburetor and air filter  fit under the hood."  </P> <P> Martin was allowed to keep the victory, but will take home only $19,150 of his  $59,150 earnings.  </P> <P> He left the raceway before learning his car had flunked technical inspection.  </P> <P> Martin had won the race when his crew changed just the right-side tires of his  Ford Thunderbird with 15 laps left.  </P> <P> "There was four choices: two tires on the left, two tires on the right, four  tires or stay out," Martin said. "The guys made the right choice."  </P> <P> Other challengers changed all four tires.  </P> <P> The move got Martin out of the pits first, and he pulled away from Dale  Earnhardt over the final 15 laps to win the 400-lap event.  </P> <P> The biggest previous fine came in 1983, when Richard Petty was assessed $35,000  after his winning car at Charlotte, N.C., was found to have an oversized engine  and illegal tires.  </P> <P> Geoff Brabham, Chip Robinson and Bob Earl combined to win the attrition-filled  Miami Grand Prix, racing to a one-lap victory in a Nissan prototype.  </P> <P> Brabham and Robinson won at Miami for the second consecutive time, with  Brabham, who started from the pole for the fourth straight year, winning on the  downtown street circuit for the third time in four years.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> SINGER RECALLS FIGHT FOR SOBRIETY  </P> <P> Singer Freddy Fender says he doubts the death of one of his band members is  drug-related but says the tragedy stirred memories of his own struggle with  drugs and alcohol.  </P> <P> Fender, 52, said Wednesday that he suffered a deep loss in the death of bass  guitarist Johnny Garcia, who collapsed and died Sunday.  </P> <P> The cause of death is under investigation.  </P> <P> "I am a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, and it's my commitment to other  drug addicts and other drunks to help them, because it's going to help me. . .  . If there is any person that is anti-drugs and anti-booze, it's me," Fender  said.  </P> <P> Fender, best known for his country western hit "Wasted Days and Wasted Nights,"  saw his career plummet when he drank heavily and used drugs. Since entering a  treatment center in 1985, he has tried to rebuild his career.  </P> <P> He knows exactly how long he's been sober: "Four years, six months and nine  days."  </P></p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Shevardnadze risks all for more powers MR Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader and former Soviet foreign minister, yesterday took the last big political gamble of his career by announcing he was resigning as Georgia's head of state. His decision, announced after a former ally accused him of dictatorial ambitions for seeking emergency powers to save Georgia from civil war, was rejected unanimously by parliament. Although Mr Shevardnadze responded by telling parliament his decision was final, the move appeared to be a high-risk gamble to clear obstacles to his policies. He later told a rally of supporters he would return if parliament was suspended for three months and he was given the emergency powers he wanted. If his gamble fails, Georgia could be plunged into even greater chaos. 'Indeed, it would seem that no emergency situation can save Georgia, if every time you want to disarm some kind of illegal bandit formation, you found it has powerful protectors,' he said, in a possible reference to Mr Jaba Joseliani, who made the accusations against him. It was Mr Joseliani, one of Georgia's freelance warlords, who helped him return to power after overthrowing the former president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia. The silver-haired Mr Shevardnadze, 65, also appeared to seize on the opportunity to shake off once and for all his mantle as a former communist party boss. Since his return, he has gradually consolidated power in his own hands, becoming prime minister as well as head of state and parliamentary speaker. With even impartial observers suggesting that he was returning to the ways he was used to in running Georgia as communist chief, Mr Shevardnadze has said that the crisis facing the newly-independent republic required emergency measures. The problems have included attempts by Mr Gamsakhurdia, to fight his way back to power with military force, separatism in Abhazia and a collapsing economy. For unlike the present leader of neighbouring Azerbaijan, Mr Geidar Aliyev, another former communist who returned to power by overthrowing an inexperienced nationalist, Mr Shevardnadze prides himself on being a genuine convert to democracy. 'When they slander me by saying I want to work with communist methods and by the laws of the communist regime, I will not bear it,' he said. Yesterday's announcement was as emotional as his resignation as President Mikhail Gorbachev's foreign minister in December 1990. Then he caused widespread consternation with a warning of impending dictatorship in Moscow.</p>

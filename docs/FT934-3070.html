			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Technology: Worldly wise in half a second - Trafalgar House has united its staff with an electronic global office Companies have to move quickly to stay profitable. They also need to be as international as their clients. It was these pressures which spurred UK-based Trafalgar House Engineering to streamline its world operations by building 'electronic corridors' - high-speed computer networks - to link employees in 38 offices across 12 countries. Since September, all the company's sites have been operating as one global office. As a result, Trafalgar House is able to offer its customers shorter working times on new projects - through concurrent or simultaneous engineering (with different stages worked on in parallel rather than in sequence) - and match the worldwide scope of their businesses. The global office system (called Join), which runs on standard computers, gives staff at far-flung sites a versatile set of tools for working together. From an on-screen menu, they can select facsimile, electronic mail, computer-to-computer data transfer or a central database. A number of sites also use videoconferencing. 'The system enables us to exchange information as if we were communicating with someone on another floor of our building,' says Graham Hill, general manager for oil and chemicals at the Melbourne, Australia, office of John Brown Engineers and Constructors, the industrial plant unit of Trafalgar House Engineering. The idea was born two and a half years ago when the company was looking for a way to differentiate itself from competitors. It realised that it could win more business from multinational companies if it could act for them anywhere in the world. It was in a favourable position to do this, because two years ago, after the acquisition of Davy Corporation, the ill-fated engineering contractor, it had 182 sites, some quite small. By contrast, most of its rivals had a small number of very big sites. The problem was that although Trafalgar House Engineering had 25,000 staff in all, the different sites were like individual companies with individual characteristics. The solution was to use information technology to enable staff to work in 'virtual teams' - separated by distance but working as if under one roof. Strong backing came from Ian Robinson, Trafalgar House Engineering's chief executive, and Ted Bavister, then deputy managing directory and since retired. The first hurdle the company faced was that some of the technology it needed did not exist. To fill the gap, it identified a number of suppliers moving in the direction it wanted to go. And it started to develop new products with them. For example, with 3Com, the US computer networking company, it has developed a form of advanced data compression enabling data to be sent through the Join network more quickly and cheaply. Helped by Oracle of the US, it has developed a large relational database that can handle concurrent engineering. Called Engines, it gives all engineers on the Join network access to the latest information on the projects in which they are involved. They can call up word-processed reports and drawings created using computer-aided design (CAD) software. Together with the database, Trafalgar House is using an electronic document management system developed in-house. With this, an engineer in, say, Bangalore, India, does not need a copy of the Cad or word-processing software used in London to view a document created there. 'This approach has saved us a lot of money in software licences,' says Jim Noble, head of IT on the engineering side. The database also makes 24-hour working possible. For example, an engineer in London can check and correct the work of a colleague in Houston using 'redlining' (a form of on-screen annotation) while the engineer in the US is asleep. 'Recently,' says Hill, 'we were doing the designs for a plant in Pakistan. Our client contacted us one day at 4pm saying he wasn't clear about a technical detail. That night, we sent an E-mail message to an expert in Houston asking him to look at the design and annotate it on the system. His comments were waiting for us the following morning and we had an answer back on the Singapore-based client's desk before he got into work.' Other benefits of the database, which has cost Trafalgar House more than Pounds 10m to develop, include: Lower travel costs. Experts anywhere in the world can contribute to a project and are less likely to have to relocate. Reduced project costs. 'Concurrent engineering allows projects to be completed more quickly,' says Noble. 'We managed to shave 20 per cent off the cost of developing one plant.' Fewer mistakes. Join includes an 'expert system' which can automatically follow a set of rules. For example, it can be made to draw supports on every pipe relative to its size and length. This saves time and reduces errors. Closer links with customers. Clients are seeing the benefits of Trafalgar's concurrent database and want it themselves. Time-to-market is critical for Merck, the big US pharmaceuticals group. So it is using the Trafalgar system for concurrent plant development. The database helps it to write the initial specification and check that the project is going according to plan. Another benefit, according to Hill, is that sites which are remote feel closer to the main office in London. The speed of the network helps to maintain the illusion. The Join network responds within half a second, even between London and Melbourne. 'Any longer and users would not feel they were in the same office,' says Noble.</p>

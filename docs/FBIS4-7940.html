			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 7 -- Croatia wants to expand  cooperation and trade relations with Poland in all possible  branches of economy, Croatian Minister of Economic Development  Nadan Vidosevic said in Warsaw on Thursday after the conclusion  of Polish-Croatian talks in the Ministry for Foreign Economic  Relations.    According to the Croatian minister both countries may  cooperate in all fields and in some branches such as shipyard  and petrochemical industries, and tourism, they may compete on  the third markets.    The Polish side hopes for the cooperation in textiles, food  processing, petrochemical and electrochnics industries. Also  the Adriatic will hopefully arouse strong interest for Polish  tourists.    Maciej Lesny from the Polish ministry said that Poland will  soon sign agreements with Croatia on avoiding double taxation  and on protection of mutual investments.    Trade turnover between the two countries have been gradually  going down from 68 million U.S. dollars in 1991 to 62,4 million  dollars in 1993, the decrease caused by Croatian unstable  political situation.</p>

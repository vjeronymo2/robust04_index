			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / NUM is warned of hesitancy on strike DELEGATES at the National Union of Mineworkers' annual conference yesterday voted unanimously to strike if necessary in opposition to the privatisation of British Coal, Diane Summers writes. The move came in spite of warnings from some delegates that miners in their areas would not be prepared to strike over the issue. Mr Peter Heathfield, NUM general secretary, hit back at delegates for declaring they would not take industrial action and said it would undermine the campaign.</p>

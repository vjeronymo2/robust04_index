			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Japan to press EU over vehicle imports - Negotiators want agreement with Brussels revised upwards to reflect market changes Japan will press for an increase in vehicle exports to the European Union this year due to stronger than expected growth in demand. The request will be made when trade negotiators meet for consultations in Brussels today. During the two-day talks, Japanese trade negotiators are expected to request that an agreement to maintain exports of Japanese vehicles to the EU at 984,000 units be revised upwards to reflect market changes. 'The market is expected to grow more than we anticipated in March. The basic policy is to increase exports if the market grows,' an official at the Ministry of Trade and Industry said. Under an agreement reached in 1991, Japan is committed to keeping its vehicle exports to the EU within an agreed level each year until the end of 1999, when the EU automobile market is to be fully liberalised. The level of Japanese vehicle exports to the EU is determined through consultation and depends on an agreed forecast for regional demand. The two sides have also agreed that if demand varies significantly from initial forecasts, the agreed level of exports could be revised. The Japanese authorities agreed in March to keep Japanese exports to the EU this year at 984,000 units on the basis of a forecast for overall market growth of 2 per cent. That would have represented a nearly 18 per cent decline from the level of Japanese vehicle exports to the EU in 1993. However, Miti now expects the EU vehicle market to grow 5-6 per cent this year and wants the level of Japanese exports increased accordingly. Vehicle registrations in the EU between January and July have already risen 5.8 per cent to 7.5m units. Increasing the level of Japanese vehicle exports to the EU is likely to unsettle European vehicle producers. The Japanese share of the European market is expected to top 15 per cent by 1998 from nearly 12 per cent in 1992, according to DRI, the UK-based analysts. But it is unlikely that Japanese vehicle exports to the EU will actually increase significantly even if the quota is raised, as the strength of the yen has eroded the price advantage of Japanese cars exported to the EU. Japanese vehicle manufacturers have boosted manufacturing capacity in Europe in recent years, with Japanese plants already accounting for more than a fifth of British car production. The overall result has been that in the first eight months of this year, Japanese vehicle exports to the EU fell nearly 30 per cent to 561,156 units.</p>

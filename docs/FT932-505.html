			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / German left-wing terrorists warned GERMANY will continue the fight against terrorism, following the arrest of a prominent member of the Red Army Faction, the interior ministry said yesterday, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. The arrest of Ms Birgit Hogefeld, a prominent member of the RAF left-wing terrorist group, and the shooting dead of Mr Wolfgang Grams by the anti-terrorist unit, is a welcome boost for security forces. The arrest of Ms Hogefeld took place on Sunday night in the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. A police officer was shot dead during a shoot out. The guerrilla movement, which was set up in the 1970s, was virtually dormant in the 1980s but re-emerged after the unification of the two Germanys in 1990. It was responsible for murdering Hans-Martin Schleyer, president of west Germany's employers' federation in 1977, and Mr Detlev Rohwedder, who was head of the Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising eastern German industry.</p>

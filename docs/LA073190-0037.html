			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEL MAR;  </P> <P> HAWKSTER IS RETIRED TO STUD AT 4  </P> <P> What had lately been a rumor became fact Monday. Owner Shelley Meredith  announced that his horse, Hawkster, had been retired.  </P> <P> Selected as Del Mar's top 3-year-old male in 1989, Hawkster will stand at stud  at Airdrie Stud near Lexington, Ky.  </P> <P> Hawkster, who had been scheduled to run in the $250,000 Eddie Read Handicap  Aug. 12, had been bothered by ankle problems for the last year.  </P> <P> "His ankle problems began here last year," trainer Ron McAnally said. "I don't  know how much longer we could have gone with him."  </P> <P> Last year, Hawkster became known for his fifth-place finishes in all of the  1989 Triple Crown races, the only time that has ever happened.  </P> <P> Among his victories were triumphs in the second division of the Oceanside  Stakes and the Del Mar Derby, both on turf here.  </P> <P> After winning only five of the meeting's first 36 races, favorites have begun a  comeback at Del Mar.  </P> <P> Four favorites won Sunday and the trend continued Monday with five more  favorites winning.  </P> <P> Veteran jockey Eddie Delahoussaye, who is spending his 11th summer at Del Mar,  said poor early showings by favorites might have been caused by the soft Del  Mar track.  </P> <P> "Like any track, horses take a while to adapt to a new surface," Delahoussaye  said. "This track has a little give to it."  </P> <P> Shirkee, ridden by Russell Baze, took the lead in the final sixteenth to win  the $46,000 turf feature by 2 1/2 lengths over Santa Tecla and Gary Stevens.  </P> <P> Shirkee covered 1 1/16 miles over a firm course in 1:42 and paid $14.80, $5.40  and $3. Santa Tecla returned $6.20 and $3 and Lowell paid $2.40.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xu Jingyue (1776 0079 6460)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 27 Jan (XINHUA) -- Zhang Wannian, chief of  general staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army [PLA],  said today that as a military command office of the entire army,  the General Staff Department must study well Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, regarding it the  paramount task and fundamental project essential to carrying out  this year's military work and strategy and to strengthening the  department's construction.    Zhang Wannian today exchanged views on what has been gained  from studying the book with members of the core group of the  General Staff Department Party Committee and students attending  the first study class for Volume 3 of the Selected Works  of Deng Xiaoping. The study class was held for the General  Staff Department's leading cadres at the army and divisional  level; most of the students attending the study class are from  the department's bureaus and academies. The students scored  initial success by studying the original work in a down-to-earth  manner, by profoundly grasping its basic viewpoints, and by  linking the study with practical problems. Zhang Wannian  stressed: Party committees of the General Staff Department and  leading cadres at all levels must study Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping with a strong sense  of political responsibility to the party and to the cause of  army building, lay a strong ideological and theoretical  foundation for upholding the party's absolute leadership over  the army, ensure adherence to the correct orientation in very  complex situations, and consciously maintain a high degree of  unity with the party Central Committee and the Central Military  Commission.    Zhang Wannian pointed out: We must study the original work  in a down-to-earth manner, grasp its spirit, and concentrate on  grasping its standpoint, viewpoints, and methodology. At the  same time, we must closely link the study with practical  military work, use the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping as guide, and improve our ability to analyze and  resolve problems. First, we must integrate study with the  reality of the ideological field, further emancipate our minds,  acquire new ideas, and enhance our unshakable faith in  implementing the party's basic line. Second, we must integrate  it with the reality of reform, opening up, and the development  of a socialist market economy, profoundly understand and firmly  implement party and state policies in promoting reform, and keep  our troops highly stable, centralized, and unified. Third, we  must integrate it with the reality of the department's work and  work hard to enhance our political consciousness in upholding  the principle of the party commanding the gun, our strategic  sense in developing plans from a macroscopic perspective, our  strong sense of responsibility toward national security and army  building, and our sense of leadership in placing stricter  demands on ourselves in everything we do. Fourth, we must  integrate it with the reality in party building and work hard to  create a good image of our party committees and leading cadres  at all levels. Fifth, we must integrate it with the reality of  our workstyle, firmly overcome formalism, carry out our tasks in  a down-to-earth manner, pay attention to work at the grassroots  level, and continue to improve efficiency in guidance work.</p>

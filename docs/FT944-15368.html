			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Foreign groups 'should get' US research funds US subsidiaries of foreign companies should be made eligible for millions of dollars of US government research and development funds if they can prove their work is beneficial to the US technology base, a congressional report suggests. The report, multinationals and the US technology base, released yesterday by the office of technology assessment, said 'a national benefits test' could be applied equally to both foreign and domestic companies, consistent with the principle of national treatment which underlies the world trading system. With the report, the OTA enters an debate over whether subsidiaries of foreign companies, which contribute to the US economy by employing American workers, ought to benefit from government funding and trade promotion activities. The OTA suggested several criteria for the participation of foreign companies in US technology projects, including: Measuring a subsidiary's research and development presence in the US, perhaps as a percentage of sales. Requiring specific technological and financial contributions for the project. Requiring a company to conduct all the project's R&amp;D (or a negotiated percentage) in the US. Agreeing not to license the technology abroad, but to export products resulting from the R&amp;D. The European-American chamber of commerce, which has been pushing a multilateral investment pact among the industrialised countries, announced its support for the proposal. 'It would be even more useful for such a test to be formulated jointly with our European partners, yielding a test that would apply equally to European and US companies on either side of the Atlantic,' said Mr Willard Berry, president of the group. The chamber attacked another suggestion in the report that the US also consider 'a two-tiered policy regime' which would treat foreign-owned companies the same as US companies on the condition that home governments offer comparable treatment and market access. 'Conditional national treatment is a dangerous precedent because the conditional can be completely unrelated and arbitrary,' said Mr Berry. The report said 'reciprocity' requirements could 'increase tensions in international relations, leading to a variety of retaliatory actions.' The Organisation of International Investment (Ofii), which represents foreign companies that invest in the US, said the US gained from foreign technology development when it allowed foreign-owned companies to participate in US government-funded technology projects. 'If foreign-owned US companies are held hostage to the trade and investment practices of their home countries, the US would be building a wall around itself,' said Ms Nancy McLernon, of Ofii.

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Clinton to have briefing with Bush MR Bill Clinton, the president-elect, will fly today from Little Rock in Arkansas to Washington for his first meeting since the election with President George Bush and for talks with congressmen of both parties. Mr Clinton yesterday was poring over briefing papers, according to Mr Warren Christopher, director of Mr Clinton's transition team. The meeting would not be 'just a social call but, as has always been true historically, it's a time when the outgoing president communicates important thoughts to the incoming president'. Mr Clinton said he hoped to receive Mr Bush's 'candid assessment' on many world issues and that he had 'one or two things I want to raise'. He will also take a good look around his new home town. In fact, his itinerary allots less time at the White House with President Bush - 55 minutes - than for a 'street walk' visiting businesses near Washington's mostly black Howard University. This could be a sign that the Arkansas governor's schedulers have learned 'to build' extreme flexibility into his calendar. During the campaign, Mr Clinton got a well-deserved reputation for tardiness caused by shaking every hand proffered and engaging in long off-the-cuff conversations. The governor will use the second day of his two-day visit to begin wooing Republicans and to cement relationships with Democrats in Congress. After two years of stalemate in Washington between a Republican president and a Democratic Congress, there is a palpable yearning for the thaw in the domestic cold war which began when Mr Clinton met Democratic leaders on Sunday and Monday. Governor Clinton and his wife, Hillary, are also creating a stir on the Washington social scene, where they are determined to prove they are not like the more stand-offish Carters, the last Democrats in the White House. They are to attend two private dinners - to which invitations are much prized and supposed to be kept secret - and a reception. Tonight's dinner is being given by Mr Vernon Jordan, chairman of the governor's transition team, and tomorrow night's hostess is Mrs Pamela Harriman, a Democratic party activist. The Clintons rejected an invitation by President Bush to stay overnight at Blair House, the official guest residence, on the grounds that it would be too expensive to open for the occasion. Instead, they are staying at the Hay-Adams Hotel, where suites run at a more frugal Dollars 1,200 (Pounds 795) a night.</p>

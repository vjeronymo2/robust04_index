			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CEAUSESCU DEPOSED;  </P> <P> ROMANIAN CHIEF AND WIFE FLEE; THEIR SON IS CAPTURED;  </P> <P> AN OUTRAGED NATION DRIVES DICTATOR OUT  </P> <P> An outraged nation today drove Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu from power,  ending the Soviet Bloc's last dictatorship, but loyalist and opposition forces  battled for control in the streets of Bucharest.  </P> <P> Army troops siding with protesters and security forces loyal to Ceausescu  fought ferocious battles into the night in the capital, Bucharest, and  elsewhere in the country, East Bloc media reports said. The Presidential Palace  reportedly was set ablaze.  </P> <P> The tumult capped a historic year of change in the Soviet Bloc that elsewhere  had been relatively bloodless: Solidarity took power in Poland, Hungary ousted  its hard-liners and opened its borders, and old-guard regimes in East Germany,  Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria were thrown out in swift succession in October.  </P> <P> State-run Romanian media, now in the hands of protesters, reported that  Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, fled by helicopter from the Presidential Palace  early today but were later caught and put in detention. Another report,  however, said he was free and his whereabouts unknown. Still other reports said  the couple had escaped the country, possibly heading for Iran or China.  </P> <P> Nicu, the Ceausescus' eldest son, was captured after trying to assume command  of the security forces in Sibiu, the south Transylvanian city he had ruled as  local Communist Party chief. He said on Romanian TV that he did not know his  parents' whereabouts.  </P> <P> About 2,000 pro-Ceausescu forces attacked Bucharest this evening, after it was  taken over by hundreds of thousands of protesters, Romanian television  reported.  </P> <P> "Dead and wounded are reported from all parts of the city," the Czechoslovak  news agency CTK said. Yugoslav TV reported hundreds dead.  </P> <P> "Television has appealed to everyone to remain in the streets and to fight  against the murderers until the very end," the Hungarian news agency MTI said.  </P> <P> The 24-year reign of the East Bloc's harshest regime collapsed in one  breathtaking week of protests that began with a small rally for a persecuted  pastor in the remote western city of Timisoara, and led to today's nationwide  uprising by millions.  </P> <P> Thousands of unarmed civilians already were believed massacred by troops in  Timisoara as Ceausescu desperately tried to prolong his rule. Security forces  also fired on protesters in Bucharest on Thursday.  </P> <P> Soviet TV said pro-Ceausescu troops attacked at dusk today and fighting raged  throughout the capital. It said troops opened fire with submachine guns on  demonstrators who gathered for a meeting.  </P> <P> It said the Communist Party Central Committee building was partially blown up.  </P> <P> Earlier, Romanian radio said tanks and army units surrounded TV and radio  stations to protect them from loyalist security forces.  </P> <P> Romanian TV showed pictures of Ceausescu's Presidential Palace in flames.  </P> <P> The television reported that Bucharest jails were opened by anti-Ceausescu  supporters. Engineer Nicu Stefanescu, one of those released, said thousands of  people had been arrested when the protests swirling through the country finally  reached Bucharest Thursday night.  </P> <P> Even children were detained, he said, reporting that there were so many wounded  in jail that blood was seen in the corridors.  </P> <P> The entire city of Timisoara, where the protests began on Dec. 15 and ignited  the revolution, seemed to be surging through the streets in celebration. Crowds  built bonfires fueled by portraits of Ceausescu that had been ripped down.  </P> <P> Residents said that between 2,000 and 4,500 people were killed by security  forces during efforts in recent days to stop the protests in Timisoara.  </P> <P> "This is something we never expected to happen. The dictator is gone," Ingeborg  Kziraska, said in front of the local cathedral where she said more than 30  children were gunned down on Sunday.  </P> <P> Former Foreign Affairs Minister Corneliu Manescu, 73, went on Romanian TV  earlier to announce formation of a provisional government until free elections  are held, the East German news agency ADN said.  </P> <P> Manescu has for many months been under house arrest near Bucharest for  criticizing Ceausescu, informed sources said.  </P> <P> Several senior military commanders appeared on television to announce  Ceausescu's ouster, indicating that the army had joined pro-democracy  demonstrators.  </P> <P> While still in Ceausescu's hands, Romanian radio reported early today that  Defense Minister Vasile Milea had committed suicide, and blamed him for the  national unrest.  </P> <P> An unidentified general denied on the radio after Ceausescu was ousted that  Milea had taken his own life, but said that he indeed had died.  </P> <P> Ceausescu was the last hard-line Soviet alliance leader. With his family he  strictly controlled the Spartan society he had built and refused to adopt  reforms despite chronic shortages of food and energy that made life miserable  for most Romanians.  </P> <P> He apparently felt so secure with the dominance of his cult of personality that  he traveled to Iran earlier this week during the growing protests, and held a  pro-government rally on Thursday that turned into a huge chorus of  denunciations of his rule.  </P></p>

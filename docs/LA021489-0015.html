			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: IT'S PUNCH-IN TIME ON CAPITOL HILL  </P> <P> There has to be a solution to the congressional pay gridlock. Representatives  and senators need more money and the taxpayer is adamant about not giving it to  them.  </P> <P> There are some people who are against the raise because they think it's too  much. Then there are others who are against it because this is the first time  in their lives that they have been in a position to turn down anyone for a pay  increase. Consequently, they want to make the most of the opportunity.  </P> <P> My taxi driver is one of them. "I say no raise," he declared, as we started out  for the office. "They get too much money anyway, and they don't do a thing for  it."  </P> <P> "That's a harsh judgment, Rico. Many legislators work day and night, and then  have to travel long distances on weekends in order to give the American people  the best laws that money can buy. Would you prefer that they be paid the same  wages as the workers at McDonald's?"  </P> <P> "They tried to sneak the raise in behind our backs because they were too  chicken to vote on it up and down. If Congress had come to me and said, 'Rico,  we need this to educate our children and feed our families,' I might have given  them the increase."  </P> <P> "That's very good of you, Rico. How many raises have you handed out in your  life?"  </P> <P> "That doesn't matter. I'm a good judge of character, and I know when someone  should have a pay increase and when they shouldn't. I read the papers like  everybody else. Besides, I never thought an across-the-board raise was a good  idea. I'd like to see the lawmakers paid on a piecework basis. Members of  Congress would be rewarded according to their level of production. If a  legislator shows up every day on the Hill, he is given a standard fee. If he  introduces a bill in Congress, he gets an extra amount for it, and if the bill  is passed, he receives a bonus."  </P> <P> "Would you give them anything for attending a PAC breakfast to raise money for  their election campaigns?"  </P> <P> "No, they would be on their own for all fund-raisers. At the same time I might  offer them a fee for going to a prayer breakfast."  </P> <P> "How much should they get for waging a filibuster?"  </P> <P> "In that situation we would be very generous because it puts a lot of wear and  tear on the body. I'd also pay piecemeal for those who give speeches on the  floor of the Senate, but I would like to see a system whereby the person making  the shortest speech gets the most money."  </P> <P> "Would I be correct if I presumed that each time a representative voted, he'd  get a stipend?"  </P> <P> "Yes. I'd have the sergeant at arms sit at a table and pay everyone in cash as  they came down the aisle."  </P> <P> "Rico, I think you're onto something. No one has ever thought of compensating  lawmakers for what they actually did -- not even Trotsky."  </P> <P> "It's the only way Congress is going to get a raise from me."  </P> <P> "You're a good man and a fair man, but suppose they don't accept your plan?"  </P> <P> "They have no choice. I don't think anyone has been fairer than I have to the  people on Capitol Hill. But I can't justify throwing money away on large pay  raises when there are so many potholes in this country still waiting to be  filled."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 17 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev said on Sunday [17 April] that Moscow is  seeking for the best ways of keeping partnership-cooperation  ties with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).    After returning from a 24-hour trip to Belgrade, Kozyrev  told  reporters that "partnership with the North Atlantic alliance was  our (Russia's) choice from the very outset."    "Two years ago, Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent a  letter  to NATO, offering partnership and close cooperation, and at  present we are seeking for the best ways of promoting these  ties," the Russian foreign minister stated, commenting on  Russia's approach towards NATO's Partnership for Peace Program.    He said Moscow is ready to discuss whether a framework  agreement should be signed first, which is to be followed by a  broader one, or whether Moscow should conclude a broader  partnership pact, without signing a preliminary agreement.    "We want a more serious and substantive agreement adequate  to  relations that should exist between NATO and the superpower of  Russia...... [ellipses as received] Especially an agreement  which will exclude unilateral actions, particularly military  ones, in areas where we have to closely cooperate," Kozyrev  pointed out.    Moscow has agreed in principle to join the NATO plan, which  offers east European and former Soviet republics cooperation but  stops short of letting them join the alliance.    According to the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY, Kozyrev has  postponed  his visit to Brussels scheduled for April 21 to sign the  Partnership for Peace deal, apparently angered by NATO's air  strikes on Serb positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina last week.</p>

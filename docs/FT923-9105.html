			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: BP upsets the stock market IT WAS almost bound to happen but when it did the shock waves still reverberated through the London market. British Petroleum halved its second-quarter dividend, as well as announcing an exceptional charge of nearly Pounds 1bn, and the shares spiralled down amid hectic selling. The stock was 17 off at one stage before ending with a net fall of 10 at 196 1/2 p, the lowest level since mid-1986. The day's turnover of 74m shares was one of the highest for the past five years. In addition, the equivalent of some 40m shares changed hands during the first two hours of the new session in New York, where they are traded in the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). US institutions have consistently taken a far more optimistic view of the oil company than their UK counterparts and overnight ADR buying was reflected on the UK shares when London opened yesterday. Then, the UK began to sell the shares and an early gain had been reversed by the time BP's headline losses were released at mid-morning. On the news, the stock ticked back sharply to trade 13 down with the turnover doubling within minutes. The analysts' meeting at midday did nothing to alleviate the gloom. Nevertheless, US investors continued to show support, with houses such as CJ Lawrence and Kidder Peabody said to be clinging on to their positive stance. Mr Bernard Picchi of Kidder said: 'The dividend cut was bitter medicine but the right medicine and, if anything, US investors have intensified their interest as a result of the sharp fall in the share price.' In London, Mr John Toalster, the Strauss Turnbull analyst who has long predicted a dividend cut, argued that the oil group would be unable to lift it again for at least two years. C and W weak Cable and Wireless retreated 16 to 524p on rumours that unofficial negotiations between the telecoms group and American counterpart US West had broken down. The talks were believed to involve US West taking a minority stake in C and W's telecoms subsidiary, Mercury, with a price tag of Pounds 500m to Pounds 600m being suggested. Although C and W has never admitted the existence of the talks, most market analysts accepted that negotiations were in progress, particularly in view of C and W's stated aim of bringing partners on board in its serach for a global partnership. But the talks now appear to have foundered on regulatory worries on the US side. This suggestion prompted several other whispers about C and W, one that a survey among leading business users by a broker had found BT favoured ahead of Mercury for the first time. BT shares, strengthened by press reports that it would not be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, edged a penny higher to 337p. Barclays ahead Disappointing interim results from Barclays were accompanied by what one analyst described as 'a sigh of relief that the dividend was maintained'. In spite of the effect of chairman Sir John Quinton's gloomy general statement on the rest of the market, Barclays rose 10 to 334p, the best percentage performance among the 100 FT-SE Index stocks, with 15m shares traded. The Pounds 1bn provision for bad debts was larger than the market had expected, and one analyst argued that the bank had not been able to control costs and was unlikely to maintain its rate of growth in the second half. However, there was confidence that the dividend would be held for the full year and Nomura Research was arguing that the shares were attractive at around 320p. A number of investors were switching from National Westminster, which slipped 6 to 315p. Thorn EMI tumbles Leisure group Thorn EMI's shares tumbled 32 to 711p under the combined weight of poor results from the Dutch Philips concern and consecutive days' downgrades. After Wednesday's downgrade by one leading house, yesterday saw further trimming by Smith New Court, Henderson Crosthwaite and Paribas. Worries over Thorn's music division were said to be behind the cuts, Smith now looking for Pounds 315m, down Pounds 10m, Paribas a similar reduction to Pounds 345m, and Henderson an unconfirmed Pounds 300m. Profits from industrial gases concern BOC came in above the market's estimates and the shares jumped 17 to 601p. Turnover in business services group BET jumped to 43m after the company said only 43.2 per cent of its Pounds 201m rights issue had been taken up by investors. Around 19m shares were placed with sub-underwriters at 107 1/2 p, representing through double counting a majority of the day's volume. The stock closed at 110p, unchanged on the day and in line with the rights issue price. Telecoms group Vodafone moved forward 7 to 327p as it announced plans to form a consortium to provide a cellular network in Greece. Vague talk that Anglian Water was in line for a share of a lucrative Argentinian contract, together with a big buyer in the market, lifted the shares 12 to 406p. Turnover in freight company NFC rose to 11m as the shares retreated after two large trades - one of 5.6m and another of 5.5m - went through the market at 245p and 247p respectively. Regional brewer Greene King continued to suffer from holding 29.3 per cent of its failed bid target Morland. Shares in the latter closed steady at 405p. Greene King, which had paid some 450p for its Morland holding, weakened 18 to 445p. Mirror Group Newspapers saw very heavy turnover as a block of 6.8m shares was bought for cash for the next account. The recorded volume was 15m shares, which represents both sides of the block trade. The stock eased a penny to 73p. Simon Engineering was subject to a two-way pull after the company reported a rise in half-time profits just ahead of expectations. The buyers were cheered by the figures and the shares ended 4 better at 185p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (4).

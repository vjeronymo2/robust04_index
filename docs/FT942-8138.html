			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / The Nature of Things: Fertility plights - Clive Cookson on the alarming decline in average sperm counts In an overpopulated world, a decline in male fertility may at first seem like good news. But recent reports that the sperm counts of men today are only half those of their counterparts 50 years ago are causing disquiet in medical circles, particularly because the leading theory to explain the decline involves pervasive chemical pollution of the environment. There has even been bizarre speculation that mass infertility could lead to the extinction of Homo sapiens by the end of the next century - a scenario that PD James explored in her recent novel The Children of Men. In reality, however, all that the latest scientific evidence has demonstrated convincingly is how lamentably little we know about male infertility in general and sperm production in particular. The much-quoted estimate of a 50 per cent fall in sperm counts since 1940 is based on a thorough analysis by Niels Skakkebaek of Copenhagen University of studies carried out in 21 countries and involving 15,000 men. Although he tried hard to correct for changing procedures and standards over the years, retrospective studies of this sort are vulnerable to statistical attack - and not everyone agrees that there has been a decline at all. Another analysis of the data, to be published shortly in the British Medical Journal, claims that the basis of the Skakkebaek paper was invalid. But a large French study, accepted for publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, will provide strong support for him. In spite of the conflicting evidence, most experts believe that there has been some decline in sperm production, though perhaps not as much as Skakkebaek estimated. They suspect that it may be linked to the three-fold increase in testicular cancer that has undoubtedly occurred in the industrialised world since 1940. Other male reproductive disorders, such as undescended testicles, have also become more common. Our scientific ignorance is so great that no one knows what impact a 50 per cent decline in average sperm counts would have on male fertility. On the face of it, a normal man produces a vast excess of sperm: about 100m per day. During sex he deposits between 100m and 800m (depending on when he last had an orgasm) in the vagina, although only about 100 sperm reach the female egg and of course just one fertilises it. But sexual reproduction has evolved to require a huge number of surplus sperm. By the standards of the rest of the animal kingdom, humans are sub-fertile. Richard Sharpe of the Medical Research Council's Reproductive Biology Unit in Edinburgh says that men produce sperm with only 10 to 30 per cent of the efficiency of other mammals and, to make matters worse, about half of human sperm are abnormal in some way, compared to 2 to 5 per cent in other species. In Britain infertility affects about one couple in six and the man's sperm count is believed to be responsible in about a quarter of these cases. But so little research has been carried out that estimates of male infertility today vary by a factor of three - and no one knows to what extent, if at all, the problem is worsening. Many theories have been advanced over the years to explain declining sperm counts. An old favourite is that modern men are overheating their testicles by wearing too-tight underpants and trousers and/or by soaking too long in hot baths. Changing diet is frequently blamed too. The organic farming lobby jumped on the bandwagon earlier this month when a small study in Denmark showed that men eating only 'organic' food had sperm counts twice as high as the Danish average. But other researchers said the sample of 30 men was too small to give scientifically valid results. However, the explanation receiving most attention at the moment is that falling sperm counts and increasing reproductive abnormalities are related to our growing exposure to 'environmental oestrogens'. These are persistent man-made pollutants which mimic the biological effects of oestrogen, the female sex hormone. Natural oestrogen molecules work by fitting into a particular 'receptor' site on human cells, like a key fitting a lock. For unknown reasons, nature has not designed the oestrogen lock to tight tolerances and a range of other molecular keys, including residues of the pesticide DDT and various industrial chemicals, will also fit it and produce similar effects. Until a couple of years ago, scientists had assumed that reproductive problems stemmed mainly from events in childhood, puberty and adulthood. Now Sharpe and his colleagues believe that the main impact of environmental oestrogens takes place during the early development of the foetus, when so-called Sertoli cells, precursors of sperm-producting cells in the testicles, are formed. According to the theory, a genetically male foetus exposed to even a little extra female hormone will grow fewer Sertoli cells - and produce less sperm in adulthood. If so, there is not much a subfertile man can do to boost his sperm count by changing to an organic diet. Evidence to support the environmental oestrogen theory is growing, from studies of wildlife as well as humans. It may be a false alarm. Or we could inadvertently be engineering not only a solution to overpopulation but a barren future for man.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by ZVYAZDA correspondent: "An Avalanche of </F> Credit.... Some Results of the Republic's Economic Performance  in January and Possible Consequences"    [Text] First of all, the overall results in the first month  indicate that the economic decline is becoming even more  threatening. Compared to January of last year the national  income declined by 31 percent, industrial output declined by  almost 20 percent, and production stood at only 43.8 percent of  the January 1991 level. The State Committee for Statistics  reported that in January practically no work was done by the  Mogilev Elevator Plant, the Minsk Bearing Plant, the Vitebsk  Kirov Machine Building Plant, the Kobrin Instrument Plant, the  Minsk Computer Equipment Association, the Grodno Azot  Association, and many other enterprises.    High prices on goods resulted in difficulties with sales,  and  overstocking. Rising prices resulted from increased costs of  production, in particular the higher cost of fuel and energy.  The State Committee for Statistics reported data on the rising  earnings and costs of production of the goods sold in the past  year. These figures are as follows: while overall earnings for  the year rose by 11 times (also, incidentally, primarily because  of the price factor), costs rose by 13 times. This reflects a  drop in profitability and labor effectiveness. Despite greater  efforts than before, we are getting less output.    The remedy is clear--either reduce costs or convert to the  production of more profitable goods or, better yet, do both  simultaneously. Our state, however, with its social form of  property ownership and consequently vague forms of  responsibility, is hardly capable of either. A typical example:  despite the extreme energy-intensiveness and sky-high costs of  energy, energy consumption relative to the national income last  year dropped only slightly--compared to 1992, the national  income and energy consumption stood at 90 and 89.1 percent,  respectively.    Let's look again at January's indicators. A total of 30.6  percent fewer consumer goods were produced than in January of  last year. Trade turnover (in comparable prices) stood at only  49 percent (consumer demand dropped by more than half!). The  State Committee for Statistics explains it this way: the drop in  sales of goods in the domestic market resulted from the decline  in their production, rising prices, and a drop in the  population's real income. Obviously, however, the latter two  factors taken together were by far the most important. In recent  months, prices have risen much faster than income. In December,  prices rose at twice the rate, and in January by almost four  times. Specifically, people's money income in January rose by 11  percent while prices rose by 40.7 percent.    What can we expect next? Obviously, the economic  situation--and with it people's standard of living--will get  worse. In February we have witnessed the government's attempts  to halt rising prices and, consequently, inflation (recall the  well known decision about bakery operations). Nevertheless, we  can expect an even higher price rise in the next few months.  This will result, in particular, from the recent credit infusion  of more than a trillion into the agrocomplex and the  government's plans to throw an additional trillion into it  (note, incidentally, the proposed approach to the distribution  of the additional trillion--it is to be proportional to the area  of agricultural lands which the farms have...). Already, as a  result, credits to the agrocomplex alone will almost equal all  the credits to the whole national economy for all of last year  (the remainder of the loans as of 1 January came to 2.3 trillion  rubles).    Meanwhile, the situation has become much worse with  circulating capital in trade and industrial enterprises, which,  as we know, are also in need of credit.... The credit mass is  turning into an avalanche, there is more and more money and  fewer and fewer goods and commodities. According to some  economists, inflation may reach as high as 80 percent in next  few months. This is very likely. Hence, we are still going to be  paying very high prices for today's "cheap" bread.</p>

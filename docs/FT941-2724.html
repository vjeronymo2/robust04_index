			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Ahold overcomes US downturn Ahold, the Dutch food retailer which has built up a large presence in the eastern US, posted a 12.5 per cent increase in 1993 net profit, with improved results in the Netherlands and acquisitions in Portugal compensating for a slight fall in earnings in the US. Net profit rose to Fl 343.1m (Dollars 180.6m) from Fl 305m in 1992. The company, which is preparing to take over its sixth US supermarket chain, said operating profits in the US should show clear improvement in 1994, and forecast an increase in full-year net earnings for the group as a whole. Ahold is to increase its dual-currency dividend to Fl 0.62 and Dollars 0.23 per share, from Fl 0.57 and Dollars 0.22 in 1992. Turnover in 1993 jumped by 25.5 per cent to Fl 27.1bn, of which about four-fifths was due to the first-time consolidation of Schuitema, Ahold's majority-owned Dutch wholesaler, as well as to acquisitions of supermarkets and hypermarkets in Portugal. At home in the Netherlands, operating profit soared by 32.6 per cent to Fl 296.7m, with around two-thirds of the rise due to acquisitions. Ahold's Dutch supermarket chain, Albert Heijn, is the country's leading food retailer with a 26.9 per cent share of the domestic market, up from 26.6 per cent in 1992. In the US, improved results were reported by three of the group's chains - BI-LO, Giant Food Stores and Tops - but its two others, Edwards and Finast, posted 'disappointing' results. Overall, US operating profit slipped to Dollars 161.9m from Dollars 169m. In February Ahold signed a letter of intent on the acquisition of Red Food Stores, a Tennessee-based supermarket chain with annual sales of Dollars 585m. It expects to conclude the transaction by late April.</p>

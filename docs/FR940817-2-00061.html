			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the first stage of the waiver process, the sole issue is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether a fuel ``causes or contributes'' to an emission standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure. The waiver applicant bears the burden of demonstrating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a fuel will neither cause nor contribute to an emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard failure for any regulated pollutant. Balancing of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission effects of a fuel for one pollutant against those for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other pollutant(s) is not permissible under the statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language. For example, an applicant would not meet its burden of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proof if its testing of a fuel shows that it causes or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contributes to an emission standard failure for CO, even though  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing shows decreases in emissions of HC and NOx. If an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant does not meet its burden of demonstrating that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``cause or contribute'' test is met, the Agency cannot grant a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver. If an applicant does meet its burden, the Agency may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then exercise its discretion to grant or to deny a waiver in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second stage of the process. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under the statute, if the Agency does not take action to grant or deny a waiver application within 180 days of submittal, the waiver is deemed granted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statute provides that the Agency ``may'' grant a waiver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application if the ``cause or contribute'' test is met, but does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not require such an action. The Agency may therefore choose not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to grant a waiver based on other issues (e.g., public health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects) that indicate that it would not be in the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest to do so. In this second stage of the process, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency has a great deal of discretion to determine which issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be examined and to balance the potential positive and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative impacts of a waiver. Such discretionary authority is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grounded not only in Congress' use of the term ``may'' rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the term ``shall'' in section 211(f)(4), but also in the goals and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of section 211 when read as a whole. The Agency does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not believe that Congress intended to require EPA to grant a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver under section 211(f)(4) when available information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that the fuel would be potentially subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory control under section 211(c)(1) immediately upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuance of the waiver. Similarly, EPA believes that Congress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> did not intend to preclude a determination of whether issuance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a waiver is consistent with other important goals of the Act once  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it has been demonstrated that the mandatory ``cause or contribute''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test has been met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This does not mean that the Administrator has unfettered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion to deny a waiver application for any reason. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grounds for any denial must not be arbitrary or capricious or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitute an abuse of discretion. Thus, in using discretion to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deny an application, the Administrator must identify and explain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the factors on which a discretionary denial decision is based and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must assure that the policy adopted is consistent for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similarly situated waiver applicants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Consideration of Potential Health Effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the basis for a discretionary denial must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rational and non-arbitrary, nothing in the statute limits the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type of factors which the Administrator may consider in deciding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether to deny an application. Section 101(b)(1) states that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one of the purposes of the Act is to ``protect and enhance the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality of the Nation's air resources so as to promote the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health and welfare and the productive capacity of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population.'' Given this general goal of the Act, certainly the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential effects on public health of vehicle emissions would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a factor which the Administrator may reasonably consider when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilizing the discretion which section 211(f)(4) authorizes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, under sections 211(b)(2) and 211(e), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator must require the manufacturer of a fuel or additive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to produce data concerning potential health effects as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition of, or a prerequisite to, registration of the fuel or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  Under section 211(c)(1), the Administrator may,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on data collected under sections 211(b) and 211(e) or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise available, issue regulations controlling manufacture or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sale of any fuel or fuel additive which the Administrator finds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> welfare.'' These provisions indicate that Congress intended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Administrator be concerned about the potential health effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of fuels and fuel additives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 211(a) and 211(b)(1) require the registration of fuels and additives designated by the Administrator as a precondition to introduction into commerce. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fact that the Administrator may control fuels or fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additives which pose potential health effects under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 211(c)(1) does not mean that the Administrator may not consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health effects as a factor in deciding whether to grant a waiver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under section 211(f)(4). Such a construction of the statute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would lead to absurd results, precluding the Administrator from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denying a waiver application and leading to potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduction of a fuel or additive into commerce, even in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific circumstances where the Administrator has concluded that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are grounds for issuance of a proposed regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibiting the fuel or additive under section 211(c). However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although this reasoning indicates that Congress could not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably intended to completely preclude the consideration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health effects under section 211(f)(4), this does not mean that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 211(c) limits the circumstances in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator may consider potential health effects as part of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver decision. Clearly, it was the intention of Congress to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treat fuels and fuel additives already registered and being sold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a particular purpose differently than those which have not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already been introduced into commerce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

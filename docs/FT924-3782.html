			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley 7% ahead WOLVERHAMPTON &amp; Dudley Breweries increased pre-tax profits by 6.6 per cent and boosted its dividend 11 per cent in spite of a slower-than-expected integration of JW Cameron bought from Brent Walker in January. Mr David Thompson, managing director, said he remained cautious about recovery in the West Midlands. This year's outlook remained bleak with reduced opportunities to raise margins through cost cutting and higher prices. Pre-tax profits in the year to September 27 rose from Pounds 33m to Pounds 35.2m on sales up 12 per cent at Pounds 209.6m. Earnings per share rose to 37.4p (36p) and a 7.1p final dividend is proposed for a total of 11.4p. Stripping out the effects of the Cameron acquisition and a Pounds 1.6m write-off in 1991, relating to closure of the Dudley Brewery, which depressed 1991 profits, the company marginally increased sales and trading profit, in spite of recession in its region. The renamed Camerons Brewery diluted earnings by 3.5 per cent, as the re-launch of the Strongarm brand and the pub refurbishment programme fell behind schedule. New pubs performed better than expected but profits from the '1960s (housing) estate boozers' continued to fall. The group's Crown &amp; Raven Hotels also had a quiet period. The directors have devalued property values by 3.5 per cent compared with the last valuation in September 1991. Net debt rose from Pounds 45m to Pounds 65m after the Cameron acquisition and interest cover fell to 6.9 times. COMMENT To boost underlying beer sales in the recession-hit Midlands is quite a feat of operational management and cost control. To cover the dividend more than three times after an 11 per cent increase, is a sign of a similar financial strength. Granted Wolves has taken longer than expected to turn round Camerons, and delays with this programme means the acquisition will remain dilutive in 1993. But with profits forecast to grow 8 per cent to Pounds 38m, or earnings of 40p the company deserves to be rated above a 13.4 prospective multiple.</p>

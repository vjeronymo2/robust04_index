Tonight the spotlight  falls on PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] President Clarence  Makwetu. As you probably know, at the weekend the PAC released  its election manifesto. Well, Mr. Makwetu is with us in the  studio this evening. A very good evening and a warm welcome.  Thanks for joining us, Mr. Makwetu.    [Makwetu] Good evening.    [Bishop] A couple of soft questions first before I bowl you  a  fast and hard one. What are your particular qualities that make  you the leader and acceptable to the people? What would you say  they were?    [Makwetu] Well, I don't think I have any particular  qualities. Actually, I was forced into this position. I never  aspired to it. I never canvassed anyone, but I was at a congress  that was held here in Johannesburg and they decided to elect me  to this position.    [Bishop] A modest response. What about chances of the PAC in  these forthcoming elections? Prediction polls say about 2  percent to 4 percent. What do you say?    [Makwetu] Don't worry about prediction polls. This has  happened in the past. We have seen it in various countries, for  instance in Britain last time we were told that the Labor Party  was winning and the Conservatives are in power. Next door here  in Zimbabwe, before Mugabe came into power we were told that it  was Joshua Nkomo or Bishop Muzorewa, and right here next door  again in Lesotho, we were told...[pauses] nothing was mentioned  about BCP [Basotholand Congress Party] until election results  were announced. So we are not bothered. Not because of this  history that I related to you, but because of the amount of work  we have done in the country. We are happy about what we have  done in the country.    [Bishop] You are widespread in the country?    [Makwetu] Throughout the country, we are represented.    [Bishop] Now, only last Sunday, and I'll give you a quote,  you said, if I am reporting you correctly, that you suspended  the arms struggle but the PAC would return to the arms struggle  if the land was not returned to the African people. Is that  right?    [Makwetu] Yes, that is the position.    [Bishop] You'll also know that you registered as a political  party, and could it not be said that you are now forbidden from  making such statements because of the Electoral Act --  threatening armed struggle?    [Makwetu] We are not threatening anybody. In fact we were  involved in the armed struggle because we were forced into it by  the regime. If anybody forces us to armed struggle, we will  resort to armed struggle.    [Bishop] You don't see that though as in any way  contravening  the Electoral Act, you know, your statement?    [Makwetu] No.    [Bishop] Have you been approached by anybody who has  challenged you on that?    [Makwetu] You are the first one to challenge me.    [Bishop] And if somebody official challenged you, what would  you say?    [Makwetu] Well, we would look into the legal consequences of  that.    [Bishop] Well, another quote from Mr. Nemadzivhanani, the  secretary general of the PAC. I think you'll probably know it.  It was in all the papers. He said unless the elections are  rigged the PAC will win.    [Makwetu] Yes, he said so.    [Bishop] You endorse that? Unless those elections are rigged  the PAC will win.    [Makwetu] We are sure to win, that's why he said so.    [Bishop] I see, but what I'm going to say is that if the  election is free and fair and the PAC doesn't win, how can the  elections have been rigged? If the election monitors, the  international people and everybody else say: no, no, no, there's  no rigging. We're very sorry Mr. Makwetu, you have not won the  election. What will your reaction be then?    [Makwetu] But we have committed ourselves already to that,  in  that we said if the elections are free and fair we will respect  the outcome of the election. That's what we have said.    [Bishop] No, I do accept that, but you see I'm quoting Mr.  Nemadzivhanani and he says unless the elections are rigged, in  other words, I take it to be only rigged elections would mean  that the PAC couldn't win. Is that not what he meant?    [Makwetu] Well, I think what he meant is what is happening  in  the country right now. For instance, we were raided in May last  year, our offices and our houses. Documents that we were using  and that we should be using right now at the World Trade Center  were taken away from us and those documents are still with the  regime. Isn't that the rigging of elections?    [Bishop] Well, I am not going to respond to that. The regime  must respond, as you call them, to that.    [Makwetu] Exactly.    [Bishop] Mr. Makwetu, Patricia de Lille, her statement made  quite a lot of press and she has since made another comment  about it. I am talking about saying that whites who wish to  emigrate should be encouraged to do so. Do you endorse that  sentiment?    [Makwetu] Well, according to the information I have, and  this  information I got from her, she says she has been misquoted.  She never uttered such words. PAC has no program to drive  whites into the sea. PAC has no program to drive anybody out of  this country.    [Bishop] Didn't Mr. Barney Desai say something about whites  going into the sea though, also quoted last week? What do these  phrases mean, you see?    [Makwetu] Well, they may mean anything in politics. For  instance, if I say I fight elections it doesn't mean I am  fighting you physically, but I am fighting.    [Bishop] No, quite. But let's stay with the whites for a  minute because I suppose there are quite a few whites watching  and would like to know their position should the PAC come in and  form a government. Now, who are whites as far as you are  concerned. Are they forever settlers or not?    [Makwetu] Firstly, I must state that we have never labeled  anybody as settlers. It is the settlers themselves who have  called themselves settlers, and I'm going to quote instances.  For instance, if you go to Grahamstown today you will find a  monument named 1820 British Settlers. That monument was not  named by PAC. If you move from D.F. Malan Airport into Cape  Town, you'll travel along Settlers Way, and that was not named  by PAC.    [Bishop] Well, we are actually in the manifesto now because  in the glossary you mention settler, and it's defined by the PAC  as any person who does not owe allegiance to Africa and is not  willing to submit to rule by an African majority.    [Makwetu] That's right.    [Bishop] And you also say the term applies to anyone who  espouses and promotes Eurocentric and colonialist values.    [Makwetu] Exactly.    [Bishop] Are those European, Eurocentric values of no value  to Africa? Let me name some of them perhaps: democracy, freedom  of expression, freedom of assembly, the rule of law, habeas  corpus, great international music, and eternal poetry and  literature. Aren't those of value to people who would call  themselves truly Africans?    [Makwetu] All these values you have enumerated are no  monopoly of Europe. We were not taught democracy by Europe.    [Bishop] Is that so?    [Makwetu] Yes.    [Bishop] It's thought that democracy originated in any kind  of recent form, by recent I mean two and a half thousand years,  in ancient Greece. You'd challenge that, would you?    [Makwetu] I have no business to challenge that, but we  practiced democracy before the advent of the whites in this  country.    [Bishop] But then the European values then, let's just get  to  that Mr. Makwetu, I mean, what must we do with those. I mean,  should they be jettisoned for other values?    [Makwetu] Not necessarily jettisoned, but values are values  irrespective of origin.    [Bishop] But European values, should we keep them in the new  South Africa under a PAC government.    [Makwetu] Well, PAC has committed itself already to  borrowing  whatever is good from each bloc, that is the Eastern bloc and  the Western bloc.    [Bishop] Right, let's move on into the manifesto. Violence  -- you say the PAC has never been party to the wanton violence  and carnage in our townships and rural areas. That's set down  in the manifesto.    [Makwetu] Yes, that is the position.    [Bishop] Let's take that position as being absolutely true.  The attacks attributed to APLA [Azanian People's Liberation  Army], carried out by APLA, on civilians in King William's Town,  Queenstown, the Cape Town church, Heidelberg Tavern, and the  late Amy Biehl. What do you say about those attacks?    [Makwetu] Actually, we have suspended the arms struggle. I  don't know whether you want us to reopen that now.    [Bishop] No, but what I have to feel free to do is to ask  you  questions that I think are in the minds of the people outside.    [Makwetu] Exactly, that is why I respond in this fashion. We  thought by us suspending the arms struggle, we were trying to  open up negotiations so that everybody should participate,  including PAC, and as far as those instances you have just  mentioned, that is not the violence that we are talking about.  PAC or APLA, the armed wing of PAC, was engaged in armed  struggle which has been suspended now.    [Bishop] That's in the past.    [Makwetu] Yes.    [Bishop] All right, move on to land -- no protection of  freehold title to land. Is that the general policy of the PAC?    [Makwetu] If you mean by freehold title -- you mean the  monopoly of land by whites in this country, therefore, PAC is  opposed to that setup.    [Bishop] Not the monopoly, but the idea of you and I having  a  freehold over a house. Is that all right?    [Makwetu] I don't have that freehold.    [Bishop] No, but if you did. Would that be all right?    [Makwetu] There would be no need for me to have that  freehold  according to PAC policy.    [Bishop] But isn't that sort of, absolute security for  people  who have bought a house?    [Makwetu] We guarantee security to each and every individual  in the country. That is PAC policy.    [Bishop] But if you don't have freehold, you don't have  title  to your land, do you, or your house?    [Makwetu] Why must you have freehold? Can't you have  something else instead?    [Bishop] What would that be, that something else?    [Makwetu] Like leasehold rights.    [Bishop] Well, you can have leasehold. Some people do have  leasehold rights, but I am just asking then -- so the policy is  no freehold in the new PAC Azania?    [Makwetu] Well, our position has been put loud and clear,  that we won't be selling and buying land.    [Bishop] And you won't allow people to do that individually?    [Makwetu] Why should we do that?    [Bishop] Well, I don't know why you should. I'm just asking  whether you will.    [Makwetu] No we won't.    [Bishop] So all private land transactions will be canceled  under a PAC government?    [Makwetu] We are saying that the land has been robbed from  our forefathers. It has been stolen and taken away by force and  this is the land we say should be returned to its rightful  owners, the African people.    [Bishop] When was that land stolen?    [Makwetu] As early as 1652.    [Bishop] Mr. Makwetu, couldn't it be argued that that land  has become the land of the people whom you say stole it, over a  period of history? I mean, isn't it an impossibility to wind  back history this way?    [Makwetu] This land was -- there were no dealings between  our forefathers and those who stole the land from them.    [Bishop] But that applies all over the world, doesn't it? I  mean the Anglos and Saxons, when they landed in England....    [Makwetu, interrupting] Well it is....    [Bishop, continuing] ... took by conquest from the Celts.    [Makwetu] That's right.    [Bishop] So, I mean this is how history, fortunately, or  unfortunately progresses, isn't it?    [Makwetu] Well, as far as we are concerned that is no  progress at all. If you deny other people land, you can't call  that progress.    [Bishop] OK. Then, the PAC government would take back land?    [Makwetu] Yes.    [Bishop] And give compensation?    [Makwetu] We will compensate you for improvements that you  have made on that piece of land.    [Bishop] But not for the cost of the land itself?    [Makwetu] Because we never sold the land to you. Why must we  buy it back now?    [Bishop] But you weren't -- I mean it could be argued that  you were not in possession, or there, to be bargained with! Not  previously, not in history, not so when the....    [Makwetu, interrupting] That is an....    [Bishop, continuing] ...not so when the Afrikaner farmer  bought this land, or took it over 250 years ago. I mean, you  know, your party wasn't there, as it were.    [Makwetu] Most of them never even bought that land, for that  matter. They were given that piece of land.    [Bishop] But in real terms, practical terms, wouldn't you  see  this kind of policy as a recipe for -- if not civil war -- mass  exodus? The people will fight to hold on to their land, won't  they, and really fight?    [Makwetu] We are fighting right now to regain that land, and  the sky has not fallen.    [Bishop] I know, but I mean if you were in power, as a PAC  government, and you instituted a policy like this?    [Makwetu] There is a regime that is in power now, that has  instituted a policy which has impoverished us.    [Bishop] Well, the regime says it's given away, you know,  given up the apartheid land laws, made it possible for  everybody, black and white, to buy land and live wherever they  like. I mean they, they've changed it.    [Makwetu] How are we expected to buy the land when we have  no  resources whatsoever, denied deliberately those resources?    [Bishop] Well, it's true, but then people, white people at  one stage had no resources and had to find them somewhere. I  mean with jobs and with progression and so on.    [Makwetu] Exactly, that is what we contemplate too. We must  create jobs for everybody to live.    [Bishop] Well, the economy is quite a large piece of your  manifesto, Mr. Makwetu. Redistribution of wealth figures  prominently there. Just outline how that would take place under  a PAC government?    [Makwetu] At present we note that the whole economy of the  country is in the hands of a tiny minority. PAC is opposed to  this. We feel that the African people should have a stake in the  economy which has been denied to them for centuries. We say,  therefore, that the industries that are operating in the country  should allow workers working in those industries to enjoy the  fruit of their labor. In other words, workers should not be  shear wage earners, but they should have a share even in the  profits. Not only that, but they should have a say in decision  making, and in order for them to be able to do so, they should  be furnished with information pertaining to those industries.    [Bishop] That's not too far from Mrs. Thatcher's caring  capitalist.    [Makwetu] That's why we talk of a caring economy here.    [Bishop] Yes. Did you get the word from Mrs. Thatcher then?  [laughs]    [Makwetu] No, not Mrs. Thatcher. In fact, I never even knew  that she ever uttered such a word.    [Bishop] She did. She called it caring capitalism. It was  also about shares, share capital being given to workers and so  on. All right. Where does this much vaunted and flaunted market  economy come in and are you for that? The market, you know, the  market?    [Makwetu] Well, we still have to be educated about the  market  forces, because we normally don't even see them. For instance,  when you talk of the selling of land you say market forces are  going to decide, only to find that there is hardly anybody who  is prepared to sell the land. So we have a problem with that  term, not unless it is defined properly.    [Bishop] And nationalization, you say no nationalization?    [Makwetu] Yes.    [Bishop] But socialization and democratization.    [Makwetu] Exactly.    [Bishop] Now, what will they mean, those two things?    [Makwetu] It's exactly what I said already.    [Bishop] Oh, that one.    [Makwetu] Democracy is the participation of everybody.  Similarly with socialization.    [Bishop] Looking at it, say, from the grassroots then, will  people with small shops, businesses, be affected by your  economic policies. Will they be restricted?    [Makwetu] No. In fact we will encourage more people to open  up businesses.    [Bishop] And keep the profits of their labor?    [Makwetu] Well, I have already indicated that they should  share the profits with the workers, because whoever is going to  start a business definitely will need somebody to assist in  their business.    [Bishop] Yes, but I mean, you know, will there be  profit-keeping?    [Makwetu] Of course, we have no problem with that.    [Bishop] And now the big companies, you know, the Big 20, as  they are called.    [Makwetu] Similarly the big companies, that's where quite a  big chunk of labor is involved. These are the people who must  be catered for.    [Bishop] If somebody said to you there is a large element of  command economy, collectivisation, control from the center in  your plan. Would you agree with that?    [Makwetu] What is the quarrel with that? Let us suppose  there is.    [Bishop] No, I'm not saying there is a quarrel. I'm just  saying -- would you agree that that would be a fair estimation  of what you might be up to as a new government?    [Makwetu] I'm not quite so sure that that is the correct  assessment.    [Bishop] Let's move on, and we'll talk about workers. You  should put a big emphasis on the workers. Your party, I think,  has always said it's a workers' party. Collective bargaining --  you go for that?    [Makwetu] Yes.    [Bishop] Some of the latest, and I think THE ECONOMIST  carries it -- whether you, you know, like that magazine or not,  carries a view that collective bargaining as applied in Germany,  for instance, has been a rather large failure, that, in fact,  instead of workers' wages being raised it has had the opposite  effect, that collective bargaining seems to not be working.  What would you say to that?    [Makwetu] It doesn't mean that if something failed in  Germany  it's going to fail here.    [Bishop] No.    [Makwetu] Similarly, capitalism has thrived in other  countries, but we have problems here at home.    [Bishop] The reason I particularly mention Germany is  because, under housing, you mention the German system soon after  the war and you think that might be applicable or at least worth  looking at as far as your system concerning housing might be.    [Makwetu] Yes. Well, it was just an example.    [Bishop] Yes, but you also stress it a little bit more, I  think. The example goes on to say that after the war, in  Germany, tax--wealth tax--was applied and you imply, in that  sentence anyway, that it might be a good thing to do that here.  Is that so -- wealth tax on property?    [Makwetu] Yes, there will be tax.    [Bishop] How would that be levied?    [Makwetu] Well, that will be the task of economists and  experts. I am not an expert.    [Bishop] Yes. It's been mooted that the tax in Germany was  simply on very large organizations, large land owners, hotel  owners, blocks of flats, people who owned that kind of property  -- not the individual man and woman with one house. Do you  think that's how that might go here?    [Makwetu] Well, I would not say so and so would be  advantaged  but we have made it clear that on issues like food, etc., we  will see to it that there is no tax levied.    [Bishop] Affirmative action, you say is not about lowering  standards or introducing reverse racism by the back door. You  don't see it then, but I would challenge you, you know, Mr.  Makwetu....    [Makwetu, interrupting] Let's hear your challenge.    [Bishop] All right, isn't affirmative action, really, it  is--I mean, let's have it out on the table--it's discriminatory.  It favors one race, sex, or age group, over another. Doesn't  it?    [Makwetu] That is not true.    [Bishop] But if I was going to be affirmatively actioned  because I'm a white, aging, or middle-class male -- we hear a  lot about that incidentally -- then I am being discriminated  against because I am not a black, young, virile male.    [Makwetu] How are you discriminated against, since you have  been benefiting all along?    [Bishop] No, I'm not...I'm not.... I'm just making an  example  of myself. What I'm saying is -- if you start saying: men out,  women in, or white people out and black people in, it's  discriminatory, isn't it?    [Makwetu] No, that is not affirmative action. We are saying  that doors should be opened to those who have not benefited all  along, long ago, through discrimination. That is what we are  saying. We are saying people should be trained to fit in into  certain positions which have been denied to them all along.    [Bishop] How will you do that?    [Makwetu] We will do that by developing skills. Instead of  importing skills, we will see to it that human resources inside  the country are developed.    [Bishop] Training schemes?    [Makwetu] Exactly.    [Bishop] No instant changeover then, you know, of people?    [Makwetu] No, these things are not going to happen  overnight,  really.    [Bishop] How long would you say it would take with a PAC  government to bring about the changes you would like to see?    [Makwetu] That is not an easy question to answer. I may say,  for instance, seven years or eight years, but the problem is,  there are people who are suffering at the moment. Are they  going to be patient waiting for me for that seven years or eight  years? So it's not easy for me. This is a debate amongst the  factor...[pauses] people who are involved.    [Bishop] I don't see, and you will know that I would spot  it,  anything about freedom of expression or the media in your  manifesto. Did you leave it out by accident or deliberately?  It's not in here.    [Makwetu] No, I don't think there was a need for it really  in  the manifesto, because that will be covered under a Bill of  Rights.    [Bishop] Well, let me ask you as leader of the party: What  is  your approach to freedom of expression?    [Makwetu] Of course, we encourage freedom of expression,  freedom of association, freedom of movement, etc.    [Bishop] Freedom of opinion, even if you don't like it?    [Makwetu] Exactly, exactly.    [Bishop] Hard questioning of evasive politicians. Is that  it?    [Makwetu] We have no problem with that. In fact, we  subscribe to Voltaire's position--that's the French philosopher  who was prepared to die protecting your right to put your point  of view.    [Bishop] Under housing I spotted something that I thought  might be a real vote catcher. You promised the township people  that if they paid sufficient rent to cover the structure of  their house, then it's theirs.    [Makwetu] Yes, exactly, that is our position.    [Bishop] But, says a fortunate township dweller who is now  in  this position, that Mr. Makwetu doesn't want freehold, so I'll  never really own the house. I'll just hold it as a curator for  the state. So, what would you say to him?    [Makwetu] Not for the state. You'll be a curator for your  next of kin. For instance, if you die it will be handed over to  you.    [Bishop] Oh, it can go to your next of kin.    [Makwetu] Yes, exactly.    [Bishop] So it would be an inheritable...    [Makwetu] Exactly.    [Bishop] We've got about 30 seconds. I could go on all  night, but we just have another item, I'm afraid, Mr. Makwetu.  Tribal leaders, traditional leaders -- PAC's views on those,  because they hold a lot of land in their power as it were.    [Makwetu] They hold no land in our country, really.    [Bishop] Don't they really?    [Makwetu] Absolutely next to nothing. You must bear in mind  that 87 percent of the land is in the hands of the white  community, and even the 13 percent is with them, a part of it is  not in their hands.    [Bishop] And in the last few seconds, health -- universal  health -- you are bringing forward....    [Makwetu] Yes.    [Bishop] Any private health? Would you allow private  practitioners, private hospitals?    [Makwetu] Well, that is a hot debate in PAC circles, but the  majority feels that we must have public health.    [Bishop] And education -- no private education?    [Makwetu] On education we feel that education should be made  free up to a certain standard, that is standard 10, or 18 years  of age.    [Bishop] No private education?    [Makwetu] We are opposed to private education.    [Bishop] What a pity, Mr. Makwetu. We've run out, I think.    [Makwetu] There's nothing we can do.    [Bishop] No, thank you so much anyway.    [Makwetu] Thank you.</p>

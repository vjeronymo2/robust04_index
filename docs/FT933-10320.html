			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Treasury chief hits back at department's detractors SIR Terry Burns, the top civil servant at the Treasury, has strongly defended the department against critics who accuse it of policy failures such as sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism and the decline of manufacturing industry, writes John Willman. In an article released today, Sir Terry says that much of the criticism arises from the Treasury's privileged position at the heart of Whitehall, which makes it an easy target when things go wrong. Too little credit has been given, he says, for changes made where the Treasury has acknowledged criticism as well-founded. Sir Terry concedes that there are arguments for an independent Bank of England to handle monetary policy, including 'weak' evidence that inflation is lower in countries with central bank independence. The demand for greater independence of the central bank is, he says, 'the most popular single answer to the problem of inflation that was once reserved for the ERM'.

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: L'Oreal sales surge to FFr34.5bn L'Oreal, the world's largest cosmetics group, yesterday posted sales up 14.4 per cent to FFr34.5bn (Dollars 6.74bn) at the nine months stage, based on average exchange rates. This would be equivalent to FFr47bn based on exchange rates at the end of last month, the company said. The group said full-year profit would be up 20 per cent on ordinary activities before tax - excluding any significant changes in exchange rates. The third-quarter results were re-stated following consolidation from July 1 this year of four new subsidiaries. The group announced a transfer and share purchase arrangement in September with Cosmair USA, Cosmair Canada, Lorsa/Fagel of Switzerland and Procasa of Spain. L'Oreal said the sales under the old basis of consolidation would have been up 7.6 per cent at nine months. Mr Lindsay Owen-Jones, chairman and chief executive, called the results 'very encouraging'.</p>

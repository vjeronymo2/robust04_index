			<p>Russia,   War   <F P=102> 944Q0263A Moscow OBSHCHAYA GAZETA in Russian No 11, 18-24  Mar 94 p 5 </F>  <F P=103> 944Q0263A </F> <F P=104>  Moscow OBSHCHAYA GAZETA </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim Dzikic, plenipotentiary of the </F> Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Moscow, by Seyfali  Akhundov; place and date not given: "Ground War"]    [Text] Passions surrounding the war in Bosnia are not  subsiding even after the West and Russia have done everything  possible, or almost everything possible, to restore peace in the  Balkans. In the opinion of Ibrahim Dzikic, plenipotentiary of  the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Moscow, in order to  treat the illness, one must have the proper diagnosis.    [Akhundov] How many Bosnian refugees are there in Moscow at  present? Has the Russian Government rendered assistance in  providing them services and utilities?    [Dzikic] There are no refugees in the legal sense of the  word, because none of them are registered as such. But there are  people who have fled the war or found themselves in Russia at  the moment it began. I believe more than a thousand such people  are in Moscow. And there are more throughout the territory of  the CIS. There are about 4,000 refugees from Bosnia and  Herzegovina. These include Serbs, Croats, and Muslims. Most of  these people are working at Bosnian enterprises in Russia,  primarily in construction. They are all registered with the Visa  and Registration Administration, like any other foreigners.    [Akhundov] Do you not consider it the least bit strange that  Russia has not to date established diplomatic relations with  Bosnia?    [Dzikic] Mr. Silajdzic, Prime Minister of the Government of  Bosnia and Herzegovina, was recently in Moscow, where he stated  candidly to Russian Federation Minister of Foreign Affairs  Kozyrev and his deputy, Mr. Churkin, that Russia's policy with  respect to the countries of the former Yugoslavia was  unbalanced. The absence of full-scale diplomatic relations  between our countries is one more confirmation of this. One gets  the impression that Russia is displaying a greater understanding  of Serb-related aspects of the conflict in the Balkans.    [Akhundov] What are they fighting for in Bosnia?    [Dzikic] In Bosnia they are not fighting for their religious  beliefs. In Bosnia they are fighting for land. The SFRY  [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] collapsed--the  communist idea ceased to exist. Then the Government of Serbia,  headed by Milosevic, put its stake in nationalism. They wanted  to create a Greater Serbia over most of the territory of the  former Yugoslavia. Bosnia and Herzegovina were to become a part  of this Greater Serbia. And that is when the war began. To  implement their plans, the Serbs conducted ethnic cleansing in  captured territories. There are just 1.3 million Serbs in  Bosnia, while there are about 8 million throughout the territory  of the former Yugoslavia. The Islamic community of Bosnia  numbers 2 million--the descendants of devoutly religious people  who adopted Islam in the 11th and 12th centuries.    At first a great deal was said about a third power being  involved in this war. It seems to me this is not true. Were it  not for Serbian nationalism, there would not be war either in  Croatia or in Bosnia. The war in the territory of former  Yugoslavia cannot be compared with the Karabakh conflict, or  with the war in Georgia, or with the confrontation in  Tajikistan--which certain commentators are attempting to do,  justly pointing out that the geopolitical interests of major  world powers are in confrontation in the three regions I  mentioned.    [Akhundov] How does one distinguish Serb from Muslim, Croat  from Serb, if they all speak the same language?    [Dzikic] Unless an individual declares what he is--Serb,  Croat, or Muslim--it is practically impossible to distinguish  among them. We have one language, Serbo-Croatian, and--if you  can say it this way--one mentality. From time immemorial three  religions have existed in Bosnia--Islamic, Orthodox, and  Catholic--which, in turn, influenced in one way or another the  formation of the ethnic groups professing them. The structure of  civilization and world outlook are formed based on religion.  There are no other distinctions.    [Akhundov] Volunteers from which countries are fighting on  the side of the Bosnian Muslims? What would you advise an  individual who asks you to help him make his way to the Bosnian  Army as a volunteer?    [Dzikic] We do not have any problems and never have had any  with people in the Army. We do not need volunteers from other  countries. We need weapons. A great deal has been reported in  the Russian press concerning volunteers from the Islamic states  allegedly fighting on the side of the Bosnian Government, but I  personally do not have such data. Other sources state that a  great many Russians are fighting on the side of the Serbs. A  certain Mr. Begayev approached me recently. He was involved in  sending Russian volunteers to the war in Bosnia and asked my  assistance in getting the bodies of two Russian mercenaries out  of Bosnia. There was another curious incident, where a Muscovite  came to our representation and asked me to help him....enlist in  the Serbian Army. I advised him to go to the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia Embassy, with a comment to the effect that he had  made a slight error in the address.    [Akhundov] What do you think about arms shipments from  Russia  to the Serbs? How are these shipments effected?    [Dzikic] A great deal is said and written about this, but as  always, there are very few specific facts. It is difficult for  me, a representative of one of the concerned parties, to comment  on this. I have one piece of information in this regard. At the  end of January 1994, a convoy of eight trucks was dispatched  from Russia to Bosnia. The cargo was intended for the Serbian  forces. It consisted of anti-aircraft systems and surface-to-air  missiles. I obtained the information from Sarajevo. All arms  shipments to Serbian forces in Bosnia come out of Serbia and  through Serbia. We have the names of officers in the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia Army who died escorting military cargo  from Serbia to Bosnia.    We have demanded that United Nations posts be set up on the  border between Serbia and Bosnia, which would be able to control  cargo shipments. However, the Serbs blocked any decision that  could be made in this regard.    Russian society is very poorly informed as to what is going  on right now on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Your  newspaper correspondents in Belgrade fall under the influence of  propaganda there. At first they were led to believe--and not  without success--that the Slavs in Yugoslavia were exclusively  Serbs. True, Russians have now come to understand that we are  all Slavs. Then they put their stake on the Orthodox kinship.  And now they are saying that Serbs are age-old allies of  Russia--which in itself is not true. From ancient times,  imperial Russia took advantage of either Bulgaria or Serbia to  serve its interests in the Balkans. When it was friendly with  the Bulgarians, the interests of the Serbs suffered, and vice  versa.    [Akhundov] The emergence of an Islamic state in the Balkans  does not elicit delight in the West or in Russia. Perhaps this  is one of the reasons behind the continuing bloodshed?    [Dzikic] We have never desired to build an Islamic state.  Our  ideal is a civilized, secular country where religion is  separated from the state and is the personal business of each  citizen. We can cite Turkey as an example--a country that has  developed for almost 100 years according to precisely such  principles. We have wanted to continue to live the way we used  to, together with Serbs and Croats. We were entirely unprepared  for war. What is going on right now in Bosnia is aggression  directed against us.</p>

Brazauskas is scheduled to make a speech at a session of the  CE Parliamentary Assembly in Strasbourg April 14.    Traditionally, one or two state leaders are invited to the  assembly's session. This time, Brazauskas will keep company  with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat.    Heinrich Klebes, deputy secretary general of the CE, said  although Lithuania is a small country, the assembly will listen  "very attentively" to Brazauskas' report.    At a press conference in Vilnius Wednesday [30 March], the  CE  official said Brazauskas is expected to assess the situation in  the Baltic states and in Russia. The CE would like to know the  president's opinion about the prospects of Russia's membership  in the organization and about the future of the Kaliningrad  region, Klebes said.    Brazauskas is also expected to discuss some domestic policy  issues, including Lithuania's preparation to join the European  convention on human rights and freedoms.    The protocol of the assembly does not oblige state leaders  to  answer questions of assembly members, but in Klebes' words, the  Lithuanian president is prepared to answer even spontaneous  questions. "The Parliamentary Assembly appreciates this," the CE  official said.    Commenting on prospects for the Baltic states to become  associate members of the European Union, Klebes expressed  certitude that this will happen soon, but reminded reporters  that the matter is not within his competence.    On Wednesday, Klebes completed his four-day visit in  Lithuania, during which he met with Lithuanian Parliament  Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas, members of the several parliamentary  committees and Lithuania's delegation to the CE Parliamentary  Assembly. The CE official also visited the second biggest  Lithuanian town of Kaunas.    Klebes said he is satisfied with the results of his stay in  Lithuania. In his words, it is very important to maintain close  ties with new members of the CE. [passage omitted]</p>

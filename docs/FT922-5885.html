			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading LATE buying and a firmer Wall Street lifted stock index futures yesterday in moderate volume, writes Christopher Price. The June contract started with a hangover from Tuesday's poor trade figures, trailing down from its opening level of 2,705. There was little buying during the morning session and June traded, at best, at its estimated fair value premium of 9 points, and often a few points below, reaching its low point of the day - 2,694 - at mid-day. However, June's decline brought renewed buying and the afternoon session brightened the day's trading. Sentiment was helped by a steadier Wall Street, underpinned by stronger US bonds. June rose gently through the afternoon, but with a late surge developing towards the close. It ended at 2,707, six points down on the previous session and around fair value. Volume was a moderate 7,698 lots. In after-hours' trading, June continued to improve, with traders predicting a positive start to today's session. In traded options, stocks with contract expiry dates yesterday were popular as traders sought to close positions. Hanson was the most heavily traded with 3,257 contracts, followed by Lucas with 3,004 and British Airways with 1,694. Total volume was 37,651 lots, up from Tuesday's 28,293.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> 3 AGGIE GRIDDERS HURT IN PARK ATTACK  </P> <P> Three Texas A&amp;M football players, including running back Darren Lewis,  sustained minor injuries during an attack they said occurred at a Bryan park.  </P> <P> Lewis suffered a minor cut on his left hand during the Sunday night attack but  was able to take part in practice Monday, the Bryan-College Station Eagle  reported today. Sophomore linebacker Quentin Coryatt, who was stabbed in the  chest and was treated and released from St. Joseph Hospital, is expected to  miss a few days of practice. Freshman linebacker Jason Medlock, who was cut on  the left arm, also was able to practice Monday.  </P> <P> Aggie Coach R. C. Slocum said the players were injured while trying to get away  from a group that attacked them. "From all I gather, it was a case of some guys  being jealous of the football players," Slocum said.  </P> <P> Police said they have no suspects in the case.  </P></p>

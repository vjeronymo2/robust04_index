			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Kuzmin] </F>   [Text] Tehran, 25 Jun -- The latest round of  Iranian-Russian consultations on achieving a Karabakh settlement  was held today in the Iranian capital. The participants  included Vladimir Kazimirov, a plenipotentiary representative of  the Russian president and the head of the Russian mediation  mission; and Morteza Bank, director general of the Islamic  Republic of Iran's Foreign Ministry.    V. Kazimirov told an ITAR-TASS correspondent after the  consultations that they had discussed the proposals to settle  the crisis that had been put forward by Russia and within the  framework of the Minsk Group of the CSCE. The Iranian  representatives assessed Moscow's initiatives as "close to the  requirements of reality." For our part, V. Kazimirov noted, we  consider the Iranian position to be well considered and marked  by an understanding of the objective situation. Iran showed an  interest in achieving the swiftest possible settlement and  cessation of hostilities. "In the Karabakh conflict there is no  side that has not suffered," V. Kazimirov said, "and there can  be no winner. Those involved in the conflict have, of course,  sustained differing losses. We understand the pain of  Azerbaijan, which has lost so much territory and has had to deal  with the appearance of such a large number of refugees. Nor,  however, have the Armenians gained anything from the war."  According to the Russian presidential representative, during the  consultations the Iranians did not display any partiality toward  any of the sides involved in the conflict.    In the course of a news conference in Tehran, Iranian  President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani emphasized that the  Islamic Republic is ready to do everything it can to halt the  bloodshed in the Transcaucasus. Answering a question from the  ITAR-TASS correspondent, he stated that "Iran considers  Azerbaijan to be the injured party."    It was agreed that the next round of consultations will be  held in Moscow.</p>

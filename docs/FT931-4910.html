			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Building coal mountains THE CURRENT 'solution' to the pit crisis being discussed in British government circles would involve paying miners to produce coal nobody wants and then stockpiling it. The only merit in this suggestion - with its echoes of European Community wine lakes and butter mountains - is that it might bring home the absurdity of further rigging the energy sector. When the government announced 31 pit closures last October, there was an outcry led by a number of backbench Tory MPs. Many were attached to the idea that, if only British Coal was given more time to cut costs, the threatened pits could have a viable long-term future. But, as the months have passed, it has become clear that few, if any, can be made viable without imposing huge costs on the economy. There may be a case for producing an extra 40m or so tonnes of coal over five years, which could save about six pits - though strike threats undermine the case by making coal supplies seem more insecure. If the price of coal were reduced to world market levels by subsidies, at a cost of perhaps Pounds 300m over the period, the electricity generators would buy the extra coal instead of imported coal. The hope is that productivity could then be improved and a subsidy would not be needed. The snag with keeping open any more of the threatened pits is that the coal has no guaranteed market. Hence the stockpiling idea, which could save another five pits, the minimum number the government thinks necessary to win over backbench dissidents. But the marginal cost of saving an extra five pits would be huge. Not only would the coal have to be subsidised, but the generators might have to be paid to keep their capital tied up in coal mountains. On top of these visible costs, there would be invisible ones. The power duopoly is understood to want immunity from reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission as a quid pro quo. Furthermore, building coal mountains would complicate privatisation of British Coal and so postpone the best chance to improve its productivity. Who would want to buy coal buried underground when so much was already on the surface? Such drawbacks may lead the government to re-examine other options for expanding British Coal's market. These include restricting output from gas-fired power stations, postponing competition in the electricity market, closing nuclear stations and stopping imports of French electricity. But the cost of such rigging would be written-off investments and higher electricity bills. Moreover, it would not even secure the long-term viability of the industry unless the distortions were to continue indefinitely. The least bad way forward would be for the government to acknowledge that no more coal should be produced than the market is willing to buy. If it feels the need to sweeten such a pill for political purposes, it could improve the already generous redundancy terms or put more money into job creation in mining communities. So far more than 7,000 miners have volunteered to leave on the current terms which provide average lump sums of Pounds 28,000. Even if the terms were improved substantially, this would still be cheaper than stockpiling coal nobody wants.</p>

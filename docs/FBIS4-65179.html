Before taking on the portfolio with his swearing in  yesterday, Maroni said he intended to keep on the job the senior  civil servants who had been managing the affairs of the  ministry's departments.    Still to name are the officials who usually become the  minister's closest aides, the chief of the secretariat, the  personal secretary and the head of the ministry's press office.    The chef de cabinet served earlier, at the end of last year,  as special commissioner for Milan when the great northern city  was temporarily without a mayor.</p>

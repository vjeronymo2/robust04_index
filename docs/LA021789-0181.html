			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> NORTH TRIAL TO BEGIN TUESDAY  </P> <P> The Iran-Contra trial of Oliver L. North has been set to begin Tuesday morning,  officials at the U.S. Courthouse said today.  </P> <P> Problems have been worked out over the use of classified material that North  wants to introduce in his defense, and U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell is  telling the jury to report at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, said the officials, speaking  on condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> A jury of nine women and three men was chosen Feb. 9, the same day the Justice  Department began trying to delay the trial. The department lifted its  objections Wednesday after receiving assurances from independent counsel  Lawrence E. Walsh, whose office is prosecuting North, that classified material  would be protected.  </P></p>

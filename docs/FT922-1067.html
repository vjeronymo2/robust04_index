			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Electrolux and AEG set for joint deal ELECTROLUX of Sweden, one of the world's leading white goods manufacturers, is poised to enter an agreement with AEG Hausgerate, a subsidiary of AEG of Germany, for joint production and development of household appliances. The deal would initially cover washing machines, tumble dryers and dishwashers which both companies make. They will continue to compete in the domestic appliance market under their respective brand names but in the long-term, they aim to have integrated plants to enable both companies to lower costs and increase efficiency. AEG Hausgerate had global sales of DM2.6bn (Pounds 892m) last year and around 10,300 workers in 16 countries. AEG group itself is 80 per cent owned by Daimler-Benz with sales last year of DM14bn and 76,000 employees. As well as household appliances it also produces rail and electrotechnical systems and components, automation technology and microelectronics. Under yesterday's proposed agreement, Electrolux will acquire 10 per cent of the shares in AEG Hausgerate with the option of increasing its holding to 20 per cent. In return, AEG will subscribe to debentures issued by Electrolux which will be convertible into ordinary B shares. Mr Leif Johansson, Electrolux president, said further financial details would be announced by the end of the year when the deal was completed. In a joint statement, Mr Anders Scharp, chairman and chief executive of Electrolux, and Mr Ernst Stockl, chairman of AEG' s board of management, said: 'To both AEG and Electrolux this arrangement will be strategic as a means to enable each party to meet the increasing competition from the US and Japan in the European domestic appliance market.' For the past two years, Electrolux has been supplying AEG with cold storage equipment and the experience of the two companies working together hastened closer co-operation. Together the two companies account for around 18 per cent of the German market in the household appliances they both manufacture. The deal has to be approved by the relevant anti-trust authorities and Electrolux shareholders. This is expected to happen in the early autumn. White goods war, Page 26</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul has announced that it  is unfair to claim that security is deficient despite the  existence of many security agencies in the country.    In an interview carried on Radio Free Lebanon's "Dialogue  With an Official" program, Dallul stated: We must not forget  that these agencies were very recently an object of admiration  and appreciation by all citizens and officials. We must have  confidence in the security agencies and give them a chance to  uncover the perpetrators of the crime. It is still premature to  say that they have failed.    Regarding coordination among these security agencies, Dallul  admitted there is a flaw in this respect, which he ascribed to  the statutes by which they were established which ignore the  issue of operational coordination among all these departments.    He added: Of course, the Central Security Council meets  regularly under the chairmanship of the interior minister, but  perhaps we should have more practical and effective coordination.    Dallul said it might be possible to give some good news to  the citizens to offset some of the sorrow that they have  suffered since the church bombing in al-Zuq. He said he has the  impression that there will be some results very soon, noting  that the citizens, officials, and media must support the  security agencies and disregard any aspersions against them at  this particular time.    Regarding reports of the arrest of some women who allegedly  carried out the bombing, Dallul said this is a lie told at the  expense of the security agencies and is not the work of any  agency seeking to discredit another.    He added: They exploited an individual working in a certain  media institution who also serves the interests of a certain  group and disseminated this report through him. The report aims  to confuse the entire investigation. The authorities  immediately arrested this person and interrogated him.    Dallul said that everyone who has been interrogated has been  treated as a witness with possible useful information, not  interrogated as a suspect.</p>

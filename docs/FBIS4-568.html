			<p>BFN     [Text] The three-day workers' strike called by the  Federation of Labor Unions of Niger [USTN] began today. The  USTN is demanding the annulment of the Right To Strike Act  passed on 17 March by parliament and a 30-50 percent salary  increase. Government Spokesman Moctar Diallo yesterday evening  reiterated the government's determination to enforce the act  rigorously. He also pointed out that the government is prepared  to raise salaries by 5 to 12 percent. It should also be noted  that deductions for up to five days of strike will be made from  the salaries of striking workers.    This morning, the USTN held a rally at the Place des  Concertations. On this occasion, the USTN secretary general  stressed the legal character of the strike. He urged members to  be more vigilant to ensure greater cohesion within the labor  federation. Finally, it should be noted that similar rallies  were held in the hinterland.    [Paris AFP in French at 1115 GMT on 12 April, in a  Niamey-datelined item, adds the following: "This morning,  Niamey Airport was closed to traffic. Similarly, banks,  insurance firms, and supermarkets in the capital were shut.

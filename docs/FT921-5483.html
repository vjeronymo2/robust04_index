			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Personal View: If the west wants to help Russia, now is the time Officials from the International Monetary Fund last week endorsed Russia's economic programme. At the same time, Russia announced further steps to reinforce its moves to monetary and fiscal discipline and to a market economy. The west is currently considering the question of foreign financial assistance to support our reforms. I should like to explain why speedy assistance is so important a reinforcement for our efforts. Our basic task is this. We must conquer a powerful inflation bequeathed by the old system, while at the same time rapidly introducing market forces and private ownership. We inherited a budget deficit of more than 20 per cent of gross domestic product, a mountain of roubles built up by years of monetary and fiscal laxness, and a crippling system of price controls. The result was a destructive combination of empty shops and explosive inflation. We took necessary and dramatic steps, in line with the serious situation. We freed most but not all prices in early January. Prices rose immediately by about 250 per cent, but since then they have risen little, and in some cases have declined. We tightened up monetary policy, and decisively cut the budget deficit, so that the flood of roubles has been brought to a trickle. The free market value of the rouble has started to strengthen as a result. However, the next phase of our reform will be at least as difficult as the first. To consolidate our budget gains, we will by the end of April free nearly all prices, including energy prices. Only rents, public transport, and some prices of utilities will remain controlled. Energy prices will move to world levels progressively over a couple of years, with an export tax accounting for the price difference. We expect energy prices to rise by a multiple of six in April. The resulting price rise will be a severe but unavoidable blow to our population. They cannot be fully protected against it without initiating an endless wage-price spiral. To prevent such a spiral from developing, it is important to 'anchor' the price level by pursuing tight monetary and fiscal policies, and by stabilising the value of the rouble against international currencies. In spite of the critical need to stabilise expectations, the future of our exchange rate is uncertain. Without foreign financial help, we cannot possibly attempt to peg the rouble, and certainly not at a socially and economically tolerable rate. At the current rate of about 80 roubles to the US dollar, average monthly wages in industry still amount to no more than Dollars 20. This disastrously low dollar wage reflects the utter scarcity of foreign exchange in our economy, the result of the anti-export bias of the old system, collapsing oil export earnings, and the severe debt crisis that we inherited. Already in 1991, our imports fell by about 45 per cent compared with the 1990 level, leaving the economy with an acute scarcity of foreign exchange. This shortage is contributing to the deepening industrial crisis. Across Russia, factories have run down the imported raw materials and spare parts needed to maintain output. Even though these factories can now buy foreign exchange in the free market for imports, with the weak rouble they are squeezed between the high cost of dollars and the low purchasing power of their domestic customers. Within a few years, our own exports will rise strongly as a result of the new market forces in the economy and the recovery of our oil industry; by then the foreign exchange shortage will then have been eased by our own efforts. However, in the coming year, we will have to rely heavily on foreign finance. We want to stabilise the rouble at a realistic rate, stronger than 50 roubles per dollar, and consistent with average monthly industrial wages of about Dollars 100 later this year. For this we will need foreign exchange reserves to help defend the currency, and a flow of balance of payments support to help us finance critically needed imports. To build up the reserves needed to defend the exchange rate, we have asked the Group of Seven leading industrial countries to provide us with a stabilisation fund similar to that provided for Poland. After allowing for the size of our country, this would amount to some Dollars 5bn. Ideally, of course, we would not have to draw on the fund, any more than Poland did. But the existence of the fund would be a clear warning to speculators that they could lose money by selling roubles. It is very important to us to have this fund in place within weeks rather than months. Since the impending price rises are bound to have a destabilising effect, it is vital to show our people that the increases are a once-for-all adjustment to complete our stabilisation, and not just another wave in a sea of inflation. In addition to the stabilisation fund, we have requested several kinds of help to increase the flow of imports into the economy. We need about Dollars 6bn in humanitarian assistance, food and medicine, in 1992, to make up for the terrible harvest shortfalls and the critical lack of pharmaceuticals. We need another Dollars 6bn or so in non-food imports, to keep production going in factories dependent on imported inputs, and to prevent the foreign-exchange crisis from driving living standards to intolerably low levels. We also need further relief on debt service (principal and interest) this year. We stand by our debts, and will be able to service them in full, but only if our reforms are given the chance to take hold. Our programme is comprehensive, practical and tough. But it must bring results as soon as is possible. This means that it must choke off inflation while sustaining a reasonable standard of living. We can then succeed with the critical tasks of privatisation and structural change, which are already in motion. Russia's economic policies for stabilisation and market reform are rapidly coming into place. If the west wants to help us, now is the time. Yegor Gaidar is deputy prime minister of Russia</p>

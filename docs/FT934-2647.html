			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Telford and Shropshire (6): Incomes falling / A look at the rural economy John Evans laid off half his workforce earlier this year. The staff at his 700-acre hill country farm in south west Shropshire went from four to two. He has less livestock as the subsidy cushion for sheep and cattle becomes less comfortable. He needs fewer people to look after them. The Evans family started on the farm as tenants three generations ago. Mr Evans is now a freeholder and he will pass the farm on to his sons who are already training to take it over. He is chairman of the Clun Forest branch of the National Farmers Union and, like his peers, he is coping with changed attitudes to agriculture. 'I was educated to maximise everything. My sons look at it from a more economic base: you can only produce what you can sell,' he said. On 600 acres of arable land, in the east of the county, Michael Dugdale, chairman of the Country Landowners Association in Shropshire, also wrestles with pressures aimed at reducing his production. He is setting land aside, as he must and, he says, 'we grow some crops - grass for seed, turnips for seed where there are no subsidies'. He is interested in oilseed rape for industrial use. 'Things like this will have to come in the future.' Farm incomes have been falling but there has been some recent relief. 'This year farming has been a little bit better than it has over the years. The harvest has been quite good. Price have been dropping lately but they were good prior to the harvest,' Mr Dugdale says. Against that, corn exports have not been as attractive as they were in 1992, largely because of currency fluctuations. If Shropshire is highly sensitive to both European Union agricultural policy and increasingly to the ebb and flow of market prices, it is because the rural economy plays a larger role in the county than in most others. The predominant land use is agriculture, accounting for 81 per cent of the area. Shropshire Training and Enterprise Council reported that, with construction and motor vehicle engineering, agriculture and horticulture is a favourite career choice for males. This choice is unwise since statistics show that the rural workforce has been shrinking. 'Between 1981-89 it experienced the second largest fall in employment of all industries: 1,400 jobs, a decline of 18 per cent. A loss of a further 1,500 jobs is predicted by the end of the decade,' reported Shropshire County Council. For all that, the number of people employed directly in agriculture is proportionately higher than the national average. The TEC noted, on the basis of the 1991 census, that in Shropshire agriculture accounted for 5.5 per cent of employment compared with 1.7 per cent for the West Midlands region as a whole. This is an ageing workforce. Nearly 66 per cent of those employed are over 35 and, of them, 75 per cent have been engaged for more than six years. Mr Evans points out that generations often follow each other on the same farm: grandfather to father, father to son. But there are variations within the county. 'There is very little Grade One land, but the arable land is good, and there's good dairy land - it gets the rainfall,' said Mr Dugdale. 'The big area is the uplands and that's the bit there's most concern about.' Livestock farming is the most labour intensive and it is most common in the uplands, where in some districts employment is far above the county average at more than 30 per cent. Shropshire splits into three main areas, with dairy farming in the north, arable in the east, and beef and sheep in the south and west, the Marches. 'Milk has come out of the hills - they have gone to beef and sheep, but on the valley bottoms, there's quite a lot of milking,' says Mr Evans. This sort of shift is not without its problems. 'Rising sheep numbers on upland landscapes present ecological problems. On the Long Mynd about 18,000 sheep are grazing an area where the ecological limit is estimated to be 5,500 sheep, according to the Country Landowners Association,' he says. But farm incomes nationally - and Shropshire is no exception - have been falling steadily since the mid-1980s as costs have risen faster than output prices and the European subsidy regime has become less generous and more controlled. Surveys of 1990-91 net farm income carried out by Manchester University and used by the county council show that the average farm income for dairying was Pounds 22,000 a year for Shropshire, slightly higher than the national average. For cropping it was Pounds 17,000, slightly lower than the national average, but for lowland livestock farming, a characteristic of the Marches, not enough was earned to cover costs. The loss of wealth in the Marches has led Shropshire County Council to work with Hereford and Worcester County Council in the preparation of an application to the European Commission asking for Objective 5b status. This would provide funds to help with the diversification of the rural economy in order to offset the changes which have been taking place in agriculture. 'Wales already has 5b status. To stop on the boundary is an entirely artificial termination of assistance, says Mr Bruce Crawcour, the Shropshire economic development officer. 'The Marches have exactly the same problems . . . If we get 5b status, that could bring in Pounds 20m over the next five years for Shropshire and Hereford and Worcester.' Spending would be concentrated on providing an infrastructure which the private sector might be induced to use. Private sector property development in the area has largely come to a halt. This would be a new pot of funding for an area of 160,000 people who, apart from their dependence on Common Agricultural Policy subsidies, have never before had European assistance. Among Shropshire farmers there is, in any case, an ambivalent attitude towards continental Europe. Mr Dugdale, noting the framing of the set aside rules and their apparent evasion by farmers in some parts of continental Europe, said: 'We feel strongly that we obey the rules and the others don't' But for Mr Evans 'the French are the best ministers of agriculture we've got'.</p>

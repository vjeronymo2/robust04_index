			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Italy alters privatisation plans: Turnround in policy threatens credibility of the new Amato government THE ITALIAN government bowed to pressure from foreign bankers, managers of state groups and politicians yesterday by abandoning a central element of its radical privatisation plan. The treasury said it had scrapped its aim, announced just two weeks ago, of grouping its main industrial and financial sector holdings under two new umbrella companies in preparation for privatisation. The plan had aroused fears among foreign bankers over the considerable foreign debts of Italy's existing state holding companies. These groups would have been broken up and their assets placed under two new super-holding companies, raising questions about the fate of the many foreign loans made to the companies and their subsidiaries. The Italian treasury had sent shockwaves through the international banking community in the past week by announcing that the debts of another state holding company, Efim, would be frozen for up to two years while the group was broken up. The plan to reshuffle the state's holdings into just two groups had centred on IRI, the main state holding group; ENI, the national oil concern; ENEL, the electricity authority; and INI, the insurance institute. Between them, these groups owe more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) to foreign banks. Professor Guiseppe Guarino, the industry minister who had proposed the scheme, insisted last night that the radical shake-up of public sector ownership would now proceed more effectively. But the turnround threatens the credibility of the new Amato government. 'This is a political setback for the government but probably a step forward for a more efficient means of reorganising the state sector,' a foreign banker said. The four groups, which were recently turned into joint stock companies in preparation for privatisation, will now remain with the treasury as their shareholder. The government gave no formal explanation for abandoning the idea of the two super-holdings. Foreign bankers are understood to have expressed concern at the lack of detail about the structure. They were alarmed at the uncertain legal status of the foreign debt of the existing groups, particularly IRI, ENI and ENEL. Bankers were also dissatisfied by the idea that they would be issued with bonds by the Italian government to back the debts of the two super-holdings, since it was unclear what interest rate or other terms would apply to the bonds. Their fears were heightened by the handling of the freeze on Efim's L8,500bn (Pounds 3.8bn) debts, of which some L2,300bn is owed to foreign banks. Only after five days of uncertainty did the treasury clarify that interest would be paid on Efim's obligations, though not for as much as two years. The managers of IRI, ENI and ENEL also objected to the plan, since it would have created a new layer of management which would have effectively put them out of a job. Politicians had voiced opposition to the plan because it threatened the balance of political power of their appointees on the boards. Under the super-holdings, the government planned to reorganise the companies in preparation for the privatisation of all or part of their operating companies. These span virtually every area of industrial and economic activity. Italian companies face credit rating scrutiny, Page 26</p>

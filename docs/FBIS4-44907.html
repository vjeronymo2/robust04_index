Although the  once-hot fever has now dissipated, we have recently seen a  series of achievements in this field. Among them, achievements  by Japanese teams announced one after another -- including the  preparation of a superconductive single-crystal thin film and  the observation of bulk superconductivity at a critical  temperature of 150K -- are being marveled at by researchers  worldwide. Japan may soon be leading the world in implementing  the dream superconductive devices.  <H5>  30-m-Thick Yttrium-Based Superconductive Thin </H5> Film    In a recent announcement, the Superconductivity Research  Laboratory (SRL) of the International Superconductivity  Technical Center (ISTEC) disclosed the successful preparation of  an yttrium-based (YBaCuO) superconductor's single-crystal thin  film by liquid-phase epitaxial growth, as a continuation of the  study concerning the single-crystal pulling (preparation of a  large single crystal through continuous growth), in cooperation  with the Nagoya Laboratory and the Fourth Laboratory.    The newly prepared, 30-m-thick single-crystal thin film  showed a critical temperature of 86K from its magnetizability  after two-hour annealing in oxygen at 500C.    Previously, thin films were prepared by deposition from the  vapor phase, e.g., the sputtering method, and it was difficult  to prepare single-crystal films. The new method, in contrast,  uses a comparatively simple device and permits the preparation  of high-quality films to any desired thickness. Thus, the new  method is said to significantly contribute to application  research of devices, clarification of basic properties, and  establishment of an oxide-based superconductivity theory.    On the latest achievement of SRL, Director Shoji Tanaka  enthusiastically told us: "Despite our having caused a sensation  seven years ago, we had been unable to achieve any practical  application because of the lack of material technology.  Therefore, while the world's attention was focused on ceramics,  we borrowed the single-crystal pulling technology from  semiconductors. This time we were successful. However, in order  to apply single crystals for electronics, we needed to develop  thin-film technology, especially, homo-epitaxy technology (using  the same material for both substrate and film), in addition to  single crystals. In this sense, the successful thin-film  preparation this time can be a breakthrough to start the  superconducting device era."    The newest single-crystal film was prepared by using the  SRL-CP (solute-rich liquid crystal pulling) method, which had  previously been developed to produce large single-crystal bulk  materials, with a substrate of MgO onto which  Y[.sub]1[/]Ba[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7-x[/] was  crystallized from a liquid phase.    The experimental apparatus consisted of an electric furnace  for heating, and a drive mechanism for the substrate. Oxides of  Y, Ba and Cu were blended at a pre-determined ratio, and the  blend was pre-baked at a high temperature for 10 hours. The  pre-baked powder was melted in an yttria ceramic crucible to  produce a liquid phase. The MgO single-crystal substrate, 10 x  10[.sup]t[/] x 0.5mm, while being rotated, was brought in  contact with the liquid phase to deposit a single crystal from  the liquid phase onto it.    The YBaCuO film deposited from the liquid phase onto the  substrate was confirmed to have c-axis orientation by X-ray  analysis. The thickness of the film prepared by a 15-minute-long  deposition process was 30 microns, as determined by microscopic  observation, indicating the extreme dense structure of the film.  Furthermore, X-ray reverse Laue photography revealed that the  film was a single crystal deposited from the liquid phase.  <H5>  Observation of 150K-Tc Bulk Superconductivity Under </H5> Ultra-High Pressure    About the same time the news on the thin-film preparation  was  announced, the three-organization team of SRL, the Second  Research Laboratory, and the Institute for Solid State Physics,  Tokyo University, reported that it had observed the initiation  of the Meissner effect at 149K (Tc[.sup]mag[/]) by a  mercury-based copper oxide superconductor (Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O) under  ultra-high pressure. The same sample showed Tc[.sup]mag[/] of  134K under normal pressure.    Thus, the material's Tc[.sup]mag[/] was increased by  applying pressure, and the 149K Tc[.sup]mag[/] was obtained  under 8.5 GPa (equals approximately 840,000 atm). This is  considered to be an extremely important achievement that hints  at the possibility of the development of a new superconductor  with a critical temperature in the vicinity of 150K.    The previous highest Tc[.sup]mag[/] for mercury-based  copper oxide superconductors had been 134K, much lower than the  temperature observed this time. A spokesperson at SRL told us  this: "On 10 August 1993, at the International Cryogenic Physics  Society meeting (LT-20), Professor C. W. Chu, University of  Houston, reported a Tc of 156K under high pressure of 15 GPa  (details are unclear as of this writing). The fact that similar  results were independently obtained by two research  organizations proves that this substance shows a high critical  temperature for superconductivity under ultra-high pressure."    The superconductor used for the observation of the record Tc  was a Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O-based material with the raw-material oxide  powder ratio, Hg:Ba:Ca:Cu, being 1:2:1:3. After blending powders  of HgO, BaO, CaO and CuO at the above ratio, the mixture was  molded. The green was sealed in an evacuated quartz tube,  calcined for one hour at 700C, and later subjected to  post-heat treatment for six hours at 300C in a flow of  oxygen.    As a result of X-ray analysis and high-resolution electron  microscope observation, the primary phase of this material  showed an Hg-1223 structure. Direct current magnetizability  measurements revealed that the material's Tc[.sup]mag[/] was  134K under normal pressure and that the material was a bulk  superconductor with a Meissner volume fraction of more than 10  percent.    This superconductor, along with a coil, was mounted on a  cubic anvil-type ultra-high pressure generator to measure the  material's AC magnetizability at various temperatures under  ultra-high pressure below 8.5 GPa.    Tc[.sup]mag[/] values determined from AC magnetizability  values varied with pressure as follows. Under pressure below 6  GPa, dTc[.sup]mag[/]/dP was large at approximately 2.0K/GPa,  whereas under pressure above 6 GPa, the slope decreased,  although Tc[.sup]mag[/] reached 149K under pressure of 8.5  GPa.    SRL explains it this way: "We were able to confirm, through  the observation under ultra-high pressure, that the Meissner  volume fraction with nearly the same level of superconductivity  was maintained under the high pressure as under normal pressure  (more than 10 percent) and that the material regained its  initial, normal-pressure characteristics when the applied  pressure was released. The Tc[.sup]mag[/] might have exceeded  150K, if pressure of more than 8.5 GPa had been applied."    During the first 60 years, since the discovery in 1911 of  the  superconductivity phenomenon, the critical temperature increased  from 4K to only 23.2K. However, since the discovery of  oxide-based superconductors in 1986, the critical temperature  (when it exceeds 77K, the cheaper coolant, nitrogen, can be  used) began to increase rapidly, and now it is almost at 150K.    Advantages of superconductivity include the passage of large  currents without power loss, the exclusion of magnetic force  penetration to the inside of a superconductor (Meissner effect),  and the passage of currents through a thin insulator layer  (Josephson effect). Thus, superconductivity is expected to not  only increase energy efficiency in an epoch-making fashion, but  also be applied in many different fields. While energetic  research is undertaken in many parts of the world, the recent  achievements in Japan must be extremely significant in spurring  practical applications of superconductivity, including  applications in the electronic field.</p>

The commission suggests that guarantees of the rights of  Russians permanently resident in countries of the former Soviet  Union be formalized in accords between Russia and each such  state. The same policy, the commission suggests, should be used  to ensure the rights of people from such states who live in  Russia. The commission will recommend that the president issue  a decree to that effect, Abdulakh Mikitayev, head of the  commission, said at its meeting on Tuesday.    Mikitayev said the Soviet Union's disintegration had left  about 50 Mn people, including 30 Mn Russians, outside their  historic homelands. He said many of them wished to go back and  that there were increasing numbers of refugees.    The commission says, in a document containing its proposals,  that ethnic Russians' basic rights were being violated in some  of the former Soviet republics. Latvia and Estonia, for  instance, do not give citizenship to hundreds of thousands of  their residents, thereby restricting their voting and property  rights and making their actual right to live in those countries  problematic.    The commission suggests dual citizenship for such people,  something the Russian law makes provision for, Mikitayev said.  He said Turkmenistan is so far the only state with which Russia  has a dual citizenship agreement. The commission also proposes  that Russian continue to be used in contacts between different  ex-Soviet states. Russia needs a special economic policy to put  those proposals into practice, the commission believes.    Federal Migration Service (FMS) chief Tatyana Regent said  Moscow should provide stronger protection for ethnic Russians'  economic interests in order not to "receive them impoverished"  if they choose to return to Russia.    She said one serious problem was illegal migration, which  was  the target of a presidential decree of December 16, 1993. To  carry out the decree, the FMS was setting up an immigration  control service, Regent said.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Son of BES' will only work if it is affordable Sir, The chancellor's proposals for a successor to the Business Expansion Scheme (dubbed 'son of BES'), the Enterprise Investment Scheme and the extension of capital gains tax relief for entrepreneurs re-investing in unquoted trading companies is to be welcomed, provided the next reading of the Finance Bill does not throw unwelcome and unnecessary hurdles in the way. One of the problems for entrepreneurs seeking investors, and for their accountants and other investment advisers, is the prohibitive cost of producing investment memoranda to comply with complex legislation on prospectuses or investment advertisements. While I understand that the principal aim of the Companies Acts and Financial Services Act legislation is to protect investors, financial advisers may be hesitant or even totally reluctant to send business propositions to potential investors, 'business angels', for fear of falling foul of the law. Let us hope that the deregulation measures announced by the chancellor to cut red tape will widen the category of investors exempt from the Financial Services Act and prescribe the minimum contents for a simple investment proposal which entrepreneurs and advisers could prepare without being caught out by current legislation. It would be a lost opportunity if a number of 'business angels' emerged ready to invest their profits from Stock Exchange securities and were prevented from receiving investment propositions from unquoted companies or their advisers because of over-zealous legislation. I regard it as important that smaller companies should be able to raise equity capital without incurring undue expense in complying with rules established to protect the public at large.

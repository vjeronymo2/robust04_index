			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Itochu Corp in Indian plastics link ITOCHU Corp, the Japanese trading group, is ploughing Dollars 50m (Pounds 29.2m) into a joint venture plastics plant in India - the largest investment there by a Japanese company. The decision is the most positive response to date by Japanese business to India's economic reform programme. It comes amid evidence of a sharp increase in planned investment in India by Japanese companies, as well as by US and European groups. In the first eight months of 1992 Japanese companies won approval for investment plans totalling Rs5.3bn (Pounds 110m), against Rs525m for the whole of 1991. Total foreign investment over the same periods jumped to Rs28.5bn from Rs5.3bn. Itochu is investing jointly with Reliance, the large Indian textiles and chemicals group, in two factories to produce polyethylene and polypropylene in a project costing about Dollars 400m in total. Each group will take a 25.5 per cent stake, with the remaining capital being raised through a public offering in India. Government figures published this week showed India is progressing in efforts to increase exports to promote growth. In the first five months of the financial year starting in April exports rose 4.6 per cent in dollar terms. Exports are not growing fast enough to cover increases in imports, which rose 22 per cent, leaving a deficit on the trade account of Dollars 2.3bn.</p>

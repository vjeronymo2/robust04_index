			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: WILL WARNING-STICKER SHOCK LEAD TO RATINGS SYSTEM?  </P> <P> If you're under 18, you better stock up on all your favorite Guns N' Roses and  LL Cool J. albums. Fast.  </P> <P> Record industry lobbyists have been hastily mounting a counterattack against a  flood of legislative proposals that would put warning stickers on albums or  preventing sales of "offensive" albums to under-18 rock fans. (See censorship  story, page 69)  </P> <P> But while record companies are trying to kill these legislative offensives,  some of the music industry's other key players -- retailers and record store  owners -- are coming out in favor of an age-bracket rating system similar to  the X-R-PG categories used in the movie industry.  </P> <P> "I'd like to see the record labels or some third-party organization get  together and form a Motion Picture Assn. of America-type organization which  could design a uniform sticker, labeling certain product as being X or R or  PG," said Mark Siegel, executive vice president of Shamrock Holdings Inc.,  which owns the California-based Music Plus chain and Sound Warehouse, which  operates 134 stores in mid-America and the South.  </P> <P> "I think the record companies are in the ideal situation to set up a ratings  bureau which could give us a self-regulated system, like the film industry,  instead of having so much confusion and debate over the standards that exist  today."  </P> <P> This kind of proposal drives industry moguls crazy, especially since they have  fought an MPAA-type rating system for years, deeming it unworkable. As National  Assn. of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences chief Mike Greene puts it: "I think it's  ludicrous to compare motion pictures to albums -- you just can't apply  MPAA-style criteria to music. It's a completely different art form. These  retail guys are just protecting their (butts)."  </P> <P> Still, it's no wonder why even a progressive chain like Music Plus wants a  coherent rating system. If any of the legislative bills pass, it's the record  store managers and clerks -- not the record execs or recording artists --  who'll take the heat (and either go to jail for 90 days or be fined up to  $300).  </P> <P> "These bills have scared the (expletive) out of us," said one top chain-store  exec who asked to remain anonymous. "They are an absolute nightmare for a  retailer. You can't listen to 700 new albums every month and make an  intelligent decision about what a concerned parent -- or some right-wing kook  -- might find offensive. To play it safe, you'd have to sticker every album.  Most big chains are going to be very slow in ordering new albums because  they're going to want to wait and see if a problem develops or not."  </P> <P> Record labels currently place small "parental advisory" stickers on potentially  objectionable albums, but policies and stickers vary with each label, who have  so far only stickered the most blatantly offensive releases. None of the  stickers remotely resemble the warning sticker described in Pennsylvania's  proposed bill, which would require record companies to warn consumers about  lyrics advocating "bestiality," "incest" and "morbid violence," even if the  song merely discussed drug or alcohol use.  </P> <P> "I think the record companies have been ducking the problem and putting the  burden on us," said Siegel. "I would agree that the (proposed Pennsylvania)  sticker goes too far. But it would be appropriate to have a sticker that could  be more easily noticed by clerks in the store."  </P> <P> Many retailers have already instituted measures aimed at calming community  fears. Siegel said his Sound Warehouse chain -- which has stores in 30 cities,  including Detroit, Chicago, Houston, Atlanta and Miami -- doesn't sell records  with warning stickers to under-17 pop fans. Plans to adopt a similar policy at  Music Plus stores is currently under discussion. Siegel said that his stores  continue to carry a wide variety of rap and metal records, but some potentially  objectionable records are kept behind the counter, available only upon request.  </P> <P> Will stickers -- or 18-and-under purchase laws -- have a chilling effect on  artistic expression? Will record companies, as film companies regularly do now,  start editing lyrics to get a prized PG-rating?  </P> <P> "Our social climate has always swung back and forth between free expression to  more restrictive views of art and in some ways we may be moving from the  freedom of the '70s and '80s back to the '50s," said Siegel. "But I don't think  this will hinder the flow of creativity -- or sales. If anything, this  controversy may inspire more artists to deal with issues that push the edge of  the social fabric."  </P></p>

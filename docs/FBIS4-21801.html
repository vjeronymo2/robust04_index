			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vyacheslav Afanasyev report: ``Kurds: Fight for </F> Survival'']    [Excerpt] ``We are willing to suspend all combat operations  under the supervision of international organizations and start  talks with the Turkish authorities. But if the Turkish  authorities refuse to come to the negotiating table, if the  genocide against the Kurdish population continues, we will  continue the struggle,'' Jamal Qadir, a spokesman for the  National Liberation Front of Kurdistan [NLFK], said at a press  conference in Moscow. This was organized under the title  ``Kurds: Fight for Survival'' in conjunction with the  Association of CIS Kurds. It was attended by Yuriy Nabiyev,  chairman of the association's Political Council.    J. Qadir gave specific examples of genocide against the  Kurdish nation. Thus two Kurdish villages whose population  boycotted the 27 March local elections were bombed and totally  wiped out recently in southeastern Turkey. People were killed  and wounded.    He described as lies and provocation the rumors that the  NLFK  is training fighters on Armenian territory and also that it was  involved in the recent explosion on the Baku subway.

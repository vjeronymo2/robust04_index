The  waffler Clinton could not force the Japanese prime minister to  accept firmer restrictions on Japanese trade, such as giving  more facilities for the entry of U.S. products into Japan.    Japan's rejection stems from the essence of U.S. policy and  logic and the market economy laws. Market economy, in the U.S.  book, means several things, primarily free prices, which are  determined by the market's supply and demand. However, the  United States, as a result of the decline in its industry and  economy, cannot compete with Japan by using democratic means.  Therefore, the only way to stop the Japanese march on U.S.  markets is to use force.    The United States has said it will impose sanctions on Japan  because Japan did not restrict its trade and set limits to the  free flow of goods. This position highlights two facts: The  United States adheres to the market economy when this enables it  to sneak into other countries, sabotage their economy, and  control them. The United States, however, rejects the market  economy when the other party is a stronger competitor, like  Japan. Thus, the United States has clearly deviated from its  capitalist economic system.    The other fact is that those who are called U.S. allies are,  in reality, not allies but satellites. This is because an ally  enjoys independence and equal opportunities and rights.  However, if this ally accepts what is unacceptable to it under  normal circumstances, then it is a satellite and not an ally.  The world is now taking interest in these two facts, especially  those who are described as America's allies. Those people have  started to realize clearly that the United States wants to turn  them into slaves who carry out orders. Is it time for another  Spartacus to appear and lead an uprising of the slaves of the  major world powers?</p>

			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / International Company News: Chemical to lift charge to cover merger costs THE new banking group created by the merger of Chemical Banking and Manufacturers Hanover announced on Tuesday it will have to take a bigger-than-expected fourth quarter charge against earnings to cover the expenses related to the link-up. The merger to form the new group, Chemical Banking Corporation, was formally completed this week. Original estimates were that a charge of Dollars 550m would be required to finance the deal, but the cost of the merger proved greater than expected and the charge has increased to Dollars 625m. The new Chemical, however, said it expected annual savings to be realised from the merger would be Dollars 750m by 1995. If this target was met, it would be Dollars 100m greater than first estimated. Chemical also announced plans to raise Dollars 1.25bn in a January stock offering, the proceeds of which will be used to boost the group's capital base. The new bank has assets of about Dollars 140bn and shareholders' equity of more than Dollars 7bn, making it the second largest bank in the US behind Citicorp.</p>

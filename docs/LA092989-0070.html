			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANADIAN MAPLE LEAF IS TOP-SELLING GOLD COIN  </P> <P> Ten years after it was introduced, Canada's 24-karat Maple Leaf glitters  brightest as the world's most popular gold coin, surpassing Britain's  Britannia, Australia's Nugget and the United States' Eagle.  </P> <P> "The Maple Leaf is in great shape," said Michael Brown of the Gold Institute in  Washington. "It will remain the premier gold coin, with the Eagle and the  Nugget fighting for second spot."  </P> <P> The Maple Leaf's birthday this month is marked by climbing sales and a 54%  market share regained since its main competitors slashed it to 44% after they  emerged in 1986 and 1987.  </P> <P> The Maple Leaf, featuring Canada's national symbol and Queen Elizabeth on the  flip side, was introduced in September, 1979.  </P></p>

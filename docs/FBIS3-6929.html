At the contact, they openheartedly discussed matters of  common concern, including the tasks facing the Chondoists and  Tangun Taejonggyo believers in the North and South of Korea in  achieving the independent and peaceful reunification of the  country through the great unity of the whole nation.    An agreement was adopted at the contact, which says:    "Considering that the great unity of the whole nation fully  accords with the Chondoist idea of concord and the Tangun  Taejonggyo's spirit of promoting human interests, the Chondoists  and Tangun Taejonggyo believers in the North and South will make  joint efforts to achieve great national unity on the principle  of subordinating everything to national reunification, the  common cherished desire of the nation, as Paedal (Korean)  nationals, transcending the differences in ideology and social  system, and to achieve the country's reunification, the supreme  task of the nation, on the three principles of independence,  peaceful reunification and great national unity.    "The Chondoists and Tangun Taejonggyo believers in the North  and South will make joint efforts to accomplish the cause of  national reunification in the 1990s without fail through mutual  contact and dialogue.    "The recent disinterment and scientific study of the Tomb of  Tangun in Pyongyang was a historic event which confirmed that  the Korean nation is a homogeneous nation that has developed a  long history of five thousand years and brilliant culture, with  Tangun, a real person, as its father.    "The chairperson of the Central Guidance Committee of the  Korean Chondoist Association invited delegates of Tangun  Taejonggyo in South Korea to visit Pyongyang and participate in  the ceremony for the completion of the Tomb of Tangun after its  reconstruction, and the leader of Tangun Taejonggyo invited  delegates of Chondoists in the Northern half to visit Seoul. On  that basis, the sides confirmed each other's willingness to  dispatch their delegates to Pyongyang and Seoul in the  convenient time.    "The Central Guidance Committee of the Korean Chondoist  Association will deeply study the proposals of the South Korean  religious leader -- the North and the South should jointly  observe the national foundation day and other traditional  functions as proposed by the religious leader of South Korea,  define and restore holy places of Tangun in North and South and  hold an academic seminar of scholars in North, South and  overseas on Tangun in an appropriate time and the Northern  headquarters of Tangun Taejonggyo be set up -- and then inform  the competent organ of the result.    "The sides promised to make active efforts to carry the  agreed points into practice."</p>

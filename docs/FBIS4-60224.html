			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Excerpt] The command of God has been delivered, so don't  be too persistent. This is what we tell the gang of apostasy  and secession. This is because the announcement of secession  made by the traitor 'Ali Salim al-Bid is evidence that his hour  and that of his gang has come and that God's command will be  implemented at the hands of his honest slaves of the sons of  Yemen in the battles of honor and sacrifice and on the axes of  combat. When the time comes for the implementation of God's  command, this cannot be delayed or prevented. This is  especially true since God does not reward the actions of the  corrupt and He is always watchful of the traitors.    'Ali Salim al-Bid and his traitorous collaborators have  asked  for it. They have dug their own graves. They have preferred  blindness to guidance and violated their commitment and pledge  to God, so He led them astray, blinded them, and promised them  severe punishment.    They have thought their weapons would save them from God and  the people. But God surprised them and threw panic into their  hearts and made the unionists stand firm. Thus, all the people  are now fighting the battle against al-Bid and his gang. The  gang is now closer to falling in the abyss and very near its end.    Have they not heard the marching of the forces of legitimacy  and unity when these forces continued to capture locations,  hardware, and various weapons? Have they not learned that the  forces which they had controlled are daily joining the forces of  legitimacy in all positions? Have they not heard that the  nationalist parties and popular bodies and organizations have  all condemned their grave traitorous act? Have they not heard  the unionists within the Yemeni Socialist Party condemn this  malicious secessionist crime and disown this malevolent  traitorous action? Have they not seen the world ridicule their  traitorous action?    Indeed, they have heard and seen all of this. We shall leave  them in their trespasses, to wander in distraction. [Koranic  verse] They are embarking on an adventure and are shooting  their arrows right and left. Therefore, what they have done so  far, and what they will do, are no more than random acts  committed in the dark. [passage omitted]</p>

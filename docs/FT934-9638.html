			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Ciampi speeds intelligence service reform REFORM of Italy's much discredited intelligence services had to be carried out before the end of the year, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, told parliament yesterday. The tight timetable underscores the government's concern about the damage being caused by an ever widening scandal over embezzlement of intelligence funds and a deliberate campaign by members of the intelligence community to denigrate ministers as well as President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. The scandal took a new turn yesterday when Mr Alessandro Voci, head of the domestic intelligence service (Sisde) from August 1991 to July 1992, resigned as special administrator of the dissolved Rome city council following allegations of involvement in misusing Sisde funds. Mr Ciampi proposed last month to merge domestic intelligence (Sisde) with military intelligence (Sismi) in a single body controlled directly by the cabinet office and answerable to parliament. But he is handicapped because the shake-up of so sensitive an area requires a broad political consensus and was not part of his brief when he agreed to become premier in May. The reforms risk provoking a controversy with the Christian Democrats who have controlled the interior ministry - responsible for domestic intelligence - since 1946. This is the only portfolio to have been held by one party throughout the post-war era. Mr Ciampi revealed that funding for the intelligence services had been L696bn (Pounds 289m) in 1992, of which L359bn was on a secret unaccountable basis. This year the budget is expected to be L724bn. Until now, these funds have been spent without any accountability, and more than 14 former Sisde employees are now accused of having syphoned off money for their own purposes. An equally serious allegation being investigated by Rome magistrates is that part of these secret funds were used to supplement senior officials' expenses. Two former interior ministers and Mr Nicola Mancino, the current minister, are due to give evidence to magistrates today on this issue. A further allegation is that secret funds have been used to pay kidnap ransoms at politically sensitive moments, although the law formally forbids such payments.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Counter staff to strike against 'back-door sale' of post offices One-day post office strikes will be held in the run-up to Christmas after counter staff around Britain rallied to their union's call to oppose the 'back-door privatisation' of services. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, told the Commons that industrial action by counter staff was 'extremely unwise'. He said strikes were aimed at trying to 'frustrate the management of the Post Office transferring individual post offices from the public to the private sector'. There were majorities in favour of striking in only 20 out of 71 areas. In the ballot, a narrow majority of the entire UK counters' staff rejected the strike call, by 51 per cent to 49 per cent. Each postal area has been allowed to decide whether to take industrial action. Substantial support for a strike was recorded in London, Glasgow and Merseyside, as well as Bristol, Worcester and Hereford, Sheffield, Shropshire and mid-Wales, Reading, Exeter, Plymouth and east Cornwall, Aylesbury, Hemel Hempstead and High Wycombe. Cities voting against included Birmingham, Manchester and Newcastle. The Post Office said the ballot result was 'a resounding rejection of unnecessary industrial action'. The union had 'no natural mandate' and any strikes would be 'pointless and misguided'. Only a 'small minority of crown offices could be affected by a few single-day stoppages', the Post Office added. 'More than 19,000 post offices will be open for business as usual. Whatever action the Union of Communication Workers takes will have no affect whatsoever on the nation's Christmas mail.' Mr Ernie Dudley, the union's national officer, said: 'Many of the areas most affected by closures will be taking action over the next month in a campaign which will unite post office workers with the public and build on the recent defeat of Post Office privatisation.' The union said that, in spite of the U-turn over privatisation, the Post Office counters' service was continuing to shut down main offices, franchising many of them to retailers. It pointed out that half the country's main post offices have closed since 1989, and only 800 have experienced counter staff. Mr Dudley said only 397 main post offices would remain by 1999. 'Unless we take action now, 400 will close in the next four years. The planned strikes will give people a taste of what the future may hold if the needless policy of closures does not stop.' But the Post Office denied it was closing main post offices and said the number providing a full range of services was about 1,500, the same as four years ago.</p>

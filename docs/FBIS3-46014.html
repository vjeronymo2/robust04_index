Kozyrev, who last visited China in December 1992 with  President Boris Yeltsin, is due to spend 48 hours in Beijing  before taking a brief trip to the Shenzhen special economic zone  near Hong Kong and visiting the ancient central capital of Xian,  the home of the terra cotta warriors.    During his meetings in the capital, the minister is due to  discuss the upcoming visit to Moscow of Chinese President Jiang  Zemin, which is scheduled some time within the next six months,  the Russian sources said. Kozyrev is due to meet Jiang and  Prime Minister Li Peng on Friday. He is also due, along with  his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen, to sign an accord setting  up regular consultations between the two, the Russian Embassy  here said. A second accord due to be signed concerns border  crossings for traders, the Russian sources said.    In 1992, Russian-Chinese trade amounted to six billion  dollars, 80 percent of which passed through their common, 4,500  kilometer (2,790 mile) border. Two-thirds of trade is based on  barter.    "Sino-Russian relations are very good and have been steadily  growing," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said  last week.    Chinese officials closely follow the situation inside  Russia,  and the matter will be one of the primary topics of discussion  during Kozyrev's visit. After the Sino-Soviet rift that  developed in the beginning of the 1960s, the two communist  giants officially reconciled in 1989 during a visit to China by  Mikhail Gorbachev. Since Boris Yeltsin came to power in 1991,  the neighboring countries have enjoyed strong military  cooperation. A Russian diplomatic source who spoke on condition  of anonymity said the military issue would be on the agenda and  that the minister "is capable of broaching all issues."    The Chinese leaders will most likely ask for an explanation  about the delay in delivering Russian Sukhoi-27 jets, other  Russian sources said. The Chinese air force ordered 24 such  jets worth more than a billion dollars in 1992, but only a dozen  of them have been delivered so far. The military hardware  factory in Komsomolsk, in far eastern Russia, is suffering from  a shortage of spare parts, the sources said.    During his visit, Yetsin spoke of the great prospects for  Sino- Russian military cooperation, recalling that much of  China's technology and equipment came from the former Soviet  Union, and thus that China needs Russia's spare parts and  technological assistance. Russia constructed 256 arms  manufacturing plants in China following a 1950 alliance treaty.    In November 1993, the Russian defense minister Pavel  Gratchev  signed a five-year military cooperation accord with his  counterpart Chi Haotian. The Chinese army prefers  less-expensive Russian material to Western equipment because of  its price. According to Western military experts, China wants  to buy fighter planes, particularly MiG-31s, ground-to-air  missiles, and technology for missiles, tanks, radar and  in-flight refuelling.    The issue of security in the Asia-Pacific region, which was  broached during Gratchev's visit, will also figure prominently  on the agenda of Kozyrev's discussions in China, the Russian  sources said.</p>

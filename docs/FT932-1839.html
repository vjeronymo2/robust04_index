			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Letter: Give more than you promise Sir, The implications of the present downturn for Europe's carmakers may be even more profound than Kevin Done's excellent review ('Carmakers hit the panic button', June 17) suggests. The reunification boom in Germany masked a real decline in comparable car sales in Europe from the high in 1989 of 13.5m units. After 1990 Europe switched from a seller's to a buyer's market for cars - a sea change whose implications Europe's industry has only begun to address. In a buyer's market, the customer has all the answers. All too used to taking the customer for granted, Europe's carmakers must now make the customer the focus of every operation from research and design through production to sales and after-sales. Thorough and open-minded appreciation of the customer's needs (not easy in an autocratic industry) discloses the right solution for every problem. Of all the customer-pleasing actions that we have identified in our car industry research, one stands out: under-promise and over-deliver. Whether in a sales pitch, a warranty or a repair, giving more than you promise wins long-term friends. Those who adopt this positive philosophy soonest will find themselves the least affected by the next 'sickening downward lurch' in Europe's increasingly cyclical car market.

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Technology: Beet takes a beating - Worth Watching An artificial sugar beet with built-in electronic sensors should give farmers plenty to chew over this harvest. Every year farmers are vexed by the amount of beet that gets damaged during harvesting. As much as a third can be harmed by the harvesting machinery. Help is at hand in the form of battery-powered sugar beet from Adas, the agricultural development service. It is thrown in with the ordinary beet and bumps through the harvester alongside it. Electronic sensors, contained within a thin, carbon fibre shield and a coating of rubber, reveal where most damage occurs during the process. Adas: UK, 0525 860077.</p>

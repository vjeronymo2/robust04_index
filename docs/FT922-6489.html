			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy The stock market brushed aside yesterday's GDP figure, even though the UK recovery will now be starting from a lower base than most analysts had predicted. Provisional estimates that output fell 0.6 per cent in the first quarter, moreover, suggest that anyone forecasting an increase of much more than 1 per cent for 1992 as a whole may spend this weekend doing a touch of downgrading. More encouraging, though, were last night's findings of the Confederation of British Industry's latest monthly trends survey, which may have contributed to a generally firm tone in equities before the close. Total order books are still below what respondents consider normal, but they are at their best level since August 1990, and export orders are at their best since October 1990. The survey evidence is not definitive, but more such news will help investors convert bullish instincts into substantial buying orders. For the moment there remains a nagging feeling that there have been false starts before.</p>

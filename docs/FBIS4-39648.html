			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, [no dateline as received] -- During the  division of the Black Sea Fleet, Ukraine can receive 18.3  percent of each class of ships, give or take 5 percent depending  on the importance of a particular class of ships for Ukraine.  This proposal satisfied both sides at the Ukrainian-Russian  negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet on 8 June.    Experts on both sides also agreed on the division of  warships. The list now has to be approved by members of  Ukraine's and Russia's state delegations.    The talks on 9 June will concern the thorniest issue of  dividing the coastal infrastructure. Russia proposes that the  main base of the Russian part of the fleet should be Sevastopol.  But the Ukrainian side proposes that the final document puts it  in a different way: not "the main base of the Black Sea Fleet is  the city of Sevastopol" but "the main base of the Black Sea  Fleet is in the city of Sevastopol."    Commenting on the course of negotiations, Russia's  ambassador  to Ukraine Leonid Smolyakov said: "There are breakthroughs, and  the talks are held in a balanced manner." Asked by UNIAN  whether an agreement on the Black Sea Fleet could be signed  before the presidential election in Ukraine, Leonid Smolyakov  said no. In his opinion, "the problem of coexistence and  interaction between two large military structures cannot be  solved in a short space of time." According to the ambassador,  "the problem of the Black Sea Fleet will continue to exist after  26 June."</p>

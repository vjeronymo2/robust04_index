			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As the IZVESTIYA newspapaer said today, initial  information on the contents of the black boxes from the Russian  Airbus that crashed in Siberia has been received from Paris.  The catastrophe on 22 March killed 75 people.    [Unidentified correspondent over video of crash site] The  results of the analysis of the contents of the black boxes are  to be announced tomorrow. However it is already known today  that despite earlier interpretations, the crew of the Airbus  were alive and continuing to converse among themselves in the  last few minutes of flight. Specialists will, therefore, have  to refute the theory that the catastrophe came about as a result  of instantaneous decompression. The Russian experts in Paris  will attempt to identify the pilots' voices and draw up a  precise transcript of the conversation.    At the same time, the other box, in which the functional  parameters of all the components of the Airbus are recorded, is  being decoded. The information retrieval process will probably  take up until the end of this week, and the results of the  decoding will be passed to members of the investigative  commission. Only then will the final verdict be made.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Roland Shawto step down as chairman of Premier MR ROLAND Shaw, a founding father of the British independent oil industry, is stepping down from his executive role as chairman of Premier Consolidated Oilfields, the company he has dominated for a decade. At a board meeting last week, Mr Shaw confirmed that he would become a non-executive chairman after Christmas, according to sources close to the company. Mr Shaw has been under some pressure from shareholders to take a less dominant role in Premier since his 70th birthday last year. In June he relinquished the chief executive position to Mr Charles Jamieson, who has been with Premier for a decade since leaving Gulf Oil. Mr Shaw said yesterday he would not be retiring 'this year or next' from the company he built up over more than 20 years. Premier was one of the first of the small UK independent oil companies in the early 1980s. At its peak in 1989, the stock market valued it at more than Pounds 500m. Like many of the other smaller independents, Premier has since fallen out of favour with the stock market and the company is now valued at less than Pounds 100m. Mr Shaw says Premier is also still suffering from the market's indigestion following the fiasco surrounding a badly handled placing of Burmah Castrol's 29.9 per cent stake two years ago. Kleinwort Benson, the stockbrokers, took the stake on its books but only placed the deal, at a loss, with the help of Cazenove.</p>

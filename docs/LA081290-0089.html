			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REFLECTIONS: 'THE REACTION FROM GIRLS WAS AMAZING . . . . I WOULD FALL IN LOVE  FOUR TIMES A WEEK.'  </P> <P> Back in the late 1960s, when Joe Miazgowicz was a student at the University of  Michigan, he learned that his best friend had been turned down by every campus  band. So they created their own band: Leaves of Grass. Miazgowicz was the  rhythm guitarist for the highly popular rock 'n' roll campus band, which played  a wide range of music from Chuck Berry to Bob Dylan to Wilson Pickett. After  graduation, members went their separate ways. They last played together in  1973. Miazgowicz moved from Ann Arbor to Encinitas, where he now runs a  business, Juicer Plants, and referees professional ice hockey games. Last month  Miazgowicz, 41, dusted off his guitar for an "amazing experience," when his  fellow band members flew in to play a reunion concert at MiraCosta College.  Miazgowicz spoke with Times staff writer Terry Rather and was photographed by  Barbara Martin Pinhero.  </P> <P> We all met in the dorms as freshmen. There were a couple of other guys who  liked to play music, so it became a ritual every night after dinner. We played  for an hour or so, old Beatles songs, jug band music, crazy stuff like that.  Only I guess back then they weren't old Beatles songs. Near the end of the  school year, Rhone Bourdages, who was on the same floor as me, started  auditioning for campus bands, but he couldn't get in. At that point we decided  that when we got back to school we would put together our own band.  </P> <P> Rhone came up with the name of the band right out of his English class. "Leaves  of Grass" is Walt Whitman's book. It certainly had other connotations, which  fit right in for the times.  </P> <P> So we came back the fall of '67 and it was real grim at first. We were not very  good at all, but we had fun. We started getting some jobs later that fall. Our  first was a fraternity mixer, that fall in '67 during the football season. We  also played T.G.I.F. afternoon mixers. That was our training ground there, just  kick out the jams for two hours.  </P> <P> It was real exciting. The other guys had played in bands before and I hadn't,  so they taught me rock 'n' roll professionalism, you can't let them know when  you're upset, keep playing, just muscle through even when you don't know  things. I was in awe. It was great having people dance to our music.  </P> <P> Having the reaction from girls was amazing. That was like a gift from heaven. I  was only just into it for the fun, but what a bonus! I would fall in love four  times a week. There were beautiful girls all over the place. Our popularity  grew pretty slowly, but we were one of the best campus bands by the time we  graduated. In our last couple of years, we traveled all over Michigan during  the summers. Graduation was the thing that disbanded us.  </P> <P> We've all stayed in touch over the years. Rhone and I were probably the closest  and I hadn't seen him in a couple of years.  </P> <P> Our reunion was amazing. I was the only one who had a couple of tapes from way  back when. We listened to a couple of them. We were like, oh man, do you  remember this song? I think so, do you remember the words? I don't think so.  But when we started playing them and, like bicycle riding time, they were just  there all of a sudden. As soon as we started, there it was. The harmonies were  right there. We knew all the words. There were a few glitches and we worked  them out.  </P> <P> People liked us a lot. We played for the students and they all liked it. We  also played a party and there were a few people who were official Deadheads.  They went nuts. They said, you guys are all right! We did a lot of different  songs and we did quite a bit of our old original stuff.  </P> <P> I have a wife and two kids here, we all have families, jobs and commitments, so  it would be hard to keep the band together. But something like this every once  in awhile would be great. A month ago, I never thought something like this was  possible, but now that we've done it, we can do it again in the future.  </P></p>

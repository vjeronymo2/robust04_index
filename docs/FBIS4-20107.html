			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, April 27 (AFP) -- North Korea Wednesday [27  April] responded to conditions posed by the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) for inspection of one of its nuclear  plants, but diplomatic sources close to the Agency said the  response was not fully satisfactory.    The IAEA had set a series of conditions to the sending of  inspectors to monitor the replacement of spent nuclear fuel rods  at a five megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, a plant which the United  States suspects of being used to produce nuclear weapons.    The North Korean "response is currently being examined by  the  IAEA services and we are in consultation with Agency member  states," IAEA spokesman David Kyd said.    A diplomatic source close to the Agency said however that  "the North Korean response might not be entirely satisfactory  and it is practically ruled out that inspectors [will] leave  (for Korea) before the end of the week."    Differences reportedly centred on how the spent fuel rods  should be controlled, the source said.    "It is essential for the IAEA, that our inspectors be  allowed  to take samples of some of the spent fuel to prove that the  North Koreans have not diverted any nuclear material for  military ends. We want to be present during the whole period of  the unloading of the reactor and we demand that all the spent  fuel from the reactor be placed under the Agency's control," Kyd  said.    The North Koreans have said they want to start unloading the  reactor at the beginning of May and have consequently asked that  the IAEA send inspectors as soon as possible. The whole  operation should last about two months, Kyd said.</p>

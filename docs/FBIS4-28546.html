			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Business sentiment among  major manufacturers improved, with the quarterly "Tankan" survey  index standing at minus 50 in may, up from minus 56 in the  previous survey, the Bank of Japan said Friday [10 June].    The diffusion index for major nonmanufacturers improved to  minus 42 from the previous minus 46, the survey showed. Major  manufacturers said in the previous February survey that business  confidence would improve to minus 50 in may, while major  nonmanufacturers saw an improvement to minus 40. The confidence  index represents the percentage of companies answering  "positively" minus those responding "negatively."    The labor index, or the net saying excessive labor force,  for  major firms, improved to 26 from the previous 28. The index of  product inventories, or the net saying excessive stockpiles,  stood at 23, compared with 30 in the previous survey.    Major manufacturers and nonmanufacturers plan to cut their  capital investment for the current fiscal year by 3.7 percent  from the year earlier, revising their plans from a yearly 4.5  percent decline in the previous survey.</p>

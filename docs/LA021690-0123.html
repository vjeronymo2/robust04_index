			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EL TORO AIR BASE ADDED TO EPA'S TOXIC-DUMP LIST  </P> <P> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday that it has placed the  El Toro Marine Corps Air Station on its Superfund list of toxic waste sites  because of contamination in abandoned storage drums, landfills and ground water  caused by four decades of dumping by the military.  </P> <P> Federal officials said the base contains several landfills and firefighter  training pits where hazardous wastes such as jet fuel and paint thinners may  have been dumped in the past. They said there are also abandoned storage drums  with low-level radioactive waste, explosives and other scattered deposits of  battery acid and fuels.  </P> <P> Officials have also reported a large plume of contaminated ground water that  will be addressed under the Superfund program, officials said.  </P> <P> EPA officials say that the waste sites pose no immediate health risk but that  "there's potential for a long-term problem," said Virginia Donohue, a  spokeswoman from the agency's regional office in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Master Sgt. Steve Merrill, a public affairs spokesman at the El Toro base, said  the Marine Corps station is grateful to be on the Superfund list.  </P> <P> "They have a lot of experience in environmental investigation," he said.  "They're going to provide a logical and scientific approach to the cleanup  efforts."  </P> <P> Because the military base is a federal facility, the Superfund designation will  not release additional funds for the cleanups. EPA guidelines prohibit the use  of the fund to pay for the cleanup of federally owned sites.  </P> <P> Instead, the cleanup will be paid for by the U.S. Department of Defense. The  Superfund designation, however, will increase the priority of the effort for  the Defense Department, officials said.  </P> <P> The El Toro base will benefit from the inclusion because "it elevates you above  other priorities," Donohue said. "These problems get cleaned up first."  </P> <P> Officials said they did not know how much the cleanup was going to cost. First,  they said, an investigation will be conducted to determine the extent of the  work that is needed. Donohue said that she did not know how long the  investigation will take but that it could be several years.  </P> <P> The EPA identified 14 separate hazardous waste sites on the Marine base that  will be included in the Superfund designation for inspection, cleanup and  monitoring by federal environmental officials.  </P> <P> The El Toro base already has started some studies on the sites through the  Defense Environmental Restoration Account -- the Defense Department's special  environmental cleanup fund, Merrill said.  </P> <P> One of the problems to be investigated is the contaminated ground water that  has been found below the base and in portions of Irvine. Officials said they  have found that the ground water contains trichloroethylene, or TCE, a  cancer-causing degreasing agent. TCE was used by the military until the late  1970s to clean jet fighter and helicopter engines.  </P> <P> So far, the contamination has not reached public wells and poses no immediate  threat, said James Van Hahn, a spokesman for the Orange County Water District.  </P> <P> The Water District has reported the existence of a large plume of contaminated  ground water nearly three miles long and a half-mile wide, stretching from the  El Toro base to a point halfway between Jeffrey Road and Culver Drive, in the  Woodbridge area of Irvine.  </P> <P> The Marine Corps, in its own study, contends that the area is smaller and  scattered, Van Hahn said.  </P> <P> The military also has not accepted full responsibility for all of the ground  water contamination that has been found. Local officials said Thursday they are  hopeful that the investigation conducted as a result of the Superfund  designation will assign responsibility for the cleanup.  </P> <P> The Marine base has already installed a treatment system to remove TCE from the  ground water. The water district and the city of Irvine started removing some  of the contaminated water last year. Van Hahn said that the process could take  over five years and that it has already cost over $1 million.  </P> <P> In its announcement Thursday, the EPA added 71 other sites to its Superfund  list, including seven others in California.  </P></p>

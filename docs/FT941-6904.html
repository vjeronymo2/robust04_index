			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / G7 ties Russian debt to accord with IMF The Group of Seven industrialised states told the Russian government this weekend that it must reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund on stabilising inflation and the government deficit before any further debt rescheduling can be negotiated. At the same time, the G7 finance ministers want to give more help, particularly through the World Bank, to set up a proper social security system, thus easing the political backlash against economic reform. They suggested World Bank funds from the Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) special privatisation programme could be used to help set up a social safety net, although the main resources for any such system would have to come from Russia itself. The tough line in insisting on prior agreement with the IMF before any new round of official debt rescheduling in the Paris Club emerged from Saturday's meeting between the G7 finance ministers and central bank governors, and a Russian delegation headed by Mr Sergei Dubinin, acting finance minister. It will put the new Russian government under severe time pressure to reach a deal with the IMF on the conditions for the release of a second Dollars 1.5bn tranche of its special transformation facility, and a Dollars 4.1bn stand-by credit. The current agreement on rescheduling Dollars 15bn of official debt with the Paris Club runs out at the end of April, after being extended by four months. Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russian economy minister, said after the talks that the next meeting with the IMF was planned for mid-March, by when fund officials would have had a chance to assess some basic budget figures presented to them last week. The Russian delegation told the G7 that they intended to reduce inflation in Russia to a monthly rate of 7-9 per cent by the end of 1994, compared with 22 per cent at the end of 1993. Their planned budget deficit would be brought down to 5 per cent of gross domestic product. They also gave 'clear and formal assurances' that the new government remained committed to the reform programme launched by the previous administration, headed by Mr Yegor Gaidar. The G7 ministers were clearly keen to give strong political support to the reform process, and expressed some reassurance over those commitments. But many remained profoundly sceptical about the Russian government's ability to meet its targets. That is why they are insisting so firmly on an early IMF agreement. 'We are still insisting on full respect for IMF conditionality,' Mr Henning Christophersen, vice-president of the European Commission, said after the meeting. 'We cannot have a situation where Russia is treated differently from everybody else.' The main way in which the G7 wants to express its political support is in the drive to provide greater assistance in creating a proper social security system. At the moment all Russian social assistance is provided in effect from enterprises and factories, which may be sold off or closed down under the privatisation programme.</p>

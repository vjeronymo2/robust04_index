			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Observer: Diplomatic choice There are signs of quiet satisfaction in London over news that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's foreign policy adviser, Peter Hartmann, is pretty certain to be the next German ambassador - but not because he will be even more anglophile than his predecessor. Far more the gentlemanly diplomat than Horst Teltschik, the acute political operator who previously inhabited the position within the chancellor's office, Hartmann has been careful to maintain good relations with Downing Street. Indeed his courteous contacts have underpinned the good personal chemistry between the chancellor and John Major, which has stood up remarkably well to the UK government's strange antics over the Maastricht treaty. But his winning point is not as a London-lover but rather as an intermediary who so obviously enjoys the chancellor's confidence, in contrast with Hermann von Richthofen, the present ambassador, whose diplomatic mildness has not always found favour with Kohl. In London since December 1988, von Richthofen still has no definite job lined up in Bonn, though the German foreign ministry insists his return is wholly unconnected with the embarrassing decision to publish a letter from Bundesbank president Helmut Schlesinger shortly after the rout of sterling last September. The elegant incumbent, a superb dinner host, went down a treat in his own way. But back home, the anglophilia was viewed with suspicion. Hence there are those who think a more sceptical character could carry greater weight.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Investor makes bid for stablemate Investor, the Wallenberg family's chief investment vehicle, yesterday announced a bid worth SKr3.45bn (Dollars 440m) for its similar but junior stablemate Export-Invest in a move that will strengthen the Swedish group's capital base after a period dominated by retrenchment and recession. The near deal between the companies - Export-Invest is also controlled by the Wallenbergs and shares offices in Stockholm with the bidder - is based on an issue of nine new Investor shares for every 10 Export-Invest shares. It will raise Investor's net asset value by SKr3.8bn to SKr41.3bn and lift Investor's solvency ratio from 55 per cent to 57 per cent. The move follows an upturn in Investor's fortunes. Although pre-tax profits slumped in 1993 to SKr410m from SKr1.48bn in 1992, there was a sharp rebound in the fourth quarter based on a strong recovery at Saab-Scania, its wholly-owned vehicle and aerospace group. Net debt also fell last year to under SKr5bn from SKr8.7bn. The bulk of Export-Invest's portfolio mirrors that of Investor, with holdings in such Swedish blue-chips as Astra, the pharmaceutical group, Stora, the forestry group, and Electrolux, the white-goods group. But Investor said the acquisition of Export-Invest's holdings in foreign stocks such as Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, and Alcatel Alsthom of France, signalled a move to increase its investments abroad. Mr Claes Dahlback, Investor chief executive, said he envisaged building up foreign investments to 10 per cent of Investor's portfolio from levels around 3 per cent after the Export-Invest takeover. Executives of both companies went to some lengths to insist the deal was fair to smaller shareholders, despite the lack of any cash alternative. The offer represents a premium of 25.5 per cent on current market values of Export-Invest's A shares.</p>

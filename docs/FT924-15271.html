			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Market fearful of EC's weak currencies - Political problems mean that there could be worse to come for sterling and the lira THE NEW round of tension which hit the foreign exchange markets yesterday indicates that the fundamental pressures on weak European currencies remain intense. Since September 14, there has been one general realignment of the ERM, three devaluations, a spate of interest rate rises throughout Europe and two meetings of EC finance ministers to try and restore order to the market. But investors are still encouraged to buy D-Marks by high German interest rates and uncertainty about the future of the Maastricht treaty on European union. The pound and lira fell sharply against the D-Mark yesterday. Meanwhile, the Bank of Spain intervened to support the peseta after it came close to its ERM floor against the D-Mark and the Dutch central bank was forced to intervene to support the Irish punt. There were three factors triggering yesterday's crisis. Investors fear that the differential between US and German short-term interest rates is threatening to widen. German short-term rates are 6.5 points higher than those in the US, offering dealers a far higher return if they invest in D-Marks. The flows between two of the world's main currencies also drive the rest of the foreign exchange market. On Friday, investors' hopes of a cut in German rates were dashed as the Bundesbank left its Lombard rate unchanged. However, investors believe there could be another cut in the US discount rate when the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Markets Committee meets today. The slowdown in the US economy was underlined by a poor set of US economic indicators last week, and the dollar fell yesterday to DM1.3890, close to its historic low of DM1.3860. The market increasingly believes that there will be another realignment of the ERM, with the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo, the Irish punt and the Danish krone moving downwards against the D-Mark. Realignment rumours make it risky to hold the vulnerable currencies. Conversely, the risk-reward ratio in selling them is small. A dealer who sells a weak currency will make a profit, but there is little chance of making a loss because these currencies are unlikely to appreciate noticeably against the D-Mark. The possibility of a realignment was raised by Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spain's economy minister, who said at the weekend that a cut in German interest rates accompanied by a general realignment could help to settle tensions. The Irish are also under pressure to devalue. Sterling was yesterday trading at Pounds 1.10 to the Irish punt. The Irish have long taken the view that it is not in Ireland's interest for the punt to rise above Pounds 1.05 because 31 per cent of Ireland's exports go to the UK. The French franc came under intense pressure yesterday, even though France's economic fundamentals could make it a candidate for revaluation against the D-Mark. Investors believe the huge cost of defending the franc in recent weeks would make another speculative attack more difficult to resist. The Bundesbank is estimated to have spent around DM20bn (Pounds 8bn) in intervention to support the franc, while France's foreign currency reserves are thought to be close to exhaustion. Investors are worried by the fundamental economic weakness of several European countries, above all Italy and the UK. In recent years, investment funds in the US and Europe bought the lira and sterling because they were increasingly tied to the D-Mark, by a growing commitment to the ERM and European Monetary Union. Their departure from the ERM has undermined that confidence. There are fears the Italian government will be unable to get its emergency budget package through parliament and that a general strike could be called. In the UK, devaluation has left the government without a clear economic policy, while the UK prime minister may have difficulty getting a Maastricht ratification bill through parliament. A worrying feature of the sell-off of the lira and sterling is that it is fundamental selling by investment institutions rather than short-term selling by the banks. Mr Avinash Persaud, currency economist at UBS Phillips and Drew in London, said that US pension funds engaged in massive selling of sterling in the run-up to its devaluation on September 16. 'We are now seeing a second wave of institutional selling by European funds who are going through a process of portfolio adjustment.'</p>

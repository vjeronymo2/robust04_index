			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Call to rethink terrorism insurance ARRANGEMENTS to insure against terrorism damage are unworkable in the wake of Saturday's bomb damage, commercial insurance buyers claimed yesterday. The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce (Airmic), which represents more than 300 UK insurance buyers, said a compulsory levy should be attached to all commercial insurance policies. Failure to introduce a levy could lead to much higher premiums for businesses based in the City and other high-risk areas. 'Companies should not be penalised by high premiums for being based in the City,' said Ms Liz Taylor, who chairs Airmic. 'All UK businesses should contribute something . . . to what is a national problem.' Insurers withdrew terrorism cover from standard commercial policies last year. Under new arrangements negotiated with the government last year, businesses can 'buy back' terrorism insurance. These additional premiums are channelled into Pool Re, a specially created reinsurance company which is reinsured by the government. However, losses of at least Pounds 300m from Saturday's bomb will almost certainly exhaust Pool Re funds. Mr Tony Baker, public relations manager of the Association of British Insurers, said yesterday that Pool Re was likely to re-examine its rating structure and could increase premiums for businesses in vulnerable areas. Airmic believes that even fewer companies will then buy cover from Pool Re. 'There is a natural reluctance for people in industries that are not vulnerable to buy the cover,' said Mr Geoff Saunders, a member of the Airmic council. The DTI said yesterday that questions regarding the viability of Pool Re should be addressed to insurers, but the ABI insisted that a levy was 'unrealistic'. A compulsory levy was turned down by the government during negotiations to set up Pool Re last year.</p>

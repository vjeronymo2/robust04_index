			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] There is no coldness on the part of the Israeli  Government towards Italy, only friendship: these were the words  of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who recalled that a  Jerusalem daily newspaper today said that the views of the  Israeli deputy foreign minister, Yossi Beilin, on the Italian  Government were irresponsible. [passage omitted]    Avi Pazner, the Israeli ambassador to Rome, met with Foreign  Minister Antonio Martino for the second time in three days.  This is what he told our reporter at the end of the meeting:    [Begin recording] [Pazner] We had a good meeting with  Foreign  Minister Martino. We spoke of the relations between Israel and  Italy -- relations which we hope will continue to be good in the  future. We spoke of the future meeting between Martino and  Shim'on Peres in Luxembourg next Monday [13 June].    [Correspondent Paolo Borelli] Will the misunderstandings be  overcome? Will this cultural protocol be signed?    [Pazner] We hope that the misunderstandings will be overcome  because there is a willingness on the part of Italy and Israel  to overcome these difficulties.    [Borelli] In general, does the Israeli Government remain  concerned at the presence of members of the National Alliance in  our government?    [Pazner] There is a debate currently taking place in Israel.  All that has happened in the last few days is a result of this  debate. We must now find a way of continuing the good relations  which exist between Israel and Italy. [end recording]</p>

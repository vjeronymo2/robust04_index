L. 101&hyph;239) added a new title IX to the Public Health Service Act (the Act), which established the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) to enhance the quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health care services, and access to such services. (See 42 U.S.C. 299&hyph;299c&hyph;6 and 1320b&hyph;12.) The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Reauthorization Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;410), enacted on October 13, 1992, extended the authorization of AHCPR and amended certain provisions related to the development of clinical practice guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In keeping with its legislative mandate, AHCPR is arranging for the development, periodic review, and update of clinically relevant guidelines that may be used by physicians, nurses, other health care providers, educators, and consumers to assist in determining how diseases, disorders, and other health care conditions can most effectively and appropriately be prevented, diagnosed, treated, and clinically managed. Based on the guidelines produced, AHCPR oversees development, periodic review, and update of medical review criteria, standards of quality, and performance measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 912 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 299b&hyph;1(b)), as amended by Public Law 102&hyph;410, requires that the guidelines:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Be based on the best available research and professional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> judgment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Be presented in formats appropriate for use by physicians,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nurses, other health care providers, medical educators, medical review organizations, and consumers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent V. Lavrushenko, including </F> recorded remarks by A. Zhokin, deputy chief of GosAtomNadzor;  from the "Vesti" newscast]    [Text] Lavrushenko: The production of nuclear  weapons still remains a very well-kept secret -- not only for  the uninformed population, but also for the federal radiation  safety control bodies. The All-Russia Conference of  GosAtomNadzor [State Committee for Supervision of Nuclear and  Radiation Safety] that was held in Novosibirsk stated this fact  with alarm. Now the regions that produce nuclear weapons have  the added problem of storing radioactive materials that have  been taken out of service. It is proposed to set up one of the  storage depots in Tomsk-7.    Zhokin: It must, naturally, be stored in a  dismantled state, and it must further be regenerated and  processed once again in the place where it was produced. There  are no other places; they do not exist.    Lavrushenko: This is regarded as an unconvincing  argument by the population of areas where bombs have been  assembled for many years without the population's knowledge, and  where -- on the basis of this argument -- unexploded bombs will  now be stored again for many generations, even though the  military and the Ministry of Atomic Energy are trying to win the  Tomsk and Siberian residents' agreement by offering large sums  of money.    The explosion in Tomsk-7 last year was a much more  convincing  argument.</p>

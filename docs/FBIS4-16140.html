			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Lithuanian budget is in a very difficult  state, according to Vice Minister of Finance Reinoldijus  Sarkinas. This has happened because the wages for the officials  at some organizations, maintained from the budget, have not been  included in good time. Lithuanian TV forecasts that the payment  of wages will be late in May, too.    According to Sarkinas, the situation in the fulfillment of  the budget became especially bad during the first three months  of this year. For example, in December 1993 the national budget  received revenue in sum of 385 million litas, whereas in  February and March only 285 million litas were received in each  month.

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Germany There is an aura of unreality in the flirtation of the DAX index with the 2,000 level. German corporate earnings are expected to rebound sharply next year as restructuring charges fall away and the effect of cost-cutting takes hold. But after rising by nearly 50 per cent so far this year, the market is trading on a 1994 multiple of nearly 20. That leaves little room for anything to go wrong in a year when rising unemployment will ensure consumer confidence remains weak and election uncertainties will overshadow an already weak fiscal position. A more plausible reason for the strength of the equity and bond markets is the simple weight of liquidity. Money supply growth of around 7 per cent is far higher than needed to finance the output which is actually being achieved. Some of the surplus is finding its way into financial assets. The received wisdom in Frankfurt is that there is room for further gains, particularly in equities, as money market rates fall. At some point, though, such confidence must give way to renewed concern about inflation. At present the Bundesbank can still point to low bond yields as evidence that inflationary expectations remain muted. If, however, the froth in the equity market spilled over into property prices, worries about an asset price bubble, which have recently surfaced in the US, would look much more applicable to Germany. Monetary easing would then stop dead in its tracks. That would be bad news indeed for the many industrial companies whose liquidity has been eroded by weak revenues and the cost of redundancy payments.</p>

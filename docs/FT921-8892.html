			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Arts: Eric Clapton - Albert Hall Eric Clapton's annual residency at the Albert Hall long ago ceased to be a string of concerts, let alone rock concerts. Like Horovitz with his piano and Stern with his violin, Clapton is the total guitar master, the genius of his generation. Even more than Horovitz and Stern, he makes it look easy as he bends his guitar to strike out cries of human anguish and pleasure. I doubt if he even practices: you feel that if he could force his fingers on to bum notes the sounds would somehow come right. No, the concerts are now just as opportunity to assess Eric's health, mental rather than musical. And the good news is that the man is just fine. Dressed darkly by Versace, his hair trimmed and his beard glinting grizzly in the spotlights, he could be a Mayfair art dealer, or perhaps a night club manager. He is as cool and undemonstrative as ever, driving home the contrast between the man and the tingling, manic, sounds that come from his guitar. He has been accepted as God by his fans since the 1960s and none of the disciples in the audience would want to forget the real trauma he suffered in the past year: the loss, through a tragic accident, of his young son. But Clapton has used the experience musically, not cashing in but apparently expiating his grief through songs like 'Tears in Heaven' and 'The Circus left Town', performed seated and acoustically in line with his bass man Nathan East and guitar support Andy Fairweather-Lowe. The songs sounded maudlin rather than elegiac but it was a sensitive moment and earned Clapton a bouquet of red roses. Around this subdued heart there was the anticipated ritual. There is no way he can escape from 'Layla' however much he changes the intro, and the lovers in the audience (vastly outnumbered by parents giving their children a sight of stardom) would have expired if he had not played 'Wonderful Tonight'. It is done so tastefully, with such craftsmanship, that the banality almost becomes a human truth. There was Cream for encores - 'Crossroads' and 'Sunshine of Your Love'. Clapton is using a slightly larger band this year and, with Fairweather-Lowe offering a spikey sound against Clapton's gold-chipped playing, the music was funkier, more rousing, than in the past. It might have nothing to do with contemporary art but it is a marvellous expression of communal worship.</p>

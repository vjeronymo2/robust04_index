			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Brokers believe in Santa George A new entry in this week's box office charts is the animated film The Nightmare before Christmas. In the movie, Halloween figures take over the role of Santa Claus and ruin the Yuletide cheer. But in the nightmares of retailers and some stock market investors, the figure of Christmas terror is personified in the more down-to-earth form of Mr Eddie George. Many fear that the governor of the Bank of England will press for a further rise in base rates when he meets Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, on December 7. That might deliver a heavy blow to consumers in the all-important Christmas shopping season. Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International bank (Europe), said: 'A lot of shops do a quarter of their turnover in the run-up to Christmas. To hit consumers with the psychological shock of a rate rise would be supremely bad timing.' The Bank of England has already warned that rates will have to rise at some point over the next few months if the government is to achieve its aim of getting underlying inflation within the lower half of its 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range by the end of this parliament. Mr Adam Cole, UK economist at brokers James Capel, said there was a strong case for an early rate rise: 'If you look at the Bank's list of inflation concerns, almost every one has deteriorated. The pace of growth has been revised up further, and lead indicators such as the CBI survey suggest the economy is not losing momentum in the fourth quarter.' However, Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, the stockbrockers, noted that October's economic data, such as retail sales and the M4 measure for broad money supply, had been weak. He thought there had been insufficient evidence since Mr Clarke and Mr George last met on November 2 to persuade the two to act. Certainly Mr Clarke might be able to put a compelling case for delay. This week's Budget confirmed the previously announced tax rises and imposed further controls on public spending. Both should be expected to slow economic growth. Indeed, the Treasury is forecasting that the UK's gross domestic product, having grown at 4 per cent in 1994, will rise by only 3.25 per cent next year. Furthermore, in the red book which accompanied the Budget, the Treasury took an optimistic line on the size of the 'output gap', one of the key measures used by economists for assessing the scope for inflationary pressure. 'There is almost certainly a sizeable (output) gap,' it said. 'In other words, there is still spare capacity in the economy as a whole. This should allow the economy to continue growing faster than trend without any significant upward pressure upon prices.' There are also one or two technical details that might make the timing of a December rate rise difficult. On the day of the meeting, the Bank of England will hold a gilt auction. Back in January 1993, an interest rate cut held just before an auction upset many marketmakers. While a interest rate rise this time might not disrupt the market - gilt prices might benefit from evidence of the government's anti-inflationary commitment - the timing would still look awkward. Mr Cole said: 'Were the auction to go badly and traders end up with a lot of stock, the Bank wouldn't want to clobber traders with a rate rise as well.' Another timing problem for the governor is that he is giving evidence on the Budget to the Commons' Treasury and civil service committee on December 8. That would mean that, if he received the go-ahead from Mr Clarke to raise rates, he would have to raise them before he addressed the committee to avoid prevarication and possible deceit. On balance, then, analysts think a rate rise will be delayed, if only until January. Mr Shepperd said: 'Waiting a month until January probably won't make that much difference to the economy. And Eddie George may find Kenneth Clarke more receptive.' When a rise is announced, Mr Cole thinks it will be of half a percentage point. 'More than half a point would seem like panic, and a quarter of a point is not enough.' So even if Mr George does allow retailers to enjoy a merry Christmas, he could still deny them a happy new year.</p>

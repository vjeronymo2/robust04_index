			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / London Bullion Market (4): Production heading towards a plateau - Supply and Demand THE total supply of gold to the world market fell last year for the first time since 1983, to 2,815 tonnes from 2,913 tonnes in 1990, according to the annual survey of the market by Gold Fields Mineral Services. While Western gold mine production continued to rise in spite of prices at the lowest real level since the 1970s, the rate of growth in mine production slowed to just 2 per cent, the lowest increase in the past 10 years. Nevertheless, total mine production set a new record of 1,782 tonnes. Gold Fields believes mine production is heading towards a plateau if not a peak. It believes the slowdown reflects 'the increasing difficulty of attracting finance for marginal properties and the depletion, rationalisation or closure of some older mines, offsetting increases from new capacity.' However, Gold Fields points to the tenacity and adaptability of the mining industry in the face of low prices. It adds that this reflects the non-feasibility of putting many underground mines on to a care and maintenance basis. Mr Andy Smith, analyst with Union Bank of Switzerland, points out that many observers had expected production to fall sharply. 'We were promised a cliff  -but now we have a plateau as far as the eye can see.' It was a mistake to assume that the mining and financial services industries would not respond to low prices. Mines adjusted their costs and the derivatives market helped them to realise higher prices. Mr Smith also points out the gold mining industry has benefited from cheap finance provided by gold loans and forward sales. These have enabled it to double production over the past 10 years. The industry now works on gold borrowed from the central banks at very low interest rates, a policy which has kept more mines in business than would otherwise have been the case. Gold Fields suggests, however, that the impact of forward sales and gold loans was much reduced last year 'owing to the combination of low spot prices, a less attractive forward price due to lower interest rates, and an absence of price spikes.' Forward sales fell from 254 tonnes in 1990 to 51 tonnes last year, while 11 tonnes of gold loans were repaid, leaving a net impact of 40 tonnes on the supply side of the equation. Net sales from the Communist bloc, in which Gold Fields still includes the former Soviet Union but not eastern Europe, fell to 226 tonnes last year from 425 tonnes in 1990. This is the net result of imports to China exceeding Chinese sales to the West in 1990. Sales from the former Soviet Union fell only marginally, and are now put at more than 1,000 tonnes over the last three years, 'although as much as 20 per cent of this metal may have been used in swaps'. Central banks reverted to being net sellers last year, with net sales of 105 tonnes compared with net purchases of 66 tonnes in 1990. Gold Fields says this reflects a variety of policies, from outright distress sales to a deliberate decision to reduce the gold content of official reserves. The biggest shift in the market, according to Gold Fields, was the implied disinvestment of 241 tonnes from the private sector, which purchased 173 tonnes in 1990. This is attributed to disposals of bullion and coins by European and US holders and sales of stocks from Europe on behalf of Japanese and Middle Eastern investors. Gold demand is dominated by jewellery fabrication, which rose by 4 per cent to 2,111 tonnes - a record - in spite of the recession. 'The reasons for this robust growth include the stockbuilding by jewellery distributors and retail outlets in many European and Gulf countries and a rapid rise in demand from China,' says Gold Fields. Gold used in electronics fell by only 1 tonne to 147 tonnes in spite of a sharp downturn in computer sales and the first signs of weakening military equipment orders. Dental use rose quite strongly. Sales of all the main bullion coins fell sharply with the exception of the Australian Nugget. The issue of a special coin to celebrate the enthronement of the new Emperor in Japan soaked up 60 tonnes and distorted the figures. Without this, coin fabrication would have fallen below 100 tonnes for the first time since 1974, Gold Fields says. Total hoarding of gold in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia fell. The report wonders whether 'the behaviour of bar hoarders in Asia is now becoming more similar to that of Western investors, with a falling price promoting disillusioned sales rather than bargain hunting purchases.' The gold price, which averaged Dollars 362.26 last year, has continued to fall this year. Gold Fields blames the poor performance on, among other things, a decline in global economic output for only the second time since the Second World War, the rapid resolution of the Gulf war and the easing of political tension with the demise of the Soviet Union. The outlook is more positive because output should fall as more than a third of gold production is unprofitable while consumer spending and inflation are near cyclical lows. But if economic recovery is weak, says Gold Fields, additional gold sales could be prompted, keeping the lid on prices for some time. Mr Smith of UBS believes gold is becoming a North-South market. He points to the fact that most jewellery sales and almost all investment are in countries that abhor paperwork and revel in the non-transparency of gold markets. 'Gold's attractiveness in the developing countries is that it is stateless, anonymous, and invisible,' says Mr Smith. He believes the big question for the market in the 1990s is whether countries such as China will absorb more gold than is being dishoarded in the west.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP 10 GOLD PRODUCERS (TONNES)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (1990 in brackets)       1991    1990  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 (1)    South Africa    601.1   605.1 2 (2)    US              300.0   294.2 3 (3)    Soviet Union    242.0   270.0 4 (4)    Australia       234.2   243.1 5 (5)    Canada          176.7   167.0 6 (6)    China           110.0    95.0 7 (7)    Brazil           80.0    84.1 8 (9)    Papua N Guinea   60.6    33.6 9 (10)   Chile            32.5    33.3 10 (11)  Colombia         32.2    32.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Gold Fields Mineral Services  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chang Hong: "NPC Plans To Reshuffle Top Military </F> Rankings"]    [Text] The People's Liberation Army (PLA) is set to do  away with its highest ranking position--a post no one has ever  held.    The Central Military Commission (CMC) yesterday proposed  eliminating the status of `first-grade general,' theoretically  the highest ranking official in the armed forces.    The commission also recommended the Standing Committee of  the  National People's Congress [NPC] give officers regular salary  raises and cut the retirement age of senior commanders by two  years--all under a package of amendments to existing military  service regulations.    The `first-grade' general position has remained vacant since  it was adopted in 1988. The Chinese president, a civilian, is  the commander of the armed forces and serves as CMC chairman.    Under the amendments, the CMC chairman will not be conferred  with any military ranks. This will be in line with the  tradition of the Chinese military and the general practice in  the world, said General Yu Yongbo, a CMC member and director of  the PLA General Political Department.    Yu said the decision to remove the first-grade general from  the military ladder was based on the fact that no one ever held  the title.    The post-Cold War era of peace also prompted the proposal,  he  said.    The current military rank system divides officers in active  service into 11 grades, from generals and field officers to  junior officers.    Ten grades will be retained: general, lieutenant general,  major general, senior colonel, colonel, lieutenant colonel,  major, captain, lieutenant and second lieutenant.    Amendments to the retirement age mainly affect deputy army  commanders and deputy commanders of greater military areas,  according to Yu.    The maximum retirement age will be reduced from 60 to 58 for  deputy army commanders and 65 to 63 for deputy commander of  greater military command regions.    This would accelerate the normal succession of officers.    Yu said the proposal for regular pay hikes for officers is  intended to boost military morale.    Other legislation under review at the current NPC Standing  Committee session includes the Foreign Trade Law, the draft  State Compensation Law and measures to punish offenders  disturbing public order.    The first two bills are ready to be approved during the  current session, which runs until Thursday.    For the first time, a law governing the real estate market  has been submitted to the NPC Standing Committee for  consideration.    The law aims to tighten government control over the industry  and prevent the loss of State property.    Its provisions focus on the supply of land for urban real  estate development, real estate transactions and property  registration.    Legislators also heard a report on introducing sterner  penalties on copyright infringements.    Two draft laws governing the service of judges and  prosecutors were also submitted for review.    Under the laws, ranking systems will be introduced to  regulate court and prosecuting department officials.</p>

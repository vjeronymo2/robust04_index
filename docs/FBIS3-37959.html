			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Chisinau February 24 TASS--Moldovan opposition  parties favouring unification with Romania received, in defiance  of law, financial assistance from Bucharest for their  campaigning ahead of the February 27 parliamentary elections, a  leader of Moldova's Agrarian Democratic Party, Nicolae Andronik,  claimed here today.    According to him, once being launched, the election campaign  has been marred with gross irregularities of the election law  banning any assistance from abroad to parties running for the  forthcoming elections. In particular, Andronik said, at the  polling station in the village of Varnica, which opened a week  earlier for voters of Moldova's breakaway Dniester region, the  local administration head instructed residents how to vote for  opposition parties.    Moldovan parliamentary chairman Pyotr Luchinskiy expressed  regret that the election campaign is blemished with breaches of  law and ethic norms by the opposition, "which seeks to regain  its popularity by these means". He did not rule out that the  Central Electoral Commission largely consisting of  representatives of opposition parties would not approve voting  results if Moldova's Agrarian Democratic Party won the elections.    In this case, Luchinskiy stressed, the Supreme Court will  have the final say. And the court has already cancelled the  ruling by the Central Electoral Commission not to open polling  stations in Gagauz-dominated areas for fear that residents there  might vote for the Agrarian Democratic Party.</p>

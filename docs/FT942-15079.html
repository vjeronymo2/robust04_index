			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Arts: A model of Renaissance perfection - Venice is hosting a revelatory exhibition which places architecture in the forefront of the fine arts Architecture has always considered itself first and sovereign of the fine arts. It is not true, of course: each of the arts, in the hands of a master, may enjoy its proper claim to the position of first among equals. But in its proprietorial role, setting the stage by which the other arts may flourish, architecture has always been a special case. But in times when the greatest artists of all kinds engage directly in the practice of architecture and great architects turn to painting and sculpture, such claims become not so much unassailable as beside the point. The period of this quite extraordinary exhibition, that begins in the 15th century with the theories of Alberti and ends with St Peter's rebuilt and Palladio waiting in the wings, was just such a time. Could more have been made of the rich seed-bed from which so much of the architectural inspiration sprang - the intimate architecture of chancel, altar and reliquary, all the more apposite given the human scale of the models that are the spectacular focus of the exhibition? And being in Venice, could a show so full of Rome and Florence have done with rather more of Venice itself, of Sansovino and Lombardo perhaps, and Carpaccio too? For the few, albeit well-chosen, paintings shown, both portraits and architectural fantasies, are important to the general argument. Perhaps. But to carp is unworthy, for any such deficiency is immediately obviated by a short foray into the city. The show itself is the thing, and the scale and physical power of it are set from the very start. The entrance court is dominated by the huge Sangallo Model from the Vatican, raised up almost to eye-level to take on, in the imagination at least, its proper monumental and architectural presence. What we confront at this scale is not architecture as architecture so much as architecture as sculpture. For so often the scope of architecture is so vast as to be beyond natural comprehension. We discover any great building bit by bit, to be pieced together in the mind. Yet here - from the Sangallo model and its peer, the great model of Pavia Cathedral, to the working fragments, the domes, facades and apses - we stand in direct relation to objects resolved and integral to themselves, sharing the same space we occupy, tangible and comprehensible. How oddly modern so much of it seems - Brunelleschi's dome and apses for Florence Cathedral, for example, that hint at the discrete elements and re-arrangements of a Cragg or Paolozzi. And there are the drawings, that seem to offer direct and poignant contact with the hand and mind of the master, as though we were there at his elbow as the mark was made. Here is a swift, fugitive note of an idea of Bramante for the plan of the Basilica, just the lightest indication of the mutual organisation of space and structure and as abstract as a Mondrian. And here again are Michelangelo's project sketch for the plan of S. Giovanni dei Fiorentini, like a formalised, exploding flower, and his paper cut-out templates for cornices and mouldings, convex and concave in easy and abstracted rhythmical counterpoint. And how we weep for our own age of the 'artist's impression' and design only by benefit of the computer model, when the architect hardly dares take up the pencil. Meanwhile St Peter's still stands to reproach them all.</p>

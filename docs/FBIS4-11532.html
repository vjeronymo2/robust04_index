			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast;" passages within quotation </F> marks recorded]    [Text] During a seminar on civilian-military relations,  Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo has said the government and  the Army reached an agreement on the Code of Military  Organization. Lacayo praised the agreement, describing it as  another government achievement in its fourth year in office.    [Lacayo] "We are celebrating this fourth year of Violeta  Chamorro's democratic government with this agreement, an  agreement that opens the door to a Nicaragua with a national  Army for the first time in its history, and closes the door on  any attempt to seize power via weapons. Thus, we are  celebrating the existence of a new Nicaragua."    Lacayo said the Military Code, which consists of 93  articles,  is the result of a consensus between President Chamorro and the  top military command on how and on which date the new Army  commander in chief will be appointed.    Lacayo mentioned the government's achievements:    [Lacayo] "Nicaragua is a territory free of armed political  groups today."    He added the government has kept its promises as no other  government has ever done in the country's history:    [Lacayo] "No one can doubt we have forever left behind the  death of Nicaraguan brothers in the battlefields, the harsh  press censorship, the jail terms for dissension, and the  subsequent crooked deals that prompted the collapse of an  economy that was in a regressive and mortal state."    Army Chief Humberto Ortega also spoke at the event. He  insisted on referring to the past until he finally expressed his  opinion about the Military Code:    [Ortega] "The law must serve to strengthen the process to  professionalize the Army. It must not be the kind of law some  people want: a law to dismantle the Army."    Ortega reiterated the Army does respect the state branches:    [Ortega] "The Army has never interfered in politics or in a  single decision made by this government, a decisionmaking power  it won in the elections."</p>

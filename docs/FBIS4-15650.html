			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 9 TASS -- "Yeltsin's candidature for  presidency in the next elections is quite possible, given a few  conditions," president of the humanitarian and political science  centre "Strategy" Gennadiy Burbulis told journalists in the  Kremlin today.    He pointed out three conditions for Yeltsin's success in the  race, which, judging by all appearances, has already begun in  Russia. "Yeltsin must realize the new political style and  appear to the people not only as the leader of reforms but also  as the person capable of reunifying the nations in the remaining  18 months. He will also need a reliable political and civic  structure on which to rely for support and which he does not  have now. He must run as a man acting on instructions from such  a civic and political structure which can propel him to the  post. Thirdly, society needs to know clearly who make up the  presidential team, who are his comrades in arms and who are his  possible successors.    If these three conditions materialize "I will back Yeltsin  proceeding from the fact that the president is now one of the  main guarantors of stability in society," Burbulis said.    He also pointed out that the accord on civic peace is not a  lull between the branches of power but an expression of  society's urgent need for stability. Burbulis called on all  political parties to defend their positions within the frame of  law.</p>

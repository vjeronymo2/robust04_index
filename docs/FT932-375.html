			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Securiguard climbs to Pounds 3.53m - Rentokil offer 'completely fails to recognise' future prospects SECURIGUARD, the security and cleaning company facing a hostile Pounds 59.2m bid from Rentokil, yesterday announced sharply higher interim profits and said the offer price of 270p a share 'completely fails to recognise' its future prospects. Pre-tax profits grew 36 per cent, from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 3.53m, in the six months to May 16, slightly ahead of expectations. The company made no full-year profit forecast, but said it intended to recommend a 22 per cent rise in total dividends for the year. The shares, which have traded above the offer price since the bid was launched last month, yesterday closed unchanged at 309p. Rentokil, which wants to add Securiguard's guarding and cleaning activities to its own business services, has until midnight next Tuesday to decide whether to raise or declare its bid final. Mr Alan Baldwin, chairman of Securiguard, said he last week received a second letter from Rentokil offering talks. 'But there's nothing to discuss. I think Rentokil has got to rethink. (The offer) is way, way away from where it should be,' he said. Rentokil said the company would look at the interim figures in detail before deciding its next move. Securiguard's profits were lifted by a higher than expected contribution from its communications division, which mainly involves the City Link parcel delivery service. Trading profits more than doubled to Pounds 1.03m even though turnover was only 17 per cent higher. Mr Baldwin said the division was helped by volume increases and previous investment. He said profits growth was 'very sustainable'. Group turnover increased 8 per cent to Pounds 95.8m while trading profit increased 20 per cent to Pounds 4.08m. Net borrowings remained stable at 'about Pounds 10m', according to Mr Baldwin, while interest costs fell slightly to Pounds 549,000 (Pounds 792,000). The security division increased trading profits 12 per cent to Pounds 1.84m. New contracts were won worth Pounds 6.5m a year and the company said it was soon to start work on its first German contract. The personnel division, which has been hit by losses at its HeMan construction services subsidiary, incurred losses of Pounds 426,000 (Pounds 511,000). Mr Baldwin said HeMan's markets had improved, but it was too early to say if the division would break even this year. Earnings increased 36 per cent to 11.7p (8.6p). The interim dividend is increased from 3.5p to 4.5p. Securiguard said it intended to recommend full year dividends of 'at least' 11.5p - a 22 per cent increase. See Lex</p>

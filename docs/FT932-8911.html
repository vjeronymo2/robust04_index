			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Israeli government starts bank sell-off ISRAEL'S finance minister, Mr Abraham Shochat, yesterday announced the sale of 60 per cent of the shares in the country's Union Bank, calling the deal 'a turning point' in the government's programme to sell off its bank shares to the private sector. Mr Shochat said that the Eliahu Group, a group of private investors headed by Shlomo Eliahu, had valued the Union Bank at Dollars 140m (Pounds 90.9m) and had agreed to pay Dollars 85m for 60 per cent of the shares. The Union Bank is not one of Israel's leading banks, but Mr Shochat welcomed the sale as 'the beginning of a process' that would see the government ultimately divest itself of its controlling interest in the banking system. He said the government hoped in the near future to sell off 20 per cent of the shares in Israel's largest bank, Bank Hapoalim, which has assets estimated at Dollars 40bn. The Israeli government became the effective owner of the country's banks a decade ago, after the October 1983 bank shares crisis. For years the banks had artificially boosted their own share prices, with stockholders treating their shares as government guaranteed bonds. A mass rush to sell the shares in October 1983, however, triggered the collapse of the national banking system, leaving the government with little alternative but to bail out the banks at a cost of more than Dollars 9bn.</p>

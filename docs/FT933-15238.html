			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Cellular Telecom late in filing accounts A COMPANY linked to family interests of Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands entrepreneur, and which shared directors with Alpine (Double Glazing), the windows company which recently collapsed, is more than two months late filing accounts. Cellular Telecom Holdings, based at Maidenhead, retails airtime on the Vodafone and Cellnet networks. It was required by company law to have submitted audited accounts within seven months of its September 30 year-end. However, the last filing was for the 18 months to the end of September 1991, when Cellular Telecom showed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 179,890 on sales of Pounds 11.5m. In recent weeks the Bank of Scotland has lodged a charge over the assets of the company for 'all moneys (sic) and liabilities (actual or contingent)' owed to the bank. In Cellular Telecom's last accounts, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Midland Bank were listed as its bankers. Mr Marc Voulters, a partner of Cellular Telecom's auditors Casson Beckman, confirmed recently that the accounts were late. He said he expected they would now be filed within the next week or so. Cellular Telecom is more than 55 per cent owned by offshore companies, according to the 1991 accounts, with a further 23.9 per cent held in nominee accounts. Two of the offshore companies - holding a total stake of 18.78 per cent - are beneficially owned by Mr Smith's two daughters. The company has also shared two directors with Alpine (Double Glazing) - Mr Robert Pollock, chairman of the windows company and discharged bankrupt, and Mr James Berry. Mr Pollock said at a recent Alpine creditors' meeting that the windows group had provided a letter of financial support to Cellular Telecom for just under Pounds 300,000 in 1992. Directors of Cellular Telecom have been unavailable for comment. However, early last month Mr Pollock and Mr Berry resigned from the company. Mr Pollock's contract, which provided for an annual salary of Pounds 60,000, ran until December 31 1993, after which six months notice was required for termination.</p>

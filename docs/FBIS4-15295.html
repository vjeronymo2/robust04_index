			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, March 31, RIA -- Russia informed Yasir  'Arafat, PLO leader, that it was prepared to take part in the  international peace-keeping force which guarantees security of  Palestinians in Hebron, Boris Schiborin, Russian ambassador to  Tunis, said today.    Meanwhile, the PLO leadership continues in emergency session  in Tunis discussing the unprovoked killing of six Fatah  officials by Israeli special troops in the Gaza Strip. No final  decision has been made yet on the incident.    RIA learnt from a reliable source in the PLO headquarters  that the current situation may disrupt the Cairo talks about  security measures for an unlimited duration. The resumption of  Palestinian- israeli talks will also be indefinitely postponed.  There is nothing to discuss as long as the Israeli Government  cannot control its army, a PLO spokesman said.</p>

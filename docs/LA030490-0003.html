			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRASILIA AND THE BURIAL OF UTOPIA;  </P> <P> THE MODERNIST CITY: AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL CRITIQUE OF BRASILIA BY JAMES HOLSTON  (UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS: $50, CLOTH; $18.95, PAPER; 432 PP., ILLUSTRATED;  0-226-34978-0)  </P> <P> The academic publishing world seems awash with books about postmodernism. Not  only architectural critics -- geographers and sociologists and general  historical doomsayers also are banding to make it the hot topic of early 1990.  </P> <P> Many of their readers may find themselves more bemused at the end than when  they started. For postmodernism seems to have become a kind of code word for  everything these authors dislike in contemporary capitalism but cannot quite  elucidate.  </P> <P> At least two hurrahs, therefore, for James Holston. An assistant professor at  the University of Southern California, he utters the P-word only in his last  couple of pages. His subject matter is at first sight specialized, even  obscure: the creation in the late 1950s of the new Brazilian capital, in the  empty plains about 600 miles from Rio de Janeiro. But, by dissecting the  phenomenon that postmodernism supplanted, he indirectly illuminates the subject  far more satisfactorily than any of his competitors so far.  </P> <P> Holston comes unusually well qualified, with a degree in both architecture and  anthropology, so he can analyze Brasilia, as an architectural project, from the  standpoint and with the techniques of an anthropologist. He argues that  modernism -- the architectural movement that began with Le Corbusier, Gropius  and all the other heroes of the 1920s, culminated in the Congres Internationaux  d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) in the 1930s, and effectively ended with the  demolition of the Pruitt-Igoe project in St. Louis in 1972 -- had a very  radical social and political intent: It was a project to replace capitalism by  a new collectivist social order.  </P> <P> This, oddly, could happen under very different political regimes: It was true  alike in the Soviet Union and in Fascist Italy in the 1920s, and (though he  does not say this) in Social-Democratic Stockholm and London in the 1950s. It  is also specifically true in Brasilia. Though President Juscelino Kubitschek,  the city's godfather, was a Latin American populist, the true begetter of the  Brasilia plan was Oscar Niemeyer, doyen of Brazilian architects and an avowed  Communist. He persuaded the competition jury to accept the plan of his teacher  Lucio Costa, written on five index cards.  </P> <P> This plan, according to Holston, was the ultimate political achievement of the  modern movement, "a CIAM city . . . the most complete example ever constructed  of the architectural and planning tenets put forward in CIAM manifestoes"; it  achieved the objective for which the pioneers of the modern movement had  struggled in vain. Its hidden agenda was to create a totally new-built form as  a shell for a new society, without reference to history: The past was simply to  be abolished. "Brasilia," he writes, "was built to be more than the symbol of  this new age. Rather, its design and construction were intended as a means to  create it by transforming Brazilian society."  </P> <P> Brasilia thus embodied a fundamental premise of the modern movement: "total  decontextualization," in which a utopian future becomes the means to measure  the present, without any sense of historical context. Costa introduces his  plan, in disarmingly self-effacing fashion, as the carrier of a mythic idea  that came to him almost as a vision: It provides a basis for a city created on  a clean slate, without reference to the past.  </P> <P> Specifically, in this new city the traditional, heavily stratified Brazilian  society would be replaced by a totally egalitarian one: In the uniform  apartment blocks, governors and ambassadors would live as neighbors with  janitors and laborers. The apartments marked a radical break with  class-conscious tradition: Masters and servants would use the same entrances,  even share the same spaces.  </P> <P> The traditional divisions between public and private space would be abolished;  these blocks would be machines for collective public living. And the  traditional street -- the age-old essence of the division between public and  private life -- must likewise disappear; hence Brasilia's eight-lane  expressways, which act as social divisors rather than social integrators.  </P> <P> On this hidden agenda of modernism, Holston is extraordinarily persuasive. He  illuminates, in a depth and with a subtlety no architectural critic ever has  achieved, just what the true program of the modern architectural movement was.  Why high-rise structures with curtain walls of glass? To erode the private life  of the family, and collectivize the children down in the communal play spaces  and creches. Why vast expressways and shopping centers? To emphasize the death  of the street, and with it the subtle relationships between public and private  space.  </P> <P> The aim was indeed radical, even subversive: "to restructure the institutional  relationships between the public and the private domains of social life so that  they are both entirely regulated by a comprehensive, state-sponsored master  plan," thus transforming the structure of capitalist society by stealth. Small  wonder that modernism came into its own only in totalitarian regimes, or in  municipal collectivist local states.  </P> <P> But in Brasilia, it could not work. The deep class structures of Brazil, subtly  racial in origin, reasserted themselves. The manual workers who built the city,  and were temporarily glorified as heroes, were banished from it; after epic  fights, they were allowed to remain in distant satellite towns, totally  segregated from middle-class Brasilian society, spending much of their meager  salaries on long commutes.  </P> <P> The servants who remained in the superblocks, ironically, were cooped up in  closet spaces far worse than the rooms they had enjoyed in traditional  apartments. Some of this story has been told, and told well, in previous  accounts of Brasilia. But Holston invests it, too, with new layers of meaning.  </P> <P> What is its significance for the project of postmodernism? Here, at the very  end, Holston is tantalizingly and disappointingly laconic. Radical  postmodernists argue that the new aesthetic requires a total social revolution  for its achievement: an irony, since modernism itself tried to engineer just  such a revolution through the effect of built forms on the psyche. Conservative  postmodernists, led by Prince Charles, conversely call for a return to  preindustrial-built forms. Both, Holston argues, are utopian: Either they  ignore their own historical context, or, worse, they exacerbate the problems  they purport to solve. And so, ironically, they fall into the same trap as the  modernists before them.  </P> <P> That may be oversimplistic, a quality certainly not found elsewhere in this  book. (If there is a criticism, it is that the style is often too academically  inflated, too prolix and unnecessarily complex; qualities that doubtless  reflect the book's origin as a Ph.D. dissertation.) Modernism's demise surely  reflects a complex counter-reaction from a number of disparate forces: bored  young architects seeking something new, angry tenants of public-housing  projects revolting against the collectivist violence done on them, and, more  subtly, a new Zeitgeist that elevates the whimsical and the ironic and the  transient above the solid and the serious.  </P> <P> Certainly, the exposure of modernism's failings in practice -- especially  through the serious media -- played a critical role. But there was more to it  than that. Perhaps, unconsciously, people came to appreciate the hidden agenda.  </P> <P> Whatever the cause, the triumph of postmodernism is surely an integral part of  a huge political sea-change, marked also by the triumph of Thatcho-Reaganism  and the toppling of collectivism in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> There is much more to be written on it; Holston's next book, maybe.  </P></p>

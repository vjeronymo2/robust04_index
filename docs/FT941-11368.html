			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Japan PM's tax plan delayed amid turmoil: Socialists force rethink after threat to coalition Japan's prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, was forced to go back to the drawing board early today on his sweeping plans for tax reform and a Y15,100bn (Pounds 90bn) economic stimulus package. A crisis meeting with his coalition partners to try to reach a compromise on the tax plans broke up without agreement. Officials said discussions would have to go back to 'square one' and a wholesale revision of the plans was likely. The fresh turmoil in Japanese politics began building up yesterday when the Social Democratic party threatened to walk out of the seven-party ruling coalition in protest at Mr Hosokawa's plan to raise sales tax. Earlier a triumphant Mr Hosokawa had unveiled proposals for an income tax cut worth Y18,000bn over the next three years, to be funded by a 7 per cent 'people's welfare tax' to replace the present 3 per cent sales tax in 1997. The socialist SDP, elected on a promise not to raise sales tax, protested that it had not been properly consulted. Disquiet spread to other coalition members, including one of Mr Hosokawa's closest allies, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, who also threatened to resign if the SDP were not offered a satisfactory compromise. Negotiators from the coalition parties met until late last night without patching up their differences and failed again when talks resumed early today. The SDP has asked for the 7 per cent rate to be suspended - although it does not take effect for three years - while a consultative body debates a new rate. It also wants a promise to spend all the extra revenue on welfare, initially rejected by Mr Hosokawa. Political analysts have warned that fresh political turmoil might hamper Mr Hosokawa's hopes of persuading the US of his government's determination to stimulate economic demand. The Japanese prime minister is due to meet President Bill Clinton in Washington next week for so-called trade framework talks. Details of the Y15,100bn package were released after a meeting between Mr Hosokawa and Mr Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal Democratic party, which has started to co-operate with the coalition since last week's compromise on political reform. But it cannot be adopted by cabinet and sent to parliament until the row over tax is settled. The package, slightly larger than expected, includes Y6,000bn of annual tax cuts, mostly affecting income and residence tax. There is another Y9,100bn of government spending and loans, which includes Y2,900bn of public works and Y2,800bn of land purchases. The tax cuts are worth 1.2 per cent of gross national product.

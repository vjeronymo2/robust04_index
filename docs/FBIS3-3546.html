The island airport is scheduled to go  into operation on July 1 this year.    The airport is 15 km from Sanya City and 17 km from the sea.  As the airport's radar system can cover the South China Sea  area and even the high seas, the airport may become one of the  aviation administration centers for the South-East Asian area.    Some of the airport equipment is imported and of the most  advanced kind in the world. After its first stage is completed,  the airport will be able to handle about one million passengers  per year.    When the island in 1988 got State Council approval as a  province and a special economic zone, it set tourism as its  leading industry. But transport shortcomings have been holding  back the development of its tourism industry.</p>

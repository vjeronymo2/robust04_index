			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROCKWELL FINED $42,000 FOR RADIOACTIVE  SHIPMENT  </P> <P> Rockwell International will pay a $42,000 penalty for shipping an excessively  radioactive container by truck from its Santa Susana Field Laboratory west of  Chatsworth to Pennsylvania last October, the U.S. Department of Transportation  said Friday.  </P> <P> The penalty "is one of the larger" fines assessed in the 15-year history of the  Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, said Ed Bonekemper, assistant chief  counsel for the department's research and special programs administration.  </P> <P> The truck was hauling six containers of contaminated equipment from Rockwell  back to their owners. The violation came to light only because the truck  blundered into an overpass when the driver got lost on a country road a few  miles from his destination in Wampum, Pa.  </P></p>

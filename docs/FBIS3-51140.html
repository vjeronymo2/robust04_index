The agreements covered matters relating to epidemiologic  surveillance, human resource training, essential medicine,  vaccinations, biotechnology products, and the drafting of a  public health support system for Colombia.    President Fidel Castro attended the agreement-signing  ceremony, which was held at the Convention Palace. Castro spoke  with the visitors about the health situation in both countries  and referred to Cuba's family doctor program and low infant  mortality rate.    With regards to the latter, the Cuban leader reported Cuba's  1993 infant mortality rate was 9.4 for every 1,000 live births.  He said the possibility of going below 10 in a tropical country  had always been questioned.    In a brief assessment of his visit to the island, which  started on 2 January, Londono stated he had found a health  system superior to existing systems throughout the rest of the  continent.    After noting that primary attention in Cuba is not only  effective but also efficient, the Colombian health minister  emphasized the signing of an agreement with the Genetic  Engineering and Biotechnology Center for the purchase of 2.5  million Hepatitis-B vaccines.    Likewise, an agreement was reached with the Pedro Kouri  Tropical Medicine Institute to draft a support program to  control specific public health problems in Colombia.</p>

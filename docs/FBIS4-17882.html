			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Tyssovskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin told a news conference at the Russian Foreign  Ministry's press center here today he is grateful to the Russian  president for his invitation to come to Russia on an official  visit. This is the first Moscow visit of an Israeli premier.    Yitzhaq Rabin noted the role of the Soviet Union in creation  of the Israeli state, including military support without which,  in the words of Rabin, Israel would hardly complete the war for  independence with a success. Then, there was 40-years-long  absence of any relations between the two states.    Rabin said the current Russian policy aims to achieve peace  in the Middle East and other world regions.    Russia, same as the United States, may play a positive  encouraging role in making Arabs and Israelis to put an end to  violence, terror and war, said Rabin. At the same time, neither  co-sponsor can substitute parties to the conflict or stop the  conflict and bring peace to the region on its own.    Speaking of the Russian-Israeli relations, the prime  minister  said the Moscow negotiations resulted in signing of six  agreements. On Wednesday the sides are expected to sign the most  important document -- on the free trade zone. These documents  will be a good basis for the development of bilateral  cooperation in agriculture, science, tourism and other spheres,  stressed the official.    The Moscow negotiations also discussed a possibility to  establish broader relations and more close contact between the  two defence systems. He said the sides will work for positive  changes in relations of giant Russia and small, but proud and  independent Israel. This will be a new start for the  development of good relations between the two states. Yitzhaq  Rabin thinks these relations will be even better under new  conditions.    The Israeli Government head stressed he does not agree with  the idea to convene the 2nd Madrid conference and thinks  bilateral negotiations of Israel and its Arab opponents would do  better. He hopes that the Cairo negotiations with Palestinians  will result in an agreement to be implemented in a short period.    This will create a new reality and enable Palestinians to  regulate their life themselves. It is not a complete autonomy,  but the one without any damage to Israel, said Rabin.    Speaking of the reasons for delayed implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement, the official said they are unforeseen  circumstances. The dates were changed because a corresponding  agreement was not achieved, he said.    The Israeli prime minister sharply criticized the  fundamentalist radical groups of Hamas and al-Jihad al-Islam  which orient at "Khomeynism without Khomeyni". Their aim is to  torpedo the peace process, stressed the Israeli official. The  only possible response is boosted negotiations and achievement  of a viable agreement with due account of the sides' interests.    Rabin called against the deployment of international forces  from the U.S. And Russia in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area.  He said the co-sponsors should not risk the life of their  citizens at this stage.    In the opinion of Yitzhaq Rabin, peace in the Middle East  can  be achieved on condition of peace between Arabs and Israel and  control over actions of Iran, which is striving to blast the  regional situation.    Speaking of the Russian relations with Arab states, the  prime  minister stressed they should be considered from the point of  view of their influence on the peace process. Rabin reaffirmed  the Israeli readiness to withdraw troops from Syrian Golan  Heights, that is the most painful compromises in exchange for  peace. At the same time, geographic scale of the withdrawal  will depend on how profound the peace agreements would be, he  said.    Rabin denied Israel and Lebanon have a territorial dispute.  When the Lebanese Government provide for security of the  Israeli northern borders from encroachments of the pro-Iranian  Hezbollah group, Israel will be ready to liquidate this safety  zone on the south of the neighbouring state, he said.    Tomorrow morning the prime minister will complete the  official part of his visit and leave for St. Petersburg.</p>

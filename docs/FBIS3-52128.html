The voice of defiance is not  only the voice of Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, but it is the voice of  the masses, the free masses. Here in Surman, the same as  yesterday and the other days in other regions, everywhere there  are people ready for confrontation; people who insist on living  on the land of their fathers and ancestors freely,  independently, and with pride. [passage omitted]    Let the world hear the voice of the masses of Bu 'Isa and  Surman. Let the world hear the voice of the free masses, however  much those around us surrender and whatever the shivers of the  rulers of the Arab nation might be. They want the Arab nation  to be subjugated to its enemies. Whatever those who surrender  might do, whatever those who prostrate themselves might do, and  whatever those who tremble might do, we have decided to live  freely and with dignity on the land of our fathers and  ancestors. [passage omitted]    For this reason, to live in freedom and live a life worthy  of  the free man, for this reason we have decided that we will  confront anyone who wants to challenge us over the land of our  fathers and forefathers. This is our land, the land of the  fathers and forefathers. We paid for this land with the lives  of our fathers and forefathers. We have written its history in  their dear blood. We will not squander one grain of sand of this  land. The banners of this land will never fly under the banners  of the colonialists. No foreigner or colonialist can settle  this land. We challenge anyone who wants to challenge us.  [passage omitted]    The defiance started in Libya; the cry of confrontation  started in Libya; and the preparations for battle started in  Libya.    Brothers, we hear now another voice from Sudan. Sudan  announced yesterday the expulsion of the British ambassador  because he considered Sudan a British colony.    The dreams of the colonialists have returned again. The  dreams of the West have returned again. Their ambitions in  Tunisia, Algeria, Sudan, Libya, and everywhere in the Arab world  have returned. Their ambitions have returned again.    Yesterday Britain acted as if Sudan was not celebrating the  38th anniversary of its independence. Britain ignored Sudan as  an independent state. Britain ignored Sudan's dignity and  Sudan's independence. Britain proceeded along the course of  marching on the Arab homeland, trampling on the dignity of the  Arab homeland, and Arab existence with an indifference to the  national sovereignty of the peoples of the Arab nation.    Its ambassador quite insolently interfered in Khartoum's  domestic affairs. Brothers, look at this. It is not the year  1881 or 1882 or 1830, and it is not even 1911 [the date of the  Italian invasion of Libya]. Today it is 1993-94. Britain  behaved as if Sudan was a colony that belonged to King Faruq and  Faruq belonged to Britain. This is how Britain sees Egypt's and  Sudan's independence.    Yesterday, however, the Sudanese people headed by al-Bashir  announced that the confrontation was not only in Libya, it has  extended to Sudan by the expulsion of the British ambassador.  Sudan said to him that Sudan is an independent state and only  death can separate it.    This is what happened yesterday. The colonialists recognized  the legitimacy of the Somali national resistance. They  recognized Aidid as its national leader and that they must  negotiate with him after they used to say that he was a war  criminal who must be captured.    Brothers, this is a retreat in the face of the determination  of the Somali people to uphold truth and defeat lies. The truth  is that every nation has the right to live on the land of its  fathers and forefathers in freedom and dignity. Brothers, all  the peoples possess the right to die in defense of their honor  and independence.    The colonialists will pull back when they face these [words  indistinct] these challenges and this determination; the  determination of peoples to live freely brothers. Yes, they  will have to be very wary. This is coming from the masses of  Surman and Bu 'Isa only, not to mention the masses of the Arab  nation and the masses of Libya as a whole. There are masses in  Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Iraq,  the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen, and Sudan [repeated as heard].  There are innumerable masses and the colonialists will find it  difficult to impose their dominion again on a nation that is  beating the drums of confrontation, a nation that has decided to  live freely.    Yes, brothers, we are not just talking, we are demonstrating  with deeds. The national resistance in southern Lebanon is  daily writing in blood the words that we are speaking now, and  it is paving the path of liberation with the bodies of the  martyrs of Hizballah and the Lebanese national resistance.  There is fighting every day [word indistinct] in southern  Lebanon and Palestine under the leadership of Palestinian Jihad,  the Fatah Eagles, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], the  Popular Front, the Popular Democratic Front, the Popular  Front-General Command, the Fatah of Intifadah, and  Fatah-Revolutionary Council. [passage omitted]    Brothers, those who sell Palestine now in a public auction  will be punished by the Palestinian people. Brothers, those who  betray the Arab nation will see their just fate.    Brothers, we did not decide to go outside our borders. We  did not decide to commit aggression. We did not decide to  sabotage the world. We did not decide to trample on  international legitimacy. We only decided to live with respect  and dignity on our land. This is what we demanded and we will  defend it until death. They are the ones who trampled on the  international treaties and tore the UN Charter. They are the  ones who violated international law. [passage omitted]</p>

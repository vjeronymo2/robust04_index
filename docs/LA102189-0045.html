			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER KEY PLAYER  </P> <P> Randy Lewis' feature on Dodger Stadium organist Nancy Hefley ("Career Takes Her  Out to Ballgame a Lot," Calendar, Sept. 24) was a welcome piece of light  reading. It was almost as relentlessly upbeat as the cheerful lady in the  Dodgers' music chair, but one piece of history must be corrected: Ms. Hefley is  the fifth person to hold the key position since the Dodgers moved west, after  Bob Mitchell, Chauncey Haines, Don Beamsley and Helen (the Iron Woman) Dell,  who is without question the Lou Gehrig of ballpark organists.  </P> <P> RUSSELL KISHI, Glendale  </P></p>

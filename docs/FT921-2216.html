			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Propping up Japan Inc. MR YASUSHI Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, has made his point. Having asserted his independence by conspicuously failing to respond to pleas from leading politicians for a cut in interest rates, he should now do what he probably intended to do all along. The latest GNP figures, which showed that the Japanese economy was shrinking marginally in the final quarter of last year, merely provide a formal excuse. A cut in the discount rate must be odds-on before March 31, an important reporting date for Japanese financial institutions. Mr Mieno would, of course, be entitled to plead that the views of leading members of the ruling Liberal Democratic party on monetary policy are scarcely impartial. Just as the stock market boom provided them with fund-raising opportunities, both legitimate and scandalous, the subsequent crash has had an equal and opposite effect on their finances. The LDP is thus one of many victims of Mr Mieno's tough monetary stance. But in this instance, its deputy president, the vociferous Mr Shin Kanemaru, is right, even if his motivation is open to question. The Bank of Japan's reluctance to bring down interest rates more rapidly is rooted in the fear that asset price inflation could be re-ignited. This is understandable on the part of any guardian of the currency; but in this instance it is a case of responding to the last crisis but one. The Japanese financial system is creaking at the seams. And as the scandal at Daiwa Securities revealed last week, there are still substantial losses in the system which have yet to be recorded and absorbed because no one can agree on where those losses should properly fall. Put another way, the understandings on which many of the trade-offs and cross-subsidies in the Japanese financial system have been based are coming unstuck. There are likely to be more uncomfortable revelations in the pipeline. Real economy The more important reason for questioning the present monetary stance lies in the real economy. Many leading Japanese industrialists have been arguing that Japan Inc. is fundamentally sound and that it faces no more than a cyclical upset. Yet there are good grounds for thinking that the problem is structural. Growth in the late 1980s was driven primarily by business investment, which was undertaken on the kind of scale that prevailed when Japan was still capable of generating double-digit growth. The investment boom was financed at what were perceived to be minimal, or even negative, borrowing costs. Much of that investment thus went into sub-optimal projects, which is the polite economist's way of saying that it was wasted. Inescapable fall Against that background, and with real financing costs looking exceptionally high, a fall in capital spending was inescapable. Meantime, in the aftermath of the asset price bubble, it is hardly surprising that the debt-laden personal sector is reluctant to spend and that the trade surplus is rising ominously. Yesterday's news that volume limits on car exports to the US are to be cut will probably make little difference to the political fallout in the run-up to the presidential election. Japanese car production in the US was no doubt undertaken to deal with just such a contingency, and it is soaring. The question now is whether a cut in interest rates and accelerated public works spending will be sufficient to stave off a serious recession. The lesson from the US appears to be that a heavily indebted economy with big financial problems is much less responsive to relaxations in monetary policy than expected. The scope for a significant fiscal expansion in Japan is far greater than in the US; but the traditional Japanese reluctance to loosen the purse strings will limit the extent of any boost. So, too, will the fact that the construction sector still suffers from bottlenecks and labour shortages left over from the boom. The government and the central bank will probably provide a modest prop to confidence in the short run. But it will be some time before Japan returns to the 5 per cent growth of the late 1980s.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The foreign currency market was almost stagnant  today and prices decreased compared to yesterday. The changes  in the foreign currency market follow yesterday's decisions by  the committee for regulating the foreign currency market. The  committee announced that the state banking system will supply  the foreign currency required by some importers at 50 rials less  than current market prices.    The cabinet also decided in a session last night that,  taking  into account the decisions of the committee for regulating  foreign currency, dealings with the foreign currency open market  by any government establishment or establishments affiliated to  the government in order to secure their required foreign  currency will be illegal and any negligence by the banks during  the currency allocation procedures will be deemed as  collaboration with economic saboteurs.    Here is our correspondent with a report on the situation in  the foreign currency market today:    [Unidentified correspondent] After the decision by the  committee for regulating the foreign currency market to ban the  purchase of dollars by government companies as well offering  foreign currency to companies at prices lower than those on the  open market, currency prices on the Tehran currency market fell  by 100 to 150 rials per dollar last night. Today as well,  prices are reduced by the same amount compared with yesterday's  prices.    Right now I am at the Tehran foreign currency market. After  last night's cabinet decision, currency dealings at the Tehran  foreign currency market have almost stopped since this morning  but at the new prices currency dealers are only buying and show  no inclination to sell.    At the same time on the Tehran open foreign currency market  currency dealings are stagnant and the market is quiet. At the  moment each dollar is priced at 263 tumans which shows a  decrease of 14 to 17 tumans compared with yesterday.</p>

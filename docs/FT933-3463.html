			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Closer links help boost business - In A Nutshell Ninety-eight per cent of companies which established close 'partnership' relations with their suppliers or customers achieved substantial business improvements, according to a survey by Partnership Sourcing, a joint CBI/Department of Trade initiative. Partnerships involve customers working closely with suppliers in fields such as product development, deliveries and marketing (see this page August 3). Of the 356 companies questioned 85 per cent said they had improved their service to customers, 75 per cent had cut costs, 72 per cent had reduced stocks and 70 per cent had improved quality. One trend to emerge from the survey was the need for purchasing departments to become less clerical and more strategic in their approach. Partnership Sourcing. Tel. 071 379 7400.</p>

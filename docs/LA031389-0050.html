			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> State Sues Over TWA Ads: The state of California has charged Trans World  Airlines with deceptive advertising. The complaint alleges that TWA advertised  in newspapers and other media a low one-way fare to London, although in fact  the fare could be obtained only by buying a round-trip ticket. State Atty. Gen.  John Van de Kamp issued a statement saying that the suit -- in San Diego County  Superior Court -- would bar the airline from further unfair advertising and  assess civil penalties.  </P></p>

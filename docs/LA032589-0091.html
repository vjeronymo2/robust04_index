			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSING AUTHORITY PAINTING JOB IS THE PITS, MEMO SAYS  </P> <P> A $2.9-million program under way at the Los Angeles City Housing Authority to  repaint 13 low-income public housing projects is plagued by poor workmanship  and management problems, an internal memo reveals.  </P> <P> Painters hired by the Housing Authority on a temporary basis over the last two  months have failed to scrape and prepare wood surfaces at several projects,  according to the March 9 memo obtained by The Times. In some cases, labels were  removed from paint containers to make it appear that primer was being applied,  the memo said.  </P> <P> The memo was written by Rudy Monterro, a maintenance supervisor at the Aliso  Village housing project, who reported in the document that his complaints of  shoddy work were "totally ignored" by Housing Authority managers. Monterro was  assigned to lead a three-man Housing Authority inspection team that was  disbanded Tuesday by Executive Director Leila Gonzalez-Correa.  </P> <P> Monterro declined to comment on the memo or Gonzalez-Correa's action.  </P> <P> The program, described by Housing Commissioner Arturo Fribourg as "one of the  largest painting undertakings to go on in the city at one time," is among  several renovation projects at the Housing Authority that have suffered from  poor quality or lengthy delays. Earlier this month, The Times reported that an  independent study criticized the Housing Authority for taking up to five years  to spend millions of dollars in federal housing improvement funds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Peeling Paint  </P> <P> In addition, a $342,000 paint job of Nickerson Gardens in Watts, the largest  public housing project west of the Mississippi, is peeling on several buildings  only months after the work was done, Fribourg said. The contractor, Circle N  Inc., abandoned the project before applying the finishing touches and left the  country, Housing Authority officials said. And a $6-million contract negotiated  in February, 1987, to modernize 481 units at Mar Vista Gardens in Culver City  is in jeopardy because the contractor, Dalton Construction Co., is in serious  financial trouble, Housing Authority officials said Thursday. Of the 50  buildings that were scheduled to be refurbished by last November, only 33 have  been completed to date, records show.  </P> <P> Several Housing Authority administrators said they could not comment on the  agency's painting and construction woes because they are under orders to refer  all inquiries to Gonzalez-Correa, who refused to be interviewed.  </P> <P> Gonzalez-Correa, in fact, has asked the Housing Authority Board of  Commissioners to formalize her no-comment policy. She requested that agency  employees be prohibited from writing or speaking to commissioners, City Council  members, government workers and reporters without her permission. But the  proposed policy raises legal and constitutional questions involving an  employee's First Amendment right to free speech, said Deputy City Atty. Dov  Lesel.  </P> <P> Gonzalez-Correa requested the communications ban a month ago after she and the  agency became the subject of intensive publicity after disclosures that she had  ignored federal regulations while awarding more than $200,000 in contracts to  her friends and to political supporters of Mayor Tom Bradley.  </P> <P> Questions about the painting of the 13 housing projects began to surface in  February when Monterro wrote a memo to Faustin Gonzalez, the agency's  modernization director.  </P> <P> Last month, the Housing Authority began hiring 98 painters and 14 carpenters  from union halls and 42 tenants to assist in the painting project. The agency  elected not to pay a painting contractor because housing officials "made a  judgment they could do it cheaper and faster," said Gary Squier, the mayor's  housing coordinator.  </P> <P> The painting program received $2.7 million from the refinancing of Housing  Authority property and $230,000 from U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development modernization funds. The price of paint materials was about  $400,000 while labor and equipment account for the remaining $2.5 million.  Records show that the 702 buildings are expected to be finished by the middle  of next month.  </P> <P> Monterro reported in his memo that painters were not preparing wood and priming  only part of window frames and doors at Aliso Village, even though the project  had not been painted since 1975. Monterro's inspection committee also found no  scraping or priming work at Pico Gardens, no priming at San Fernando Gardens  and only partial priming at Ramona Gardens, according to the memo.  </P> <P> Labels had been ripped off paint containers at Aliso Village and Pico Gardens,  the memo said.  </P> <P> "On Thursday, March 6, 1989, I went to Pico Gardens at 8:30 a.m. and observed  that the painters were setting up to spray an overhang, " Monterro wrote. "When  I inquired as to whether or not primer or a finish coat was being applied, (the  foreman) indicated that it was primer. When I asked why the labels had been  removed from the cans, (the foreman) gave me a big story and insisted that it  was primer. After I tested the material by sticking my fingers into it and  smelling it, I told (the foreman) that he was not telling the truth, because  the material was a finish material. He then admitted that it was a finish  material and indicated that he was just following orders."  </P> <P> Within the last week, Fribourg said, paint crews at Pico Gardens have been  scraping wood around windows and doors.  </P> <P> The paint program has suffered logistical problems as well. At San Fernando  Gardens in Pacoima, for example, a rented hydraulic lift was delivered two  weeks before the paint crew began working, said one Housing Authority official  who asked not to be identified. When the painters arrived, the lift had been  hauled away.  </P> <P> In his memo, Monterro stated that Faustin Gonzalez had ignored Monterro's  requests to discuss the paint program. Monterro also wrote that on March 3 he  contacted Jorge Rosales, Gonzalez's assistant, to inform him of his findings.  Rosales asked Monterro, "What are you, a spy?" according to Monterro's memo.  </P> <P> Rosales and Faustin Gonzalez were appointed this week by Gonzalez-Correa as the  only supervisors to inspect the paint program.  </P></p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Difficult chapter refuses to close Completion of the parliamentary inquiry should in theory allow the new management team at Credit Lyonnais to close a troubled chapter of the bank's history. Instead, they have found themselves struggling with more skeletons tumbling out of the closets. When Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who succeeded Mr Jean-Yves Haberer as chairman last autumn, announced last spring that Credit Lyonnais had made a net loss of FFr6.9bn (Pounds 834m) in 1993 and required the state's support for a FFr44.9bn rescue package, it looked as though he had brought all the bank's problems out into the open. Mr Peyrelevade recently warned that he has since discovered some new problems. His submission to the parliamentary inquiry also confirms that he considers the original FFr44.9bn package inadequate. The French financial community is now anxiously waiting to hear how bad those problems are and how much more money is required. 'It's a bit of a black hole,' says Mr Sasha Serafimovski, European banking analyst at Merrill Lynch. 'We now know that the initial clear-out wasn't sufficient. What we don't know is where it's going to end.' He, like other observers, had initially expected Credit Lyonnais to break even in 1994 before returning to profit next year. The group is now expected to stay in the red this year, with a deficit of between FFr1bn and FFr4bn depending on what level of provisions the government agrees to. Mr Peyrelevade is now understood to be wrangling with the authorities over the scale of those provisions and over the amount of money the bank needs. Credit Lyonnais originally planned to stage a FFr4.9bn capital increase this autumn open to all investors, as opposed to this spring's FFr4.9bn increase which was restricted to the government and its state-controlled shareholders, the Caisse des Depots and Thomson electronics group. However, the deterioration in expectations of the bank's performance, coupled with the weakness of the French equity market, could complicate such an exercise. Meanwhile Credit Lyonnais may need to raise more than FFr4.9bn, given the gravity of its financial difficulties.</p>

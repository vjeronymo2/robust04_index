			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Automatic data collection equipment requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The analyzer response may be read by automatic data collection (ADC) equipment such as computers, data loggers, and so forth. If ADC equipment is used, the following is required:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) For bag sample analysis, the analyzer response must be stable at greater than 99 percent of the final reading for the dilute exhaust sample bag. A single value representing the average chart deflection over a 10-second stabilized period shall be stored.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For continuous analysis systems, a single value representing the average integrated concentration over a cycle shall be stored.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The chart deflections or average integrated concentrations required in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section may be stored on long-term computer storage devices such as computer tapes, storage discs, punch cards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and so forth, or they may be printed in a listing for storage. In either case a chart recorder is not required and records from a chart recorder, if they exist, need not be stored.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) If ADC equipment is used to interpret analyzer values, the ADC equipment is subject to the calibration specifications of the analyzer as if the ADC equipment is part of analyzer system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Data records from any one or a combination of analyzers may be stored as chart recorder records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bag sample analysis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For bag sample analysis perform the following sequence:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Warm up and stabilize the analyzers; clean and/or replace filter elements, conditioning columns (if used), and so forth, as necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Obtain a stable zero reading.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Zero and span the analyzers with zero and span gases. The span gases must have concentrations between 75 and 100 percent of full-scale chart deflection. The flow rates and system pressures during spanning shall be approximately the same as those encountered during sampling. A sample bag may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be used to identify the required analyzer range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Recheck zero response. If this zero response differs from the zero response recorded in paragraph (c)(3) of this section by more than 1 percent of full scale, then paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section must be repeated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) If a chart recorder is used, identify and record the most recent zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) If ADC equipment is used, electronically record the most recent zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Measure HC, CO, CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  background concentrations in the sample bag(s) with approximately the same flow rates and pressures used in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. (Constituents measured continuously do not require bag analysis.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) A post-analysis zero and span check of each range must be performed and the values recorded. The number of events that may occur between the pre- and post-analysis checks is not specified. However, the difference between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pre-analysis zero and span values (recorded in paragraph (c)(5) or (c)(6) of this section) versus those recorded for the post-analysis check may not exceed the zero drift limit or the span drift limit of 2 percent of full-scale chart  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deflection for any range used. Otherwise the test is void.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Continuous sample analysis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For continuous sample analysis perform the following sequence:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Warm up and stabilize the analyzers; clean and/or replace filter elements, conditioning columns (if used), and so forth, as necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Leak check portions of the sampling system that operate at negative gauge pressures when sampling, and allow heated sample lines, filters, pumps, and so forth to stabilize at operating temperature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Optional: Perform a hangup check for the HFID sampling system:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Zero the analyzer using zero air introduced at the analyzer port.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

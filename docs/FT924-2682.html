			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Scotland (4): Mr Lang's open options - The local government debate When Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish Secretary, introduced his second discussion document on local government in Scotland in October, he might have hoped that debate would centre on possible cost savings and on the new council map involved in moving towards a single tier of unitary authorities. An earlier paper published in 1991 indicated that the Conservatives would move towards a single tier of local government if they won the general election. It implicitly ruled out the creation of a Scottish parliament. The new document sets out in more detail the government's case for replacing the current two-tier structure of nine regional, three (single tier) island and 51 district councils. But it has left its options open on the new council structure and put forward scenarios involving between 15 and 51 councils, with joint boards to provide services such as education and police, where administration by a large number of unitary authorities would be inefficient. Mr Lang has since emphasised that he has reached no decision on the new local council map of Scotland. There was no masterplan ready to be dusted off, he said. He wanted widespread debate. But - perhaps predictably - initial public reactions have been political. Professor Alan Alexander, who is director of the Scottish Local Authorities Management Centre at Strathclyde University, says: 'This document is politically driven. The aim is to break up Labour control of local government. In particular there is a wish to be rid of the great Labour fiefdoms of Strathclyde and Lothian. 'But the government might be out of luck. Research has shown that however you slice the cake the Conservatives would not pick up control of many councils. I think there is a strong argument for unitary authorities but it is not the one put forward in this discussion document.' Prof Alexander admits he is a Labour supporter. At the moment the Conservatives control none of the regional councils and only five of the districts. Many of the councils are hung. Mr Mark Lazarowicz, the leader of the Labour group on Edinburgh district council, has similar views. He says: 'I do not know that it is politically driven because it probably would result in few gains to the Conservatives. Certainly it is ministerially driven. 'Mr Lang needs something to do over the next few years and it is likely there will be a single tier of government. 'Our position is that a single tier makes sense only if there is a Scottish parliament. Labour party policy is for a Scottish parliament. If we cannot have a parliament we are happy with the way things are. We work very well with Lothian regional council and there is hardly any overlap of functions.' If Edinburgh were made a unitary authority, he asks, 'How would you service the parts of Lothian which are sparsely populated? More important, how would you ensure the people of Lothian were adequately represented?' The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla) takes the view that a change in the current system is unwanted and unnecessary. Mr Bruce Black, the senior deputy secretary, says: 'Few of our members welcome these proposals, although of course, when push comes to shove, some of the bigger district authorities might want to become unitary authorities. 'The current system works well. You need regional councils to handle strategic areas like water and roads. You need the economies of scale you can achieve. You also need the district councils, particularly in remote areas, to respond to local needs.' But when Mr David McLetchie, vice-president of the Scottish Conservative &amp; Unionist Association, is asked to comment on Cosla's views, his reply is robust: 'They would say that. Cosla is dominated by the Labour party.' However, he adds: 'It would be less than honest if we didn't acknowledge that part of the appeal of these proposals is the political case against the large Labour strongholds. 'But this should not obscure the cogent arguments in favour of reforming local government.' Stripped of the political overtones, the arguments, as set out in the discussion document, can be summarised as follows: Under the present system there is confusion about which tier is responsible for which functions; There is an overlapping of functions which results in waste - and bloated employment levels. Although regional councils have been in existence since 1975, many people still think of themselves as living in the now-extinct counties. Streamlining local government would accord with the government's desire to move from councils providing most services themselves, to becoming 'enabling' authorities which might contract out many functions to other bodies or the private sector. There would also be cost savings. A report by the accountants Touche Ross for the discussion document estimated a that a 15-authority structure could save an estimated Pounds 192m a year, a 24-authority structure Pounds 120m a year and a 35 unit structure Pounds 55m a year. But a 51 council would cost Pounds 58m more a year than the existing setup. These figures are tentative; not everybody agrees there would be cost savings. It would depend on whether existing facilities were used, on new staffing and computer systems and on a range of other factors. However the idea that 51 council structure would cost more money almost certainly rules this out as a choice. At the other extreme a 15-council scheme would be rather too similar for comfort to the existing regional council arrangements, despite the estimated cost saving. Prof Alexander has doubts about cost savings but still favours a move towards a single tier system. His argument is that the near-monopoly of service delivery held by local government has been broken by changes in housing legislation and education; and by the introduction of compulsory competitive tendering for many local authority services. In short, he implies, the development of the enabling council has gone so far that people's democratic rights are weakened when residual services are spread between two tiers of local government. He advocates a system of single unitary councils for most of Scotland with two tiers in the remote areas of the Highlands, making some 30 councils in all. There would be a number of area boards for services like fire, policing but perhaps not water. Mr McLetchie, who drafted the Conservative party's submission after the first consultative paper, says: 'I don't know what is going to happen. But I suspect that you are going to end up with around 30 councils which will not be dissimilar to the old county council structure you had before the reforms of 1975.'</p>

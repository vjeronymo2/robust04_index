			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LUMBER UNIT SOLD TO JAFFEE;  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT: CHAIN'S FORMER PRESIDENT BUYS CATHEDRAL CITY STORE AS  BANKRUPTCY JUDGE FORMALIZES LIQUIDATION OF ONCE-THRIVING COMPANY. BUILDERS  EMPORIUM TO TAKE OVER ENCINITAS OUTLET.  </P> <P> Melvin Jaffee's day in bankruptcy court Thursday marked both an end and a new  beginning for the former president of National Lumber &amp; Supply Inc.  </P> <P> U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James N. Barr approved the sale of the once-thriving home  improvement chain's two remaining stores Thursday. Jaffee will pay about $1.3  million for a store in Cathedral City, and Builders Emporium will buy an  Encinitas store for about $1.3 million.  </P> <P> "I'm glad I was able to keep one store," said a misty-eyed Jaffee, who accepted  congratulations from people in the courtroom after the proceedings. He said he  was sorry that the National Lumber employees in Encinitas would lose their  jobs.  </P> <P> "That's the only thing I feel bad about," he said.  </P> <P> Jaffee, 56, had wanted to buy both stores. With his father, he spent almost  half a decade building the home improvement chain, which had 21 stores when it  filed for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on April 3. Barr ordered the  Fountain Valley company liquidated on Aug. 28.  </P> <P> The court allowed Jaffee to retain non-exclusive rights to use the National  Lumber name.  </P> <P> Wickes Cos., the parent of Builders Emporium, agreed to pay $1.3 million cash  by noon today for the Encinitas store, which will be operated as a Builders  Emporium store. It also bought an option to acquire the lease of a closed  National Lumber store in South Gate.  </P> <P> Jaffee said he plans to refurbish the store in Cathedral City, which is near  Palm Springs. He also acquired the store's inventory and two storage  facilities.  </P> <P> Virginia-based Lumber City, which had been bidding for the Cathedral City  store, pulled out of the negotiations Wednesday.  </P> <P> The landlord of the Encinitas store, Mitsui/SBD America Fund, held up an  agreement earlier this week by objecting to Jaffee retaining the lease on that  store. Mitsui said it was concerned about Jaffee's proposed financing.  </P></p>

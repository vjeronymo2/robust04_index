			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN JOSE;  </P> <P> BOY, 5, SAYS HE SAW FATHER KILL WOMAN  </P> <P> A 5-year-old boy, still haunted by the memory, says he was splattered with  blood and watched in horror as his father robbed and murdered a woman three  years ago, investigators said. "We feel the information the child gave is  accurate," Police Chief Joseph McNamara said.  </P> <P> "The details he gave fit the crime." A $10,000 reward for information leading  to the arrest and conviction of the boy's father, Erik Sanford Chatman, 25, has  been offered through the city's Crimestopper program, McNamara said. Chatman  was seen recently in the San Francisco Bay Area and is "considered armed and  dangerous. He is a known drug abuser," the police chief said. Chatman is  suspected in the stabbing death of Rosellina LoBue, 18, during the Oct. 7,  1987, robbery of a drive-up photo shop.  </P></p>

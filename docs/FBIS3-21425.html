The genesis of the Kashmir problem is rooted in its history  and the events of the last 40 years. It is a complex problem,  which the Czech republic is observing from the outside, he said.    He clarified that this was the political stand of his  government. Mr Havel said that he could not offer any personal  views on Kashmir and the allegations of human rights violations,  since he had not been to the state to personally see the  realities.    If he had the time and the opportunity to visit Kashmir and  see things for himself it would be possible to make an  assessment of the validity or otherwise of international  accusations against India of human rights violations in the  valley.    The official position of the Czech republic on Kashmir is  that the matter is an internal affair of India and Pakistan and  the problems should be resolved through mutual negotiations on  the basis of the Shimla agreement of 1972.    Playwright, philosopher and dissident-turned-establishment  politician, the Czech President chafes under the burden of  office. He confessed that the most unpleasant part of being a  head of state was to have to repeat several times over the same  words at different fora. For a wordsmith, who has described his  paradox as "I write mercilessly sceptical" pieces, repetition  must be agony. The demands on his time to perform public duties  eats into his pursuit of art. Mr Havel said that writing had  become a victim of his political career.    While the horrors of "criminality, hatred among  nationalities, suspicion, racism, deliberate lying, politicking  in an unrestrained struggle for purely partisan interests, a  hunger for power, unadulterated ambition" had receded in the  Czech republic, the dangers lurked under the surface. These  spectres were rampant outside the Czech republic, Mr. Havel said.    There was xenophobia, fanaticism and violence against which  the struggle for morality and responsibility and conscience  would have to be waged.    Mr Havel said that there were basic human rights that would  have to be protected. As head of state, he would use the  opportunity to further the cause of human rights. The global  yardstick for human rights would have to be forged out of the  inherent truths in every religion, which fundamentalists in  their own self-interest had perverted to serve their  fundamentalist cause. These inherent truths which were the  essence of every religion would have to form the basic  foundation of a global yardstick for human rights.    Mr Havel said the virus of truth was an analogy he had used  to describe the dissident movement against the totalitarian  regime in former Czechoslovakia. Battling ethnic conflict and  violence generated by hatred between nationalities required a  different remedy. Truth was weak against the accumulated  bitterness of ethnic conflict and violence, he said.    Mr Havel spent part of the morning visiting Mother Teresa  and  handed over a cheque for the Missionaries of Charity. He visited  the Kalighat temple as well.</p>

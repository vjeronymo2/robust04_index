			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABSENTEE VOTERS HELP GIVE HILL GOP STATE SENATE NOMINATION  </P> <P> Assemblyman Frank Hill put together his victory in Tuesday's Senate election  with the help of absentee ballots and hard-core Los Angeles County Republicans  unwilling to believe attacks on his ethics, according to political consultants.  </P> <P> The Whittier Republican, who since 1988 has been the target of an FBI political  corruption investigation, led a field of eight candidates. Because Hill failed  to win 50% of the vote, he will face Janice Graham of Laguna Hills, the top  Democratic vote-getter, in an April 10 runoff to fill the vacancy created by  the decision of Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) to leave office.  </P> <P> With Republicans holding an edge of 54% to 36% among registered voters, Hill is  widely believed to have the inside track at winning the runoff in the sprawling  31st Senate District, which stretches from West Covina and Whittier in the  north to Laguna Beach in the south.  </P> <P> In anticipation of a Hill victory in April, seven candidates already have lined  up to run for his 52nd Assembly District seat in the June 5 primary election.  </P> <P> Sal Russo, Hill's campaign consultant, said attacks against Hill "lacked  credibility." Voters in the Whittier area, which Hill has represented in the  Assembly for eight years, "knew him too well" for the criticism to undermine  his reputation, Russo said.  </P> <P> The unofficial results were: Hill, 15,043 votes, or 22.8%; Gil Ferguson,  14,123, or 21.4%; Ron Isles, 11,827, or 18%; Gary Miller, 10,310, or 15.6%;  Graham, 9,357, or 14.2%; Bradley McFadden, 3,056, or 4.6%; Thomas Whaling,  1,489, or 2.3%; and Robert Lewis, 683, or 1%.  </P> <P> Nearly half of Hill's votes came from absentee ballots, according to election  officials in Orange and Los Angeles counties. Orange County officials Wednesday  said they were still counting another 500 absentee ballots.  </P> <P> Russo acknowledged that "the absentees certainly were a help." Of Hill's  absentee ballots, 5,559 or about 70% were cast in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> The Senate campaign was the third special election in recent months where  absentee ballots played an important role.  </P> <P> Last week in Modesto, Democrat Sal Canella won a special Assembly election on a  heavy tide of mailed in ballots. Canella was running to fill a vacancy created  by the election of Assemblyman Gary Condit (D-Ceres) to Congress. Condit, too,  fashioned his victory four months ago with a heavy reliance on absentee  ballots.  </P> <P> Harvey Englander, a campaign consultant to Republican Isles, a Brea city  councilman, said Hill's campaign was able to get off to a faster start than  other candidates in encouraging voters to file absentee ballots.  </P> <P> Englander cited a letter Hill mailed early in the campaign that erroneously  implied that he had been endorsed by former Sen. Campbell. The letter included  an absentee ballot application, which Englander and other consultants said  could have provided a boost to Hill's campaign.  </P> <P> Another factor in the outcome was a last-minute mailer sent out by a  Sacramento-based Republican group to promote Democrat Graham's candidacy,  Englander said. Sources said the purpose had been to help Hill by heading off  Democrats who might defect to Isles over the abortion issue. Isles was the only  pro-choice Republican in the race.  </P> <P> Bob Gouty, a consultant to Republican Miller, a Diamond Bar city councilman,  said the low turnout of 17% and the number of hard-core Republicans who did  vote played a pivotal role in the result. "They will generally vote for some  sort of incumbent," Gouty said. Hill already represents "a large part of the  district," and many Republicans in Los Angeles County treated him as the  incumbent, Gouty said.  </P> <P> Democratic legislative staffers privately have dismissed the chances of Graham  or any other Democrat of winning the runoff because of the Republicans  registration edge.  </P> <P> "No doubt at all, (Hill will) win the runoff," Englander agreed. But, he  maintained, if Hill is indicted in the political corruption investigation "all  bets are off," and there could be a write-in campaign mounted by another  Republican.  </P> <P> American Independent Party candidate Robert Lewis will also be in the runoff.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, seven Republicans, including Hill, have filed papers indicating  their intention to run for the 52nd Assembly District. A Hill campaign official  indicated that Hill's filing was a mistake.  </P> <P> The other Republicans who have filed are Kenneth Manning, a member of the  Hacienda-La Puente Unified School District who said Stuart Spencer, an adviser  to former President Reagan, will oversee his campaign; Wil Baca and Jim Baker,  both of Hacienda Heights; Jack Dortignac of West Covina; Phil Mautino of  Whittier and Tony Russo, a former aide to Hill.  </P> <P> One Democrat, Gary Neely of Diamond Bar, has filed papers with the county to  run for the seat.  </P></p>

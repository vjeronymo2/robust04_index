			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / International Company News: BA joins German banks in deal BRITISH Airways has, with three German partner banks, acquired Delta Air, a German commuter airline, to consolidate its position in the domestic German air travel market. Delta Air, which has no connection with Delta Air Lines, the US carrier, will form the operating base of Deutsche BA, the joint airline company set up by BA last year with Commerzbank, Berliner Bank and Bayerische Vereinsbank. The three banks own 51 per cent of Deutsche BA, with the UK carrier controlling the remaining 49 per cent. The company was set up as a vehicle to enable BA to maintain its presence in the domestic German market. BA has traditionally had a strong presence in the German market since the second world war with its Internal German Services (IGS), based in Berlin. But following German unification two years ago, it has been forced by the German authorities to run down its IGS activities. IGS operates 92 scheduled flights a week on five routes from Berlin but will have to cease all its operations by the summer of 1993. To continue operating in the German market, the UK carrier had to establish a new airline majority owned by German interests. 'Delta Air will help us build up the operating base for the new German company,' BA said yesterday. The UK carrier did not disclose how much Deutsche BA was paying for the commuter carrier, which operates 10 turbo-propeller aircraft including 9 Saab 340s and one Dornier 228. But Deutsche BA plans to acquire an unspecified number of Boeing 737-300 twin-engined airliners to develop its German network. Delta Air carried 225,000 passengers last year on domestic German routes as well as serving international destinations including Brussels, Zurich, Paris and Basle. The commuter carrier based at Friedrichshafen by Lake Constance was set up in Germany by Crossair, the Swiss regional carrier. The Deutsche BA acquisition coincides with moves by Lufthansa, the German flag carrier, to consolidate its own position in its domestic market. Lufthansa has taken an option to acquire up to half of the voting capital of Aero Lloyd, the German charter airline. Aero Lloyd is understood to have also had discussions with BA and Delta Air Lines.</p>

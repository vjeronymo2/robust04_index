			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Top Norwegian savings bank returns to black Sparebanken Nor, Norway's biggest savings bank, yesterday reported a sharp reversal in its fortunes, with a net profit of NKr1.52bn (Dollars 200m) in 1993 against a loss of NKr154m a year earlier. The savings bank, known internationally as Union Bank of Norway, said although loan losses continue to be unusually high and growth in volume was modest, the improvement was far above expectations. The near-50 per cent decline in domestic interest rates, which contributed to a sharp rise in bond prices, made a strong contribution to the turnround. Sparebanken Nor will pay a dividend of NKr18 per primary capital certificate  -a hybrid security listed on the Oslo bourse - and will allocate NKr599m to a dividend adjustment reserve fund. Group net interest income rose by NKr604m to NKr3.21bn, as net operating income shot up to NKr5.35bn from NKr3.73bn. Operating expenses rose slightly, to NKr2.46bn from NKr2.43bn. Losses on loans and guarantees dipped to NKr1.31bn from NKr1.5bn, but the bank still achieved an operating profit of NKr1.56bn against an operating loss of NKr271m. The bank said the volume of defaulted loans developed 'in the right direction'. Net non-interest-bearing loans fell to NKr1.7bn last year from NKr2.7bn in 1992, with the loss of income on such loans representing an estimated Nkr220m in 1993 against NKr300m the previous year. Norgeskreditt, the Norwegian mortgage lending institution which converted to a bank last year, reported a rise in 1993 pre-tax profit, to NKr272.5m from NKr133m in 1992, helped by an increase in net interest income and a fall in loan losses. Nevertheless, the bank's shares closed down NKr1.50 at NKr150.50 yesterday on the Oslo bourse in active trading. Norgeskreditt will pay a dividend of NKr8.50 per preference share, with the total payout reaching NKr96.4m. Group net interest income rose to NKr313.7m, or 1.5 per cent of average total assets, from NKr266.8m, or 1.3 per cent of average total assets. Realised gains on bonds, certificates and foreign exchange reached NKr29.7m, against a loss of NKr3.8m in 1992. Profits on shares amounted to NKr26m last year, against a loss of NKr17.1m. The bank said that a write-down of NKr6.9m of the share portfolio at the end of 1992 was reversed in last year's first quarter, with the market value of shareholdings at the end of last year NKr29.4m higher than the acquisition cost.</p>

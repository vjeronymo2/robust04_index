			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Dollar hits new lows as hopes of Fed rates move fade Pessimism about the prospects of the Federal Reserve lifting US interest rates yesterday drove the dollar to fresh lows in Europe. A benign set of US inflation data reduced pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates, while US and European leaders continued to stress that the level of the dollar was best left to the market to determine. The dollar steadied during US trading after the White House released figures revising down the budget deficit for fiscal 1994. Earlier, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, had told reporters that the Group of Seven leading industrial countries was right not to overreact to the dollar's decline. 'The economic fundamentals are in order in the US. The agreement by the finance ministers was the correct way. The US has inflation under control and good growth. These are convincing signs for a stable dollar,' said Mr Waigel after a meeting with President Bill Clinton. The dollar closed in London at DM1.5235 from DM1.54. Against the yen it finished at Y96.80 from Y97.36 on Monday. In New York it closed at DM1.528 and Y97.325 and early today in Tokyo it opened at Y97.44. Dollar weakness spilled over into sterling, which closed at its lowest level against the D-Mark since soon after the UK currency left the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992. The UK currency closed in London at DM2.3958 from DM2.4081 on Monday. These losses were partially offset by gains against the dollar. One side-effect of the dollar's fall was the continued recovery yesterday of European government bonds, as more investors shifted out of US bonds into Europe to escape currency weakness. One of the strongest performers was Italy, where 10-year bonds rose by about 1 1/2 points. UK gilts also rose sharply before easing in late trading. The dollar weakened after comments from Mr Ron Brown, the US trade secretary. Speaking after congressional testimony in Washington, he said the US would continue to use 'aggressive, pro-active' methods to open Japan to foreign goods. Mr Brown added that he saw no inflation pressures which would warrant higher interest rates: 'If inflation is not a problem, then I think you would have to make a reasonable argument that changes in interest rates are not appropriate.' Mr Brown said interest rate policy was the province of the Federal Reserve. He received support for his views from the re-lease of the June producer price index data. The PPI, excluding volatile food and energy components, fell by 0.1 per cent in June - well below market expectations. A further fillip for the US economy came with a downward revision of the deficit for fiscal 1994 ending September 30. Mr Leon Panetta, White House budget director, said the deficit would be Dollars 220.1bn compared with February estimates of Dollars 234.8m. He said the figures showed the Clinton economic programme to be a 'remarkable success', reducing the deficit for two years in a row for the first time in two decades.

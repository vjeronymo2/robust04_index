			<p>931101 FT  01 NOV 93 / Venezuela gas blast arrests A Venezuelan criminal court judge issued warrants at the weekend for the arrest of 19 people, including executives of GTE and AT&amp;T in Venezuela, as part of an investigation into a gas pipeline explosion outside Caracas that killed about 50 people, writes Joseph Mann in Caracas. The explosion on September 28 occurred allegedly when an excavating machine digging a trench for fibre-optic cable struck an underground natural gas pipeline. CANTV, the privatised telecommunications company run by a consortium headed by GTE of the US, contracted AT&amp;T Andinos to lay the fibre-optic cable. AT&amp;T sub-contracted a Venezuelan company, Abengoa, to carry out the work. The pipeline is operated by Corpoven, a subsidiary of the national oil company PDVSA. No one has accepted responsibility.</p>

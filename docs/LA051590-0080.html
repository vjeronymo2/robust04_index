			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MODEL CITIZEN SEIZED AS ONE OF 10 MOST WANTED IN MARYLAND  </P> <P> A convicted rapist and bank robber who was one of Maryland's 10 most-wanted  fugitives apparently lived as a "mild-mannered, polite" model citizen in  Southern California for nearly 10 years -- even helping set up a neighborhood  crime watch -- until his capture Monday, police said.  </P> <P> Moses Herman Fisher, 45, using the alias Michael E. Johnson, worked as an  appliance salesman and had no criminal record in California, police said.  </P> <P> His wife of four years, who is seven months pregnant, was stunned when she  learned that her husband was a wanted man after police and FBI agents knocked  on the door of their Sun Valley apartment in the northeastern San Fernando  Valley at 6:30 a.m.  </P> <P> "She had no idea," Detective Eugene Edwards said. "She was quite surprised and  upset. So was he."  </P> <P> Fisher has been sought by Maryland authorities since October, 1980, when he  fled from the Brockbridge Correctional Facility in Jessup, Md., while on a work  detail, Edwards said. Fisher was placed on the the state's 10 most-wanted  fugitives list this year and described as possibly armed and dangerous, Edwards  said.  </P> <P> Fisher had been serving a life term plus 15 years for two rapes, a bank robbery  and three counts of attempted robbery with a deadly weapon, Edwards said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police found him after authorities in Maryland received an  anonymous tip on his whereabouts, Edwards said.  </P> <P> Fisher had lived at the apartment for two years and recently started work as a  salesman at a discount store in Sun Valley, police said.  </P> <P> Art Michener, manager of Discount Sales, said he hired "Johnson" earlier this  month and was shocked to learn Monday that his new employee was a fugitive.  "Surprise is not even close," to describing his reaction, Michener said.  </P> <P> "He was a mild-mannered, polite guy. He would do anything I asked him to do. I  thought I had found the ideal employee."  </P> <P> Police said Fisher previously worked for several years as an assembler for  Xerox in El Segundo and may have lived in that area and possibly San Diego,  where a driver's license under the name Michael E. Johnson was first issued in  1981. A Xerox spokesman, however, said "Johnson" worked there for only two  months last year.  </P> <P> Wesley Gibson, Fisher's next-door neighbor, took him to Discount Sales to apply  for a job after he was laid off from Xerox.  </P> <P> "It's very shocking. I can't believe he is who they say he is. People change  and I don't see Mike as being what they say he is. If it is true, it's a  Jekyll-and-Hyde personality.  </P> <P> "As far as I know, he is an outstanding citizen. We were setting up a community  watch program at our complex. Everybody knew that if they had a problem they  could come to him to get it fixed."  </P> <P> He said Fisher put up signs in the complex encouraging residents to join the  crime-watch group. "He has been a very good tenant," said Jaga Ostapowicz,  manager of the apartment complex where Fisher lived. "This is shocking. I said,  'No, no, no, this can't be,' when I heard."  </P> <P> Fisher was being held without bail in the Parker Center jail.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Stepanakert ("LRAGIR", "AZG" dailies), 03/30/94--The  Azeri units shelled, using different weaponry, particularly  Howitzers, mortars and armored infantry carriers, the Armenian  positions in the Askeranskiy district and at the villages of  Salakhli-Kengerli, Papravend, Shakbulakh and Novruzlu in the  Agdamskiy district. The shelling started in the night of March  29 and repeated at 8-11am in the morning. The Karabakh units  retaliated in all cases, forcing the enemy to stop shelling.    A representative of the RMK [Republic of Mountainous  Karabakh] Defense Army Political Department Rudolf Martirosyan  rejected the information spread by the Azeri media on  mercenaries from Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and the PKK [Kurdish  Workers Party] groups who are ostensibly fighting at the  Armenian side. According to the Political Department, such  misinformation is spread in order to justify the participation  of Afghan mojahedins, Russian and Ukrainian mercenaries fighting  in the Azeri army.</p>

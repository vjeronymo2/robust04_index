			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'THIS BAN'S FOR YOU' BRINGS CHEERS, JEERS AT BEACH  </P> <P> Kurt Burris was standing on the sand at Ocean Beach, holding a beer in his  hand. When he heard that drinking on the beach might be illegal as early as  next month, he grimaced. He said, "You're kidding."  </P> <P> "This ban's for you" is one piece of legislation Burris can do without. But  it's true: The San Diego City Council will soon be voting on a total ban on  alcohol at city parks and beaches.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't like it at all -- in fact, I would hate it," said Burris, 30, who  lives in Pacific Beach. "They passed a law saying you can't drink beer on the  beach after 10 (p.m.), and that didn't stop anybody. This won't either. When  will they learn? This won't stop people from drinking. If that's the goal, they  better try another route."  </P> <P> J. J. Cihouski, who, with his wife, Nora, lives in a stately home on Sunset  Cliffs Boulevard in Ocean Beach, favors the ban -- unequivocally, passionately  -- but agrees with Burris that it probably won't make a difference.  </P> <P> "People are going to drink no matter what," Cihouski said, "and, they're going  to make noise and cause problems. Still, I think it's a good idea, and I'm very  much in favor of it."  </P> <P> Cihouski's viewpoint was echoed by other beachfront homeowners interviewed  Thursday in Ocean Beach, whereas Burris' views summed up the feelings of most  beach-goers. One liquor store owner dependent on the business of beach lovers  was adamantly opposed.  </P> <P> Just about everyone interviewed had heard about the vote taken by a City  Council committee, which recommended -- unanimously -- that alcohol be banned  year-round at all city beaches and parks.  </P> <P> The vote, by the five members of the Public Facilities and Recreation  Committee, suggests that there is enough council support for passage when the  issue comes before the nine-member council, probably next month.  </P> <P> The ban is aimed at complaints of public drunkenness, crime and noise that have  come from representatives of beach communities in recent years. As a beachfront  homeowner, Nora Cihouski is one of those who feels the ban should have come  sooner.  </P> <P> "I remember this one evening, I guess it was 7 o'clock, when we heard this man  screaming at the top of his lungs," she said. "He was threatening to jump off  the cliff, and he was falling-down drunk. We have trouble with rowdyism and  crowds on occasion, especially in the summer. I don't think a ban will solve  the problem, but it has to help."  </P> <P> Reaction to the proposed ban was swift at most City Council offices Thursday  afternoon. A spokeswoman for Councilman Ron Roberts, whose district includes  Ocean Beach, said Roberts' office received 17 calls Thursday from people  inquiring about the ban (some for it, others opposed). A spokeswoman for  Councilman Bruce Henderson, whose district includes Mission Beach and Pacific  Beach, said Henderson's office received about 12 calls.  </P> <P> Jeffrey Smith, 38, a massage therapist who lives in Mission Hills, comes to the  beach three to four times a week to play volleyball. Like many of those  interviewed Thursday, he sees the sins of a few as having "ruined a good thing"  for many.  </P> <P> "I really hate to see it happen here in Ocean Beach," Smith said, "because OB  has done a lot to clean itself up. The area has really improved. I think the  majority of people who come here, volleyball players and surfers especially,  are responsible.  </P> <P> "If they do ban it, here's what will happen -- 20% of the people will stop  drinking at the beach, and the other 80% will figure out a way to sneak it in."  </P> <P> Duff Patterson, 33, who lives in Point Loma, said the ban on booze at the beach  is further evidence that San Diego is now very much a big city. He, for one,  reacts to that with sadness.  </P> <P> "I lived in L.A. for four years, and, as you know, they have it banned on the  beaches up there," Patterson said. "The area between the border and Solana  Beach has been about the only part of Southern California where you could drink  on the beach."  </P> <P> Patterson remembers nights as a kid going to Point Loma High School when he and  his buddies could gather around a bonfire at Ocean Beach and "stay up all  night, drinkin' and talkin.' We didn't bother anybody, and they didn't bother  us."  </P> <P> "What happened is a lot of East County gang types started showing up at the  beaches, ruining it for everybody. Legislation won't stop it, but they've tried  everything else, so now, they've got to try that. I think the ban was  inevitable; it's just sad it had to happen."  </P> <P> Paul Fejfar, 22, a Navy man from South Dakota, and Nebraskan Paula Heine, 20,  both of El Cajon, said one of their happiest memories is the first time they  ever saw a California beach at sunset, an event they celebrated at Ocean Beach  with a glass of champagne.  </P> <P> Claude Sims, 31, a corrections officer from Spring Valley, was at the beach  Thursday afternoon with his 4-year-old son. He's all for the ban.  </P> <P> "A lot of people would be against it until something happened to one of their  kids, and then, they'll be for it too," Sims said.  </P> <P> A lifeguard, who asked not to be quoted by name, said he is for it --  enthusiastically so.  </P> <P> "Eighty percent of the rescues out here are alcohol-related," he said. "Last  summer, a drunk Navy guy was out here surfing. He almost drowned, only because  he was so damn drunk. It's getting worse and worse each year.  </P> <P> "I also don't think it's going to be hard to enforce. We give out $65 tickets  for people drinking from bottles, or drinking after 10 p.m., and that's seemed  to work. I can't wait to start cracking down on the ban."  </P> <P> Patrokolas Demaggio, who owns Pat's Liquor Store, just a beer-can's throw from  the water at Ocean Beach, said he bitterly resents the ban because it may  destroy his business.  </P> <P> "The Navy guys buy heavy and then take it down the beach," said Demaggio,  puffing a thick cigar. "It won't close me down, at least not right away, but it  will hurt. I'm dependent on business from people who drink at the beach. But  then, nobody listens to me anyway."  </P></p>

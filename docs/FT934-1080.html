			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: Dasa unit in cross-equity link with Pratt &amp; Whitney Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the aerospace arm of Germany's Daimler-Benz car group, is reinforcing its partnership in the aircraft engine business through a cross-equity investment between its MTU engine subsidiary and Pratt &amp; Whitney, the US aero-engine maker owned by United Technologies. 'The deal is done although there are still some legal issues to be ironed out,' said Mr Jurgen Schrempp, Dasa's chairman. The equity swap was first mooted three years ago but little progress had been made. Pratt &amp; Whitney will take a 24.9 per cent stake in MTU and the German company will acquire an interest equivalent in value in the US engine maker. Mr Schrempp said MTU's precise stake in Pratt &amp; Whitney would depend on the valuation of the companies, which had not yet been completed. 'Pratt is our privileged partner and our joint interests could develop further. The equity exchange will be a first stage in our alliance,' he added, implying the cross-holdings could eventually increase. Dasa has negotiated a series of international alliances since taking over the leadership and restructuring of the German aerospace industry four years ago. After taking control of the Dutch Fokker aircraft maker this year and merging its helicopter activities with those of Aerospatiale of France, Mr Schrempp said negotiations to form a partnership in the guided weapons business with Aerospatiale were advanced. 'We are also moving closer with the French to merge our two satellite businesses,' he added. Dasa is also restructuring: Mr Schrempp confirmed the company would shed 16,000 jobs by 1996. Some 5,700 jobs have already been cut this year. Dasa is also closing six factories, including two commercial aircraft and four defence facilities, and plans to sell an additional three plants. The restructuring will produce annual cost savings of DM2bn (Dollars 1.2bn) by 1996, including DM1.5bn from the job cuts and a further DM500m from other efficiencies. This restructuring programme aims to return the company to profit in 1995. After losing DM341m last year, Mr Schrempp said the company was expected to show another 'heavy loss' this year. But he said without restructuring costs, the company would be in profit this year. Fokker was also expected to show operating losses of about Fl 150m (Dollars 78.5m) before restructuring costs this year. However, Dasa's activities in the European Airbus programme of which it owns 37.9 per cent, would report 'quite acceptable profits' this year and next.</p>

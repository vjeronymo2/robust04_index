			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow, April 21 (TASS) -- "It is time to decide  what result the international community wants to see in Yugoslav  settlement," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Demurin  said.    Russia favours a "common and single position of the world  community" on this problem, Demurin said. He believes such  position should include "clear benchmarks and determination for  ensuring the implementation of the adopted decisions," as well  as "reflect the will of the international community to meet the  rightful interests of all sides involved in the settlement which  are moving along the path of peace."    He stressed that "there should be no doubts about the  ultimate goal." in his view, it is important for Russia, the  United States, the European Union, the United Nations and all  other concerned countries to have a "common and clear-cut  position." "Seeing the prospects for political settlement and  having a clear vision of what the post-war future of the  countries that emerged on the territory of the former Yugoslavia  should be, one can make decisions on intermediate steps,"  Demurin said.    He warned, however, that such steps, if taken without clear  understanding of the consequences, may be harmful for the  settlement process in the former Yugoslavia.    Demurin described as "allegations" statements by today's  newspaper IZVESTIYA that the Russian Foreign Ministry's position  on the Bosnian crisis has allegedly not been supported by  President Boris Yeltsin and is now being reworked.    He stressed that "these allegations are far from the foreign  policy and the essence of Russia's foreign policy initiatives."  He noted that there are "no disagreements, let alone  contradictions" between the president and the Foreign Ministry.</p>

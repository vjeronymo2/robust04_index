			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW LONG CAN WE LIVE?;  </P> <P> WE MAY BE ABLE TO PUSH OUR LIFE SPANS PAST OUR 80S, BUT WOULD WE WANT TO,  UNLESS WE COULD ALSO GUARANTEE THE QUALITY OF THOSE YEARS?;  </P> <P> THE PUSH FOR LONGEVITY CREATES COMPLICATIONS. CHRONIC, NONFATAL ILLNESSES CAN  MAKE GROWING OLD MORE OF A CURSE THAN A BLESSING, EXPERTS SAY.  </P> <P> While science strives to achieve the glamorous goal of increasing our life  span, most researchers studying aging are concerned with a more practical  problem.  </P> <P> Do we really want to live longer?  </P> <P> According to a group of researchers who study the consequences of being old,  living longer might be of little value unless the extra years are healthy and  active.  </P> <P> Despite recent gains in life expectancy caused by lower death rates from heart  problems and other major fatal diseases, many of the nation's elderly are  troubled by generally nonfatal ailments and disabilities during their final  years, gerontologists say. These conditions include Alzheimer's disease,  blindness, deafness, arthritis, osteoporosis, diabetes, hypertension,  incontinence and physical frailty.  </P> <P> "These are the things that, for the most part, don't kill us. But they make  life difficult in old age," says medical demographer S. Jay Olshansky of the  Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. "If you ask people what stops them  from enjoying life in old age, many are going to say those diseases."  </P> <P> Olshansky is co-author of a recent study published in Science magazine that  asks if efforts to expand life should continue without equal emphasis on making  the last years quality years.  </P> <P> Scientists have made astounding gains in the past decade in understanding the  process of aging, giving rise to hopes that they might someday postpone its  effects through genetic engineering.  </P> <P> Another arm of longevity research concerns eradicating the major killers --  such as cancer and heart disease -- to reduce death rates and prolong life.  Advances in heart disease treatment have already led to gains in life  expectancy over the past two decades, experts say.  </P> <P> But, Olshansky says: "What I worry about is if we are successful in identifying  what causes us to age, if we find an anti-aging drug or find a way to  manipulate genes, then we are faced with the social problem of whether we  really want to do that.  </P> <P> "If we can extend life expectancy by 10 years or 20 years, we need to be  assured that the additional years of life are healthy years. If we are adding  30 years of crippling disease, then I don't think we should do it."  </P> <P> The question is not merely philosophical. Policy-makers are increasingly  interested in understanding the future impact on health care and Social  Security as the baby-boom population turns the corner on middle age.  </P> <P> Experts estimate that the portion of the population age 65 and older will  increase from 12% today to 22.9% in 2050. The number of Americans age 85 and  older will increase from 3 million today to 16 million by the middle of the  21st Century.  </P> <P> Congress has allocated $323 million to the National Institute on Aging in  Washington for fiscal year 1991 for new research and programs on aging, up  nearly 30% from 1990 -- the largest percentage increase in funding this year  among the federal health institutes.  </P> <P> "There hasn't been that much funding for quality-of-life research in the last  20 years. But that's beginning to happen now," says Dr. Edward L. Schneider,  dean of USC's Andrus Gerontology Center. "The Medicaid bills, the health care  bills, are going to drive us up the wall. So maybe we should start investing  now in the quality of life."  </P> <P> Shifting the emphasis in research from simply lengthening life to increasing  years of health is the goal of a growing number of researchers. One reason,  some say, is that we may be close to reaching the cap on how far we can push  our life span.  </P> <P> In last month's Science article, Olshansky and co-authors Bruce A. Carnes and  Christine Cassel use statistics to show that even if the major fatal diseases  were eliminated, life expectancy would not increase by much.  </P> <P> For instance, eliminating all forms of cancer, which cause about one-fifth of  all deaths in the United States, would increase life expectancy at birth by  only 3.17 years for females and 3.2 years for males.  </P> <P> Currently, U.S. females born in 1989 can expect to live until age 78.6, while  males can expect to reach age 71.8.  </P> <P> "I think if our goal is (only) to increase life expectancy, then I don't think  we're going to be very successful," Olshanksy says. "Even if we go after major  diseases, we'll only make incremental gains."  </P> <P> Moreover, he asks, even if cancer and heart disease were eliminated, would the  elderly enjoy life if encumbered by weakened bones and muscles, dementia and  hearing loss?  </P> <P> "The question is what are we replacing (death) with?" he says. "It is possible,  as cancer and heart disease deaths decline, as we make this progress, that we  may be about to trade longer life for worsening health."  </P> <P> Already, medicine's successful efforts to reduce deaths from heart disease and  some types of cancer have raised questions about how to live with chronic  illness, Olshansky says.  </P> <P> "Forty years ago, if you have a heart attack or stroke you wouldn't live very  long," he says. "But science is rampantly transforming those diseases into  chronic problems."  </P> <P> Virtually no researchers advocate halting research on extending life span,  either at the gene-tinkering level or among those working to cure the major  fatal diseases. But with limited funds available for the study of aging,  setting priorities for research becomes a sticky issue.  </P> <P> "I don't think money should be taken away from cancer and heart disease,"  Olshansky says. "Those are major contributors to morbidity and mortality. But  we think it is now time to give equal attention to the other nonfatal  diseases."  </P> <P> In a 13-year study of elderly people completed in 1981, USC gerontologist  Eileen M. Crimmins found that her subjects reported a wide range of  disabilities marring their later years.  </P> <P> "Our conclusion has been that the increase in life expectancy has been in what  we call 'disabled years of life,' " she says. "The person says they have some  kind of medical condition that prevents them from leading their normal life.  But these appear to be conditions that might not be too serious. . . . For the  most part, it's mild disability."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, because these conditions can hamper one's ability to enjoy life,  researchers are seeking ways to eliminate them. Crimmins is optimistic that  this is possible, as the emphasis in health care moves from treating diseases  to preventing them.  </P> <P> Studies have shown that a good diet, stress reduction, aerobic and  weight-bearing exercise and companionship can help the elderly stave off  chronic ailments and remain active and happy.  </P> <P> "I think that's where much more research is being concentrated: delaying the  onset of disease," Crimmins says. "We've just arrived at the idea that elderly  people can be rehabilitated" after injury or surgery.  </P> <P> But in setting priorities for research on aging, society should not attempt to  determine just what kind of life is worth extending, says Richard Suzman, a  scientist at the National Institute on Aging.  </P> <P> "I think it's important to realize that, while we all have a sense of what  quality of life means, ultimately it's a very subjective measure that differs  across groups and individuals," he says.  </P> <P> Before deciding to fund expensive scientific research, he adds, federal health  officials must weigh the potential benefits of the research against the costs.  But, Suzman says that it would be wrong to stop pursuing longer life expectancy  based on the belief that those extra years would not be worth living because of  pain, disability or dementia.  </P> <P> "I think that one could make a bad mistake if we adopted some federal  (standard) that defines quality of life."  </P></p>

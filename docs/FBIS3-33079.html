			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] This humble shack became the home of former Chiapas  governor General Absalon Castellanos, whom the Zapatist  guerrillas kidnapped at the start of the conflict. Just a few  hours before his release, Univision was able to obtain this  exclusive interview somewhere in the jungle.    [Begin Castellanos recording] They told me to accompany  them,  and I went with them. By then they had blindfolded me and tied  my hands. I remained that way in different places. I cannot  tell exactly where, I couldn't tell until I got here. He [not  further identified] held me responsible for these things, in  addition to the death of leader Angulo [not further identified]  when I served as governor. I could not answer those accusation.  He said I knew.... [end recording]    Looking aged and with a humble voice softened by his days in  captivity, the former governor now says he understands why  violence broke out in Chiapas.    [Begin Castellanos recording] I do agree that social  injustice really exists. Obviously they are greatly removed  from civilization and there was this outburst. The outburst  could have taken another form since the government has been  willing to resolve all these problems. I hope the problem is  resolved soon and that we think of ourselves as brothers,  Chiapas residents, all of whom bear responsibility for this  situation. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Glaxo faces further challenge to Zantac The challenge to the world's best-selling drug, ulcer treatment Zantac, made by the UK company Glaxo, intensified yesterday when a second company said it would launch a generic version of the drug at the end of next year. Canada's Novopharm has applied to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval to sell a version of Zantac, whose patent expires in December 1995. Glaxo said it may file a patent infringements suit against Novopharm. At stake are the Dollars 2bn a year revenues that Zantac makes in the US alone. Total Zantac sales are Dollars 3.5bn a year. The active ingredient, ranitidine, exists in two versions. The older Form 1 is patent protected until December 5 1995 in the US but is unstable, says Glaxo. Zantac is made of Form 2 under patent protection until 2002. In April Glaxo filed a lawsuit against Geneva, a US subsidiary of Swiss drug company Ciba, which like Novopharm plans to market Form 1. It alleged infringement of Form 2 patents in both the manufacturing and the final product. Mr Leslie Dan, president of Novopharm, said that there were several ways of making ranitidine. Novopharm's was different from that used by Glaxo and 'we checked out that there was no production of Form 2', he said. Novopharm filed its application with the FDA on June 10. If Glaxo takes legal action within 45 days of that date, the launch of the drug can be delayed for 30 months. Mr Dan said Novopharm and Glaxo lawyers were in talks. He would not comment on whether Novopharm had devised or would manufacture the Form 1 version. Novopharm is still awaiting the outcome of court action surrounding Form 2's patent. One of the company's arguments was that Form 1 could not be made without producing Form 2, which therefore should not have separate patents. Glaxo filed suits in April against Union Quimico Farmaceutica, a Spanish subsidiary of Holliday Chemical Holdings, a UK distributor.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Money Markets: Speculation on UK MONEY MARKET dealers went home for the Bank Holiday weekend on Thursday mulling over the possibility of a another cut in UK base rates when they return next week, writes James Blitz. In recent weeks, the UK Treasury and The Bank of England have issued very strong indications that monetary policy is on hold for the time being. But some dealers see another burst of speculation about a cut blossoming after the Easter break. One factor in favour of another cut is sterling's stronger performance on the foreign exchanges. At the close of trading yesterday, the pound was back above the 80 per cent level on the Bank of England's exchange rate index for only the third time since January 25. The index, which measures sterling's performance as a percentage of its 1985 value against a basket of currencies, is the UK chancellor's favourite way of judging the currency's strength. Dealers are also wondering whether next week's UK economic indicators will help to construct a case for another easing. The retail price inflation figures, due out on Friday, are expected to be on the low side. The industrial production and manufacturing output figures due out on Wednesday should be positive - but not so strong that they give the government much source of comfort. All these factors may explain the slightly more bullish tone in sterling futures markets yesterday. The June short sterling contract was up 5 basis points at one stage, touching 94.28, before closing at 94.26. Cash rates also remained very soft, with 3 month sterling deposit rates closing unchanged at around 5 7/8 per cent. One factor easing sterling rates was the ease with which a Pounds 2.05bn shortage forecast by the Bank was reduced. The overnight rate was as low as 1.5 per cent at one stage. The bullishness for sterling rates may have been underlined by the lack of any gloom following the Bank of France's decision not to ease policy. Contrary to the market's view, France left its intervention and 5-10 day rates unchanged. This caused a set-back for futures, with the June contract falling 8 basis points to 91.75 immediately after the news, and closing at 91.76. But 3-month French cash remained very low at 9 1/8 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Turin, Italy, March 8 (AFP) - The bosses of a major  drugs ring escaped arrest after a record seizure of 5.5 tonnes  of cocaine aboard a truck here, with only intermediaries  arrested, police officials admitted Tuesday [8 March].    The cocaine, smuggled in on a boat from Colombia in a banana  cargo, was seized overnight Saturday. Police announced its  seizure on Monday.    The drugs, with a street value of about 300 million dollars,  were seized when a truck taking the cargo from the port of Genoa  to a warehouse in a village near here was stopped on a road in  northern Italy, police said.    In order to divert attention, the drugs traffickers had left  the cargo in the warehouse for two months from its arrival  before moving it, police said.    When the cargo was moved, the driver was joined in the cab  by  his three year old daughter and pet dog in order to allay the  police's suspicions, officials said.    The seizure, a record amount in Europe, followed months of  joint investigation by police in Milan and Genoa, Turin police  said.    Twelve people were arrested during the operation, including  several suspected Mafia members. Only two of the suspects were  identified--Adrea Lia, 22, and Maurizio Lo Russo, 28, who had  rented the warehouse where the cocaine was to have been  delivered.    The drug was probably destined for sale outside Italy, in  several other European countries. Inquiries are continuing in  Switzerland, Germany and Lichtenstein.    Police said that the recent increases in frontier controls  in  areas bordering on the former Yugoslavia had pushed the drugs  traffickers to use the Turin region as the major conduit for the  drugs trade out of Italy.    "If the traffickers chose Turin as the base for the passage  of such a quantity of the drug, that means that the mafia has  the capacity in place to manage such a volume," a police source  said.    It shows their heavy implantation into northern Italy, he  added.</p>

General Idriss  Nagri, the Army Chief of Staff, has been appointed Defense  Minister. The 38-member cabinet does not include any  representatives from the radical opposition, in spite of  repeated appeals by President Bongo for a government open to  other parties. Most of the ministers from the previous  government remain in the cabinet. Jean Ping moves from the  Mines Ministry to foreign affairs. He is replaced by Paul  Toungoui, former Finance Minister.</p>

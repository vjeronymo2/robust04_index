			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: Why it simply has to be . . . a real little gem - What really matters when you buy a keepsake? ANITA LOOS, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Liz Taylor and that vast sisterhood of upfront Hollywood ladies had no doubts about the matter - when it comes to jewels what really matters is quite simple; are they real and are they big? These sentiments may seem a little bold for Britain, in or out of recession, but there is no getting away from it that when it comes to rites of passage in a woman's life - her 21st, her engagement, wedding, first child and ensuing anniversaries - nothing but real will do. Some fake pearls? A bangle from a boutique down the road? A witty ring? Well-designed they may be, fun too - but appropriate? No, never. So, although costume jewellery sales may go on booming, and may have a place in the daily lives of most of us, any man wishing to celebrate a big day in the life of his nearest and dearest would be wise to remember to make it real. This is true no matter how far down the financial scale you look. When it comes to engagement rings, for instance, what every bride longs for, the jewellers tell us, is a ring with a real stone. Times may be hard, wallets thinner but no self-respecting first-time bride will want to waft up the aisle with anything less sparkling on her finger. Some 74 per cent of all first-time brides, we learn, go for diamonds at an average cost of Pounds 270 a time and, perhaps most surprising of all, in these modern, unisex days it is not all one way - 90 per cent of all grooms want a wedding ring and one in five of those will choose one with diamonds. No matter how hard the times, the need for these 'necessities' as they are known in the jewellery trade, goes on for ever. But while 'necessities' may be their bread and butter, any jeweller who hopes to survive into the 1990s knows well enough that changing times require changing attitudes. As the number of coronations, grand balls and royal marriages dwindles, so more new-money and growing professional classes have emerged to keep the accountants happy. All these changes are faithfully reflected in the wares the big jewellers offer. Matching sets of tiaras, necklaces and ear-rings ablaze with precious stones are thinner on the ground. Gold bracelets and chic little brooches that could sit happily on a working suit, cuff-links for a smart French cuff, are brought well to the foreground. Rosamund Monckton, managing director of Tiffany, 25 Old Bond Street, London, W1, saw the way the wind was blowing: 'I personally go through the sales slips every day to see what is moving.' She made sure that she was plentifully supplied with affordable middle-range jewellery. (Affordable, of course, is a moveable feast, but we are talking Bond Street here and affordable could be anything from Pounds 400 to Pounds 10,000). Tiffany, of course, has always had the work of people like Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso, known more for the panache and impact of their designs than the high price-tags of the materials. This may not be the stuff that brings the Maharajas or the Saudi Princesses running but, more to the point in these egalitarian days, it is just the thing that many a successful professional woman might buy to celebrate a promotion and that a salaried professional man could afford to treat his wife to. But, even at jewellers known more specifically for their haut joaillerie, such as Boucheron, 180 New Bond Street, London, W1,the view is that all this talk of gloom and doom has been overdone. Certainly 1991 was not a good year but, as Daniel Reveyron of Boucheron says: 'If you take a long-term view much more business is being done today than 15 years ago. 1991 may have been down when compared with 1990 and more particularly with the late 1980s but compared with 1975 it is still incomparably up. 'Society these days is infinitely richer, far more people can afford a pair of diamond earrings or a good gold bangle than 20 years ago. Go to the first room in the British Museum and what do you find? - weapons and jewellery. Adornment of the person is an ancient tradition. The desire for jewellery is old and deep and it will take more than a recession for people to stop buying.' The key, though, for Boucheron too, has been to provide plenty of choice in the 'affordable' range. For instance, Boucheron's puzzle jewellery - for women rings and bracelets start at Pounds 620 for a ring, Pounds 1,800 for a bracelet, and for chaps, cufflinks start at Pounds 425 a pair - has been a steady seller all through the dark days. Women choose gifts formen when Christmas or a birthday comes up, men buy them all the year round. They are, you might say, a piece of affordable fun. You can add to them as the years go by and change the look, with the variety of optional inserts, from day to day. At Asprey, too, the word is that everything that is small and reasonable, whether it be a little pearly delight or a small diamond number is still selling well - provided it is somewhere in the magic band of Pounds 1,000-Pounds 4,000. They look back with wonder at the heady days of the late 1980s when several times a year they could sell Pounds 500,000 'suites', when men would buy each other hugely expensive watches to celebrate a deal, when everybody was high on profits and bonuses and price seemed no barrier. These days they make sure that there are gold earrings, cuff-links or silver bracelets at no more than Pounds 500 a time and these seem to keep the tills ringing and the volumes up. And as for watches - the days when a watch was purely functional are long gone. When a woman needs a pick-me-up, or what a friend calls some 'retail therapy' she may buy herself a lipstick or a designer jacket. When a chap needs to cheer himself up or a reward for a job well done, a watch is what he goes for. And not just any old watch - expensive, designer-labelled, big-status stuff. Just as no woman ever had too many designer jackets, so it seems, the man about town cannot have too many watches. Hennell, of Bond Street, London W1, reports that the value of every sale is down but by dint of producing a new collection of 'affordable' jewellery - in its case this means the Westminster and Fleur de Lys ring collection and some 18 carat gold jewellery at around a Pounds 3,000 a time - volume is still holding up well. But, needless to say, the desire for a little decorative quelque chose is not confined exclusively to the rich. When a few years ago the Daily Mirror asked its readers what they most wanted to find in their stockings on Christmas morning, it found that most women hoped for a pair of diamond ear-studs. Some of the middle-market chains, such as Beaverbrooks with its 27 stores specialising in gold jewellery in the north of England and Scotland, report that overall there was no falling off of sales at all - 1991 figures were up on 1990 which in turn was up on 1989. Sales of 18 carat gold moved ahead of those in 9 carat - no-one wants to throw away money on things with little intrinsic value. Better a smaller piece in 18 carat gold than a larger one in 9-carat seems to be the message. So when it comes to cheering themselves up she likes nothing better than a bauble and he could be nicely consoled with a dashing pair of cuff-links or a big-name watch. Times are nothing like as hard as they have been made out to be.</p>

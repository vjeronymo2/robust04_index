			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: Japan set to ease rules for yen bond offerings Japan's ministry of finance is considering abolishing its restriction on yen-denominated bonds issued overseas by foreign companies. To protect the country's corporate bond market, the ministry has tried to keep euroyen bonds offshore by prohibiting yen bonds issued overseas from entering the country for the first 90 days of issuance. The ministry's move would follow the easing earlier this year, amid calls for financial deregulation, of the 'lock-up' period for bonds issued by sovereign borrowers. This prompted a total Y5,500bn in sovereign debt to be issued this year, 2.5 times the previous year's figure. The ministry said the move could come in April, but expected restrictions on euroyen debt issued by domestic borrowers to remain for the time being. The move will provide investment opportunities for Japan's institutional investors which want exposure in overseas companies but are loath to take foreign currency risk.</p>

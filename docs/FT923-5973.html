			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Guardian Royal The most intriguing passage in yesterday's interim statement from GRE underlines the vulnerability of life company bonus rates. It is easy for the market to take cheap shots at GRE's investment record. The reality is, though, that its place at the bottom of most performance tables can in part be explained by a more prudent actuarial approach. Declining investment returns and pressure for more generous surrender values suggest that competitors cannot possibly sustain the level of policyholder rewards they achieved in the 1980s. Precious few of them have fully acknowledged that the days of easy returns seem to be over. GRE still has some sorting out to do on the life side - but the message of a much reduced first-half loss is that at last the company is getting to grips with general insurance. The mild UK winter has helped and Germany remains a blot. On the other hand, there is ample evidence in the UK private motor and household accounts of a willingness to sacrifice market share in the quest for renewed profitability. The delayed impact of UK rate rises means the rebound could be quite sharp next year. In the short term that prospect and the absence of serious mortgage guarantee exposure underpins the shares, which have outperformed the market and other composites this year by 17 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. Longer term, though, GRE has to prove that once the process of loss elimination is complete, its UK operation is a quality business.</p>

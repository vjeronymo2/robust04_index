			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / 'The Big Hustle' goes for gold in the 1996 Olympics: Atlanta is confident it is equal to the daunting task of staging the games THE extravaganza of the summer Olympics usually takes place in well-known cities, such as Barcelona, Seoul, Los Angeles, and Moscow, to name the last four. But in 1996 Atlanta, the ninth largest US city, will host the games and it sees the event as its ticket to international recognition. Atlantans intend the games to bring not only world fame, but foreign investment and a physical transformation of the city. If these seem ambitious goals, take into account that the best-known characteristic of this city, sometimes derogatorily called 'The Big Hustle', is self-promotion. But after lengthy self-congratulation following its award of the games in 1990, Atlanta now seems awestruck by the scope of what it must accomplish to mount the 16-day spectacle. Nonetheless, Mr Billy Payne, the irrepressibly exuberant Atlanta lawyer and native son who heads the private organising committee called the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (Acog), is brimming with confidence. Atlanta will stage the games, he says, 'better than anyone ever has.' With respect to his committee's budget needs of Dollars 1.5bn, Mr Payne's confidence seems well founded. The US television rights for the Atlanta games were sold on July 27 to NBC for a record Dollars 456m. The final bid by the network came in unexpectedly high given that it recorded a loss of Dollars 100m on the Barcelona Olympics, for which it had paid Dollars 401m. But with projections that this will be the largest audience in history for any Olympics, NBC officials appear confident that they can make a profit. Although Mr Payne had once predicted he could get Dollars 600m in TV rights, he said he was pleased with the agreement. Of the Dollars 456m fee, 60 per cent, or Dollars 274m, will go to Acog, with the remainder to the International Olympic Committee. Atlanta, the American South's business capital, is only the second city in history - after Los Angeles in 1984 - to raise funds for the games entirely from the private sector. After television rights, the next biggest contributor to Acog's budget is corporate sponsorships. Unlike Los Angeles, which sold some 35 at about Dollars 4m each, Acog wants 10-12 sponsors at Dollars 40m a piece. Surprisingly, in an economic climate that can hardly be called robust, five companies have already signed on for the full Dollars 40m, namely Nationsbank, Home Depot, Sara Lee, IBM, and Anheuser-Busch. John Hancock Financial Services has also signed on to promote its life insurance, but two other insurers are expected to fill the insurance category for a total of more than Dollars 40m, according to Mr Payne. He says several companies will share the telecommunications category and also bring in more than the normal sponsor fee. He claims negotiations with sponsors for cars and quick service restaurants are in the final details. Chrysler and McDonald's have been past sponsors of the US Olympic Committee, which has combined efforts with Acog for 1996 and will take 30 per cent of the sponsor fees. Yet, while ACOG's financial picture 'looks extraordinarily favourable,' according to Mr Payne, the bigger picture for Atlanta is not so rosy. There are worries that Atlanta will not measure up to world standards on amenities. Although it does not have to build infrastructure, its downtown has little life for pedestrians and virtually closes after business hours. Visitors may also shudder at the poverty of the dilapidated neighbourhoods where the main Olympic venues will be located. A Dollars 500m facelift is planned that includes walkways and parks. This is down from an original wish list of Dollars 2.5bn, but beyond a request to the state for Dollars 200m, and it is unclear where the rest of the money will come from. The city has pledged not to put itself in debt for the Olympics. City improvements are the financial responsibility of local government. But Acog, which is handling Olympic venues, has been caught up in conflicts about the impact on the predominantly black neighbourhoods where its venues will be. Acog's construction of a Dollars 209m Olympic stadium, which will be the city's centrepiece for 1996, is, for example, opposed by residents who contend it will not deliver the promised economic development. Meanwhile, true to the city's reputation for being pushy, the business community has latched on to the Olympics as a chance to win new investment. By the end of this month, the Chamber of Commerce will launch a three-year worldwide TV advertising campaign on CNN International to promote the city.</p>

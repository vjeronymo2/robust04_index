			<p>Separation   Film Technology   <F P=102> 94FE0273B Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO in Japanese 29 Nov 93 p 1 </F> <F P=103> 94FE0273B </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] The Japan High Polymer Center is beginning a  program in the development and application of high functionality  separation film technology for uses such as petroleum  purification. In the past there has been a concern with finding  methods of reducing the harm to the environment while saving  energy if a separation film process were to be used to purify  petroleum. Both the technological and financial aspects of the  problem have been discussed. As the result of about one year of  research, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI) reports that such applications are in fact possible, and  is therefore establishing the Advanced Materials Laboratory at  the High Polymer Center. MITI is also embarking on this research  and development in cooperation with the film manufacturers Tore  and Nitto Electric, as well as with petroleum purification  companies, the engineering industry, and universities.    The separation of liquids and gases with polymer films has  made great technological strides in recent years and is used for  a wide range of applications. However, distillation is still the  basic step in the petroleum purification process. The use of  separation films has merit, but MITI says that new technological  advances are required because "these liquids have high  viscosity." In fact, there are as yet no examples of successful  application anywhere in the world.    MITI's Center for Promoting the Petroleum Industry has been  investigating the suitability of separation films for pertroleum  purification. Their conclusion is that the technology is  difficult but application is possible if the necessary advances  can be made in polymer technology. MITI also said that it will  support increased technical cooperation with oil-producing  nations such as Saudi Arabia.    The focus of this research and development will be the High  Polymer Center. Technical investigations will be carried out by  the Joint International Separation Film Specialists Research  Committee, studying the state of experimental research.  Participants include scholars such as Professor Naoshi Kimura of  Tokyo University and Professor Teruhiko Oya of Yokohama National  University, the Materials Engineering Technology Laboratory,  Arabia Oil, Shukko Kosan, Chiyoda Kako Kensetsu, Tore, and Nitto  Electric. Research will be conducted at the Advanced Materials  Laboratory that is expected to be completed by February of next  year, with Tore and Nitto Electric in charge.    The 1993 budget calls for expenditures of about &yen;200  million (about $2 million), and MITI expects the project to last  10 years. Film materials are currently made from polyimides or  PPS, but materials of higher functionality will be sought. MITI  also says that research will attempt to find applications  through modularization and bench plants.</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Equities exposed That leaves the equity market exposed. German shares have been valued above their long-term trend for the last couple of years. Yet the impact of falling profits only started to affect the stock market towards the end of 1992. With more unpleasant earnings shocks likely, any delay in interest rate cuts could badly affect sentiment. This notion is reinforced by the fact that bond yields have already fallen sharply in the expectation of short-term rate reductions. So, even if the rate cuts come through, further rallies in the bond market may be limited and thus would offer little additional impetus to equities. France, however, offers a nice contrast. Inflation is subdued and industry is competitive, yet economic growth is being held back by the ERM-inspired high interest rates. Both equities and bonds would benefit from a loosening of monetary policy, and one way or another that is likely to happen in the course of the year. If the Bundesbank lowers rates in response to domestic German recession, then pressure within the ERM will ease and French rates can fall. But if the Bundesbank drags its heels, the mismatch between the monetary needs of different continental economies will revive ERM pressures and either break the ERM or force a significant rate cut. In either event France would get the lower interest rates justified by domestic conditions. And that might just make France the market to watch in 1993.</p>

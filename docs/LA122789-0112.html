			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> CLINIC FUNDS AGAIN SUSPENDED  </P> <P> The Second District Court of Appeal in Ventura today temporarily suspended an  injunction that restored $24 million in funding to about 500 family planning  clinics throughout California.  </P> <P> The injunction had ordered the state to restore full funding to family planning  clinics, ruling that Gov. George Deukmejian's two-thirds cut in the $36-million  program violated state welfare law by depriving health care to thousands of  poor women. The state appealed the ruling, requesting a stay, and the court  currently is reviewing the state's appeal.  </P></p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / New Irish cabinet to tackle punt crisis IRELAND'S new Fianna Fail-Labour coalition government, which formally took office last night, is likely to tackle the crisis facing the punt at its first cabinet meeting today. Interest rates in the Dublin inter-bank money market continued their roller-coaster ride yesterday, falling sharply as the central bank dropped its overnight lending rate from 100 to 30 per cent. It also offered limited amounts of one-month funds on tender to the clearing banks at 14 per cent in an effort to improve liquidity in the market and head off commercial interest rate rises. The punt traded above its ERM floor yesterday. However, the fall in money market interest rates appears unlikely to avert a threatened increase of 3 percentage points in mortgage rates later this week by the main Irish building societies. Mr Michael Torpey, treasurer at the Irish Permanent Building Society, said: 'We will need a substantial cut in wholesale money market rates if we are to hold off a rise in mortgage rates. We are now assessing the situation on a day-by-day basis.' In the inter-bank market, one-month rates fell from 60 to 40 per cent yesterday. Mr Mike Lennon, the head of treasury and funding at the EBS building society in Dublin, said the one-month rate would have to fall to between 15 and 20 per cent 'and have a prospect of remaining there', if the mortgage rate rise was to be avoided. A rise of 3 percentage points in mortgage rates to 17 per cent, while price inflation is projected to be less than 2 per cent this year, would be a blow to the new coalition in its first week in office, and could undermine its stated resolve to maintain the punt at its present parity within the ERM. Interest rate management has become the central bank's main weapon in defending the punt since exchange controls were lifted on January 1. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Fianna Fail party leader, was formally re-elected as prime minister by parliament yesterday, with the support of the Labour party's 33 deputies, thereby sealing the new coalition pact. Labour is to be allocated six of the 15 posts in the cabinet. Mr Dick Spring, the Labour party leader, will take charge at the Foreign Ministry. Mr Bertie Ahern, the outgoing finance minister, is widely expected to retain his portfolio.</p>

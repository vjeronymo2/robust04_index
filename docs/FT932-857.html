			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Tenth of pupils play truant ONE IN 10 pupils in England plays truant at least once a week in the GCSE exam year, a report commissioned by the Department for Education said yesterday. The survey found that nearly a third of pupils aged 14 to 16 had played truant at least once in the preceding half term. The main reason cited by truants was dislike of lessons, particularly physical education, games and French. Their main complaints about lessons were that they did not enjoy them, found them irrelevant or too hard, or disliked the teachers. Most truants  - 58 per cent  - wanted to stay on at school. A third found school enjoyable and a third actively disliked it. The report is based on questionnaires issued to more than 37,000 pupils in their GCSE and pre-GCSE year in 150 English local authority schools. The report says the situation was worse than results showed because many truants would have been absent from school when questionnaires were handed out.</p>

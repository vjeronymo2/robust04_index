			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 18 (XINHUA) -- China has set up a  phonographic association to protect intellectual property rights  and to promote the development of its phonographic industry.    The primary task of the newly-founded body, called "China  Phonographic Association" (CPA), is to protect phonographic  product copyrights, Liu Guowei, chairman of the association,  told XINHUA.    He said that in the protection of copyrights, it will firmly  adhere to both the relevant Chinese laws and international  conventions and fight against any activities of piracy and  infringement.    All copyrights, membership or non-membership, domestic or  overseas, should be protected by his association, he said.    He noted that piracy is a complicated problem. And most of  the master compact discs are coming from overseas, but China  hopes to make joint efforts with all foreign countries to crack  down on piracy, he said.    But, he pointed out, China will not keep silent at any  groundless attacks regarding the matter, referring to the  denunciation by the British FINANCIAL TIMES on June 2 saying,  "worldwide sales of pirate compact discs doubled to 75 million  units last year, almost exclusively as a result of unauthorized  production in China."    He said that the fact is overstated and distorted by the  British newspaper.    The chairman said that the latest statistics compiled by the  CPA show that although China has 30 compact disc production  lines, the total output has so far been no more than 20 million  yearly.    "We hope the British newspaper makes corrections of the  error  in a responsible way," he said.    The chairman concluded that his association is taking part  in  a nationwide campaign launched by the central government against  infringement and piracy.</p>

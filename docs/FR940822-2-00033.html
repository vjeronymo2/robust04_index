(Farmland) at a meter located on Texas Gas's Bastrop_Eunice pipeline system in Grant Parish, Louisiana (Wintershall_Farmland Meter). Such meter was installed and is being operated under the authority of Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act (Section 311) and Section 284.3(c) of the Commission's Regulations. Texas Gas states that Farmland has recently indicated a need for greater flexibility in the services that can be provided at this delivery point on Texas Gas's system. In particular, Farmland would like to be able to receive at the Wintershall_Farmland Meter gas transported not only pursuant to Section 311, but also pursuant to Texas Gas's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP88&hyph;686&hyph;000. By this filing, Texas Gas is requesting authorization to change the status of this delivery point in order to be able to transport and deliver gas on a jurisdictional basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas Gas states that the quantity of gas to be delivered through this meter will vary; however, the design capacity of the Wintershall_Farmland Meter is approximately 78,200 Mcf per day under normal operating conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> At least 20 people were injured in a clash between supporters of rival  political parties in the central Mexican city of Morelia, police said. A  spokesman said three of the 20 were seriously hurt in the clash between  followers of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and the opposition  center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution. The clash took place as an  electoral college began meeting to ratify the results of local elections held  July 2 in Michoacan state, of which Morelia is the capital. The opposition  disputes official results given so far, which indicate the ruling party won  with 12 of 18 electoral districts.  </P></p>

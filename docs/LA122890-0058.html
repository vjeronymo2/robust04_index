That confirmation took place Thursday. The Andonians and the  alleged mastermind of the scheme, Raul Vivas, 39, were also found guilty on 25  other counts of money laundering.  </P> <P> On Thursday, the judge instructed the jury, over objections of several defense  lawyers, to resume deliberations to try to break an impasse on five other  counts of money laundering against Seresi and on all counts against defendant  Ruben Saini.  </P></p>

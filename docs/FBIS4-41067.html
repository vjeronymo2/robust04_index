			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Chugayev: "Duma in Time Trouble"] </F>   [Text] The course of the 17 June plenary session of the  State Duma and its results seriously shook hopes that this  chamber of the Federal Assembly would prove to be more capable  of legislative activity than its predecessor, the Supreme  Soviet. As is well known, in the course of this session day  packed with stormy debates and scandals not one legislative act  received any reading. It would appear that the Duma expended  all its creative potential on the adoption of the budget and has  subsequently proved ready only for political, largely  internecine, battle.    Such an evolution of the country's supreme legislative organ  looks particularly striking against the background of the  gathering pace of the president's activity; in the course of the  past week he not only completed a lightning tour of important  Russian regions, but also continued the preparation and  publication of a series of edicts, among which the edict on  stepping up the battle against gangsterism has attracted the  most attention.    The Duma has not been able to deliver an intelligible  response to a single one of these presidential initiatives. The  compromise proposed by a number of Duma leaders -- to postpone  the entry into force of the edict on combating crime until the  appearance of an analogous law, which the Duma promised to adopt  in two weeks -- looks unrealistic. First, the Duma has had  almost six months to adopt such a law. However, instead of  doing so, legislators used the lion's share of the time to  prepare and adopt the law on the deputies' status and the decree  on the creation of parliamentary radio and television  broadcasting. The law on the budget, adopted at the second  reading, in this sense looks like the exception without which,  as we know, there is no rule. Second, July is the last month of  the session's work. Thus deputies of the chamber have only 10  plenary sittings ahead. The timetable of legislative work has  long since been disrupted, probably irreversibly. In addition,  the disposition of political forces in the Duma gives no grounds  for hope that a law devoted to combating organized crime can be  adopted quickly enough, even if preparation of all other  legislative acts is put to one side for this purpose. And, of  course, factional boycotts and deputies' strikes -- which we  have also witnessed over the past week -- cannot be ruled out.    At the same time deficiencies in legislative activity were  more than compensated for by an upsurge in aggressiveness. A  number of episodes at the 17 June session put one in mind of the  scenes played out at the Congresses of People's Deputies. It is  insufficient to attribute this to the speaker's absence from the  session, although I. Rybkin does indeed demonstrate masterly  control of the Duma. But it is impossible not to focus  attention on the fact that the main sources of tension in the  Duma last week were by no means the representatives of the LDPR  [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] faction, but the leaders of  the nonregistered deputies' groups "12 December" and "Russia's  Path."    It is improbable that the roots of this activity lie  exclusively in an innate sense of justice causing deputies to  contend with the Duma Council, which, in their opinion, has both  usurped power in the chamber and has turned into a counterpart  of the old Supreme Soviet Presidium. On the contrary, it is  more likely that it is a question of attempts to penetrate this  leading parliamentary organ themselves by any means, including  some which closely resemble blackmail. Moreover, it is hardly  exclusively in order to obtain the additional benefits which  registered factions and groups enjoy. Their main aim here seems  to be their inclusion, as quickly as possible, in the existing  system of the political establishment, and, as a consequence,  their inclusion on equal terms in the political process, which  is hard to describe as anything other than preparation for  elections.    Everything which happened in the Duma last week creates a  fairly firm impression that deputies assessed the president's  press conference and his legislative activity as the beginning  of the election campaign. What is more, they found themselves  at the same time grouped with the laggards who have lost the  initiative and effectively find themselves in time trouble.  After all, less and less time remains until the elections, and  there are so far, alas, not many grounds to be proud of their  achievements.    The president's expedited legislative activity, which is  taking place against the background of the Duma's poor  effectiveness, the ambiguous situation over the General  Prosecutor's Office, and the absence of the Constitutional  Court, although it will most likely increase B. Yeltsin's  popularity with the voters, could also have quite unexpected  consequences. The upsetting of the balance between the the  legislature and the executive in the favor of the latter can  already be seen extremely clearly today. It is not hard to  suppose that irate charges of usurping power will be leveled  against the president in fairly short order by the State Duma.  However, at the same time it would not be superfluous to remind  the initiators of such charges that they themselves in their  time have ignored many instruments of power under their full  control. Such as, for example, the constitutional laws on the  Constitutional Court, on the president, and on the elections.  At least, nothing is heard today of the preparation of these  legislative acts.</p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: HITTING SOME HIGH NOTES IN CONDUCTING THE CLASSICS  </P> <P> In writing the other day about Andre Previn's frank conversation with bright  students after a Philharmonic concert, I probably exposed my musical ignorance  and my awe of big-time conductors.  </P> <P> They are the ultimate authoritarians; who else can command the exquisite and  simultaneous response of 100 artists merely with a flick of a baton? Who else  can decide what novel interpretations to give to Mozart's music, and then do  it?  </P> <P> Previn is a young man; but if he runs true to form, he will still be conducting  in his 80s, and will probably live into his 90s. Longevity seems to be a reward  of life on the podium. Arturo Toscanini lived to be 90; Leopold Stokowski, 95;  Eugene Ormandy, 86; Bruno Walter, 86; Sir Thomas Beecham, 82; Pierre Monteux,  89; Arthur Fiedler, 85.  </P> <P> I don't know what accounts for this phenomenon. Probably the act of conducting  itself, which requires a vigorous exercising of the upper body, promotes good  health and, consequently, a long life.  </P> <P> Or it may be that a constant exposure to great music in itself has both an  invigorating and a soothing effect on the conductor's emotional health,  producing and relieving stress at the same time. I suppose that most musical  illiterates, like me, have wondered whether the orchestra would play just as  well if the conductor were not conducting. We all remember that Harry James,  Glenn Miller and most of the other big-band maestros used to turn their backs  on their bands periodically, producing no noticeable disorder.  </P> <P> On the other hand, an orchestra of 40 or 100 musicians, depending on the piece  being played, surely needs a conductor to avoid the anarchy that many  individual artists would undoubtedly slide into if left to themselves, and to  work them into a cohesive and harmonious whole.  </P> <P> I remember seeing a movie in which the fine British actor Ralph Richardson was  an eccentric old gentleman who played classical records constantly and went  about his home conducting. He was incredibly inept. None of his motions were at  all synchronized with the music. So, obviously, not just anybody can do it.  </P> <P> On the other hand, there is a popular notion that the conductor is unnecessary.  Milton Narwitz sends me a clipping from the sports section reporting that when  Pittsburgh Steeler Coach Chuck Noll was asked to guest-conduct the Pittsburgh  Symphony Orchestra he sent Steeler business manager Joe Gordon to ask the  orchestra members what was expected of him.  </P> <P> Gordon reported back: "I asked them what you'd have to know, and they said,  'Nothing.' The musicians don't pay any attention to the conductor anyway."  </P> <P> "Sounds like football," Noll said, and took the job.  </P> <P> "It confirms what I have maintained for 60 of my 80 years," says Narwitz. "The  orchestra before the conductor are all experts and -- in following the score --  will get the same result."  </P> <P> That is, of course, an attitude that is easily espoused by us ignoramuses. But  anyone who has ever watched Zubin Mehta work an orchestra into a frenzy with  his herculean calisthenics has to believe they couldn't do it without him.  </P> <P> By the way, Duke Russell sends me a clipping from The Tidings, which shows that  music has its Casey Stengels. Music critic Henry Roth recalls a number of non  sequiturs and syntactical gems collected by members of the Philadelphia  Orchestra from the lips of Eugene Ormandy.  </P> <P> The maestro is said to have inquired, "Who is sitting in that empty chair?"  Also, "Why do you always insist on playing when I'm trying to conduct?" And  this: "If you don't have it in your part, leave it out, because there is enough  missing already."  </P> <P> It is perhaps irrelevant to this subject, but I'm afraid that if I don't tell  this story now I will never be able to work it in. Recently, condensing the  plot of "Tosca," I noted that in the end the soprano jumps off a parapet to her  death, out of sight. I guessed that she jumped into a net.  </P> <P> Oliver McBain recalls a performance of Tosca (he thinks it was Scottish Opera)  in which the management had arranged for Tosca to jump down onto a trampoline,  instead of into a net. "In an unusual twist to Puccini's original intentions,"  he writes, "Tosca bounced back for one final look at her beloved Caravadossi."  </P> <P> I'd rather have seen that than to have heard Caruso sing "O Sole Mio."  </P></p>

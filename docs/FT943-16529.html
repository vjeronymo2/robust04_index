			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Spanish telecoms group joins global alliance Telefonica, the Spanish national telecommunications operator, has joined Unisource, the joint venture of the Dutch, Swedish and Swiss telecoms operators which last month forged a European alliance with AT&amp;T, the largest US telecoms company. The move came as the three founding companies announced initial steps to merge their international telecoms networks, and the Spanish government agreed to open Spain's undeveloped mobile phone market to competition. With turnover of nearly Dollars 11bn (Pounds 7.2bn) in 1992, Telefonica is far larger than its new partners. Its strong international holdings - notably its telecoms stakes across Latin America - make it particularly attractive to AT&amp;T and its European partners. Telefonica is expected to take a 25 per cent equity stake in Unisource. Unisource was established two years ago by the Dutch, Swiss and Swedish operators as a means of pooling their efforts to exploit the growing market for one-stop international telecoms services. Telefonica was attracted to Unisource by its successes in the multinational corporate sector, and by the desire to link up to a wider alliance as Europe's larger operators line up in rival transatlantic groupings. British Telecommunications last year signed a Dollars 5.3bn alliance with MCI, the second largest US long-distance operator, and is set to compete fiercely with Telefonica in the Spanish market through a deal with Banco Santander, one of Spain's largest banks. The other transatlantic alliance is between France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, and Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance operator. Unlike its Swiss and Swedish partners, Telefonica is in the private sector. Its largest shareholder is the Spanish state with a 32 per cent holding. Reversing Telefonica's long-standing opposition to early competition in the Spanish telecoms market, Mr Candido Velazquez-Gaztelu, its chairman, said: 'We support the Unisource policy toward opening telecommunications markets within Europe.' The Spanish government has taken the first step by abolishing Telefonica's monopoly over mobile telephony. Competitors will soon be invited to bid for a second licence to operate a digital cellular network. The Dutch, Swedish and Swiss national operators have decided to strengthen their existing Unisource alliance by progressively merging their international networks, with the aim of securing a fifth of worldwide telephone traffic by 2000.</p>

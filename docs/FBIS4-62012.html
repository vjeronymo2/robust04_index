			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Mars Urkumbayev, Kazakhstani </F> minister of economy, by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov;  place and date not given: "Eurasian Union Is Command of the  Times"]    [Text] Mars Urkumbayev, Kazakhstani minister of economy,  believes that a special relationship between his country and  Russia is not a whim of politicians but a vital necessity.  Despite all the complexities of the present reality, both  states are actually working to create the backbone of the future  Eurasian Union of CIS countries. It is this that largely  accounts for President Nursultan Nazarbayev's initiative of  transforming the Commonwealth into such a fundamentally new  association of like-minded countries, which he advanced at the  end of last month during his official visit to the Russian  Federation.    An ITAR-TASS correspondent met with the minister and asked  him to describe in an exclusive interview how this idea matured.    "Our idea is the result of an impartial analysis of the  state  of the two states' economies," the minister said. "They  virtually constitute a single whole. Therefore they are not  subject to disintegration, although in reent years certain  `hotheads' have committed quite a few follies here, with the  result that we are all having to pay a high price for confusion  and unprofessionalism.    "For example, how will the power workers of the Urals and  West Siberia work stably without Kazakhstani coal, if they are  almost totally dependent on deliveries of it? Or Russian  metalworkers, to whom our republic used to dispatch more than 8  million tonnes of iron ore and iron-ore concentrates and pellets  every year?    "There has recently been an ever greater number of  complaints  about paralysis in our passenger motor transport and housing  construction. Just about everyone is blamed for this. In  actual fact, however, the primary causes lie elsewhere. The  republic is almost 100-percent dependent on deliveries of buses  and timber from the Russian Federation. Until we have secured  the reinstatement of this flow, people will continue to stand in  line at bus stops for hours on end, and new buildings will stand  for months without floors, doors, or window frames."    [Akimov] But it will not be easy to reinstate the disrupted  ties in their former volume, not to mention deepening and  broadening them. Last year alone commodity turnover between our  countries fell by a factor of more than four. Do you really  believe that in this situation it is possible to speak of any  start of integration processes?    [Urkumbayev] They are already taking place. Forms and  methods of mutually acceptable cooperation were identified at  conferences of representatives of ministries, departments, and  administrations of contiguous oblasts held under the auspices of  our governments during 1992-1993, as well as in talks on a  purely regional level. Including with the Republic of Sakha  (Yakutia), Bashkortostan, Buryatia, and the cities of Moscow,  St. Petersburg, and Nizhniy Novgorod. It is now a question of  ensuring that the agreements reached start to work in full. For  this it is necessary to remove the last remaining obstacles.    The chief stumbling block here has been the failure of  payments to pass not only between individual enterprises but  even between banks. This has now reached astronomic figures and  runs to trillions of rubles. The lack of joint structures  directly engaged in coordinating Kazakhstani-Russian economic  ties and eliminating the misunderstandings that arise in their  implementation also acts as a big brake.    As a result of talks between our countries' presidents our  countries' corresponding departments have, together with the  state banks, already begun unraveling the tight tangle of  contradictions occasioned by mutual debts. I believe that this  work will be completed over the next six to eight weeks, along  with the current preparation of proposals for simplifying mutual  payment-clearing relations between business subjects, which have  been complicated by the introduction of national currencies in  our countries. Consequently, in June it is quite possible to  expect the completion of the first, most difficult, stage in the  normalization of Kazakhstani-Russian trade and economic  cooperation.    The second stage is connected with the creation of  conditions  for the free movement of goods, services, and capital. Here,  too, everything seems to be starting to move. The groundwork  has already been done for the formation of a single customs  area. Compared with last year, Kazakhstan has already reduced  the list of quota-regulated output by a factor of six, and  Russia by a factor of more than seven. At the same time customs  export duties on many types of products have been substantially  reduced or even totally removed by mutual agreement between the  sides.    There will then follow the complete lifting of customs  duties, taxes, dues, and other tariff and nontariff restrictions  in mutual trade and a switch to a unified trade policy with  regard to third countries. All this, in conjunction with the  standardization of trade and economic legislation, is to serve  as the basis for rapprochement in other spheres of  Kazakhstani-Russian ties, including management structures, and  lead ultimately to a union of the two countries of which  Nursultan Nazarbayev spoke in Moscow. It is this union in turn,  being a kind of guarantor of fair and honest partnership, that  must become the backbone of the Eurasian Union.</p>

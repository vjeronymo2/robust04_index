			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown calls for credit card photos PHOTOGRAPHS should be laser-engraved on credit cards as a crime prevention measure, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said yesterday. As the debate about crime continued to exercise MPs Mr Ashdown said that there was scope for making progress in taking practical steps to cut opportunities for crime. In a letter to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, he urged a renewed emphasis on crime prevention, and in particular 'plastic fraud'. Losses from credit cards and cheque guarantee cards had risen to Pounds 166m in 1991, he said, an increase of one-third over the 1990 figure of Pounds 123m.</p>

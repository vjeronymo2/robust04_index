All sides  agreed to the deployment of the force after the cease-fire  agreement signed on 30 January by deputies from the four regions  of the south of the country. The force is being sent to keep  the belligerents apart and to contain the various militias in  their zones. This force of 400 men is due to be deployed today.  It already began to take up its positions on the night of  Friday to Saturday [18-19 February]. [passage omitted]</p>

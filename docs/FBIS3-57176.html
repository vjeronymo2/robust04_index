There is vast  potential for multifaceted cooperation. As long as there is the  desire on both sides. But is there? And just how profitable is  it, for example, for us to trade with China today?    "The policy of liberalization in foreign economic relations  is beginning to yield positive results. This is evidenced, in  particular, by the development of Russian-Chinese trade,"  officials at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations  say.    It is certainly true that the total volume of commodity  turnover between Russia and China has increased. Russia had a  surplus in 1992. But in reality things have turned out badly  for the Russian recipient and consumer. By the end of 1992 the  rate at which goods were ordered from and supplied by the  Russian side under the terms of the relevant protocol had  considerably outstripped the rate at which goods were supplied  by the Chinese side. As a result, Russian suppliers have not  received goods in exchange for their exports. Furthermore, in  the light of Russian exporters' difficulties with the supply of  complete sets of equipment, the Chinese side is holding back  with regard to honoring its mutual commitments to despatch goods  to the Russian Federation. In addition, the Chinese side has  prevented the Russian side from honoring its commitments to  supply equipment to the "Suizhong," "Jingxian," "Yimin," and  "Yingkou" thermal power plants.    How should this be viewed?    The policy of liberalizing foreign economic activity has  meant a rejection of the regulating role played by the center,  which represented general state and national interests. As a  result of the new policy, trade with China now mainly takes the  form of border and regional commodity exchange, rather than  being conducted on an intergovernmental basis (by protocol).  The participants in this process are nonproduction cooperatives  and enterprises, and also foreign economic associations at  regional, city, and rayon level. The basis of this border and  regional commodity exchange is barter (the exchange of goods for  other goods). In 1992, the bulk of Russian supplies of trucks,  tractors, combines, machine tools, and mining equipment, and  also some power engineering and aviation equipment and spare  parts, were implemented by enterprises on a barter basis. The  supply of so-called "hard currency Russian goods" --  fertilizers, metals, and commercial timber -- is offset by  consumer goods imported from the PRC, although these are often  of poor quality.    This also cannot be counted as one of Russia's achievements  in its trade with China.    In 1992 the proportion of decentralized trade in the Russian  Federation's commodity turnover with the PRC increased from 59  percent to 90 percent in the space of one year. Moreover, the  export of machinery and equipment fell from 35 percent in 1991  to 31 percent in 1992.    Liberalization in foreign trade has therefore had a negative  impact with regard to utilizing production capacity in Russia's  machine-building industry. Trade with the PRC has not given it  any incentive to increase output.    Barter-driven border trade is gaining in scope. According to  XINHUA, at the end of June 1993 barter deals between the  province of Heilongjiang and Russia (and also other CIS  republics) amounted to 1.51 billion Swiss francs, an increase of  83.3 percent in comparison to the same period in 1992. At the  end of July 1992 China had a surplus in border trade with Russia.    Current trade relations with China are economically  disadvantageous to Russia, because border and regional trade  deals are unevenly balanced. Russian export prices are set too  low, while Chinese import prices are set too high. In a number  of cases Chinese companies have deliberately refused to buy  timber, petroleum products, fertilizers, and metal products  through interstate channels, instead obtaining them in  significant quantities on a barter basis. It is quite obvious  that China is pumping out Russia's raw material resources with  the aid of border and regional trade.    Joint Russian-Chinese enterprises in our Far East are a  component part of this "border pump." However, the creation of  these enterprises is seen as an achievement in Russian-Chinese  foreign economic relations! They are involved in the export of  natural resources and unprocessed raw materials and in the  services sector (the hotel business, in particular), according  to experts from the semigovernmental Japan External Trade  Organization.    But is this activity by joint enterprises in the Russian  Federation's long-term interests as a whole? After all, we are  losing irreplaceable natural resources and receiving in exchange  foodstuffs and consumer goods which have no demand on the world  market.    This kind of trade cannot be described as mutually  advantageous. According to data for the first half of 1992,  Beijing was able to improve its overall foreign trade balance as  a direct result of supplying goods to Russia, by expanding its  exports -- which began to decline noticeably from January 1993.    What about Russian exports to the PRC? As a result of  capital construction being scaled down in China, our rolled  steel, machinery, and equipment are not in the demand they used  to be.    According to data for October 1993, the value of unsold  Russian goods has reached 1.3 billion yuan. Assessing the  prospects for developing economic cooperation between our  countries, many Chinese economists regard the Russian Far East  primarily as a supplier of fuel and raw materials. Strange  though it may seem, some representatives of Russian economic  science share these sentiments.    Trade between the Russian Federation and the PRC is  sometimes  held back for technical reasons. In the first half of last  year, for example, the plan for freight traffic between the two  countries was only 62-67 percent implemented, mainly because of  a shortage of cars and the low capacity of railroad sidings on  PRC territory.    Meanwhile, it was planned to transport as much as 5 million  tonnes of freight by rail from Russia to the PRC in 1993,  whereas China was only supposed to dispatch 2.4 million tonnes.    The Russian side has volunteered to iron out transport  bottlenecks by offering to build a passing track between the  Chinese station of Manzhouli and Zabaykalsk, using its own  resources. This was announced by Zabaykalsk Railway Chief A.  Dovgello. Such generosity on the part of officials in the  Russian railway department would be touching if they were paying  for the work out of their own pockets. Especially as the  transport system in rayons bordering on China leaves much to be  desired.    It is extremely interesting that some tend to view the  export  of Chinese manpower as an achievement in our foreign economic  relations. According to XINHUA, in the first half of 1993 the  province of Heilongjiang alone sent 20,000 Chinese contract  workers to Russia. To quote SIBIRSKAYA GAZETA, the citizens  arriving in Maritime Kray from China today "can hardly be called  the best examples of the Chinese nation."    For example, the services of some plant growers from China  have had to be refused. More than 60 Chinese hired workers have  been sent back to the PRC early from the "Leninskoye" Peasant  Farmers' Association in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast. When they  arrived from the city of Tongjiang, the Chinese workers were  contracted to grow tomatoes and cucumbers on land leased in the  oblast. However, once they had planted out the seedlings, they  left the ripening harvest to the mercy of fate and actively  engaged in commercial activity. They obtained large  consignments of Chinese goods from across the border and sold  them at the local market.    The question of Chinese contract workers goes beyond pure  economics. A political problem lies behind it. At the end of  the sixties the PRC leadership officially made territorial  claims against the USSR. In particular, they referred to lands  in the Russian Far East. To this day the PRC Government has not  retracted these claims. The question of "the lost territories"  is hyped in various PRC publications, which is reflected in the  mass social consciousness of the Chinese. According to  Germany's DER SPIEGEL, the Chinese see their striving for the  east of Russia as the continuation of a long tradition.  Historian Huang Dingtian from the Heilongjiang Academy of  Social Sciences claims that, 140 years ago, large areas of  Siberia belonged to China, and the Chinese never forget history.    According to SIBIRSKAYA GAZETA, the reality is that twice  as many Chinese as Russians live in Maritime Kray's Pogranichnyy  [Border] Rayon. All these PRC citizens are living there  illegally.    Our own Russian street traders (known in the jargon of  today's new "businessmen" as "commuters") do not arouse any  positive emotions in our neighbors. Every day, several thousand  Russian buyers descend on northeast China. Once they have  "stocked up," they hurry home. This is how Russians try to  ensure their own personal prosperity on the road to a market  economy!    Russian-Chinese foreign economic relations cannot be  discussed in unequivocal terms. Nevertheless, while living for  the present, we must not forget Russia's long-term economic and  political interests.</p>

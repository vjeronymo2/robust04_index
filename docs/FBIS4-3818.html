			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- Acting Premier Zhu  Rongji today chaired the State Council's 18th executive meeting  to discuss the additional regulations (draft) for the "PRC  Regulations Governing Offenses Against Public Order." The  meeting later adopted, in principle, the draft additional  regulations.    The meeting maintained that, since they came into effect on  1  January 1987, the current regulations have played a significant  role in safeguarding social order and social stability.  However, with the development of the economy and the deepening  of reform and opening up, many new situtions and new issues with  regard to public order have appeared. Thus, the additional  regulations are very essential for strengthening control over  public offense; safeguarding public order, safety, and  interests; and protecting citizens' legitimate rights and  interests so that reform, opening up, and socialist  modernization can proceed smoothly.    The meeting adopted, in principle, the additional  regulations  (draft), which the State Council will submit to the National  People's Congress Standing Committee after further revision.</p>

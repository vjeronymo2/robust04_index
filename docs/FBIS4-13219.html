			<p>BFN     [Text] Concerning the setting up of the Transitional  National Council, debates on whether to take part in it have  flavored the lives of political parties.    After the National Liberation Front, the Socialist Forces  Front, Ennahda, Ettahadi Movement, and the Democratic Movement  for the Renewal of Algeria announced they were boycotting the  council, the Rally for Culture and Democracy announced that it  would not be participating. The Algerian People's Union,  however, has agreed to join in.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Japan faces trade sanctions by US THE US administration yesterday announced trade sanctions against Japan for its failure to open its domestic construction market to foreign contractors, architects and engineers. A spokesman for Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, said the administration would limit Japanese involvement in all areas of US government-funded construction projects. However, the sanctions will not come into effect for 30 days, during which time the Japanese will have the opportunity to come to the bargaining table with an acceptable proposal. Japanese companies have been earning an average of about Dollars 2.4bn a year (Pounds 1.42bn) for projects in the US market. US companies have won only Dollars 200m in contracts in the Japanese market since 1988, according to Senator Frank Murkowski, the leading Congressional proponent of action in the construction dispute. In 1989, Mrs Hills announced an official finding of unfair Japanese trade practices in the public construction market. But she delayed sanctions on the grounds that there had been some progress. Last year, Senator Murkowski succeeded in getting Congress to require Mrs Hills to impose sanctions if the Japanese market continued to be closed. However, Mrs Hills yesterday was prepared to order even wider retaliation than that ordered by Congress. The US has sought to expand the 1988 Major Projects Agreement, under which Japan promised to improve US company access to 14 big construction projects, worth Dollars 18bn. This year, US negotiators asked for access to all big construction projects before backing down and agreeing to a finite, but extended list.</p>

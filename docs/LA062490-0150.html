			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER FLAG AMENDMENT  </P> <P> Has Congress stopped to consider that attempted passage of the flag burning  amendment will cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars? Agendas must be  printed, meetings must be held, lobbyists must be paid. And all 50 state  legislatures must deliberate, each printing up their own agendas, etc.  </P> <P> While protecting the flag is a noble goal, that money could better be spent on  education or fighting drugs, where it would have a real impact on people's  lives, not just preventing one kook a year from burning a flag.  </P> <P> SUSAN KAYTON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Carl Purdy first collected and described  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (western lily) from unspecified locations in the headlands around Humboldt Bay, California (Purdy 1897). There are no other taxonomic treatments of this lily. Some researchers have speculated that separate Oregon and California varieties of the lily may exist (Ballantyne 1980). The variation between lilies in these two regions is now believed to be due to environmental differences; i.e. wetter (bog) sites and drier (coastal prairie) sites, and not geographic variation (Mark Skinner, California Native Plant Society, pers. comm., 1991). In some instances,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. occidentale  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is known to hybridize with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. columbianum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (tiger lily) that grows in generally drier sites. Hybrids are known only from disturbed sites such as road edges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a perennial in the lily family (Liliaceae), grows from a short unbranched, rhizomatous bulb, reaching a height of up to 1.8 meters (5 feet (ft)). Leaves grow along the unbranched stem singly or in whorls and are long and pointed, roughly 1 centimeter (cm) wide and 10 cm long (0.5 inch (in) by 4 in). The nodding flowers are red, sometimes deep orange, with yellow to green centers in the shape of a star and spotted with purple. The six petals (tepals) are 3 to 4 cm (1 to 1.5 in) long and curve strongly backwards. This species can be distinguished from similar native lilies by the combination of pendent red flowers with yellow to green centers in the shape of a star, highly reflexed petals, non-spreading stamens closely surrounding the pistil, and an unbranched rhizomatous bulb.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium columbianum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is yellow to orange and grows from a typical ovoid bulb;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. vollmeri, L. pardilinum,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. maritimum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> can have red tepals, but none have the distinctive characters of stamens that stay close to the pistil and a green central star (which may change to yellow with age).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> has an extremely restricted distribution within 2 miles (3.2 kilometers (km)) of the coast from Hauser, Coos County, Oregon to Loleta, Humboldt County, California. This range encompasses approximately the southern one-third of the Oregon coast and the northern 100 miles (161 km) of the California coast. Its extreme westerly distribution is the origin of its specific name. The plant is currently known from 7 widely separated regions along the coast, and occurs in 31 small (2 square meters (2.4 square yards) to 4 hectares (10 acres) in area), isolated, densely clumped populations. Of the 25 populations known in 1987 and 1988, 9 contained only 2 to 6 plants, 5 contained 10 to 50 plants, 6 contained 51 to 200 plants, 4 contained 201 to 600 plants, and 1 contained almost 1,000 plants (Schultz 1989). At some sites, particularly the sites with more than 200 plants, the majority of plants were non-flowering, which is probably an indication of stress (Schultz 1989). Schultz calculated a known population of 661 flowering and at least 2,750 non-flowering plants in 1988. Since then, an estimated total of 1,000 to 2,000 flowering plants have been discovered at 4 sites near Crescent City, California, where none were previously known (Dave Imper, Humboldt State University Foundation, pers. comm., 1991). In addition, a population of about 125 flowering plants was discovered near Brookings, Oregon, in 1991 (Margie Willis, Oregon Department of Parks and Recreation, pers. comm. 1991), and a population of 13 flowering plants was discovered near Bandon, Oregon, in 1992. The known populations occur on State of Oregon (15), county (1), private (15) including 1 site on land owned by The Nature Conservancy, and State of California (2) lands. Two sites span two ownerships.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Oregon, Schultz (1989) identified a 20-mile stretch of coast from Bandon to Cape Blanco as an area likely to contain undiscovered populations of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Previously, Ballantyne (1980) searched this area and did not find new populations, but his visit was after flowering when the plants would have been inconspicuous. It is possible this area may support the lily. In California, little suitable habitat remains that has not already been surveyed (Dave Imper, pers. comm., 1992). The extremely dense vegetation in the coastal scrub habitat and around bogs makes surveying for the lily difficult.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

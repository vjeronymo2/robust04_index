			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Senate Acts on Czech Tariffs: The Senate approved normalizing trade relations  with Czechoslovakia for the first time since World War II, reducing tariffs on  its exports to the United States by up to 90%. On a voice vote with no  opposition, it approved a trade agreement, signed last April by the Bush  Administration, granting it "most-favored-nation" trade status.  </P> <P> The House approved the agreement last week. The accord will effectively reduce  by 90% the tariffs paid on about $82 million in Czech exports to the United  States last year and open the way for increased business ties between the two  countries. The effect will be to give Czechoslovakia a much broader U.S. market  for its exports by cutting their prices to wholesalers, retailers and  ultimately American consumers by as much as up to 40%.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the NTV Newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] Army General Raul Castro, minister of the  Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], has visited Caibarien  Municipality as part of his continuing tour of Central Army  areas. The party and government take initiatives there that  involve the masses when solving problems.    The words consistency and determination are no longer theory  but reality in Caibarien Municipality, north Villa Clara  Province. Raul saw this during his tour of the area. Major  Jimenez Vazquez, head of the municipal general staff, briefed  Raul on the area's level of defense preparedness, the  territory's political and moral state, and the development of  the food program with the people's help in solving problems.    Caibarien Municipality is recognized as being prepared  defensively at the second stage for several reasons, including:  the completion of fortified projects, the detailed preparation  of the cadres in the six defense zones, the authorization of the  warning system, and the ability to transport in case of enemy  attack. Defense Day was completed successfully with specialists  giving practical and theoretical classes. Furthermore,  Caibarien is contributing more to the territorial militia in  preparation for combat. The municipality has perfected the  Unified Vigilance and Protection System and the equipment and  armaments are ready to be put into action. [passage omitted]    Raul and his delegation met workers at the municipal organic  gardens -- the most outstanding in the province -- where he was  able to see developments in the production of vegetables and  tubers for the population. Raul expressed his satisfaction when  he saw the good political and moral state of those workers, who  labor every day with great responsibility. [passage omitted]    The tour through Caibarien included a visit to the Campanas  de las Villas contingent, which is working on the Caibarien-Cayo  Santa Maria embankment. A total of 42 kilometers have already  been completed. Orlando Rodriguez, head of the contingent,  explained the progress made on the project, the collective's  experiences, and the fuel-saving initiatives and innovations.  Construction on the embankment is top quality and is being  carried out with environmental protection in mind.    Access to the beaches of Villa Clara's northern keys will  help develop the Cuban tourist industry. Raul was interested in  touring the completed portion of the embankment, particularly  the embankment's new bridge. Raul conversed with the workers en  route to the project and encouraged them to continue. Raul was  amazed by the magnificent project and posed for a photograph  with the workers and his delegation at the end of the embankment  as a souvenir of his visit. This project, devised by our  commander in chief, demonstrates how man can overcome any  obstacle regardless of difficulty.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Directors' pay increasing as profits fall and debt rises to pay dividends Sir, Your article on directors' earnings only touched on the surface of this problem ('Directors' pay shoots ahead', September 9). A larger study of 529 companies from the FT index that have year-ends from September 1992 through to May 1993, with a total turnover of Pounds 511bn, shows that the highest-paid directors averaged increases of 10.4 per cent. The second and third highest-paid directors achieved increases of 9.3 per cent. While their companies increased turnover by 6.7 per cent, the profit before tax fell by 13.9 per cent with margins slipping 1.3 per cent overall. Ordinary shareholders' profit fell by 19.5 per cent but dividends rose by 7.7 per cent. This left the retained profit needed to finance the growth of the businesses down 32.7 per cent. The result was that many had to borrow more money to finance their dividends. The average highest-paid director received 10.4 per cent more while profits fell by almost 14 per cent. Yet this glosses over the many cases where much higher increases were paid for even poorer results. There are too many to list here in total and to identify only a few would be unfair. Overall, the profit per pound of directors' emoluments has fallen by one-third in one year. The time is now here when rewards, at all levels, should be more closely tied to changes in the real wealth created. When senior directors received rises of about 10 per cent, the total wage bill rose by 2.3 per cent, the actual change in added value created by these 529 companies fell by 4.2 per cent and it was from this depleted added value that the 7.7 per cent increase in dividends was paid. No wonder the retained profits fell and borrowings increased. If the institutions used their influence on boards to link remuneration more closely to wealth created it would ensure that everyone's eyes were on the same ball. Were each of the above companies then able to improve by only 1 per cent in key areas, other than by raising retail prices, they would increase their added value by 6.9 per cent and their profit before tax by 30 per cent. This would raise the added value-to-pay ratio from its present 1.66 to where it was only two years ago, at 1.78. The margin would increase from its present 6.82 per cent to 8.9 per cent; this compares with 9.09 per cent only two years ago. Such improvements would, in themselves, not justify increases as they would only be taking us back to where we were two years ago. Substantial increases should only follow large real gains.

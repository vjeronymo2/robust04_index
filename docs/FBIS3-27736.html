			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii stressed the government's policy Monday [31 January] of  implementing a cut in income tax and a rise in the consumption  tax in a single package. He made the comment at a press meeting  soon after consulting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura to confirm their  remarks over the weekend indicating a revision of government  policy.    He said he complained to Takemura over his remarks and said  they made it difficult for him to fulfill his responsibilities  as finance minister.    Fujii said he reiterated that under the government's basic  policy of conducting the tax cut and hike as a single measure, a  joint economic forum of the government and ruling parties is to  decide on the tax issue "in two or three days." He said  Takemura agreed and told him that news reports did not reflect  his "real intention." He later saw Hosokawa, who also agreed  with him.    Takemura had hinted at a reception hosted by his party,  Sakigake, on Sunday, that there was a possibility of separating  the tax hike and of issuing deficit-covering bonds to finance  the tax cut.    Hosokawa told reporters Saturday that he was not considering  a consumption tax hike.    Meanwhile, Fujii repeated his strong opposition to the  issuance of "untreated" deficit-financing bonds, and called for  the timing and other concrete details of a consumption tax hike  to be stipulated in the same law as an income tax cut so as to  guarantee repayment of bonds issued to cover the time lag  between the tax cut and hike.</p>

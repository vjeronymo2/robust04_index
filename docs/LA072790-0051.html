			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PASSES D.C. SPENDING BILL THAT ALLOWS FOR ABORTIONS  </P> <P> The House approved a District of Columbia spending bill Thursday that would  allow the use of local tax revenues to pay for abortions for poor women.  </P> <P> But the bill, adopted by a 241-178 vote, is likely to be vetoed by President  Bush if it is passed by the Senate.  </P> <P> Last year Bush twice vetoed the District of Columbia appropriations bill over  similar abortion provisions.  </P> <P> The new bill bars the use of federal government funds to pay for abortions  unless the life of the mother is in danger or in cases of rape or incest.  </P> <P> Bush last year objected to the use of federal funding for abortions in cases of  rape or incest and also objected to use of local tax funds for unrestricted  abortions.  </P> <P> Unable to override the vetoes, Congress eventually restricted payments for  abortion to instances where the mother's life was endangered and Bush signed  the bill.  </P> <P> Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), an outspoken abortion foe, said White  House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu told him Thursday afternoon that Bush would  veto the bill over the abortion issue.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to the Congress of </F> Deputies in Madrid--live]    [Excerpts] Mr. Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen: Various  parliamentary groups have asked me to appear before the House,  in accordance with Article 203 of the regulations, to give the  government's position on the situation created in Spanish  society--I am reading this word for word--in view of the flight  of [former Civil Guard Director General] Mr. Roldan and the many  responsibilities that arise from this. Although this is the  reason for my appearance--bearing in mind the social disquiet  that has been caused and the political uncertainty experienced  in the past few days--you will understand if I make, albeit  briefly, a number of points of a more general nature.    First, the circumstances that can be explained with regard  to  the flight of Mr. Roldan were explained by former Interior  Minister Asuncion in an appearance before the joint justice and  interior committee held last week after the calling of this  plenary session. The course of the investigation by a large team  from the security forces is continuing both inside and outside  our borders. We hope it will bear fruit as soon as possible.    For my part, ladies and gentlemen, to add any more details  on  this task would be imprudent because it could detract from the  effectiveness of the work of the security forces. You know,  however, ladies and gentlemen, that the prosecutor's office has  applied for the freezing of Mr. Roldan's current accounts. This  will not only facilitate the work of justice but will also limit  his capacity for movement.    Second, knowledge of the government's position is called for  with regard to the other responsibilities of all kinds that  arise from his flight. In my view, these responsibilities could  have a political, administrative, or penal nature. There seems  to be no doubt that political responsibilities exist, although  the juridical-constitutional limits of surveillance are also  clear. Well, after the first report--the first, ladies and  gentlemen--of the disappearance of Mr. Roldan, the interior  minister presented his irrevocable resignation in less than 24  hours. This is an assumption of political responsibility with  regard to the specific fact of the flight itself. Bearing in  mind the gravity of the matter overall and its great social  repercussions, [former Interior Minister] Mr. Corcuera gave up  his seat as a deputy in a gesture that, by its very nature,  surely goes beyond the normal demands of such responsibilities.    In relation to his flight, there is no doubt that there  could  be other kinds of responsibilities in the administrative or  penal areas. The ministry is investigating those that may have  lain in its jurisdiction. If penal responsibilities derive from  this investigation, the findings will be passed on to the  judiciary so that they can be dealt with in accordance with the  law.    However, I want to make it clear to you, ladies and  gentlemen, that the main priority is to place Mr. Roldan at the  disposal of the courts. The Ministry of Justice and the  Ministry of Interior are directing their utmost efforts to this  end. Consequently, it is necessary to recognize the serious  public concern caused by his flight. One can and should be  critical and demanding with regard to the circumstances that  brought about his flight, but one should not be more specific at  the present time in order to avoid prejudicing the work of the  security forces. Responsibility can be demanded for a fault  confirmed by the facts; this has already been fully assumed.    In my view, one should not speculate from positions of  responsibility about hypothetical blackmail or impossible  battles of wills in a law-governed state. As a government,  still less can we accept any suggestion of connivance. For us,  I repeat, more than for anyone, the main priority is to place  Mr. Roldan at the disposal of the courts. The fulfillment of  this intention will clearly demonstrate that there cannot be any  kind of impunity.    I know that some groups have persistently asked, now and on  previous occasions, for my resignation as prime minister. As I  have already said to the House with regard to the positions  taken--when they do not have clearly biased connotations and  partisan or other interests--I believe that it is my obligation  to remain at the head of the government, respecting the will of  the ballot box, helping to clarify this and other matters, with  the aim of seeing justice done and the necessary confidence  reestablished in the institutions.    I said at the beginning of my address that I thought it was  necessary to explain my government's attitude toward the  disquiet caused in our society by this and other events of  undoubted importance, even though they may not be the specific  motive of the request for my appearance today.    We are witnessing the recovery of our economy, together with  what this means for employment. This is without a doubt the  greatest and the most constant concern of our society. As a  government, we are duty bound to maintain political stability  and to overcome the justified concern of society, not only  because of the importance that this has in itself but also in  order to establish the climate of confidence that aids the  process of recovery. So, ladies and gentlemen, I feel myself  doubly obliged to contribute through the action of the  government to reestablishing this confidence in the functioning  of the institutions, and I am firmly determined to do so. For  this reason, I do not share the requests for my resignation, in  the conviction that this would generate a climate of instability  that would make this task more difficult.    Three weeks ago, during the state of the nation debate, we  discussed in depth the problem created by the cases of  corruption. We decided on government actions, parliamentary  actions, and we also announced our readiness to accept those  responsibilities corresponding to us. We considered it  necessary to improve the instruments for anticipating,  investigating, and judging irregular practices and corrupt  conduct.    Since that time, Mr. Roldan's flight has, without a doubt,  heightened the climate of social concern. At the same time,  however, the government and parliament have acted by fulfilling  the commitments emanating from that debate. In these three  weeks, we have demonstrated with actions our capacity to adopt  measures, measures that strengthen the chambers' control or  which entail government initiatives and decisions. We have also  demonstrated our readiness to assume political responsibilities  by virtue of the desire to contribute to the lessening of  society's disquiet or the desire not to prejudice a shared  project. We are thereby contributing to the improvement of the  situation, despite those incidents that may occur on the way.    Today one can see with the clarity provided by the facts  that  the fight against corruption is a priority of our political  action. [passage omitted]    As I said at the beginning of my statement, a series of  political responsibilities have to be assumed, and this is what  has happened over the last few days.    I have already mentioned the decision by former Interior  Minister Antoni Asuncion to tender his resignation, assuming his  political responsibility for the flight of Mr. Roldan. I have  also mentioned Mr. Corcuera, who has given up his seat in  parliament--linking it to his former responsibility as interior  minister. Mr. Carlos Solchaga, former head of the parliamentary  group and socialist deputy, also tendered his resignation from  both posts, linking them to the responsibility taken on when he  was finance and economy minister. There was also the case of  Mr. Rubio, the former governor of the Bank of Spain.    I have said before--and I repeat myself here--that, in my  opinion, this taking of responsibility most surely goes beyond  what can reasonably be expected. The generosity of those who  assumed responsibility, however, is meant to contribute and to  give a stronger answer to this situation and to reestablish the  citizens' confidence in the institutions and in their political  representatives.    Finally, the former agriculture minister [Vidente Albero]  also assumed his political responsibility linked to tax issues,  which he explained to the public after presenting his  irrevocable resignation.    The recent events show clearly that there cannot be any kind  of impunity in our democracy. In fact, there is none for  irregular or illegal acts. Furthermore, they show our will as a  political group to assume our responsibilities.    Mr. Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is urgent to finish  this set of measures and to clarify fully the corruption  situations in order to wipe out any kind of feeling of impunity  that may have been felt and to thus clear up any uncertainties  that might weaken the impulse and energy needed for ending the  economic recession. This recovery means reestablishing  confidence in the future. That can only happen in a calmer  atmosphere than the one we have had over the last few days.    The best contribution we can all make to this climate of  confidence would be for everyone to assume their responsibility  and renounce political advantages made by hurting the whole of  society.    It is our duty to avoid causing more social alarm,  considering the circumstances we must face, and to help restore  as soon as possible a climate of confidence in the institutions  and in the real economic possibilities that exist in the future.    We cannot reach this without political stability. Following  the 6 June elections, in order to guarantee this stability, one  has to complete the majority that is governing in  minority--which our party represents. This is what we are  doing, correctly interpreting the will the citizens expressed in  voting. In our democratic system, a respect for rules  represents a guarantee for all. It does not help stability, and  thereby does not help the confidence we need for economic  recovery, if we try and discuss alternatives not chosen by the  voters.    As prime minister, I agree to have a vote of no confidence  as  soon as I feel that it is necessary to determine the support, or  lack of it, in this chamber. This has not happened until now.  So it is our obligation as a government to continue making the  necessary decisions to combat corruption cases and to  reestablish a climate of confidence that will further the  recovery of our economy.    Ladies and gentlemen, the initiatives that make this double  task more difficult will, sooner or later, be seen as negative  by the society because they will diminish the needed political  stability. Thank you very much.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Swans offer hinges on lay-offs A fresh proposal from the French company wishing to buy Swan Hunter would mean some workers having to wait on lay-off, being able only to claim state benefits when not receiving wages. Any who chose to leave while waiting would not be entitled to redundancy. Those being laid off rather than made redundant would forfeit entitlement to lay-off payments as a condition of continued employment, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership said yesterday. The affected workers are entitled under the present company scheme to 68 per cent of their earnings if laid off. Mr Fred Henderson, who has led negotiations for Soffia/ Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie on its proposed purchase of Swan Hunter said CMN would take on the legal obligation to pay the employees their redundancy should they later not be needed. The time they would have to wait to resume work at the yard would vary. Mr Henderson said: 'The way we view it, the entire moral responsibility in relation to the difficulties which face the workforce rests with the former employer, not the new employer.' He said a further CMN condition was that the unions accepted sub-contracting of shipbuilding work where cheaper. Steelwork, he said, would almost certainly be sub-contracted, probably to Sunderland. CMN will buy Swans only if the yard has two years' work. On Tuesday it offered Price Waterhouse, the receivers, a new deal after a previous proposal ran into negotiating difficulties. The new offer includes paying the wages of Swans' design team until the end of the year in the hope of winning a Ministry of Defence order for an ocean-survey vessel. On Tuesday CMN told the receivers it expected them to make everybody redundant except the design team. But yesterday it amended the proposal, saying it required the ocean-survey vessel core team to be laid off. Mr Henderson said that the new offer also required CMN to have 'first refusal' on Swans' assets, including intellectual property, should it not buy the yard. Unions at the yard maintain that CMN must buy the business before negotiations on terms and conditions. Mr Henderson and Price Waterhouse are to meet in London today.</p>

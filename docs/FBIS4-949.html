			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Full-page advertisement by Inkatha Freedom Party, IFP] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  We've done our duty. </H5>   One week ago to the day, after weeks of exhaustive  negotiations, the IFP and the ANC agreed on the terms of  reference for international mediation. It was a solemn contract  between us and was submitted to the mediators.    On the basis of this, some of the most eminent men in the  world arrived in South Africa on Tuesday, to start mediation the  following day.    The ANC however, tore up the Sunday agreement which had been  made by national chairman Mr Thabo Mbeki. If the ANC can tear  up a covenant like that, what value can be attached to its word?    Our fellow South Africans, we know you will now understand  why we cannot accept the ANC's word and why we insist that your  rights can only be safeguarded in cast-iron constitutional  guarantees.    We negotiated in good faith for more than 15 long years  before the National Party recognised the wrongness of its ways  and decided to break with apartheid. We have done so since  February 2 1990.    The ANC showed bad faith at CODESA and then held the country  to ransom through violent mass action. The Government buckled  and has negotiated in bad faith in the Multi-Party Negotiating  Forum. It is this that has brought our country to the brink of  disaster.  <H5>  A Power for Good. </H5>   We promise you that we will find a way to bring peace,  democracy and development to our country."    If you want to help us build a better future, you can do so  by supporting us financially.

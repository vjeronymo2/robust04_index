			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comment letters submitted to the SEC regarding NPROVE have expressed concern that this order processing methodology places limit orders at an unfair disadvantage. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  In particular, these commenters maintain that the limit orders, which provide liquidity to the marketplace at prices inside the best bid or offer, are disadvantaged because market makers can trade through them by taking out the market order at the limit order price within 15 seconds and deprive the limit order of an execution for an indefinite period of time. To address this concern, the NASD is proposing to modify NPROVE to provide that market makers must improve upon the limit order price if they want to execute the matched market order. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, under the proposal, <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  if a limit order is residing in NPROVE priced superior to the best bid or offer, any incoming market order on the opposite side of the market will be repriced to a price equal to the limit order price plus 1/16th of a point in the case of a limit order to buy or the limit order price minus a 1/16th of a point in the case of a limit order to sell. The market order will then be displayed for 15 seconds to all market makers whose current quotation equals the applicable inside quote. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  If no market maker accepts the incoming market order within the 15-second period, the market order will be automatically executed against the limit order at the limit order price. In addition, if adding (subtracting) 1/16th of a point to the price of a limit order to buy (sell) would cause the acceptance price of the market order to sell (buy) to be at or above (below) the current inside offer (bid), then the market order and the limit order will be automatically executed against each other at the limit order price without the participation of a market maker. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  letter from Lawrence R.

In this connection, the NASD notes that one of the cornerstones of the success of Nasdaq's competing dealer system has been the availability of market maker capital to satisfy investors' liquidity demands and that this capital is critically dependent on the ability of market makers to interact with customer order flow. The NASD also notes that the proposal will provide an even greater opportunity for price improvement for market orders matching against limit orders, as market makers will have to accept them at a price at least a 1/16th of a point superior to the price at which they otherwise would have matched against the limit orders. In sum, the NASD believes the proposal significantly enhances the price improvement and limit order protection features of NPROVE and eliminates the possibility that a pending limit order will remain unexecuted while other public customer orders receive executions at the order's limit price, while preserving the liquidity and orderliness of Nasdaq by allowing a minimal, yet essential, opportunity for market makers to interact with retail order flow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Broader Dissemination of NPROVE Limit Order Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD is proposing several amendments to NPROVE and other Nasdaq services to achieve a broader, more detailed dissemination of NPROVE limit order information. The NASD believes these system modifications will facilitate the ability of market participants to readily observe and react to limit orders entered into NPROVE priced better than the inside market, which, in turn, will maximize order interaction in NPROVE and maximize the price improvement and limit order protection benefits available to investors through NPROVE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the NASD proposes to create a separate feed of NPROVE limit order information to vendors. This feed will consist of the price of the highest priced limit order to buy and the price of the lowest priced limit order to sell that are inside the best bid or offer displayed in Nasdaq, along with the aggregate size of all limit orders at such prices. Second, the NASD proposes to modify the ``NPRV'' indicator displayed when a limit order is residing in NPROVE between the spread to indicate which side of the market the limit order is on. Third, the NASD is proposing to modify the functionality of Nasdaq Workstation I and Nasdaq Workstation II so that subscribers can readily obtain information on all limit orders residing in NPROVE, including those limit orders priced within the inside market on Nasdaq. This ready display of NPROVE limit order information will be accomplished with one key stroke in the Nasdaq Workstation I environment and one mouse click in the Nasdaq Workstation II environment. Fourth, the NASD is proposing to develop a separate feed of NPROVE transaction information and limit order information to registered market makers. Specifically,, the feed to the market makers will include all NPROVE orders, cancellations, corrections, and executions. With this information, which is in response to a comment letter received by the SEC regarding NPROVE, <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  market makers will be able to assure their customers that they are receiving the same quality of execution that they would have received had their orders been entered into NPROVE. Accordingly, with this feed, while a market maker's customer order may not interact directly with a limit order in NPROVE, it would benefit indirectly from the existence of the limit order in NPROVE. In sum, the NASD believes these changes will enhance the limit order protection and price improvement benefits available to retail investors through NPROVE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  letter from Leonard Mayer, Vice President &amp; Chief Operating Officer, Mayer &amp; Schweitzer, Inc., to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated July 13, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Modifications to the Processing of Preferenced Limit Orders <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As currently proposed, while preferenced limit orders are able to take advantage of the limit order protection feature of NPROVE, the existence of these orders are known only to the preferenced market makers. Unlike unpreferenced limit orders, when a preferenced market order is entered between the spread, it does not activate the NPROVE limit order indicator and it is not retrievable by other market makers in the summary scan of pending NPROVE limit orders. In addition, when a preferenced limit order is matched against an incoming market order, the matched market order is only displayed to the preferenced market maker for acceptance. Accordingly, in order to afford preferenced limit orders the same opportunity for order interaction that is afforded unpreferenced limit orders, the NASD proposes to amend NPROVE to provide that preferenced limit orders priced within the inside bid or offer on Nasdaq will be processed the same way as unpreferenced limit orders. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  However, once the price of a preferenced limit order to buy (sell) is at or above (below) the inside offer (bid), it will be automatically executed against the preferenced market maker. The NASD also proposes to amend the NPROVE rules to reiterate and clarify that market makers may enter orders into NPROVE on self-preferenced basis and that these orders will be processed like preferenced orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Arguably, only flashing matched market orders to the preferenced market maker may increase the likelihood that the limit order will be executed because the market order is not exposed to multiple market makers for acceptance. It would be inappropriate and confusing to market participants, however, to disseminate information about preferenced limit orders and at the same time preclude investors from interacting with them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (5): Membership still growing - Labour and the trade unions The forced resignation of Mr Stig Malm as head of Sweden's LO blue-collar union federation earlier this month - for his sanctioning of 'golden parachute' pay-off deals for failed executives in union-dominated companies  -has thrown a harsh light on the inner machinations of what remains one of the strongest trade union movements in the world. The scandal was only the last of many involving Mr Malm during his 11 years as LO leader and his departure was met with barely concealed sighs of relief from Sweden's labour establishment who believed he had grown into a serious liability. Previously, Mr Malm had been able to ride out the storms by mobilising support behind himself but this time he found no sympathisers among the rank and file. LO's headquarters was inundated with letters, fax messages and phone calls calling for his dismissal. Mr Malm, already a figure of fun, lost all credibility with the exposure of the enormous gap that exists between the harsh shopfloor realities and the lavish, cushioned world of the nomenklatura. Now the LO executive is looking for his successor and the choice will be put to a special meeting of the LO on February 2 for approval. The Malm affair is unique in Swedish labour history. His predecessors at the LO were sober, modest men of power, vision and responsibility who combined idealism with administrative competence. They built the movement into one of the most respected and influential in the industrialised world. Union leaders wonder whether they can restore the LO to its former pivotal role and they are taking the opportunity presented by Mr Malm's abrupt departure to re-examine the role of organised labour in Sweden and plans its reform. At first sight, the Swedish unions look in reasonable shape. despite the return of mass unemployment, deindustrialisation, and the waning of the old centralised corporatism that made the LO almost an arm of government. Union membership is actually going up at the moment. It rose from 82 per cent to 86 per cent of the employed workforce in the past six years. Compare this with today's official figures of less than 33 per cent in the UK; 34 per cent in Germany; 15 per cent in the US and a mere 8 per cent in France. The huge size of Sweden's organised workforce suggests no social stigma is attached to belonging to a union. Nor is there any hostility to trade unionism among the country's white-collar salariat, with 83 per cent of them organised. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of Swedes regard union membership as a necessary protection at a time of labour market crisis. The reason for this is understandable. The Swedish unions do not only try to provide strong job security for their members in work but they continue to administer the unemployment insurance benefit system as they have done since 1935. Commentators believe that if the unions were ever to lose their key role in the welfare state, their membership would tumble to 50-60 per cent of the employed labour force; the norm in other Scandinavian countries. But other factors in Sweden are perhaps just as important. First and foremost, the country's employers remain strong supporters of workplace trade unionism. While some dislike the political role the unions like to play in national life, they see the value of having unions in their own plants. During the current deep and long recession in Sweden, companies such as Asea Brown-Boveri, Saab, SKF and Atlas Copco have carried through sweeping programmes of workplace rationalisation. Job losses have been heavy but workers and unions have co-operated in the introduction of lean production methods, multi-skilled teams and time-based manufacturing systems aimed at improving cost competitiveness. After a prolonged period of stagnation, the growth in Swedish manufacturing productivity is now the highest in the industrialised world. Employers recognise these radical changes would have been much harder to achieve if they had not enjoyed the whole-hearted support of the unions. In fact, Sweden's unions have a long tradition of accepting technological change. Innovative, not reactive, they have developed internal structures flexible enough to enable them to turn the demands made on them by capital to their own advantage. Such adaptability has made it easier for the Swedish unions to reassess parts of the old model that have grown obsolete. Support for centralised, solidaristic wage bargaining where workers were paid the same level of wages for the same kind of work has waned. There is also much less enthusiasm among the rank and file for retaining close links between the unions and the Social Democratic party The most significant change in collective bargaining this year has been the joint two-year agreement for the first time in the engineering industry that has united the white-collar unions SIF and CF with the metalworkers' union . Such single-table bargaining is likely to spread to other sectors and it may lead to an eventual merger between the LO and the TCO white-collar union federation, particularly as the LO has all but abandoned its old role as central wage bargainer or even pay co-ordinator. There are clear signs of a new consensus emerging in the workplace between capital and labour. Mr Heinrich Blauert, head of VF the engineering employers body, points out: 'In the new agreement, the role of co-operative groups is even more important. This is a step in the right direction.' By enhancing the position of company-based union negotiators in the bargaining process, the employers believe they can establish a more effective basis for keeping down costs. Four joint employer-union working parties are examining the future of Swedish engineering. 'Our approach is low-key,' says Mr Blauert. 'In a peaceful way we are moving to a position where our member companies have the room for manoeuvre in reaching the kind of wage settlements which they want.' There is a more conciliatory tone nowadays among Sweden's employers. The neo-liberal rhetoric of SAF, their main national organisation, is less in evidence. Only limited moves have been made to deregulate the Swedish labour market and rolling back union power remains little more than an aspiration on the far right. A new generation of young union leaders and employers is starting to emerge. They are keen to find a new way of working together. This will not mean any cosy return to the certainties of the old Swedish model. But nor is the country about to see a marginalising of organised labour. In fact, Sweden may turn out to be an example of how organised labour can still have a positive role to play in an open market economy. By accepting the global realities of Sweden's manufacturing companies and embracing new forms of work organisation, the Swedish trade unions may escape the steep decline suffered by trade unions elsewhere.</p>

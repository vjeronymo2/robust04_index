			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Top SIB official to head retail finance watchdog The Personal Investment Authority, the proposed new self-regulatory body for retail financial services, has appointed Ms Colette Bowe, a top official at the City's main watchdog, as its chief executive. Ms Bowe has been group director in charge of retail markets at the Securities and Investments Board since 1991 and has been responsible for communicating the new tougher stance towards the insurance industry set out by SIB chairman Mr Andrew Large. Mr Large has made the creation of the PIA a centrepiece of his plan to improve the effectiveness of the two-tier system of self-regulation as set out by the Financial Services Act. Mr Large has said the PIA must also demonstrably improve the quality of retail investor protection and has set tougher, sometimes controversial standards its members will have to meet. In September, the former chairman of the PIA, Sir Gordon Downey, resigned abruptly and was replaced by SIB board member Mr Joe Palmer. Sir Gordon had been criticised for failing to move swiftly enough to include Mr Large's reforms in a proposed prospectus and for failing to appoint a chief executive. Regulators feared that the authority's board had been plagued by in-fighting, delaying the completion of its proposed rulebook. Ms Bowe, who came to prominence during the Westland helicopter affair in 1986 when she was principal information officer at the Department of Trade and Industry, said she intended to have the PIA running by summer of 1994. 'My aim, with the support of my colleagues, will be to deliver a high standard of investor protection, through a cost-effective regulator,' she said. The main goal for the PIA would be to attract a 'critical mass' of firms applying for membership. The SIB has no power to force firms to join a particular self-regulatory body and there has been concern that too few firms will seek to join the new body. In particular, some members of Fimbra, the self-regulatory body for independent financial advisers, have expressed unhappiness about some aspects of the tough new regime, particularly a requirement for them to have minimum capital of Pounds 10,000. In addition, the life insurance industry has said it will not join unless the banks and building societies which sell life insurance, most of which are currently regulated directly by the SIB, join as well. Mr Lawrence Churchill, chief executive of NatWest Life, said he was 'delighted' by the appointment. 'She is well suited to maintain the communication with the SIB,' he said. However, NatWest Life 'will have to take a look at the prospectus when it is issued and make a judgment about whether to join', he said.</p>

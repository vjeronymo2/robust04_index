			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Tarmac restructures housebuilding side TARMAC, Britain's biggest housebuilder, yesterday unveiled details of a restruc-turing which will mean the loss of 273 jobs from its 3,000-strong housing division and reduce the size of its housebuilding operation by 20 per cent. The group said it planned to shut four of its 20 operating units in the south of England and the Midlands. It also said it planned to reduce the number of sites and show homes, which adversely affect costs. The overall target was to cut working capital by Pounds 100m and sharply reduce overheads. Analysts are estimating an overall reduction of Pounds 18m in overheads to Pounds 54m, and working capital this year of less than Pounds 300m. Mr Sean Bruen of Tarmac said the group aimed to sell just 7,000 homes in 1993, compared with last year's 8,000. The sales in 1992 had been achieved on a total of 350 sites. This was too high a ratio of homes to sites, he said. In 1988, for example, Tarmac had sold more than 12,000 homes from just 270 sites. The group also announced the intended sale of its joinery business, the 11th of 19 planned disposals. Since announcing the disposal programme last spring, Tarmac has sold 10 businesses, for a total of Pounds 150m. The restructuring plan had been announced at the time of the interim results in September, when the group warned of heavy provisions due to property writedowns for the full year. Analysts said the actions had been expected, although some suggested yesterday's details might even dampen the per-sistent bid rumours which have plagued Tarmac for some time. 'The window of opportunity for a bid was in September,' said one analyst. 'This announcement puts flesh on the restructuring.' The housing division, which fuelled Tarmac's rapid growth in the boom years of the 1980s, has been blamed for the group's falling profits in the past two years. Analysts are expecting after tax losses of as much as Pounds 250m for the year ended December 31.</p>

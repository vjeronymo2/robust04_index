			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Letter: Auditors must redefine their profession Sir, By the end of March the auditing profession must decide where it is going by responding to the Auditing Practices Board's vision for the future. The APB suggests the audit should provide more assurance to both management and shareholders on the proper conduct of companies' affairs. But many in the profession suggest the proposals are too radical. They would indeed be a large step for a conservative profession. But they are essential if auditing is to retain its relevance to society. The audit was last defined in the 1947 Companies Act and no longer satisfies public opinion. The status quo is therefore not an option. Those who are unhappy with the APB's proposals should propose an alternative. Without it, there is a serious danger that the role of the audit will be increasingly marginalised. Directors and shareholders need more assurance in an increasingly competitive and complex business world. If my profession does not provide it, ultimately others will fill the void. And, unless the profession demonstrates its vitality, it will be hard to attract talented recruits. Roger Davis, Head of Audit, Coopers &amp; Lybrand</p>

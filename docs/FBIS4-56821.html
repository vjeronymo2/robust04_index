			<p>BFN     [Text] Daniel Ortega Saavedra, secretary general of the  FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front], said yesterday he  does not plan to occupy the presidency in 1996. He also said he  will support a candidate who does not belong to his party, but  who supports the Sandinist program.    In his statements to La Primerisima radio station, Ortega  hinted that he will not accept Sergio Ramirez as the FSLN's  official candidate and confirmed he will support a candidate  with no FSLN ties. Ortega and Ramirez are the leaders of two  divergent currents that are vying for the leadership of the  FSLN. The statements by the current FSLN secretary general  tacitly rule out possible support for Ramirez if he decides to  become his party's presidential candidate as he has publicly  said.    In his visit to the radio station, which shares his  political  views, Ortega pointed out he would like to be reelected  secretary general, adding that it is unhealthy to have several  candidates vying for this post. The FSLN leader said: "Several  candidacies are unhealthy for a revolutionary party; it would be  as though discord were being sown." Such a comment differs from  the results of a poll of Sandinist followers conducted by the  Nicaraguan Study Institute (IEN), which shows that a large  number of FSLN members believes there should be two or more  candidates for the post of secretary general.    Henry Ruiz, who has more votes than Ortega to occupy this  high leadership post, on 2 May agreed to vie for leadership of  the FSLN, which is experiencing one of its worst crises just  before its 20 May Special Congress.    The IEN poll also reveals that the FSLN electorate  represents  only 23 percent of the population: 12 percent in the rural area  and 8 percent from those who never attended school. [figures as  published] In addition, the poll shows that a large number of  Sandinists believes a dictatorship exists within the party.</p>

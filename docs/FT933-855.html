			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Fallacy of pressures for short-term profits Sir, David Waller writes that the listing of Daimler on the New York Stock Exchange is 'likely to influence the way in which the group is managed, putting the management board under greater pressure to generate short-term profit and pay higher dividends to performance-oriented US shareholders' ('Daimler plunges to loss of Pounds 380m', September 18/19). This is a statement frequently made by German industrialists and bankers, and perhaps believed by many boards of management in the Anglo-Saxon countries. But it is contrary to the facts. The Stock Exchanges in London and New York take account of long-term prospects (for large companies at least) and do not like short-term profits if they result from actions detrimental to those long-term prospects. Reinvestment is preferred to dividends if the reinvestment can enhance a company's prospects; a drug company perceived as having inadequate research and development expenditure can certainly be marked down. Fund managers and analysts frequently talk about the short-term prospects, in particular for earnings, but this stems essentially from the fact that the next annual or interim results contain the next important new information concerning a company's future - long term as well as short term. Unfortunately anecdotal evidence of such conversations is given greater weight than the overwhelming body of academic evidence that the markets in the Anglo-Saxon countries take a long-term view and use detailed accounting disclosures appropriately. Another way of giving life to fallacies is to repeat them. David Damant, Credit Suisse Asset Management, Beaufort House, 15 St Botolph Street, London EC3A 7JJ</p>

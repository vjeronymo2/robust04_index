			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Brokers downgrade profit forecast for MFI Furniture COUNTY NatWest Securities, the stockbroker, has cut its profit forecast for MFI Furniture, the retail group coming to the market next month. The issue is being handled by County NatWest's merchant banking side, but the securities division is acting independently in writing research. County NatWest Securities is now forecasting a trading profit of Pounds 86m for the year to April 1993, a reduction from an estimate of Pounds 100m made before the pathfinder prospectus was issued a week ago. The forecast represents a rise of 17.3 per cent over the Pounds 73.3m reported for the 1991-92 financial year. Despite the reduced forecast, the broker still regards the shares as 'one of the more attractive and safer recovery stocks in the sector'. It says its 1993 forecast indicates a price of 145p, and advises clients to buy a full weighting in the shares at up to 150p. At that price the market value of the group would be Pounds 872m. The pathfinder prospectus indicated that the group's sales were currently flat. This caused the broker to cut its prediction for sales growth in the current financial year from 10 per cent to 6 per cent. In turn that led to the lower trading profit forecast. County NatWest Securities is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 77m, excluding exceptional charges of Pounds 26m relating to interest on the group's debt before the flotation and a bonus being paid to management. It also forecasts earnings per share of 8.9p, which would be an increase of 18.7 per cent over the pro-forma figure of 7.5p for 1991-92 shown in the pathfinder prospectus.</p>

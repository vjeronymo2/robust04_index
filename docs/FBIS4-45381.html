In the largest-ever seizure of  Indian manufactured heroin, the narcotics cell of the city  police recently seized 11 kg of the drug, valued at Rs 22 lakhs  in the Indian market, and Rs 15 crores in the international  markets.    This seizure of heroin, the third in the city within a  month,  strengthens the suspicion that the trafficking in Indian heroin  is a rapidly growing component of the drugs trade whose terminus  is Bombay.    Acting on a tip-off, the police arrested Mohammed Usman  Gulam  Husein Chhipa, 35, a resident of Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh, at  Cotton Green, with 23 packets of the drug. He was on his way to  deliver it to a customer.    Interrogation has revealed that the drug was supplied to him  by Mohammed Ahsan, a well-known dealer in the illicit drug  trade. Ahsan, granted bail by the Madras high court in a DRI  [Directorate of Revenue Intelligence] case involving a 300-kg  seizure of opium, visited that city last month. He is now  absconding, according to the Madhya Pradesh police.    "Greed," is Usman's one-word reply, when asked what made him  do it. He is a garment dealer. He used to purchase used clothes  in Bhendi Bazaar and sell them in Mandsaur, and has been a  carrier for the last eight or ten months. "Through the grace of  God, I was comfortably off. But it was sheer greed that led me  into this." The load he was arrested with was the largest he had  carried. Previously he had only carried around five kg.    According to Usman, the contraband was to be delivered on  April 27, by a truckdriver named Rashid. However, the delivery  was delayed because Rashid's truck broke down along the way, and  Usman finally received it on May 4. It was to be delivered by  him to two men, identified only as Fazal and Ravi, both  residents of Kanjarpada in Agripada.    His interrogation has given the police tantalising clues to  an ongoing territory squabble between two groups of M.P. drug  dealers. Ahsan is stated to be in competition with one Fazal  over which group will supply the gangsters who run the Agripada  distribution network.    "Earlier the drug used to be rough and granular," says the  deputy commissioner of police in charge of the narcotic cell,  Mr. Rahul Rai-Sur. "Now it is smoother and more powdery. That  indicates a greater degree of refinement, and therefore, the  increasing technical expertise of the clandestine chemists  operating there."    Mr. Sur estimated that about 110 kg of opium probably went  into the manufacture of the present load. In Mandsaur district,  he said, there were as many as 68,000 cultivators of the poppy,  and a total of 6,800 hectares under cultivation.    One of the earlier seizures consisted of a load of two kgs  of  heroin, seized from a chawl in Kurla. In that case Rafiq  Mohammed Jullaiya, and Abdul Hamid Mansuri, were arrested. It  was revealed to have been manufactured in Ujjain. The other  load, of 2.2 kgs, worth around Rs 4.4 lakhs, originated in  Chittorgarh in Rajasthan. A man and a woman, from Jogeshwari and  Santa Cruz, respectively, were arrested. It was learnt that the  drug had been bought from two residents of Jawra, also in M.P.,  Irad Khan and Ramesh. Irad Khan has been arrested by a police  team.</p>

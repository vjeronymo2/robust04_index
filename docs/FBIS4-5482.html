			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu and Hans Blix, chief of the U.N.'s nuclear  monitoring agency, agreed Tuesday [12 April] that North Korea  must permit the completion of inspections initiated last month  on its suspect nuclear program. Han, on a weeklong diplomatic  mission to Russia, Britain, and Belgium, arrived in Tokyo on  Tuesday and met with Blix, director general of the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who is here for a forum starting  Wednesday in Hiroshima on the peaceful uses of atomic energy.    Blix and Han, during their hour-long meeting, studied  Pyongyang's response to the U.N. Security Council's March 31  presidential statement urging North Korea to comply with the  nuclear safeguards accord and permit the conclusion of the  checks, the South Korean Embassy in Japan said.    The IAEA has said two weeks of inspections in March were  insufficient to decide whether Pyongyang has diverted nuclear  materials for weapons purposes as alleged by the United States  and other Western nations.    North Korea says it has fully complied with inspection  criteria previously agreed upon and maintains its nuclear  program serves strictly civilian purposes.    The nuclear row will top Han's agenda in Moscow, where he  will meet Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and other  government leaders from Wednesday through Friday.    "I expect Moscow to bring up its earlier proposal for an  eight-way conference on the North Korean nuclear issue and I  will explain Seoul's position," YONHAP NEWS AGENCY quoted Han as  saying before departure. Moscow has suggested that both Koreas,  China, the U.S., Russia, Japan, the United Nations and the IAEA  try to resolve the nuclear controversy through a special  conference.    According to YONHAP, Han said Seoul welcomes the Russian  proposal but prefers that the U.N. handle the North Korean issue  for the time being.    Han is scheduled to meet British Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd in London on Saturday and will return to Seoul next Monday  after attending a two-day conference of South Korean mission  chiefs in Brussels.</p>

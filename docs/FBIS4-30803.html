			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 31 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces seized  back control of a cannon that was under UN supervision in the  exclusion zone around Sarajevo "in violation" of the NATO  ultimatum, a UN military spokesman said Tuesday. The 105-mm.  artillery gun was at a site where heavy weapons had been rounded  up in Krivoglavci, in a Serb-controlled zone northwest of  Sarajevo, said Major Rob Annink, spokesman for the UN Protection  Force (UNPROFOR). The site was a designated "weapon collection  point" within the 20 kilometer (12-miles) exclusion zone for  heavy arms imposed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  around the capital, he said.    UNPROFOR "immediately" contacted the Bosnian Serb military  headquarters in Lukavica, a southwestern Sarajevo suburb, which  said the cannon had been taken Monday at "the initiative of a  local commander," according to the major. The Serb command said  they would investigate the incident. A UN forces patrol noticed  the weapon was missing early Monday evening. "It's a violation  of the ultimatum" ordered by NATO to neutralize the Sarajevo  zone under threat of air strikes. He also said that UNPROFOR was  trying to consolidate the number of weapon collection points to  facilitate monitoring.    In another incident, Serb forces Tuesday were holding five  people including a UN employee they detained around midday  Monday at a Serb checkpoint at Kasindolska on the road to  Sarajevo airport, the major said. He said UNPROFOR was  negotiating to try to obtain their release, identifying the  other four as a local employee of the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR), and three local people with "a press card."    The situation was unchanged in the rest of the country, with  fighting continuing in the Travnik region in western Bosnia  where the mainly Moslem Bosnian army was trying to take control  of a strategic Serb-held hill overlooking the city, the Vlasic  plateau. "We have reports of fierce artillery fighting in the  area of Donji Vakuf and Prusac," southest of Travnik, the  spokesman said. Annink said there were also reports of eight  shots from Serb tanks in the area of the strategic Brcko  corridor against the village of Brka, a Bosnian Moslem position  to the south. The Serbs are trying to gain control of the  corridor, barely three kilometers (1.5 miles) wide at its  narrowest point, to link territories they have won in Croatia  and northwestern Bosnia with their conquests in eastern Bosnia  right up to Serbia. Fighting was also reported in Mostar in the  south.    On Monday, UNPROFOR said the UN-controlled Tuzla airport in  the northeast was shelled as Serb forces counter-attacked in  northern Bosnia in a bid to halt a push westwards by the  Moslem-dominated Bosnian army. In Gorazde, southeast of the  capital, UN workers are still facing "restrictions" of their  freedom of movement in certain areas inside the 20-kilometer  exclusion zone around the city. Shots were fired at a team of  UN engineers there without anyone getting hurt, but the source  of the fire could not be determined, the spokesman said. A UNHCR  spokesman said no aid convoy had yet managed to reach the  southern part of the Moslem enclave at Bihac in the west since  May 17.</p>

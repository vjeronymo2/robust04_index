			<p>BFN     [Text] Talking to the leader of the CSCE Moldovan mission  Richard Samuel in Kishinev [Chisinau], Moldovan President Mircea  Snegur pointed to the need for continued CSCE activities in his  republic.    According to Snegur, Kishinev [Chisinau] and Tiraspol based  dialog on the CSCE Moldovan mission's advice for stability in  Transdniestria.    The multi-party elections of 27 March, said Snegur, and the  victory, in the elections, of a centrist-oriented party, made  the solution of the Transdniestrian problem possible.    Snegur and Richard Samuel met in the runup to next week's  session of the CSCE's standing council which is to concentrate  on the extension of the Moldovan mission's mandate.</p>

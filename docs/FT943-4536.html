			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Wilson (Connolly) warns on costs Mr Ian Black, managing director of the housebuilder Wilson (Connolly) Holdings, warned yesterday that 'inflationary evidence has appeared in the costs of labour and materials, which has not yet been reflected in increased house prices.' Mr Black added that in the last eight months labour and material costs had risen on average by 8 per cent, including a 15 per cent increase in the price of bricks and concrete blocks. Bricklayers, he said, were being paid between 10 and 20 per cent more. Nevertheless, a 9 per cent increase in the number of homes sold by its Wilcon Homes subsidiary helped push up group pre-tax profits by 62 per cent. In the six months to June 30, pre-tax profits stood at Pounds 13.3m (Pounds 8.2). The housing division contributed Pounds 13.3m (Pounds 7.8m) and Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 39,000) came from property. Construction incurred a loss of Pounds 1.15m, against profits of Pounds 221,000. Turnover advanced 24 per cent to Pounds 127m (Pounds 102m) with the strongest growth in housing, which had sales of Pounds 105m (Pounds 88.5m). 'Our planned volume growth in a low inflationary economy is showing signs of success,' Mr Black said. However, a strong first quarter had been followed by 'an easing off in the rate of recovery.' Mr Black expected that house prices would rise only marginally, keeping pace with inflation. His warnings affected the share price, which fell 15p to 213p. Mr Black said margins had improved from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, mainly due to a higher proportion of sales of larger units. The average selling price was Pounds 58,000 compared with Pounds 54,500. He said he expected the trend in sales, up 9 per cent to 1,750, to remain the same. An interim dividend of 1.36p (1.27p) was announced, on earnings of 4.7p (2.9p). The landbank stood at 14,400 plots at the end of June. Net cash was Pounds 25m. Following the losses in the construction division, the company is withdrawing from external contracting. COMMENT Wilson Connolly's concerns about higher labour and material costs made the market nervous. It had assumed cost increases had been held at about 3 or 4 per cent rather than the 8 per cent indicated by Mr Black. With an operating margin target of 14 per cent, the company is beginning to reach its peak. However, it remains a benchmark for quality in the sector and is soundly managed. With profit forecasts of Pounds 36m for 1994 and a prospective p/e of more than 16, it's all in the price.</p>

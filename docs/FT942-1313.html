			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Canadian group buys polyols units from ICI ICI, the international chemicals group, is to sell some of its North American operations to Harrowston, a Toronto-based company which emerged from the ashes of the fallen Belzberg family empire. Harrowston declined to reveal terms but said the deal would be all cash. The deal involves ICI's polyols businesses and includes a factory in Delaware which makes a wide range of polyhydric alcohols used in the pharmaceutical, oral care and confectionery markets. The deal remains subject to US regulatory approvals and completion of detailed negotiations. Harrowston's chief executive is Mr Brent Belzberg, nephew of Mr Sam Belzberg who made a name in the 1980s as one of North America's most formidable corporate raiders. The Belzbergs' empire, linked through the First City Financial group, was hit by several loss-making investments and the slump in real estate markets. Harrowston was created from First City's remnants in the early 1990s and recapitalised by a group of large Canadian institutional investors. The Belzberg family no longer has a stake in the company, beyond a small shareholding and options held by Mr Brent Belzberg. As in its latest deal, Harrowston's strategy is to buy businesses put on the block as part of the rationalisation of much larger companies. It has bought ICI's North American sulphur products division as well as a small division of Du Pont, the US chemicals group, and a retail meat distributor.</p>

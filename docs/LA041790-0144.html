			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CLEMSON GETS NCAA RECAP ON VIOLATIONS  </P> <P> Clemson officials have received the case summary of the NCAA investigation into  the school's football program and are preparing for their hearing before the  Committee on Infractions in Kansas City on Friday.  </P> <P> A case summary is a compilation of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s  allegations, the university's response and the NCAA enforcement staff's  response to the Clemson response. It provides all the parties an indication of  the issues to be discussed in the hearing.  </P> <P> "We're ready to get on with it," said Nick Lomax, university vice president for  student affairs. "To say I'm glad the day is here, no; we wish it had never  happened. But we're ready to deal with it and get it behind us."  </P> <P> The 10-man Clemson entourage going to the hearing will include former head  football coach Danny Ford and his attorney, Thomas McCutchen Sr. of Columbia.  Ford resigned as the head coach Jan. 18.  </P> <P> New head football coach Ken Hatfield is also scheduled to attend, as are  university President Max Lennon, athletic director Bobby Robinson, senior  associate athletic director Dwight Rainey, faculty athletics representative B.  J. Skelton and two university counsels, Ben Anderson and Paul Aaron.  </P> <P> D. Alan Williams, chairman of the Committee on Infractions and the faculty  athletics representative at the University of Virginia, has resigned from  hearing the case to avoid a potential conflict of interest.  </P> <P> Virginia and Clemson are members of the Atlantic Coast Conference. If the ACC  decides to impose other penalties on Clemson after the NCAA's action, Williams  would have a vote in that.  </P> <P> His decision to step aside leaves five members to rule on the Clemson case,  with Milton R. Schroeder, a professor of law at Arizona State University and  the next senior member of the committee, serving as chairman.  </P> <P> The committee is expected to announce a decision on the Clemson case within  three weeks.  </P> <P> In a letter dated Jan. 4, the NCAA charged the Clemson football program with 14  rules violations ranging from cash payments to players of between $50 and $150  to improper recruiting techniques.  </P> <P> Since then, one charge has been dropped and two others have been amended.  </P> <P> Neither Robinson nor Lomax would say whether any other charges were dropped or  amended in the case summary, but Lomax said the summary "clarified" the  allegations.  </P> <P> "We have done our best to this point, not only in what we have provided in  written form, but also our oral presentation," Lomax said. "We will have done  all we can do by the time we leave Kansas City."  </P> <P> Clemson officials would not speculate on the outcome of Friday's hearing.  </P> <P> "After seeing some of the other reports (of committee decisions), I couldn't  speculate," Lomax said.  </P> <P> The University of Maryland basketball program received severe penalties despite  university officials being confident that they had cooperated with  investigators.  </P></p>

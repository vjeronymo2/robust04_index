			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It is better late than never. After several hours  of negotiations, political leaders of the five parties that form  the current government have finally managed to make a  breakthrough towards the establishment of the remaining  transitional institutions. A marathon meeting interrupted by a  brief pause at 1830 discussed the problem of the functioning of  the government led by Madame Agathe Uwilingiyimana, and the  obstacles to the establishment of the national assembly and the  transitional government extended to include the Rwandan  Patriotic Front [RPF].    Two meetings -- since there had to be two -- on 25 February  and 27 February were led by President Juvenal Habyarimana in the  presence of the two prime ministers, Agathe Uwilingiyimana and  Faustin Twagiramungu. The meeting concluded with a communique  whose contents are read to us by the principal secretary at the  presidency of the Republic, Enoch Ruhigira.    [Begin recording] President Juvenal Habyarimana chaired  meetings on 25 and 27 February, which brought together the  political parties which form the current transitional  government, namely the Republican National Movement for  Democracy and Development, the Republican Democratic Movement  [MDR], the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic  Party, and the Liberal Party [PL].    Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana and Prime  Minister-Designate Faustin Twagiramungu participated in the two  meetings, which studied the problem of the functioning of the  current government led by Madame Agathe Uwilingiyimana as well  as the obstacles hampering the establishment of the transitional  institutions.    Concerning the functioning of the current government, it was  stated that so long as the transitional broad-based government  has not been put in place, the current government must continue  functioning through ministerial council meetings in order to  tackle the challenges facing our country, particularly the  problems relating to security and the problem of establishing  transitional institutions.    In regard to obstacles to the establishment of the  transitional institutions, the 27 February meeting reached the  following conclusions in order to help come up with a solution  enabling the MDR and PL parties to participate in the  institutions:    Concerning the MDR, the list of deputies is that established  on 5 January, with reservations concerning cases pending in  court and the settlement that will ensue.    Concerning the ministers, [words indistinct] on the MDR  side,  will be entitled to two ministers chosen from a list to be  presented to the prime minister-designate, while Prime  Minister-Designate Faustin Twagiramungu will be entitled to one  ministerial portfolio.    Concerning the PL party, the Mugenzi faction will nominate  five deputies from its ranks, while the Ndasingwa faction will  choose six. Concerning ministers, the Mugenzi faction will have  two while the Ndasingwa faction will have one and will provide  candidates for the post of transitional national assembly  speaker. Landwald Ndasingwa expressed reservations about the  (?proposal), notably on the distribution of ministries.    Any faction not satisfied by the above compromise will draw  lessons from the conclusions reached and will assume liability.  [sentence as heard]    The two PL factions will send the final lists of deputies to  the president of the Republic and the prime minister by 1900 on  28 February at the latest.    The prime minister-designate will present the list of  ministerial candidates to the president of the Republic by 1200  on 1 March.    The establishment of the transitional institutions will take  place at a date to be jointly agreed upon with the RPF.    Signed in Kigali on 27 February 1994. Thank you. [end  recording]</p>

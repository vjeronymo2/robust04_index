			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 2 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government decided to expand military exchanges with Japan,  informed sources said on Saturday [2 April].    Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae will visit Japan on April 25  for the first time as Korean defense minister and will have a  meeting with the Japanese defense minister.    Both ministers are to discuss military exchanges between the  two countries.    "The people's feeling has banned military exchanges between  Seoul and Tokyo so far, but Yi's visit to Japan will be a  momentum to activate military exchanges between the two  countries," a government official said.    It is highly likely that navy ships of both countries will  visit each other as early as this year, the official said.    Meanwhile, the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Yi Yang-ho,  who accompanied President Kim Yong-sam's visit to Japan and  China, met with Japanese military leaders in Tokyo to discuss  North Korea's nuclear problem and measures for a possible  missile attack from Pyongyang.</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / DC fails in bid for statehood Supporters of statehood for the District of Columbia were yesterday claiming a symbolic victory even after the House of Representatives voted down a proposal to bestow full democracy on the nation's capital. Sunday's 277-153 vote came as no surprise. Only one Republican supported statehood, along with about 60 per cent of the Democrats voting. In reality, the prospects of DC ever gaining full independence, meaning two senators and at least one House member as well as greater financial autonomy, never stood a chance. The capital's budget is still mostly determined by Congress, supplemented by local property and sales taxes. Its mayor and city council are elected by popular franchise, as is the delegate it sends to the House, whose vote, however, is not counted if a result hangs on it. The 600,000 residents do vote in presidential elections, however. Mr Jesse Jackson, a leader of the statehood movement, complained the White House had not worked hard enough for the lobbying campaign, though President Bill Clinton is on record as supporting independence. But the DC delegate, Mrs Eleanor Holmes Norton, said she was 'ready to declare victory right now', mostly because the House debate was the first time either chamber had considered statehood in full session. The principal Republican objection is a natural aversion to creating two new senators, both very likely to be liberal Democrats and probably black.</p>

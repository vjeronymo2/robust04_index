			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Company failures at lowest for 18 months THE NUMBER of companies passing into administration and receivership in May fell to the lowest level for 18 months. Figures compiled from the official London and Edinburgh gazettes by Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, show that banks made 358 insolvency appointments last month, compared with 389 in March and 527 in February. The previous low was 325 in December 1990. Mr Christopher Morris, head of corporate special services at Touche Ross, said the lower numbers probably reflected the bottoming out of the recession. There were grounds for 'cautious optimism' on the number of future corporate failures. In the first five months of this year there were 2,306 appointments of receivers or administrators, compared with 2,432 for the same period last year. Coopers &amp; Lybrand received 345 appointments, Peat Marwick 271 and Ernst &amp; Young 195. The bank appointing most insolvency practitioners was National Westminster with 482.</p>

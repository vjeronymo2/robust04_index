			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Drop in US jobless fuels pressure for rise in rates Strong job creation last month cut the US unemployment rate to its lowest level in four years, prompting speculation that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates again this month to cool the economy. The Labour Department said non-farm payroll employment expanded by 350,000 in November, bringing the unemployment rate down to 5.6 per cent from 5.8 per cent in October and 6.7 per cent at the start of the year. The number of unemployed has fallen by 1.4m since January to 7.3m. Although comparisons with earlier years are difficult because of a radical change this year in the way data are collected, an unemployment rate below 5.6 per cent was last recorded in 1990. The employment figures gave a fillip to the dollar which broke through the Y100 level for the first time in two months on speculation of an interest rate increase. In late trading in New York last night, the dollar was one yen higher at Y100.6 and more than half a pfennig up against the D-Mark at DM1.5800. The stronger dollar also helped the bond market, where prices of long-term government securities surged. The benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond ended up more than a point, yielding 7.9 per cent. The rally in bonds prompted some late buying of stocks yesterday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 44.75 at 3,745.62. The strength of the employment market in November led some Wall Street economists to warn that the Fed might decide that last month's three-quarters of a percentage point increase in short-term interest rates will not be enough to slow the economy to a pace that can be sustained without an acceleration of inflation. Even before yesterday's fall, most Fed governors believed that unemployment was at, or below, the 'natural rate' at which they could expect wage pressures to build. Fed officials say they want to slow the economy to a sustainable growth rate of about 2.5 per cent a year, but the Commerce Department this week said that the economy grew at a 3.9 per cent pace in the third quarter. Although the view is now spreading that the Fed could raise rates as early as December 20, most economists still expect the move next year. A conflicting signal about the strength of the US economy came from the index of leading economic indicators, which the Commerce Department said yesterday had fallen in October for the first time in 15 months.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Martin S. Lambeck commentary: "NATO's Response"] </F>   [Text] By downing four Serb combat aircraft, the Western  alliance addressed the right signal to the Serbs. The intruders  had been asked several times to turn away from the no-fly zone.  They did, however, not take the combat planes seriously, just  as the Western alliance has often been ridiculed over the past  weeks.    This might have changed since yesterday's downings: The  Bosnian Serbs know now that NATO means business. The fact that  in this first NATO air strike on Bosnia, the AWACS planes had  German crew members on board has answered all questions as to  what would happen if German staff were on board radar  reconnaissance planes in a similar case. They helped enforce UN  Resolution 816 in a NATO military strike.    Thus, there is hope that all warring parties in Bosnia have  realized that the international community will no longer watch  the killing and blocking of aid without taking action. What  will have to follow is an active policy of humanitarian aid on  the part of the United Nations.    The time has now come to get aid convoys for the starving  population on their way. And they will have to be forced  through, if necessary. This is the only way the international  community and NATO can take the initiative in hand. And this  would be the first step on the way to achieving tangible results.</p>

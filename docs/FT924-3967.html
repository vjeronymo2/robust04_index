			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Hanson It is perhaps surprising that Hanson has managed to uncover Pounds 1.2bn of value in its newly acquired US aggregates business which had escaped the attention of the normally gimlet-eyed Mr Brian Beazer. At the same time, the Pounds 1.7bn of provisions against the Beazer acquisition is also substantial, even in the context of the business's Pounds 765m of environmental liabilities. Both figures may surprise the City, which had been expecting Hanson to move away from the extensive use of acquisition accounting as it places greater emphasis on the development of its core businesses. On the basis of yesterday's full-year figures it may take the company a little longer to divest itself of its image as an aggressive asset trader. Those core businesses are clearly showing the strain of recession. Granted, the company is right to stress the quality of its middle management and its financial controls. But there must be questions about how much additional value can be squeezed from the basic cyclical businesses under Hanson's care. It is also questionable what kind of value the market is prepared to attach to such an operation. That is all the more important since recently so many of Hanson's mooted acquisitions have run into the sand. It would be unfortunate indeed if the company really had lost its dealing touch with the outlook for core earnings growth still poor. The new accounting standards may make it easier for an outsider to interpret what is going on inside Hanson. The view, however, may not be as enticing as it once was.</p>

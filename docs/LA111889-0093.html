			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SABERHAGEN GETS 3-YEAR EXTENSION WORTH $8.9 MILLION FROM ROYALS  </P> <P> Bret Saberhagen has been given a three-year contract extension worth $8.9  million by the Kansas City Royals, making him the highest-paid player in  baseball, it was learned Friday.  </P> <P> Saberhagen could have become a free agent after next season had the Royals not  given him the contract extension, which runs from 1991 through '93.  </P> <P> The 25-year-old right-hander will earn $2.75 million in both 1991 and '92 and  $2.8 million in '93. He also got a $600,000 signing bonus, pushing the total to  $8.9 million.  </P> <P> The Dodgers' Orel Hershiser is in the middle of a three-year, $7.9-million  contract. Hershiser made $2.4 million in 1989 and will get $1.6 million next  season and $2.8 million in 1991. Hershiser got a $1.1-million signing bonus.  </P> <P> The Dodgers' Eddie Murray, in the final two years of a five-year deal, will  make $2.7 million in 1990 and $2.8 million in 1991. Murray's average salary  during the length of his contract is $2.5 million.  </P> <P> Saberhagen, 23-6 last season after winning 20 of his last 22 games, had the  option year of his contract, 1990, picked up shortly after the season ended. He  will be paid $1.4 million in 1990.  </P> <P> Saberhagen, who starred as a pitcher and shortstop at Cleveland High School in  Reseda, was named the American League Cy Young Award winner Wednesday. He also  won the award in 1985.  </P> <P> Kansas City recently signed 15-game winner Mark Gubicza to a three-year  contract through 1992, meaning the Royals now have their top two pitchers  locked up through the '92 season.  </P> <P> "We are delighted that Bret's career with the Royals will continue well into  the future," General Manager John Schuerholz said. "He has established himself  as one of the top pitchers in major league baseball and this contract reflects  that."  </P></p>

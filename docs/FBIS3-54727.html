			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ukrinform correspondents Viktor Demidenko and Aleksandr </F> Litvinov for TASS]    [Text] Kiev, 30 Dec -- In an interview with Ukrinform and  Gosteleradio correspondents, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk  described 1993 as the year in which Ukraine began a transition  to new forms of economic life.    Although there were many mistakes and miscalculations, he  admitted, "Ukraine has not slid into the abyss, as some would  have us believe." The fall in national income was 5 percent  less than last year, and the decline in manufacturing slowed  down. The country's industry produced a greater quantity of  electric locomotives, special-purpose cisterns, power equipment,  generators, wood working machines, and other goods. Farmers  also had a good year, gathering 45.6 million quintals per  hectare, considerably more than in 1992. The milk yield also  increased.    Leonid Kravchuk described an agreement on prices and volumes  of fuel deliveries to Ukraine signed with Russia and  Turkmenistan as a positive step in the right direction.    In the interview he paid a considerable attention to the  upcoming elections of people's deputies. The president  expressed confidence that people would be able to come grips  with the situation and, bearing in mind the pre-election  campaign in Russia, would elect truly worthy and experienced  politicians.    Taking about the most pressing tasks for the upcoming year,  Leonid Kravchuk expressed confidence that Ukraine would be able  to meet its targets for nuclear disarmament and to resolve the  problem of the Black Sea Fleet in a civilized manner with  Russia. The main thing for us, the president stressed, is "that  there should be peace, tranquility, and confidence in the future  in this common home of ours which we call Earth."</p>

The U.S. Administration  demands exact minimum import quotas for certain U.S. products  from the Japanese in Tokyo. The Japanese Government rejects  this. It is understandable that in the long run the United  States is concerned about the horrendous Japanese trade  surpluses with their own country. However, it is not convincing  to claim again and again that the Japanese market is closed.  Since the European auto industry sold altogether 1.1 million  vehicles in Japan by the end of last year, the reasons for the  failure of the U.S. automakers to sell more U.S. cars in Japan  are to be found elsewhere. One cannot talk of free world trade  if products that are hard to sell are to be pressed into a  market in the form of minimum import quotas, as the U.S.  Administration is trying to do in Japan. At the same time, one  must not fail to see that every solution to that effect finally  has to burden suppliers from third countries -- that is, exactly  the European industry. Minimum import quotas are a bad relapse  into foreign trade regulated by the state.</p>

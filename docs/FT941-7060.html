			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Stronger market aids Mallett Mallett, the art and antiques dealer, saw pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 double from Pounds 519,000 to Pounds 1.04m on turnover ahead 21 per cent at Pounds 9.89m, against Pounds 8.17m. The result was struck after crediting net interest receivable of Pounds 3,000 against a charge of Pounds 175,000 in 1992. Despite a small decrease in sales in the second half, the company had found that the market was now stronger and prices firmer. An increased final dividend of 2.5p brings the total to 3p (2p). Earnings per share came out at 5.27p (2.52p).</p>

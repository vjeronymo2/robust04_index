			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> 'CLEAN' SMOG SEASON CREDITED TO WEATHER;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: AIR QUALITY IN AUGUST, USUALLY THE WORST MONTH FOR POLLUTION,  VIOLATED FEDERAL HEALTH STANDARDS ONLY THREE DAYS.  </P> <P> The air during the 1990 smog season will probably be the cleanest since the  Ventura County Air Pollution Control District began monitoring air quality in  1973, district officials said.  </P> <P> The county's air in August, which is usually the smoggiest month of the year,  violated federal health standards on only three days, all in Simi Valley, the  county's smoggiest city. In July, county air was unhealthful on only two days,  twice in Simi Valley and once in Ojai.  </P> <P> Overall, the county's air has violated the federal standards on only nine days  so far this year. Simi Valley accounted for eight of the days, with the  county's coastline escaping smog violation days completely.  </P> <P> The summer smog season lasts from May to October. Typically, low clouds and  warm inversion layers trap pollutants near the ground, and there are 40 to 60  smoggy days in the county, said Herman Ragsdale, air quality specialist at the  Air Pollution Control District's data center. About 80% of the smoggy days,  which are defined in terms of ozone levels, usually occur before September.  Preliminary figures for 1989 show that there were 16 smog violation days in  July and two in August.  </P> <P> "But even if we have a typical September and October, we will still have the  cleanest year," Ragsdale said. "We would not expect more than about 15 smoggy  days in September and October, and that would still put us at half the norm."  </P> <P> However, late September and October typically bring warm Santa Ana winds that  blow pollutants in from the Simi and San Fernando valleys, district  meteorologist Kent Field said.  </P> <P> "But this is not a typical year," Field said.  </P> <P> Field said new Air Pollution Control District regulations have reduced  emissions in recent years but deserve only a small part of the credit for the  unusually clean air.  </P> <P> "We haven't seen a drastic reduction in emissions," he said. "No, this air is  due to the weather."  </P> <P> Unusual weather patterns this summer have brought light winds and weak, dry  inversion layers that do not trap pollutants, he said. That has allowed the  pollutants that cause ozone to disperse into the air, he said.  </P> <P> Field said he could not predict if the weather patterns that have kept ozone  levels to a minimum will hold through September and October.  </P> <P> The same exceptionally low smog levels have prevailed in the sprawling South  Coast Air Quality Management District, which includes Los Angeles, Orange,  Riverside and San Bernardino counties, district reports show.  </P> <P> The AQMD does not measure smog in terms of unhealthful days. Instead, it  measures federal health standard violations at 26 monitoring stations in the  area. Thus, many stations might have violations on a given day. The South Coast  District recorded 1,798 ozone violations from May through July. There were  3,283 such violations in all of 1989 and 3,416 in 1988.  </P> <P> Ozone, a primary ingredient of smog, is formed when nitrogen oxide reacts with  hydrocarbons in sunlight. Motor vehicles in Ventura County account for more  than half the nitrogen oxide in the air, and Southern California Edison's power  plants and the oil industry produce about 40%.  </P> <P> Motor vehicles produce more than 40% of hydrocarbons and are the largest single  source. But engines used by the oil industry for pumping as well as industrial  and agriculture solvents combine to produce 55% of hydrocarbons in Ventura  County's air.  </P> <P> Air Pollution Control District regulations have forced a 25% to 30% decrease in  emissions over the past 10 years that has steadily improved air quality,  district officials said.  </P> <P> Richard Baldwin, the county's top air pollution control official, said emission  levels are expected to continue to decrease gradually until the county meets  federal clean air standards sometime in 10 to 20 years. The federal government  sets the health standard at .12 parts per million of ozone.  </P> <P> State guidelines, which are stricter, say that any ozone concentration above  .09 parts per million is unhealthful. A first-stage smog alert is called when  ozone concentrations hit .20.  </P> <P> Ozone is an irritant that attacks the respiratory system and can cause lung  tissue damage, according to the American Lung Assn.  </P> <P> Baldwin warned that the clean-air summer of 1990 could change drastically with  weather conditions.  </P> <P> "If we had a horrible heat wave, we could still have poor air quality. The only  difference is that it would have been worse without the emission reductions,"  he said.  </P> <P> Ventura County has never had second- or third-stage smog alerts, which are more  severe than first-stage alerts, but it did have three days of first-stage  alerts in April. It was the first time in eight years the county had had a smog  alert.  </P> <P> In that unusual episode, winds pushed polluted air over the ocean. A low  inversion layer trapped the air mass and the sun baked it for four days. When  the hot Santa Ana winds cooled, other winds kicked in and blew the pollution  back over Ventura, causing a dim gray film to settle over the coast.  </P> <P> The dirty air mass later moved east into Simi Valley, where it backed up  against hills that surround the valley and caused smog alerts there.  </P></p>

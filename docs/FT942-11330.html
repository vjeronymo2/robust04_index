			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Government and rebels to restart peace talks The Mexican government and Zapatista rebels said yesterday they would reopen peace talks aimed at formally ending the conflict in the southern state of Chiapas, Damian Fraser writes from Mexico City. Mr Manuel Camacho, the government peace negotiator in Chiapas, met leaders of the Zapatista movement at a secret location in the Chiapas jungle on Wednesday afternoon. A joint statement pledged to push on with peace efforts, but no date was given for a start to new negotiations. The Zapatistas launched their rebellion on New Year's Day, pressing for land reform, indigenous peoples' rights and more democracy. The government and the Zapatistas last met on March 2, when the government presented a peace offer. The Zapatistas have still not responded formally to it, and temporarily broke off consultations with their supporters on their response after the assassination of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party's presidential candidate, Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio. In recent weeks tensions in Chiapas have eased as peasants have largely ended land invasions that led to violent confrontation with rich landowners. Mr Ernesto Zedillo, chosen to replace Mr Colosio as the PRI's presidential candidate, was in Chiapas yesterday, and gave unconditional support to the peace process.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: GBL seeks alternative BBL bid GROUPE BRUXELLES Lambert (GBL), the Belgian holding company, is still searching for an alternative solution to the likely Dutch bid for Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), the bank in which it has a 13 per cent stake. GBL yesterday also announced that its consolidated profit for the first half of 1992 had slipped from BFr6.01bn to BFr5.03bn (Dollars 158m). Excluding capital gains and exceptional results, profit was almost static at BFr2.98bn, compared with BFr2.91bn. The holding company is at the centre of speculation over the future of BBL, the accounts of which are being examined by Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING), a Dutch banking and insurance company which wants to make a full bid. Some 24 per cent of BBL is directly or indirectly controlled by GBL, which believes the proposed offer of BFr3,600 a share undervalues the bank. GBL said yesterday that it did not want to predict now what its attitude might be if a bid were launched. The company said its results had been affected by several elements, including the drop in profits at Petrofina, the Belgian oil company, in which GBL has a 20 per cent stake, although this was compensated by profit increases from other portfolio companies, most notably CLT, the Luxembourg-based media group. GBL warned against attempting to estimate the full-year performance from half-year figures which are affected by the seasonal nature of some of the portfolio revenue.</p>

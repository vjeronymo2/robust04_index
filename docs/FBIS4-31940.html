			<p>BFN     [Text] The talks on economic issues between the Croatian  authorities and representatives of Serbs from the UNPA [UN  Protected Area] -- which were scheduled to take place today --  have been canceled. Local Serbs refused to attend a meeting on  the previously agreed terms. The most controversial questions  concerned the agenda and issues in connection with delegations  and the presence of Croatian journalists. Hrvoje Sarinic, the  head of the Croatian delegation to talks with the Serbs,  explains why the discussions were canceled.    [Begin Sarinic recording] The Serbs gave as a pretext our  request that you, the media, should be present. My stand was  very firm. I said that if the media are not present then the  Croatian delegation will not come to the talks either. I think  that the presence of the media is an indication of civilized  behavior -- I would even say a question of general culture --  pardon me if I speak sharply -- and of decency. Why do I say  decency? Because it was my initiative to invite the journalists  from the UNPA. Your colleagues came here to witness the signing  of an agreement on the cessation of hostilities. Enough said  about this; let there be no speculation about who is to blame  for the talks not taking place. Of course, the Serbs will most  likely try to shift the blame on to us. I can say that had it  not been this reason they would have thought up some other one.  At this stage they are clearly not prepared to talk.    If they were to talk they would want to discuss certain  points of the agenda which they would like to stick to -- and  these would certainly not be acceptable to the Croatian side.  In particular, after the Zagreb agreement they interpreted the  accord as if they had been given a state and now they have to  solve some vital problems, such as water, electricity,  equipment, and so on -- problems that are normally solved by  other states, such as Italy, Austria -- among themselves. This  is of course a stand that Croatia cannot accept and that we will  not and cannot accept. [end recording]</p>

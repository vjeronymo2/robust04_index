			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to a report from Panmunjom by reporters  Kim Chong-chin and Kim Chong-ki, North and South Korea started a  working-level contact at 1000 today at the House of Peace, on  our side of Panmunjom, to discuss procedures for the exchange of  special envoys. However, no progress has been made at the  contact because North Korea again insisted on preconditions for  the working-level contact. As a result, North and South Korea  agreed to hold a fourth working-level contact on 9 March at  Tongilgak, on the North Korean side of Panmunjom.    In today's contact, both sides delivered key addresses only.  They could not enter into discussions on procedural matters.    However, the sides reportedly agreed in principle to  exchange  special envoys of top leaders at the earliest possible date.    In his keynote speech, Song Yong-tae, our side's senior  delegate, presented a revised letter of agreement on the  exchange of special envoys. The revised agreement stipulates  the handling of the nuclear issue by special envoys, the  implementation of the North-South basic agreement, North-South  summit talks, and reunification.    Our side presented this revised agreement after accepting  North Korea's proposal that the missions of special envoys be  specified. Our side had previously insisted that no special  mission be stipulated. Regarding the method of envoy exchange,  our side demanded that our side's special envoy be allowed to  first visit Pyongyang, and said that if the North is willing,  our side is willing to be flexible.    However, contrary to our expectations, the North side again  put forward in its keynote speech the preconditions for  working-level contacts which it had previously asserted,  including the suspension of the international cooperative system  and so forth. Thus, there was no practical discussion on the  issue of special envoy exchange.</p>

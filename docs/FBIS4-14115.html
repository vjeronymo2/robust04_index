			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Algiers, 27 Apr (MENA)--Arab Maghreb Union [AMU]  Secretary General Mohammed Amamou has denied the existence of  any political reasons or differences among the AMU member states  that caused the absence of Moroccan King Hassan II and Libyan  revolution leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi from the Arab  Maghreb summit that was held in Tunis early last month.    Amamou, who is now in Algiers to participate in the meetings  of the follow-up committee, said in an interview with MENA that  both leaders had their own circumstances and engagements that  kept them from attending the summit. He noted that Morocco and  Libya were represented at a high level and that the five member  states participated in the summit with the leaders' approval.    He said the full commitment of the heads of state to the  idea  of a great Arab Maghreb and to serious work to consolidate  progress and implement what has been agreed on in the context of  the AMU was clearly evident at the Arab Maghreb summit.    In response to a question on the AMU's role in the Libyan  crisis in which Libya has been accused by Western nations of  involvement in the Lockerbie issue, Amamou said the AMU is  continuing to do all it can to find a fair and honorable  solution to this crisis that will guarantee security and  stability in the region and prevent any harm being done to all  peoples of the region, not just the Libyan people. He pointed  out that this crisis has had far-reaching effects on all peoples  of the region, even Egypt. He stressed that the Arab Maghreb  countries and Egypt are concerting their efforts along with the  Arab league to solve this problem. He noted that Arab League  Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd al-Majid entrusted the Arab  foreign ministers at their latest meeting to follow up on this  issue until a fair and honorable solution is found.

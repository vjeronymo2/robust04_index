Miryanin, candidate of technical </F> sciences]    [Text] In evaluating prospects for development of mortar  weapons, foreign military specialists note that even in the  future, mortars will remain the basis of battalion artillery and  an irreplaceable means of infantry fire support and effective  engagement of personnel, weapons and vehicles, especially where  high-trajectory fire is required for their destruction.  Qualitatively new models of mortars and ammunition for them were  developed as a result of a complex of work done to upgrade  mortar weapons in the 1980's, which led to a change in  organizational structure and tactics for employment of mortar  subunits.    A new direction was developed in creating self-propelled  [SP]  mortars with a turret design and full armor protection of crew  personnel, equipment and ammunition. Smoothbore, muzzle-loading  mortars are the most widespread. They are designed according to  the classic scheme of an imaginary triangle with charge ignition  according to the Stokes scheme (Fig. 1 [figure not reproduced]).  According to this scheme, ignition and combustion of the primary  propelling charge occur within its round located in a hollow  tube called a chamber. On attaining a certain pressure, powder  gases pierce the walls of the primary charge round, ignite the  secondary charges contained in the chamber and impart a  translation movement to the mortar round. The design  implementation of the imaginary triangle scheme is that the  mortar tube is hinged with a bipod assembly and base plate; the  bipod assembly and base plate rest on the ground with no joint  between them.    In the assessment of the NATO command, saturating opposing  sides' combat formations with mechanized means, providing  improved protection for targets and providing subunit personnel  with means of protection against bullets and fragments pose the  task of substantially increasing the effectiveness of mortar  ammunition, including kinetic energy of their submunitions  (fragments). And the dispersal of combat formations and  increased depth of unit and subunit echelonment under conditions  of highly mobile combat operations lead to the need to increase  the range of mortar fire and increase fire and tactical  maneuverability of mortars. Conduct of large-scale troop  airlifts also requires lessening the weight of weapon models and  reducing their dimensions without decreasing combat capabilities  and effectiveness.    Among shortcomings of mortar weapons, the NATO command  includes their great variety of types, (which complicates  maintenance), combat employment, coordination of fire control,  and logistic support. In this connection it is necessary to  resolve problems of reducing the number of models of mortars and  ammunition for them, since with limited capacities of  transportation, the unit of fire carried with the mortar may  prove sufficient in quantity but unsuited for performance of a  specific combat mission. Foreign military specialists also note  the low velocity and long flight time of the mortar round, which  makes mortars an easy target for detection by modern  reconnaissance assets. Therefore, work to create new models of  highly maneuverable, SP mortars based on a light, armored,  wheeled or tracked chassis with a load-carrying capacity up to 5  tons is becoming widespread abroad. These and other requirements  being placed on mortar weapons show that their upgrading in the  1990's will be conducted along the following directions:  Increase in range of fire, increase in maneuverability and  reliability, increase in rate of fire, improvement in grouping  and accuracy, and so on.    The increase in range of fire of mortars is being  accomplished both through increased muzzle velocity of the  mortar round and decreased loss of velocity in flight and  through an additional increase in velocity of the mortar round  on the trajectory and on the approach to the target. First of  all, to increase muzzle velocity reinforced propellant charges  and charges made of powders of a new mixture (for example,  ballistite-cordite powders) are being used, which provide for  increased muzzle velocity without a substantial increase in bore  pressure; secondly, the mortar tube is being lengthened. To  reduce energy losses the design and configuration of propellant  charges are being improved and the quality of stabilizing fins  and bodies is being increased to improve the mortar round's  aerodynamic shape. New rocket-assisted mortar rounds are being  developed and also are being widely used to additionally  increase velocity on the flight path, which in addition provides  for an increase in muzzle velocity by 125 m/sec or more.    To increase maneuverability work is being done to  reduce the weight of mortars in deployed and traveling  configurations. To this end possibilities are being sought for  wider use of light materials possessing high strength, rigidity  and anticorrosive properties. Alloyed steels, light,  high-tensile alloys (with use of aluminum, titanium, chrome,  nickel and molybdenum), and reinforced plastics are being  studied. Results of such studies from an early period already  have been realized in specific models. Thus, the L16A1 81-mm  mortar tube is made of alloyed steel and the M61 81-mm mortar  tube is made of chrome-nickel steel. The United States and other  countries have developed polyethylene containers for mortar  rounds instead of wooden packaging, and cases made of light  synthetic materials for the propellant charges. This permitted  considerably reducing overall weight of the transported ready  inventory and increasing operational reliability of ammunition  during storage and transportation. Work is constantly being done  to create SP mortars to increase maneuverability (Fig. 2 [figure  not reproduced]). Advanced mobile equipment possessing buoyancy,  air-transportability, and increased speed, range and off-road  capability is being used as the chassis. The design of devices  for installing a muzzle-loaded mortar on a self-propelled  chassis and its removal when conducting fire from the ground is  being improved. New recoil mechanisms such as of a torsion or  hydropneumatic type are being developed, considerably reducing  the force of recoil, which permits using lighter and more highly  maneuverable mobile equipment as the chassis for the SP mortar.    To improve safety of operation of mortars and their  ammunition, new explosives and more reliable standardized  proximity fuzes are being developed and trigger mechanisms and  safeties (interlocks) for them are being upgraded. The United  States, FRG and Great Britain presently are developing 120-mm SP  mortars of turret design loaded from the breech end. Automatic  loaders using robotics (for example, for the RO 2003) and  systems for diagnosing malfunctions (for example, for the FAMS)  are being manufactured for them.    The rate of fire of muzzle-loaded mortars is rather high,  but  duration of continuous fire is limited by tube heating  temperature, which is limited to a temperature of 180-200C  because of possible self-ignition of the powder of secondary  charges. New steels and alloys resistant to heating and  possessing high strength characteristics, increased heat  exchange with the surroundings in a broad range of temperatures  and under various climatic conditions, are being studied for  increasing the rate of fire. New design schemes and  plastic-ceramic materials are being sought for mortar round  obturating devices, which reduce friction as the round moves in  the bore. New powder mixtures with low combustion temperature  are being studied for propellant charges.    To increase the rate of fire, mechanical and  automatic devices also are being developed for restoring aim  after a round is fired. Patents have been registered for a  mortar round magazine and a loader for a muzzle-loaded mortar  (Switzerland), and automatic mortars with a turret configuration  are being created (USA, FRG, Great Britain).    Research in the area of improving the grouping and  accuracy of fire are aimed at improving the design of  propellant charges and the ignition devices ensuring their  reliable initiation, creating new obturating devices and  improving the aerodynamic shape of the mortar round. Stabilizing  fins of a new design, which make a certain rotation of the  mortar round possible, are being used to improve mortar round  stability on the flight path. The design and shape of base  plates are being changed in order to have greater stability of  the mortar when firing from different soils, new sighting  devices are being developed, and firing tables are being  improved. Mortars and mortar subunits are being outfitted with  modern means of fire support and fire control. Thus, the United  States proposes to outfit the FAMS 120-mm SP mortar with a  topographic survey and orientation system, a computer which  figures initial data for firing and fire control, and an  automatic system for laying the mortar.    From the early 1980's foreign military specialists began to  consider the mortar as one of the weapons for combating armored  equipment, since its ammunition can hit tanks and IFV's from  above, where they have the weakest armor. Moreover, the range of  fire of modern 81-mm and 120-mm mortars, which is 5-8 km,  exceeds the range of fire of antitank missile systems and  antitank guns. Based on this, a number of western countries have  stepped up creation of guided mortar ammunition, including that  which does not require target illumination. Thus, since 1975 the  FRG has been developing the Bussard 120-mm mortar round equipped  with a semiactive guidance system with laser homing head  envisaging the mandatory presence of a device for illuminating  the target, which is not always possible under conditions of  modern battle. Therefore, in recent years work has been carried  out successfully to create mortar rounds with infrared or radar  homing heads (millimeter waveband), which operate on the "fire  and forget" principle (Fig. 3). In this case, on the descending  branch of the mortar round's flight path (for example, the  Merlin 81-mm) there is a circular scan of the Earth's surface by  the homing head's field of view. The scan area in searching for  a moving target is 300x300 m. If a target is not detected, a  search for a stationary target begins in an area of 100x100 m.  On detecting it, the tail fin and four control canards located  on the front part of the body carry out guidance to the target.  In the assessment of military specialists, compared with the  Milan antitank missile system (range of fire 2 km and cost of  &pound;7,500) use of the Merlin mortar round clearly is  preferable  (4.5-6 km and &pound;3,700 respectively).             Guided mortar rounds with an active guidance system also are  being developed in the FRG, United States, Sweden and France.  Their principal characteristics are in the table.

The aggregate of such factors as rate of fire, high  accuracy of fire, reliable crew protection and high  maneuverability of SP automatic mortars will permit delivering  strikes against armored targets that are attacking or moving in  columns; and it will permit quickly changing firing positions to  move out from under enemy fire. Such a self-propelled system  would be more advantageous from the standpoint of cost  effectiveness than the SP antitank gun or ATGM system. At the  same time, some foreign military specialists also note  shortcomings of guided munitions--complexity of design and high  cost. It is emphasized that mortars cannot compete with antitank  weapons, since they are incapable of performing their primary  mission of giving close fire support to infantry subunits when  there are no other means for this, but they themselves are  engaged in combating enemy armored vehicles.    To improve effectiveness of action of mortar  rounds new mixtures of explosives are being developed  abroad which provide a high level of kinetic energy of the  fragment stream with optimum choice of body material. Malleable  perlitic iron and graphitized steel are beginning to be used to  manufacture the bodies. For example, use of malleable perlitic  iron for the bodies of 81-mm mortar rounds doubles their  fragmentation effect against personnel compared with a  ferrosteel body. Graphitized steel provides even better mortar  round body fragmentation. In recent years the United States and  Spain have been giving great attention to developing 120-mm  cluster munitions with shaped-charge-fragmentation submunitions  of the SADARM type providing a sharp increase in effectiveness  of engaging personnel and vehicles.    Resolving questions of unification and standardization  of mortar weapons is facilitated by coordinating overall  technical requirements for mortars and ammunition within the  NATO framework. In addition, joint developments are being  conducted abroad, as a result of which a new model of mortar or  ammunition goes to several countries. The export sale of mortar  weapons is being carried out on a broad scale, which for many  states precludes the need to perform their own development and  adjust series production. For purposes of unification, it is  also the practice to develop several versions of individual  parts of a standardized mortar (tubes, base plates), which  permits putting together models for subunits of different combat  arms.    The development of mortar weapons will follow the path of  creation of new models and modernization of existing ones to  improve their main specifications and performance  characteristics. The scale of RDT&amp;E being performed abroad to  create new mortar weapons and ammunition for them indicates that  in the future as well, mortars will hold an important place in  the armament system of ground troops of armies in many countries.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / German union ballot backs wider strikes: Heavy support in eastern states IG METALL, Germany's engineering union, yesterday received overwhelming support for further strike action in eastern Germany after balloting metal and electrical workers in three of the region's states. More than 82 per cent of the union's 72,000-strong membership in Thuringia, Berlin-Brandenburg, and Saxony-Anhalt said they were prepared to strike in pursuit of higher pay. Backed by such a mandate, the union's leadership, headed by Mr Franz Steinkuhler, will today hold a special meeting to decide how many more enterprises in eastern Germany will be targeted for strike action, and where any action should take place. Over 40,000 workers from more than 90 enterprises are now on strike to put pressure on the employers to reinstate a contract signed with the union in March 1991 which sought to equalise western and eastern wages by next year. About 10,000 west German workers yesterday held token stoppages in solidarity with the easterners. The contract would have meant pay rises exceeding 20 per cent for the metal, electrical and steel sectors in eastern Germany. But the employers cancelled the contract because of the country's deteriorating economy. The threat of further strikes coincides with the resumption today of crucial talks between the employers and union in the Saxon capital of Dresden. Mediated by Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the state's prime minister, they could lead to a negotiated settlement of the 12-day-old dispute. Both Mr Dieter Kirchner, head of Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical employers association, and Mr Michael Kittner, IG Metall's main legal expert, will be attending the talks.</p>

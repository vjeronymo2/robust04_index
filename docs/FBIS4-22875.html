			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Physical Mathematical Sciences O.M. </F> Kovalevich and Candidates of Technical Sciences A.M. Bukrinskiy  and V.P. Slutsker (S&amp;T Center for Nuclear and Radiation  Safety)  under the ``Problems, Search, Solutions'' rubric]    [Abstract] The development of the nuclear power industry  in the country can be conventionally split into three stages.  During the first stage (first generation AES power units with  reactors VVER-440 and RBMK 1000) normative regulation of safety  was mainly based on the general industrial experience and  experience in the development and operation of military nuclear  units and research and experimental reactors. During the second  period (second generation VVER 440 and RBMK 1000, and VVER 1000)  problems of AES safety were dealt with more thoroughly, based on  domestic and foreign experience in the development and operation  of first generation AESs. At this stage construction of nuclear  power units was governed by ``General Safety Requirements for  the Design, Construction and Operation of Nuclear Power Plants''  (OPB-73), which on the whole corresponded to similar documents  of other countries, for instance, to the then in effect U.S.  ``General Design Criteria for AES''. In 1982 the OPB 73 was  revised and replaced with OPB 82, but the safety concept  practically had not changed. Also during this stage normative  technical documentation (NTD) dealing with radiation safety of  the operating personnel and population at large was developed.  In 1987 a ``Summary List and Plan for the Development of Rules  and Standards Related to Nuclear Power'' (SPPNAE 87) was  approved. It took into account the available experience in the  development and operation of nuclear equipment, as well as the  consequences of the Chernobyl AES (1986) and Three Mile Island  (1979) accidents. This third (current) period of the development  of nuclear power is characterized by more stringent requirements  to ensuring AES safety. As of 1990, OPB 88 replaced OPB 82. The  work on OPB 88 coincided in time with the development of ''Basic  Principles of Ensuring Safety of Nuclear Power Plants''  (INSAG-3) by the International Consulting Group on Nuclear  Safety under the auspices of the IAEA General Director, which  made it possible to take into account the international  experience in solving problems related to ensuring safety. The  article explains in greater detail the new safety concepts set  forth in OPB-88 and describes work on the development of  Integrated NTD that regulates problems of ensuring safety of  dangerous nuclear and radiation facilities.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Net interest boosts Atlas Copco Atlas Copco, the Swedish industrial components group, has reported a 30 per cent rise in profits after financial items to SKr1.32bn (Dollars 166m) for 1993. But the improvement was due in large part to net interest income, with operating profits after depreciation ahead only 5 per cent at SKr1.18bn. The weaker underlying earnings left Atlas B shares SKr13 lower at SKr432. Group sales were up 18 per cent at SKr18.9bn but with 95 per cent of sales outside Sweden, Atlas said the rise was mainly due to the weakness of the Swedish krona, which fell by more than 20 per cent in value over the year. It said demand was weak in Europe, which accounts for more than 50 per cent of sales, and was expected to remain so in central and southern Europe this year. But the trend outside Europe was positive, orders overall were up 21 per cent and Atlas said it expected profits in 1994 to be ahead of 1993. The dividend was set at SKr9.00 per share, up SKr1.00 from the SKr8.00 paid for 1992. Atlas said it proposed a five-for-one share split, changing the par value from SKr25.00 to SKr5.00. A swing to net interest income of SKr88m in 1993 from a loss of SKr118m in 1992 was attributed to favourable interest rate differentials on currency hedging, lower borrowings and lower interest rates. Securum, the state-owned Swedish company set up to take on the bad assets of Nordbanken, has reported a pre-tax loss of SKr16.2bn for 1993, its first year in existence. The result illustrates the extent of the problems piled up by state-owned Nordbanken before the government removed loans and commitments worth SKr67bn  -mostly in Swedish and European property - into Securum. Securum said its 1993 loss included credit losses of SKr14.2bn and net financial expenses of SKr1.8bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq today visited the Cave of  the Patriarchs and the Hebron area with senior IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] officers and conducted a debriefing of  yesterday's incidents. After reaching his conclusions  Lieutenant General Baraq convened a news conference, which was  attended by our correspondent Karmela Menashe:    [Begin recording] [Baraq] Early yesterday morning a  shocking murder was carried out by a lunatic in this place. He  murdered innocent people on a holy day in a place of worship  which is holy to both religions. We are deeply grieved by this  terrible and unnecessary loss of life and share the sorrow of  the families, the residents of Hebron and the entire Palestinian  people and its leadership. We will do everything possible to  determine as best we can the circumstances of the incident  itself and the ensuing events and will do everything possible to  minimize the chances of the recurrence of such events.    [Unidentified correspondent] Do you have any picture of what  happened inside these halls?    [Baraq] Dr. Goldstein entered early morning and apparently  opened fire from one of the passages connecting the two prayer  areas -- it is still unclear which passage. He opened fire at  the group of worshipers who were praying in the Muslim hall. I  cannot determine the facts beyond this yet. The entire issue is  under a thorough investigation. I have no doubts that in the  wake of this investigation the entire picture will become clear.  This is the situation. To the best of my knowledge Dr.  Goldstein was the only one who fired shots inside this hall.    [Menashe] The chief of staff was also asked whether steps  will be implemented against the settlers in Qiryat Arba' and  Hebron.    [Baraq] At this point I am not qualified to say whether any  steps will be implemented. Right now there is a curfew in  Hebron and a closure on the Jewish settlement. This situation  will continue for the time being.    [Menashe] Will you change the procedures and the soldiers'  operation in this area?    [Baraq] We will implement whatever recommendations will  surface in light of the investigation. An investigation is  being carried at the division level and a debriefing by  Brigadier General Agmon on behalf of the General Staff. I have  no doubts that the events which occurred here and the incident  which happened near the hospital [not further specified] will be  thoroughly investigated. I am convinced that we will do whatever  is necessary after the investigation is completed.    For years hundreds of Muslims and Israelis have been praying  side by side -- at times simultaneously-- and there are quite a  few passages connecting the two areas in this intricate  structure.    [Menashe] The chief of staff was asked for his opinion  regarding the demand for an inquiry commission, as demanded by  some ministers.    [Baraq] The Police are conducting a criminal investigation  of this incident, and I have no doubts it will exhaust all the  criminal responsibility in this incident. The Central Command  and the General Staff have also appointed officers to  investigate the incident. We have no reservations or opposition  to any other investigations. We have no position regarding this  question.    [Menashe] Lt. Gen. Baraq also met the leaders and  dignitaries of Hebron.    [Baraq] I met Hebron's mayor and a group of dignitaries and  expressed our deep shock at this despicable crime, as well as  the IDF's and the entire Israeli people's denunciation of this  incident, and our determination to do whatever we can to  ascertain exactly what happened and to prevent the recurrence of  such incidents.    [Menashe] Chief of Staff Baraq, who held the news conference  near the Cave of the Patriarchs, emphasized that apparently  there should have been border policemen stationed near the Cave  of the Patriarchs yesterday, but they were not there.

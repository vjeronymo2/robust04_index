			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN, 20, IS FATALLY SHOT IN HEARNS' HOME;  </P> <P> BOXER SAYS FIGHT WON'T BE AFFECTED; BROTHER AT POLICE STATION IN MICHIGAN  </P> <P> An unidentified woman was shot to death in a bedroom of boxer Thomas Hearns'  home in Southfield, Mich., Saturday night, and six witnesses were being  questioned, police said.  </P> <P> One of the boxer's brothers was at the police station, accompanied by defense  attorney Neil Fink, but Southfield Police Officer Gary Conat refused to say if  Henry Hearns, about 19, was among those being questioned, the Associated Press  reported.  </P> <P> Lt. Lloyd Collins of the Southfield Police Department told The Times early  Sunday that police had a suspect in custody. He said he could not identify the  suspect until after an arraignment, which was scheduled for later in the day.  </P> <P> Promoter Bob Arum said late Saturday night that Hearns would meet Sugar Ray  Leonard Monday night, as scheduled, in a 12-round bout for Leonard's World  Boxing Council super-middleweight title at Caesars Palace.  </P> <P> Arum said he went to Hearns' hotel suite, where he found Hearns, several  members of his camp and Hearns' mother, Lois, who he said was crying.  </P> <P> "Tommy was angry at me for coming by and he said to me: 'This is not going to  affect me. Look, I'm here to do a job -- I've been waiting eight years to knock  this guy out.' "  </P> <P> The dead woman, whose name was not released, was shot once in the head, Collins  said. She was in her 20s and was known to the Hearns family, but the fighter  did not know her well, Arum said.  </P> <P> Detectives found a gun they believed was used in the slaying, Collins said.  </P> <P> Collins said Southfield, a suburb two miles north of Detroit, is considered a  "quiet community." He said the neighborhood of the shooting rarely has  disturbances.  </P> <P> "Incidents are incidents and they're unfortunate, but we're all professionals  here," Arum told Associated Press. "Is he (Hearns) concerned about his brother?  He probably is, but he says he doesn't want to think about it, and he won't."  </P> <P> Arum said three people in Hearns' entourage left Las Vegas for Detroit,  including another younger brother, John Hearns, who is a student at the  University of Nevada Las Vegas. His mother will remain in Las Vegas for the  fight.  </P> <P> "Tommy talked to her and asked her to stay in Las Vegas," Arum said. "She is  here and she is going to stay."  </P> <P> Arum said: "It has been made clear to me that the (dead) woman herself has  absolutely no connection with Thomas."  </P> <P> Asked how he knew that since he didn't know the victim's name, he said, "They  apparently know who she is."  </P> <P> Prentiss Byrd, chief assistant to Emanuel Steward, Hearns' manager, quoted the  former world champion as saying: "I've got to do what I've got to do. A lot of  people worked to make this fight happen."  </P> <P> Leonard told Charlie Brotman, a publicist: "I don't know any of the details,  but I certainly feel empathy for him, especially in light of the big  championship fight."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Elliott Almond contributed to this story.  </P></p>

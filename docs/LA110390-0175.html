			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LATINOS UPSET BY CARTOON IN COLLEGE PAPER  </P> <P> A cartoon published in the Lariat, a student-run newspaper at Saddleback  College, Friday was denounced by Latino students and a faculty member as racist  and offensive.  </P> <P> The cartoon, drawn by Saddleback student Clint Bond, depicted five Mexican  nationals crossing Interstate 5 in a crosswalk marked "Illegal Alien Crossing."  On the other side of the freeway is a brick wall marked by graffiti and a sign  saying "No Green Card Needed" and "Welcome to America."  </P> <P> The cartoon, published last week, was drawn in reference to recent incidents  involving undocumented workers who were struck by vehicles as they dashed  across the freeway while attempting to evade the Border Patrol checkpoint south  of San Clemente. Several have died.  </P> <P> It was the second time within a year that the Lariat had drawn fire for  publishing cartoons that some ethnic groups labeled insensitive. Last December,  the Larait drew criticism from Jewish students and community leaders for a  cartoon and editorial it published titled "Happy Holocaust."  </P> <P> Lariat editors eventually issued a formal apology to the community.  </P> <P> "The border-crossing cartoon was confusing in the point it was trying to make  and made light of a very tragic and complicated issue," said Juanita Baltierra,  a Saddleback College counselor and adviser to the Student Organization of  Latinos. "It presented an image of Latinos that we consider derogatory. I found  it insulting and racist, and so did many of the students."  </P> <P> Lariat Editor Alex Murashko said the cartoon was not meant to offend Latinos.  "We were trying to call attention to the problem on the freeway near the  checkpoint and some of the Latino students thought the cartoon was making fun.  We met with them and are going to publish their letters in the next edition."  Bond, the cartoonist, could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Gustavo Flores, a photographer on the Lariat staff, said he was offended by the  cartoon and felt that, as a Latino, he should have been asked for his opinion  before the cartoon was published.  </P> <P> "It's not a joke," he said. "Families and little children have been hit  crossing the freeway. These are real lives and you just can't make fun of their  deaths."  </P></p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Verity back in the black with Pounds 0.44m Verity Group, the manufacturer and distributor of Wharfedale and Mission loudspeakers, yesterday reported a return to profit and a link to maximise its potential in Asia. For the half year to end-December the Surrey-based group, which moved from the USM to a listing last summer, swung from losses of Pounds 1.35m to profits of Pounds 444,000 pre-tax. The turnround was achieved on a Pounds 4.8m rise in turnover to Pounds 11.6m. The link-up is with Tomei Group, a Hong Kong-based maker of electronic and electrical products. The two companies have formed a joint venture whereby Tomei will manufacture and distribute certain Wharfedale products in China, Hong Kong and Indonesia. Sir Gordon Brunton, chairman of Verity, said Tomei had distribution access to some 5,000 sales outlets throughout China. He added that trading in east Asia was expected to bring important benefits to both companies. Tomei will also raise its stake in Verity from 7.71 per cent to 9.97 per cent via the purchase of 5m new ordinary shares at 13p, costing Pounds 650,000. Verity will hold 32 per cent of the venture with Tomei holding the balance. Previously Tomei acted as a distributor for Verity products. Control of Cascade, which distributed Wharfedale products in the UK, has passed to Ross Group. Mr Syd Edels, former chairman of Cascade, has left the board and Mr Johnny Lau, chairman of Tomei, has joined as a non-executive director. Mission was acquired in October 1992 and for the interim period contributed turnover of Pounds 7.67m, some 66 per cent of the group's total. Other contributing factors to the turnround were lower interest charges and a reduction in overheads. Early indications lead the directors to believe that the rest of the financial year will continue the progress made in the opening half. Earnings per share emerged at 0.2p (losses 1.9p). Comparative figures have been adjusted to conform with FRS 3.</p>

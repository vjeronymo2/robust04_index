			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LA JOLLA INDIANS COURT OFF-ROAD VEHICLES  </P> <P> Much of the 9,000-acre La Jolla Indian Reservation in remote north San Diego  County is unforgiving terrain -- too hard for digging, too thickly covered with  brush or too hilly, as it rises up the base of Palomar Mountain.  </P> <P> "It's land we can't use," said Mitzi Magante, La Jolla Indian chairman. "It's  not suitable for housing. We can't afford to develop it for housing. The ground  is clay and granite and a lot of rocks."  </P> <P> But Indian leaders have now begun to see the potential for hundreds of  thousands of dollars in their dirt, and they are asking the state to size up  the reservation, northeast of Valley Center, as an off-road vehicle park.  </P> <P> The La Jolla band of Luiseno Indians on Friday presented its exploratory  proposal for an off-road park to the Off-Highway Motor Vehicle Recreation  Commission, a nine-member panel charged with working with the state Parks and  Recreation Department to build and maintain trails for four-wheel-drive,  three-wheeler and motocross bike enthusiasts.  </P> <P> At the urging of off-road enthusiasts, the commission and department have been  trying for years to find about 1,000 acres that can serve as a nearby  playground. The state already maintains a large vehicular park in Ocotillo  Wells, but the off-roaders say it is not close enough for them to use for only  a few hours or during the week after work.  </P> <P> So far, the state has been looking south, to Otay Mesa, for a solution. It has  identified a potential 1,200-acre site, 920 acres of which are owned by  developer Roque de la Fuente II.  </P> <P> But a deal with De la Fuente -- $5 million for the state to take title to the  land, only to give it back to him in 20 years -- failed to get through the  Legislature last year because of the price and the novelty of the arrangements.  </P> <P> Renewed talks with De la Fuente are expected to begin soon, and indications are  that the state is looking at paying as much or more for the site, since a  recent state audit shows his land is worth $11 million to $12 million, state  officials say.  </P> <P> Against that backdrop, the La Jolla Indian proposal -- although a surprise --  immediately piqued the interest of Off-Highway Commission members, who  instructed their staff to look into the idea and requested a tour of the San  Diego County reservation before their next meeting in March.  </P> <P> What commission members will find, said Magante, is a band of 300 Indians who  are eager to take on a year-round enterprise like an off-road park because of  the prospect it will create about 20 full-time jobs. That means a lot to a  reservation with an unemployment rate of more than 50%, she said.  </P> <P> "We need year-round enterprises," said Magante. "Right now, we have three  enterprises on the reservation -- an 800-unit campground, a general store, and  we do have an aquatic water park. But the season for all of them begins in  March and ends in October."  </P> <P> As for the noise, the Indians have some concerns, said Magante. Then again,  there may be considerable tolerance since the reservation is already home to  the Amago Raceway, which features go-cart and motorcycle events, she said.  </P> <P> Jack Orndoff, an Irvine businessman who first suggested the off-road park to  the La Jolla Indians, told the commission in Sacramento on Friday that putting  the vehicular playground on tribal lands would be easier and about 25% cheaper  than working with a private owner.  </P> <P> In addition, he said its North County location would be convenient for  off-roaders in both San Diego and Orange counties. It is 55 minutes from  downtown San Diego and 50 minutes from Irvine, he said.  </P> <P> And the thick brush on the land could be seen as an advantage, he said. No  off-roader would dare stray from official trails to tangle with the tough  mesquite  </P> <P> "We have so much brush up here, they couldn't tear it up," Magante said of the  reservation. "The brush is so rough that they would be dissuaded from making  their own path. They would tear their vehicles and themselves."  </P> <P> Magante said the band would welcome a response from the state, which would pay  for a new off-road riding park from its "green sticker" fund -- money collected  from the registration of off-road vehicles.  </P> <P> If talks become serious, the entire tribe would have to approve a deal with the  state, she said.  </P></p>

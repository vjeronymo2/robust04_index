			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DIVISION I-AA CITADEL USES WISHBONE TO KNOCK OFF SOUTH CAROLINA, 38-35  </P> <P> Quarterback Jack Douglas scored from the one on fourth down with 22 seconds  left to give The Citadel a 38-35 victory over South Carolina Saturday at  Columbia, S.C.  </P> <P> It was the Division I-AA Bulldogs' first victory over South Carolina since 1950  and first in Columbia since 1919. It was also the Gamecocks' first loss to a  I-AA opponent since 1982.  </P> <P> Douglas rushed for 104 yards and completed seven of nine passes for 125 yards  in directing the Bulldogs' wishbone attack.  </P> <P> It was the first time South Carolina had seen the wishbone since 1977 -- and it  showed. The Citadel moved the ball at will, gaining 396 yards against the  fourth-ranked defense in the nation, which had been giving up only 232 yards a  game.  </P> <P> The Bulldogs (4-3) scored 10 points in the final 3:11 to earn the victory  before a crowd of 63,000 at Williams-Brice Stadium.  </P> <P> After The Citadel made it 35-31 on Howard Barnard's 37-yard field goal,  Torrence Forney recovered the ensuing onside kick for the Bulldogs at the South  Carolina 41-yard line.  </P> <P> Douglas hooked up with Terrance Young on a 24-yard pass to the 16. Douglas  fumbled on the next play, but the Bulldogs recovered at the 10. Douglas scored  four plays later.  </P> <P> South Carolina Coach Sparky Woods said the Gamecocks (4-2) weren't looking past  the Bulldogs.  </P> <P> "This game was a heartbreaker," he said. "They're a tough football team."  </P> <P> South Carolina had enough yards (480) on offense to win, just not enough  points.  </P> <P> No. 22 Clemson 24, North Carolina State 17 -- The Tigers needed every advantage  their nationally- ranked defense could provide to escape with an Atlantic Coast  Conference victory over the Wolfpack at Raleigh, N.C.  </P> <P> The struggle between Clemson, ranked second in total defense, and the Wolfpack,  ranked seventh, featured seven fumbles -- four by N.C. State. The third fumble  set up fullback Howard Hall's one-yard touchdown with 3:02 left that gave the  Tigers the victory. The fourth came on the ensuing kickoff, with Clemson's  David Joy recovering.  </P> <P> Clemson, 6-2, 3-2 in the ACC, and N.C. State (4-4, 2-4) were tied, 17-17, after  three quarters.  </P> <P> Clemson's Ronald Williams fumbled inside the Wolfpack 20 with 5:05 left, but  N.C. State quarterback Terry Jordan returned the favor three plays later to  give the Tigers the ball at the 11. Hall scored two plays later.  </P> <P> North Carolina State rolled up 328 yards against a defense that has been  allowing an average of 202 a game.  </P> <P> Clemson quarterback DeChane Cameron completed 14 of 26 passes for 182 yards and  Williams rushed for 95 yards in 26 carries, 87 yards coming in the second half.  </P> <P> Maryland 23, Duke 20 -- Dan DeArmas kicked three field goals in the second  half, including the game-winning 20-yarder with 50 seconds left, as the  Terrapins (3-4, 0-3) held off the Blue Devils (3-4, 0-3) in an ACC game at  Durham, N.C.  </P> <P> Blue Devil quarterback Billy Ray had thrown a 27-yard touchdown pass to Walter  Jones with 12 minutes left to tie the score, 20-20.  </P> <P> Southern Mississippi 23, Memphis State 7 -- Brett Favre's passing set up two  touchdowns and Jim Taylor kicked three field goals to lead the Golden Eagles  (6-2) over the Tigers (3-3-1) at Hattiesburg, Miss. Southern Mississippi held  Memphis State to 191 yards and 11 first downs.  </P></p>

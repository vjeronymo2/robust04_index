			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Timex suspends threat to sack 300 MANAGEMENT at the Dundee-based Timex Electronics plant yesterday issued and withdrew a threat to sack about 300 striking workers pending the outcome of a mass meeting of the workforce to be held this morning. The factory's 500 production workers are in their third week of an all-out strike over management's decision to lay off 200 of them - including all the shop stewards and the factory convener - after the US-owned company experienced a 'prolonged' downturn in demand. Timex said: 'Management were intending to issue dismissal notices to about 300 striking workers.' The company had agreed to 'delay' issuing the notices ahead of today's mass meeting at the request of the AEEU engineering and electrical union. It is understood the workforce will consider a previously rejected four-point peace plan that was drawn up by management in both Dundee and in the parent Timex Corporation in Walterbury, Connecticut. The package offered employees a 50 per cent share in this year's profits and arbitration on the issue of lay-offs, following an immediate return to work in return for a cut in fringe benefits and a wage freeze for the rest of the year, the company said. Earlier, scuffles briefly broke out between police attempting to keep the roads around the factory clear and pickets. Police said the incident had not resulted in any injuries or arrests. As many as 305,344 workers have lost their jobs in manufacturing industry over the past two years, according to the latest job-loss survey by the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union published yesterday. A total of 33,352 went in 377 different companies between October 9 last year and Monday of this week, with the largest contractions being in London and the south-east and the west Midlands. Mr Bill Jordan, the union's president, said the figures showed the jobs crisis in Britain was deepening.</p>

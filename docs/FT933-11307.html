			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Barclays hits at Treasury on BT3 BARCLAYS BANK plans to challenge the Treasury over more than Pounds 1m in lost discounts for BT3 shares, the bank said last night. A lorry taking 12,000 application forms to the City for bank customers was delayed by traffic jams and arrived two minutes after the offer for the third and final tranche of British Telecommunications shares closed. The bank has told its Share Shop customers that it will pick up the bill so they will not lose the discount of 30p per share available to small investors - 10p off each payment due. But Mr Philip Ashley of Barclays said the bank would fight the Treasury over its decision not to stretch the deadline. He said it seemed very harsh to have the lorry-load of forms ruled out for just a couple of minutes.</p>

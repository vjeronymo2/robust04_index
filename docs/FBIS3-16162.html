He  arrived in Perm at the invitation of Perm Region Governor Boris  Kuznetsov.    "I firmly believe Russia's main problem now is linked with  the slowing down of the social life transformation process",  Gaydar said. "I am convinced the ongoing transformations can be  given a new impetus. I am ready to work on this in the  government when there are political preconditions for it",  Gaydar said.    Gaydar plans to meet on Monday with the regional  administration and entrepreneur's to discuss the situation in  Russia, prospects for its development as well as the most acute  problems the region and the whole country are facing.

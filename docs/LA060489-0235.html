			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COVINA STOPS MISSION VIEJO ON THREE HITS  </P> <P> Mission Viejo High School entered Saturday's Southern Section 3-A softball  championship game hoping to pull off one more surprise.  </P> <P> But the unseeded Diablos -- an at-large team -- ran out of luck against  second-seeded and undefeated Covina.  </P> <P> Covina's Mary Letourneau (24-0-1) pitched a three-hitter with 12 strikeouts to  lead the Colts to a 2-0 victory at Mayfair Park in Lakewood.  </P> <P> "I thought we played really well, we just didn't generate any offense," Diablo  Coach Jeff Cunningham said. "She did a lot of things we expected, only she did  them better."  </P> <P> Amy Bond, one of three Diablos to reach base, said: "She had nice rise and nice  drop, and she threw them both when we were expecting the opposite."  </P> <P> Letourneau, who came into the game with an 0.12 earned-run average, recorded  her 17th shutout of the season.  </P> <P> Covina got to Mission Viejo starting pitcher Erin Fitzgerald (12-5) for four  hits and the two runs, and reliever Kerin Dull for three hits. The Diablos  played outstanding defense to keep the score as close as it was.  </P> <P> Dull, a sophomore, replaced Fitzgerald to start the third after the starter  aggravated a back injury while warming up before the inning.  </P> <P> "I hurt it before the (second round) of the La Mirada game," said Fitzgerald.  </P> <P> "In the second inning, I started to have pain in my lower left side and it  spread. (By the third), it shot all the way across my back. It just really  hurt.'  </P> <P> Covina scored its runs in the second inning. After Bond made a diving catch on  a line drive to center field by Letourneau, Lea Hollister and April Ruedaflores  singled.  </P> <P> Cassy Hollister then a hit ground ball to shortstop. Jennifer Ward tried to  force Hollister at third but her throw tailed over the third baseman's head.  Lea Hollister scored on the error and Ruedaflores took third.  </P> <P> Fitzgerald then struck out Dawn Sawyer but Hollister stole second. r Cindy  Escobedo hit a single up the middle to score Ruedaflores to make it 2-0 before  Sherrie Ward flied out to end the inning.  </P> <P> "She was hurting in the first and second innings," Cunningham said of  Fitzgerald. "I think if I had known, I might have made the (pitching) change  then."  </P> <P> Mission Viejo's best scoring opportunity also came in the second. Designated  hitter Michelle Daugherty singled to right field and was sacrificed to second  by Tamar deFries but she could get no farther.  </P> <P> In the sixth with one away, Letourneau reached on a fielder's choice and  advanced on Lea Hollister's ground out. Ruedaflores then hit a bloop single to  center field. Bond charged the hit, wound up and let go with a throw to the  plate that arrived before Letourneau even had a chance to slide. Catcher  deFries tagged her out to prevent the run.  </P> <P> "The girls have done a great job," said Cunningham. "They have nothing to be  ashamed of."  </P> <P> The farthest the Diablos (18-11) had advanced previously was to the semifinals  five years ago, he said.  </P></p>

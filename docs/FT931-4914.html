			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Imagine no Maastricht Make-believe time is here again. Just imagine. In spite of last night's defeat in the Commons, everything is about to come right for the British government. A grateful nation will shortly be singing the praises of Mr John Major, his cabinet, even his chancellor. It is a charming fancy. If you get drunk, stand on your head, shut your eyes and picture the fairies at the bottom of the garden you might wake up believing it. The case for such a touching exercise of faith is deceptively strong. The political scenery is shifting. Winter is nearly over. Doom and gloom, those unwelcome guests whom the prime minister seeks to evict, always arrive with the cold and the dark. They usually leave when the days get longer and warmer. The recession is coming to an end; spirits will rise as the inevitable upswing begins. Sales of new houses and cars seem to be picking up. As we are frequently reminded by Number 10 Downing Street, interest rates are at their lowest since the prime minister was a lad. The annual rate of inflation is under 2 per cent. There is more. Wage-cost pressures are becoming insignificant. The CBI says that pay settlements have fallen to their lowest level for 13 years. The Institute of Directors says that half the chairmen and chief executives who answered its latest questionnaire confess to a feeling of optimism. The equivalent figure in the depths of winter was 38 per cent. On the stock exchange the Footsie index o'erleaps itself every other day, while brokers confidently predict a bull market in government bonds. The explanation may be foreign buyers, or leads given by Tokyo or the Dow, but the effect is the same. That wonderful resurgent feeling is entering the nation's bloodstream, and it isn't only spring fever. If past performance is any guide, the initial reaction to the forthcoming Budget will be that the government is onto a winner. When Mr Norman Lamont sits down next Tuesday afternoon he may even be cheered by the benches behind him. This happens with most chancellors, in most years. Second thoughts come later. Mr Lamont is clearly aware of this. He is soliciting post-Budget social engagements all over town. He must feel that he has something to sell. Himself? That is the cynic's answer. A less narrow interpretation is that he is under orders to restore confidence. This sounds right. It will, after all, be Mr Major's Budget. The official advice that goes to Mr Lamont also goes to the prime minister, who was the man in charge when Sir Terry Burns was made head of the Treasury. The present chancellor is allowed to make small decisions on his own. The fiscal stance, the thrust of the Budget, is the prime minister's to determine. The pair of them know that the holders of their two offices sink or swim together. Mr Nigel Lawson jumped overboard, and soon afterwards Mrs Margaret Thatcher also went under. No Conservative minister has forgotten the lesson of those events. Mr Major is determined to be more of a hands-on manager of the economy than his predecessor; Mr Lamont is not in a position to demur. It is at this point in the optimist's daydream that the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty comes in to burst the bubble. It need not be so. We may brush aside the treaty's regular escapes from extinction in parliament. These have become a bore for all save the few dozen fanatics who glory beneath the banner of Euro-sceptic. Even the government's dramatic humiliation of last night may eventually be forgotten. Assume, as most ministers do, that one day the bill is passed. Over and done with. Behind us. Combine that happy anticipation with the expected glad tidings on the economy and you are ready to accept that quite soon we will witness the rehabilitation of a government whose authority was drained away on Black Wednesday. Reality is an awkward devil. It will insist on breaking into such fanciful meanderings. Reality tells us that the divisions in the Conservative party have become so bitter, so deep, that they will not heal, at least not quickly, even when the recovery is well under way and the Maastricht treaty has been ratified. For Mr Major is not merely saddled with a small majority. He aspires to run a traditional British-style elective dictatorship on the strength of a coalition of Conservatives and Sometimes-Conservatives. This would not be remarkable in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium or other continental democracies in which coalition-building is the norm. In Britain it is so extraordinary that nobody realises what is happening. The strength of the Sometimes-Conservatives has to be gauged whenever an important proposal is put before the Commons. Their presence is such a threat to the government that other possible allies, such as the Ulster Unionists or even, in extremis, the Liberal Democrats, are kept sweet. This affects everything. Question: how much pressure should be put on the Unionists in Belfast in response to the Dublin government's recent peace overtures? Answer: it depends on what the government may need to ask of the Unionists in the Commons. Should the pension age be equalised for men and women? Not if it seems to have been demanded by the Europeans (although if Mr Peter Lilley, a known Euro-sceptic, is to make the announcement, perhaps the Sometimes-Conservatives will accept it). How many coal mines will be closed? Answer: how many S-Cs will vote for whatever number is proffered? There is another reason why the restoration of the government's fortunes is likely to be a long and painful process. People are aware that the end of the recession has been brought forward by the forced abandonment of a managed exchange rate - something that, a week before it happened, the prime minister and the chancellor told us would be the height of irresponsibility. To claim credit for the beneficial results of that failure is pretty cheeky. While unemployment remains so high, and the fear of it reaches into nearly every home, such a claim will sound hollow. Voters can see that we have a weak government, led by a prime minister who is unable to unite his party, even by appealing to old loyalties. That was true in the darkest days of winter, and it may be just as true in bright midsummer. Never mind. Government matters less than you think. Most of us, most of the time, can manage very well without it.</p>

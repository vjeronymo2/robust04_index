			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: A marriage made in the market place - The merger of Liffe and LTOM which will go ahead in March THE LONDON International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) has managed to find enough market-makers in individual stock options to allow its merger with the London Traded Options Market (LTOM) to go ahead. 'We have received sufficient commitment from a nucleus of market-makers to make it possible for the merged market to continue to trade the full range of individual equity options and index options currently traded on LTOM,' said Mr David Burton, Liffe's chairman. Although there is still some concern that the market-making capacity of the new exchange may initially be rather thin, dealers hope the boost in activity provided by the merger will prompt an increase in the level of market-making activity. Six firms - JG Bolitho, City of London Options, Hills Independent Traders, James Capel, Kleinwort Benson and Swiss Bank Corporation - have said they will act as assigned market-makers and nominated market-makers in a range of contracts. An assigned market-maker is committed to making a continuous two-way price in a particular contract, while a nominated market-maker is expected to make prices on request. The merger, originally due to take place at the end of January, was postponed until March 20, because insufficient firms had come forward to act as market-makers; there were also technical problems. Liffe yesterday made a provisional allocation of 'D' shares which entitle holders to trade stock and stock index options on the new exchange. The final allocation will be made once the merger has become legal. There is still some concern that the vested interests which hindered progress on the merger from the start may continue to divide the market. In particular, four of the most active firms in the underlying market - Barclays de Zoete Wedd, County NatWest, Smith New Court and Warburg - will not be acting as market-makers. These firms had pushed for a move from open-outcry trading to a screen-based system, a proposal which met strong opposition from other quarters. Although they will not be involved as market-makers, these firms will act as principal traders and could contribute substantial liquidity since they hold around a dozen seats each. Each seat is equivalent to one trader on the floor. Kleinwort Benson, which had also advocated screen-based trading, surprised some market participants when it volunteered last week to become a market-maker. Mr Bruce Froud, head of equity derivatives at Kleinwort, said the decision to make markets was 'economically a sensible decision in the medium-term'. Due to the nature of the market, volume in individual stock options is expected to remain volatile. 'If there is takeover speculation affecting a particular stock, market-making will shift to where the action is,' one trader said. The mood among traders yesterday was generally optimistic, after weeks of speculation that the merger might not go ahead. Provided confidence in the effectiveness of the market improves, the relatively small number of market-makers could provide enough liquidity to get the market started, according to most traders. 'I think you could see average daily volume in the FT-SE option (which currently trades around 8,000 contracts a day) rise in excess of 30,000 contracts,' said Mr Richard Harris, head of derivative trading at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Mr Michael Jenkins, chief executive of Liffe, pointed to the 'high degree of expertise' among the market-makers. However, he admitted that if volume in the market failed to pick up following the merger there was still a chance there would have to be a shift to another system. He said a screen-based system was still an option. Also under consideration is a 'negotiated price' market, like the system used on the American Stock Exchange, where one nominated market-maker who runs the book for a particular contract.</p>

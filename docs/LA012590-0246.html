			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> REDD FOXX AUCTION SET SATURDAY  </P> <P> Officials with the Robert Deiro Auction Co. said today that they are proceeding  with plans to sell personal property of entertainer Redd Foxx at auction  Saturday.  </P> <P> An attorney for Foxx raised questions about the auction earlier this week and  will argue the matter in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Las Vegas Friday morning.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills attorney Paul Whitford said the auction, ordered by the Internal  Revenue Service, would conflict with the rights of the bankruptcy court. Foxx  filed for bankruptcy in 1983, and some of his assets have been sold over the  years to pay creditors.  </P> <P> The IRS moved in on Foxx last November, seizing his Las Vegas home, several  cars and expensive jewelry. The IRS wants to sell the property at auction  Saturday to pay nearly $900,000 in back taxes, interest and penalties.  </P> <P> Whitford said the IRS auction would conflict with the rights of creditors in  the bankruptcy case. Deiro's office said the auction will start at 10 a.m.  Saturday at the Cashman Field Center.  </P></p>

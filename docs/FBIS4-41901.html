			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Gorelov] </F>   [Text] Birobidzhan, 28 Jun -- The first "Cover" [Zaslon]  operation carried out in central Amur has provided the  opportunity to "cleanse" Russian territorial waters of Chinese  poachers. Border guards at the Birobidzhan detachment, guarding  nearly 500 km of waters along the border with the PRC, prevented  over 100 border violations in the first week of the operation.  About 2 km of floating and fixed gill nets have been  confiscated along with hundreds of meters of hooked tackle.  Sixteen of the most hardened Chinese poachers were detained.  After registration of the incidents of poaching, the culprits  were handed to the Chinese authorities.    ITAR-TASS was told by Mikhail Naymilo, head of the  detachment, that "the Amur these days is practically clean."  After an official statement to Chinese border representatives,  the Chinese border patrols, the river police, and the fish  patrol inspectors stepped up their activities noticeably.  Before Operation Cover went ahead, none of these departments  even attempted to halt the intensified poaching by their  compatriots.</p>

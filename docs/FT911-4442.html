			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Retail side underpins 46% jump to Pounds 95m at Littlewoods THE LITTLEWOODS Organisation, the privately-owned retail and football pools group, yesterday raised pre-tax profits by 46 per cent from Pounds 64.9m to Pounds 94.8m in 1990. This increase came in spite of only a marginal gain in turnover from Pounds 2.26bn to Pounds 2.37bn. Pre-tax profits for the company's retail divisions rose from Pounds 73.2m to Pounds 83.6m on sales rising by just over 3 per cent to Pounds 1.73bn. Profits from the pools operations, however, were only up to Pounds 17.3m last year from Pounds 17.1m in 1989. Littlewoods is still undecided about the future of its mail-order operations which achieved trading profits last year of Pounds 53.5m (Pounds 51.7m) on sales of Pounds 933m (Pounds 957m). Mr Desmond Pitcher, chief executive, said yesterday that no negotiations were currently taking place for the sale of the division. An approach for the mail-order operations had been made to the company earlier this year but the Pounds 400m offer had fallen 'significantly short' of Littlewoods' asking price. Littlewoods had asked Kleinwort Benson to advise it on the possible sale of the mail-order business. Mr Pitcher said that a possible sale was only being considered 'to ensure that adequate funds are available to expand the rest of the company's activities'. The Moores family, which controls the company, is determined that Littlewoods should remain privately owned and consequently is having to seek finance through the sale of some assets. If no buyer is found for the mail-order division, then 'other avenues of financing our growth' would be explored, said Mr Pitcher.</p>

			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / International Company News: Canadian airlines merger stalls on buy-out proposal CANADIAN Airlines International has stalled controversial merger talks with Air Canada to consider a buy-out proposal from a group of its employees backed by several Canadian provincial governments. The pressure on Canada's two leading airlines either to merge or forge alliances with foreign carriers was underlined however, by continued heavy losses in the second quarter. The two carriers posted a combined loss of CDollars 163m (USDollars 137m) in the latest three-month period, and CDollars 401m in the first half of 1992. PWA Corp of Calgary, Canadian's parent company, was pushed into Air Canada's embrace late last month after it called off negotiations for American Airlines of Dallas to acquire a significant minority shareholding. Since then, the future of the two airlines has become a highly-charged political issue. Besides concern about the commercial implications of a monopoly carrier, the western provinces are nervous that they will suffer the heaviest job losses from a merger. The deal would probably leave Montreal-based Air Canada calling most of the shots. PWA said late on Friday that Air Canada's merger terms were unacceptable. While the two airlines have not broken off talks, PWA said it will at the same time study a hastily-assembled proposal from its employees. This would include bridge financing from several provinces, including Alberta and British Columbia, where the bulk of Canadian's operations are located. Outsiders are speculating that PWA may also revive its talks with American. Air Canada's second-quarter loss was CDollars 129m, or CDollars 1.73 a share, up from CDollars 30m, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest figure includes a charge of CDollars 31m to cover, among other things, staff cuts. The operating loss rose to CDollars 35m from CDollars 6m. PWA lost CDollars 34.4m, or 74 cents a share, virtually unchanged from CDollars 34.7m, or 75 cents a share. The company said that without new financing, Canadian's ability to continue operating and meet its financial obligations in 1993 was 'a matter of concern'.</p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONE MAN'S URBAN WOES  </P> <P> Let us all be thankful that Stein is "Sealed Up, Walled In, (and) Locked Out."  His ignorant and racist attitudes reveal a man who has purposely detached  himself from the community, perhaps consumed by his own materialistic quest. I  doubt he would regard white-collar crime as a form of "barbaric" behavior  because it doesn't affect his Mercedes, CD, or his closed house. His closed  environment echoes his provincial mind. In all likelihood, the only step he has  taken to help his community is to join the empty Reagan legacy of "Just say  no."  </P> <P> LONCE H. BAILEY  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

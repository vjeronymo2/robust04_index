Each of these diseases can lead to serious problems, even death. Your child can be protected from diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis by the vaccine. These diseases_especially pertussis_are still found in our country, mostly because some people do not get enough doses of the vaccines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Diphtheria is spread from person to person. It can cause a membrane to form in the nose, throat, or airway. Diphtheria can cause breathing problems, heart failure, or paralysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tetanus, also called lockjaw, is caused by a germ that enters the body through a cut or wound. Tetanus causes serious, painful spasms of all muscles, ``locking'' of the jaw so the sick person cannot open his mouth or swallow, and death.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

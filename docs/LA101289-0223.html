			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 2 INSURANCE FIRMS AGREE TO TESTIFY IN ANTITRUST SUIT  </P> <P> Two of the nation's biggest insurance companies, sued in one of the largest  antitrust lawsuits in Texas history, have agreed to testify for the state and  pay $500,000 in legal costs each, Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox said today.  </P> <P> Mattox said Travelers Insurance Co. and St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance  Co. also agreed to cease certain industry activities in the settlement  agreement signed by state District Judge Pete Lowry.  </P> <P> "In essence, these companies have entered a (no contest) plea and have agreed  to testify for the state as the lawsuit continues against the other  defendants," Mattox said.  </P> <P> The state is accusing the insurance industry of seeking to create a phony  "insurance crisis" several years ago in which insurers claimed that an increase  in lawsuits was forcing them out of the commercial liability field.  </P></p>

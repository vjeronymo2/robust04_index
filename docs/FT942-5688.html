			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Leading indicators decline in April Both the longer and shorter leading indicators of the UK economy fell in April, the Central Statistical Office reported yesterday. The shorter leading indicator, which looks five months ahead, fell sharply because of declining share prices, consumer confidence and new car registrations. Subsequent data may reverse the decline. The longer leading indicator, which looks 13 months ahead, has been flat or falling since the second half of last year. The coincident indicator continues to rise, as it has done since the second quarter of 1992. This indicator is based on factors such as industrial output, retail sales and M0. The UK's official reserves rose Dollars 9m in May, bringing the total at the end of the month to Dollars 43.46bn, Treasury figures showed yesterday. The underlying rise in the reserves was Dollars 25m.</p>

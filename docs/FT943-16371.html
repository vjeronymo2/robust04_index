			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Survey of Marmara (7): Tuna from a distant ocean - Profile of the country's leading processed seafood manufacturer It's the shoes that give him away. Most Turkish executives would not be seen dead in a pair of brown loafers in an office in the heart of Istanbul. But then Mr Haluk Arpad of Onen Sirketler Grubu is different from other businessmen. And as general manager of Turkey's leading processed seafood manufacturer, he probably feels more comfortable dressed as a seadog than a city slicker. The company, based in Canakkale on the Asian side of the Dardanelles, is Turkey's largest producer of canned tuna. It hopes for a stock exchange listing later this summer, under the name of Dardanel, its most famous brand. Audited figures are not available, but the company is estimated to have turned over Dollars 51m in 1993, more than double the sales of two years before. The company is the first entrant to the canned tuna market, and has an established brand name. Domestic markets for the product remain fairly immature, while the export opportunities seem vast. In addition the company has invested in state-of-the-art technology - the main reason for the flotation of what could be as much as a 20 per cent stake. All this may be a little surprising. For the tuna is not actually caught in the Dardanelles, which with the pollution of the Marmara Sea is not one of the region's cleanest stretches of water. The tuna is bought from Spanish and French deep sea fleets fishing the Indian Ocean. Mr Arpad makes a point of buying what is called EU origin fish - essential if the product wants to hit supermarket shelves in Europe, where the group makes 40 per cent of its total sales. The company is in many ways a pointer to the future. In contrast to the region's heavy industry, the Onen group represents the sort of medium-scale, labour-intensive industry which many analysts believe will be the big winners when Turkey eventually opens its markets and finds its real comparative advantage. 'There is no machine in the world that can clean a fish,' says Mr Arpad, pointing out the line of operators, most of them women, busily reducing massive chunks of tuna to the perfectly shaped fish wedges with which most consumers are more familiar. Location is important. The company has its own loading pier near the factory. There is also the advantage of low wage costs, which Mr Arpad estimates are probably a tenth of European levels. The workers he employs are paid on a premium basis, an incentive system which would probably not be allowed if the industry were unionised - another important commercial advantage. The company was started in 1983. It concentrated on frozen produce: shrimps for the Spanish market and baby clams and mussels for Italian buyers - all the seafood coming from local waters. While canned tuna is a relatively new line, the company has been exporting frozen produce for more than a decade and has good contacts with European traders. In 1994 the company expects its exports to be worth Dollars 35m, 65 per cent of which will be from the canned tuna factory. 'The European Union is a very big market,' says Mr Arpad. 'There's no quota and no import duty.' Unlike other processed food products such as tomatoes, seafood products do not suffer from EU quotas. Indeed, the company is selling canned tuna to France, Italy, Germany and the UK - it is selling under its own brand name to the French. A labelled product, which is canned with olive rather than vegetable oil and carries the words 'prodotto en Turchia' is now sold in Italy. Mr Arpad says penetrating the Italian market with own brands is all but impossible. In Germany and the UK, the company varies the strategy again, adding brine to the fish. The Germans, Mr Arpad says, tend to concentrate on price, not so much on quality. 'For that reason we prefer to sell there using their brands.' The company is now negotiating with a large Italian food distributor. 'In tuna we want to sell brands. Our Dardanel brand is now registered in all the European countries,' says Mr Arpad. It is also registered in Turkey, although he is less confident about being able to protect his intellectual property in his home market.</p>

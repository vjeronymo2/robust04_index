			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 2 GUYS OF 'GREATER TUNA' EXPOSE FOIBLES OF SMALL AND BIGGER TOWNS  </P> <P> Ever wonder what happened to Richard Nixon's Silent Majority -- the ones who  wanted to help make a better America for the "right" kind of people?  </P> <P> They're alive and well and living in "Greater Tuna," a sendup of the  third-smallest city in Texas by co-writers and actors Joe Sears and Jaston  Williams at the Lyceum Stage through April 2.  </P> <P> The cheerfully self-satisfied residents of Tuna include station OKKK  newscasters Thurston Wheelis and Arles Struvie, who couldn't be prouder of the  titles of this year's winning high school essays: "Human Rights, Why Bother?"  and "The Other Side of Bigotry."  </P> <P> And then there's Vera Carp, vice president of Smut Snatchers, an organization  determined to pull such words as "deflowered" and "nuts" from the dictionary.  Remarkably, these three and 17 others -- including an unadoptable perennial  canine of the week named Yippy -- are all played by Sears and Williams.  </P> <P> That the two know their terrain is a given. Both were out-of-work actors in  Austin, Tex., when they put this show together seven years ago. Later, Ed  Howard came on board as a director and co-writer and "Greater Tuna" has been  supporting them ever since.  </P> <P> Part of the "Greater Tuna" success story is obviously the skills of Sears and  Williams. Sears uses his beefy frame to take on the slow, solid citizens: the  depressed matrons, the cliche-ridden reverend, the menacing sheriff, the  insensitive husband, and he reveals surprising emotional depths in most of  them. The slightly built Williams buzzes around Sears with a series of children  and snappy, waspish and hapless adults, providing more of the stinging side of  the comedy.  </P> <P> But part of the success, too, is due to localizing small towns as figures of  small-minded fun. The laughter then takes on a spirit of exorcism as clever  urban audiences identify the problem as being outside them.  </P> <P> But, before you laugh too much, there is that apt phrase that Vera Carp  (Williams), the queen of smut snatchers said to Pearl Burras (Sears), dog  poisoner extraordinaire when Pearl criticizes Vera's boy: "Glass houses . . . "  The sad part is that you don't have to live in a small town in Texas to  champion censorship. You could be a well-to-do matron from a suburb of Detroit  like Terry Rakolta, whose protests of "Married . . . With Children" pulled  advertising support from the show. Or you could be the leader of Iran.  </P> <P> And when San Diego is a home to Tom Metzger and the Skinheads, how much of a  finger can you point at Elmer Watkins (Sears) addressing the Tuna chapter of  the KKK?  </P> <P> But the single most remarkable thing Sears and Williams make you do is care  even for the very people they are using for target practice. They can actually  take would-be book burner, Bertha Bumiller (Sears), and make you squirm when  the smart young interviewer (Williams) makes critical mincemeat of her beliefs  without her even suspecting.  </P> <P> Yes, Bertha tells the interviewer, she wants to ban "Romeo and Juliet" because  it shows a rampant disregard for parental authority and, besides, it encourages  teen-age sex.  </P> <P> But doesn't she know that "Romeo and Juliet" is by William Shakespeare? the  young man asks, rolling his eyes.  </P> <P> "Yes," she says. "And we're looking into his other works. . . . Didn't he write  'Barefoot in the Park?' "  </P> <P> But the joke turns sad when the young man leaves leaves smiling, because he has  such a good story, and Bertha sighs with relief.  </P> <P> "I'm glad he didn't ask about my family," Bertha says.  </P> <P> She's glad he didn't ask her about her son in reform school, her husband who  runs around on her, or her daughter who believes her life is over because she  never made cheerleader.  </P> <P> And, by the time Sears finishes Bertha's slow, measured, painful account of all  the things that have gone wrong for the woman in ways that she doesn't even  understand, one is close to tears for the very same person who seemed such a  deserving target of ridicule just a few moments before.  </P> <P> Moments like those save the script from being a one-joke show about Tuna to  being a portrait of a people who are not so few and far between as many might  like to believe.  </P> <P> "GREATER TUNA"  </P> <P> By Jaston Williams, Joe Sears and Ed Howard.

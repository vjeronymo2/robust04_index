			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COINS: WHAT IS CONSIDERED 'FAIR' MARKUP?  </P> <P> Question: As a result of your column, I subscribed to the Coin Dealer  Newsletter and discovered that I have been paying sizable premiums over the  quoted prices to my dealer. I realize that the quoted prices are for  "dealer-to-dealer" transactions, and that I can expect to pay a premium over  the quoted price. Here's my question: Is there an average markup that an  off-the-street buyer can expect to pay, or is the price whatever the traffic  will bear? What is considered fair in these transactions? -- J.T.  </P> <P> Answer: You've cut to the bone of coin collecting -- the relationship between  dealer and collector. There should be a feeling of mutual trust. The collector  should feel he is paying a fair price; the dealer should feel customer loyalty.  </P> <P> As a collector, you did the right thing by subscribing to the Coin Dealer  Newsletter. It was a way for you to verify prices. Some dealers will share  their price guide with collectors. Sometimes the dealer will reveal exactly  what he paid for a coin. That way, you know what the markup is.  </P> <P> A good dealer will pass good buys along to his customers. A good collector will  learn the fine points of numismatics, especially grading. That way, it won't be  necessary to ask what is fair. You'll know.  </P> <P> If you really want an education, try to sit in on some dealer-to-dealer  transactions. They really go at it. And when a deal is struck, you'll have a  pretty good idea what a particular coin is worth at that particular time.  </P> <P> Q: I have several coins that, as far as I can tell, do not have any mint marks.  They are two quarters dated 1965, one quarter dated 1966, one quarter dated  1978, two nickels dated 1973, one nickel dated 1964 and one penny dated 1980.  Are they worth more than face value? -- R.J.J.  </P> <P> A: Only regular U.S. coins dated 1964 and before contained silver. Your 1964  nickel is mostly copper and nickel. Wartime nickels (1942-45) did contain some  silver. Your coins, as you may have suspected, are just worth face value.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coin News  </P> <P> Mintages don't always tell the story regarding coin rarity. The 1893-S $1, for  example, had a mintage of 100,000 but only a handful of gems are known to  exist. The finest known (pictured) is graded Mint State 65 by the Numismatic  Guaranty Corp. It sold for $52,000 in 1978 and for $100,000 in 1980. It will be  featured in the Sussex Collection Sale in New York June 11 through 13.  Catalogues are $20 from Auctions by Bowers and Merena, Box 1224, Wolfeboro,  N.H. 03894.  </P> <P> Uncut currency sheets are an interesting method of collecting $1 Federal  Reserve notes. There are 32-note sheets for $47, 16-note sheets for $28 and  4-note sheets for $10.25. Shipment of currency from the Philadelphia Federal  Reserve will begin about April 15. Mail requests to the Bureau of Engraving and  Printing, Public Sales, Room 602-11A, 14th and C streets S.W., Washington, D.C.  20228.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coin Calendar  </P> <P>  Friday and Saturday -- Exhibitor space at the semi-annual Buena Park Coin and  Stamp Expo is sold out, with 80 dealers ready to buy, sell or trade everything  from coins and stamps to baseball cards, jewelry and related items.

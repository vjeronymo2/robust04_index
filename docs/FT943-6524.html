			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Arts: Wagner - discord and dynasty / Bayreuth, the world's most celebrated music festival, is the focus of a bitter family struggle This story is better than any soap opera, and it still has a long way to run. It is about the Wagner clan - a dynasty at loggerheads over an inheritance. The current head of the clan is Wolfgang, who has just published his autobiography and celebrates his 75th birthday tomorrow. The treasure he guards is the Bayreuth Festival, founded by his grandfather in 1876. The supporting cast is a gaggle of next-generation Wagners, hoping to grab a share of the inheritance when Wolfgang dies. The festival has long been Wolfgang's personal fief. He chooses the artists, welcomes visiting dignitaries, holds forth in a thick Franconian accent from the stage curtain, and is a formidable presence behind the scenes. Together with his elder brother Wieland, he revived the festival after the second world war, freeing it of its disastrous association with Nazism. He has run it alone since Wieland's death in 1966. Bayreuth has been his life. For all who work at the festival, Wolfgang is an avuncular, silver-haired figure, who knows his grandfather's operas inside out. To his many critics and enemies, he is the Bayreuth blockhead: stupid, arrogant, mulish and greedy. His family liken him to Fafner hoarding the gold in The Ring - a dragon who will not let them near the treasure. Wolfgang's autobiography, Acts*, is his attempt to set the record straight - before his children, nephews and nieces (all aged around 50) publish their own bitter versions of the truth. It is a catalogue of gossip and self-justification, a settling of old scores, a pent-up reaction to years of sniping at him and his second wife Gudrun. He calls it an interim report, a statement of accounts, 'as one who is still an active and creative participant'. His own Bayreuth productions may be old hat, but he will probably carry on working until he dies. Despite a jumbled narrative and much pedantic detail, Acts is easy to read - but it is unlikely to enhance Wolfgang's reputation. This is no memoir of a worldly-wise philosopher who has risen above the fray, nor does it adequately reflect his vast knowledge and experience. Never having harboured intellectual pretensions, Wolfgang gives a skimpy analysis of the festival's artistic development. He was always the Handwerker, the plodding journeyman more concerned with safeguarding the archives, balancing the books and consolidating the fabric of the Festspielhaus, than conjuring new artistic visions in the manner of his elder brother. The book underlines the long shadow which Wieland has cast over Wolfgang's life. It opens, perversely, with a detailed description of the atmosphere and intrigues surrounding Wieland's death. Wolfgang's claim that their relationship was based on brotherly love carries little conviction. He scolds Wieland for trying to sell priceless manuscripts in 1945, for rejecting their English-born mother after the war, for excluding him from the 'fireside chats' at which Wieland decided artistic policy with his cronies. Reading between the lines, one senses Wolfgang's resentment: from their earliest childhood, Wieland was the anointed one. So the picture of Wieland that emerges is cool and compromised. The only references that carry weight are when Wolfgang describes his brother as 'incapable of handling financial matters properly', and says Wieland's affair with the young Anja Silja was sparked by her unerring feel for his theatrical ideas. Wolfgang's vituperative attacks on Wieland's wife and children are tame compared to the hostility he shows towards his late sister Friedelind. Like the younger-generation Wagners today, her pot-shots from the sidelines were a constant embarrassment. Wolfgang says he never possessed 'the fabulous brilliance and absolute predestination characteristic of many other members of the Wagner family. These qualities seem to preclude their involvement in subordinate activities, but have often prompted them to lay vehement but unjustified claim to positions of paramount authority'. And that is why he has done everything he can to stop the next generation succeeding him. For Wolfgang, the survival of the festival is more important than the continuing involvement of the Wagner family. 'The mere statement 'I am a Wagner' has long ceased to be an open sesame.' In his eyes, none of the younger Wagners has the necessary training or proved their qualifications independently - and few observers would disagree. Much of the book seems an apology for the irrevocable breach in relations with his son Gottfried and daughter Eva, children of his first wife Ellen. Apart from Gudrun and his parents, the only member of the family to merit affection is his 16-year old daughter Katharina. The book is a poor reflection of Wolfgang's better side - his openness, his sense of duty, his ability to inspire team spirit - but it does offer some interesting nuggets. The only time the festival orchestra ever went on strike was in reaction to an outburst of abuse from Toscanini in 1931. Free tickets were handed out for some performances in the early 1950s, because there was insufficient demand from the paying public - a far cry from today. When asked to stage the centenary Ring, Peter Stein wanted the four parts condensed to two. Wolfgang also reveals that the 1981 Ponnelle Tristan (for which he shows little regard) was the most expensive production ever staged at Bayreuth. Walter Legge, Peter Hall and Georg Solti ('downright aggressive') are the target of predictable brickbats. Hitler, who made the first of many visits to the Wagner household in 1923, is let off lightly. There are good anecdotes about Knappertsbusch and Karajan, who demanded his own WC and headed his correspondence from the Festspielhaus with the word 'management'. The dull account of Bayreuth's recent history is leavened by shafts of dogged realism: 'If something misfired, the public tended to lay the blame at my door; if it succeeded, I had no part in its success.' One of the book's leitmotifs is the unwavering wisdom of Bayreuth's civic leaders, and their ability to serve the festival's best interests. Most of Wolfgang's life has been dedicated to that same purpose. When the time comes to choose a successor, Wolfgang will probably not be around to influence the decision. Under the statutes of the Richard Wagner Foundation, which Wolfgang and his mother set up in 1973 to preserve the festival's independence and protect it from family in-fighting, candidates from the Wagner family must be considered, but there is ample leeway to appoint an outsider. Gudrun, 50, is a possibility - the festival has a history of widows inheriting the mantle of power. However, most Bayreuth observers reckon she will not command enough support within the foundation, which is dominated by public funding bodies. The most likely outcome is that an experienced intendant will be brought in. The link with the Wagner family will be cut. It will be the end of Bayreuth as we know it. *Acts by Wolfgang Wagner.

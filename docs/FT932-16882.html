			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Nigeria pressed to end petrol subsidy The Nigerian government is under increasing pressure to begin phasing out its petroleum price subsidy, Paul Adams reports from Lagos. In the past two weeks, anticipation of the price rise has spurred the racketeering which causes much of the domestic supply of 300,000 barrels a day to be smuggled abroad. A tanker of fuel worth N40,000 at official prices can fetch N1.2m in neighbouring Francophone states. Mr Philip Asiodu, the oil minister in the transitional council, acknowledged to industry leaders yesterday that the price rise was necessary to stop the chronic mismanagement of Nigeria's oil assets.</p>

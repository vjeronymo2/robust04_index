			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Barbara Palombelli: "`Ministers From Outside Our </F> Ranks Too'; Berlusconi Looks `Beyond' Majority"]    [Excerpts] Rome -- "I hope that it will be possible to  implement properly Article 92 [of the Constitution], which  asserts the prime minister-designate's full responsibility for  choosing the government team. And I hope I will be able to  depend on ministers from outside the majority too, both men and  women. But for the present there are no definite names; the  ones that I have seen in the newspapers are fruits of the  imagination..." The only certainty is that Silvio Berlusconi,  interviewed by journalists outside his house yesterday evening,  is furious with Mario Segni [Pact for Italy leader], (who  ironically was at that very moment issuing an official  communique declaring his "close attention" to Berlusconi). He  said: "That fellow says all kinds of things; nothing of what he  says corresponds to the truth. Segni questions himself and  provides his own answers. There have been no approaches to him,  and we do not intend to make any... With regard to the Popular  Party [PPI], we remain open to a dialogue... And as for De  Mita, who demanded a rejection of the National Alliance, my  reply is that ours is a compact alignment, and we are people who  concern themselves with specifics. We have obtained the Italian  people's support and we will govern. We will not have any  second thoughts. Of course, I have discovered that politics has  a pace of its own, which is different from what I thought."  [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, attorney Vittorio Dotti has gained the post of  deputy speaker of the lower house; the decision was made  yesterday afternoon. Berlusconi appreciates the cooperation of  his allies. He feels more secure with his lawyer at the head of  the lower house. And the Justice Ministry remains free...  "There is time," Berlusconi said yesterday morning. "How long  it takes to form the government will depend on the consultations  that will be started in the next few days by the president and  on his decisions. For our part, if we have responsibilities as  the pole for freedom, it will take time to decide. We will not  follow the principle of the spoils system. I do not think that  speed is the most important thing."    We will not follow the principle of the spoils system. That  means that no one can yet be certain of being appointed. No one  knows what hat he will wear and what role he will play. The  only certainties, apart from the top positions of Berlusconi,  Tatarella, and Maroni, are that Berlusconi wants Cesare Previti  as his right-hand man at the Interior Ministry (or the Justice  Ministry, as a second choice). That he definitely wants to find  another position for Tiziana Parenti, if not in the government,  then in one of the most important of the parliamentary  committees (perhaps the Anti-Mafia Committee) which commands  definite prestige and a prominent image. That he attaches great  importance to a Family Ministry and very much hopes that his  program can receive the approval of a sector of the PPI. This  morning he will officially offer them a deputy speakership of  the lower house and the chairmanship of important committees in  the lower house and the Senate. Also today Berlusconi will meet  with Marco Pannella, and will ask him directly to choose: Forza  Italia can offer him a post as EC commissioner for himself  and/or the chairmanship of the television watchdog committee for  Mario Taradash. "There are only six of them and they want seven  things..." one of the officials in charge of the negotiations  commented drily.    The League and the National Alliance do not want Pannella in  the government (as they confirmed yesterday very clearly) and  Berlusconi cannot do much to change their minds. Another  obstacle being dealt with confidentially is the issue of whether  the former Christian Democrats of the CCD [Christian Democratic  Center] should enter the government. There are those who are  not in favor of granting a prominent position to Clemente  Mastella (who said: "I have no government ambitions; all I want  to do is to engage in politics..." However, he added  resentfully: "But it must be clearly understood that we will  not accept any prejudices.") "Thoroughbred" League members will  not accept on the team anyone too easily identified with  previous majorities,. "but Clemente is such a nice fellow;  everybody likes him..." according to Forza Italia members.  However, the final decision lies with the likely prime  minister. Meanwhile, it is certain that Mastella will be the  CCD's lower house floor leader. When it comes to sharing one  post between two, there will be problems for the Liberals, too.  Some members of the majority have made two calculations: "Three  Liberals have been elected -- Scognamiglio, Costa, and Biondi.  We cannot have all three of them in the country's  leadership..."

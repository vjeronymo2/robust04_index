			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / De-regulation leads to Sharp increase in level of rents in England DE-REGULATION of the private rented housing sector has led to a sharp increase in the level of rents in England, according to a government survey published yesterday, John Willman writes. An Environment Department survey on private renting shows that the average rent for all tenancies in 1990 was Pounds 43 a week, compared with Pounds 30 a week in 1988. This 43 per cent increase followed the deregulation of rents on new tenancies in 1988. Of the 1.6m private tenancies in 1990, 483,000 had been created following the 1988 Act. Rent levels for these new tenancies were much higher than the average for all tenancies - Pounds 66 a week on average for assured shorthold tenancies. According to the survey the age and occupational profile of private tenants is changing. The proportion of tenants under 30 rose from 29 per cent to 35 per cent between 1988 and 1990, while those aged 60 and over fell from 33 per cent to 28 per cent. Private Renting in England in 1990.

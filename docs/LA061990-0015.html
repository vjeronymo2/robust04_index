			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> 'Alien' Rescue: In the tradition of "Star Trek" and "Beauty and the Beast," a  group of fans is trying to save Fox Television's canceled "Alien Nation."  </P> <P> Viewers for Quality Television is launching a grass-roots effort to encourage  fans to write 20th Century Fox President Barry Diller and ask him not to cancel  the show. "Alien Nation" is the only Fox series on the VQT list of supported  shows. Spokeswoman Dorothy Swanson said, "VQT feels that Fox made a tactical  and public relations mistake in canceling this quality show, and believes that,  with another chance, 'Alien Nation' could turn into a solid hit for that  network."

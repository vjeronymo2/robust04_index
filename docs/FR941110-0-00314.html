			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several changes have been made in &sect;&sect;905.1008/906.8 ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purchaser eligibility and selection <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). In response to comments, the final rule allows HAs more flexibility concerning how they may wish to formulate the particulars of the eligibility and preference provisions of their homeownership plans. It also incorporates a number of clarifications and editorial revisions, including reordering the paragraphs in a more logical sequence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In paragraph (b) of these sections, language has been inserted to make it clear that Turnkey III homebuyers (and, in the case of IHAs, Mutual Help homebuyers as well) are within the overall class of public or Indian housing residents who are eligible to purchase under the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program, should they elect to terminate their existing homebuyer agreements in favor of purchase under a Section 5(h) plan. A homeownership plan might thus allow Turnkey III or Mutual Help homebuyers the individual option to switch over to Section 5(h) purchase of their present homes. As another possibility, a plan might allow such a homebuyer to vacate the present Turnkey III or Mutual Help unit and purchase a vacant unit that is offered for sale under the Section 5(h) plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment objected to the option to include Section 8 residents. The Department believes that the statute was intended to allow that option, at HA discretion, subject to the minimum residency requirement and the requirements for admission to public or Indian housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter objected to the 30-day minimum residency requirement, while another suggested that a minimum one-year period be prescribed. Because Section 5(h) of the Act authorizes an HA to sell to ``its tenants'', some initial period of public or Indian housing or Section 8 residency is a statutory precondition for purchaser eligibility, and the Department believes that 30 days is the shortest period that satisfies the statute. Each HA is, however, free to include in its homeownership plan a longer minimum period for such tenure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One objection was expressed about the further option (as now reflected in paragraph (c) of these sections) for the HA to extend eligibility to applicants who are not public or Indian housing or Section 8 residents at the time of application, subject to the preference for existing public and Indian housing residents and the requirement for a minimum period of public or Indian housing residency prior to conveyance. The Department believes that the HA should have this option to extend eligibility to families on its waiting lists, or to other low-income families who may wish to apply, or to both of those categories, if the HA considers that they are needed to make up a sufficient pool of eligible applicants for purchase of the vacant units that will be offered for sale. Such nonresident applicants would also be subject to the requirements for admission to public or Indian housing, including the income limits and Federal preferences for admission, as prescribed by applicable regulations. (Those admission requirements do not, however, apply to applicants who are already residents of public or Indian housing.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

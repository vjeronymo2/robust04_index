			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 2 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Jaime Serra Puche,  Commerce and Industrial Development Secretary, reiterated today  his country's stance favoring other nations' joining the North  American Free Trade Agreement under the condition that this be  done with clear place-of-origin regulations.    Mexico supports the expansion of the treaty as long as  confusion about the place of origin is avoided, the official  stated while inaugurating the two-day ministerial meeting of the  Latin American Economic System (SELA). In his inaugural speech,  Serra Puche recalled that the text of the treaty that entered  into force on 1 January includes Article 2204 that considers the  possibility that another country or group of countries may join  the North American commercial zone.    Serra Puche explained that with the proliferation of  bilateral agreements there will be different regulations on the  place of origin, which may cause a triangulation and hamper  regional commerce. He stressed that commercial liberalism among  the countries that become joined with clear and stable rules  yields the benefits of assured access to markets and the design  of long-term projects in companies.    It also allows, he said, a broad and varied demand and the  use of more efficient scales of cooperation and of a broad range  of technological options that favor productive flexibility.  "The increase in competitiveness stimulates investments,  promotes an increase in exports, and creates productive and  remunerated jobs, something that entails economic growth," the  secretary indicated.    Mexico is not on the sidelines of these processes, and in  1990 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari voiced his concern  about insufficiencies regarding integration and proposed  specific measures to expand the Latin American market, he added.    The commerce and industrial development secretary noted that  the establishment of multinational economic openings responds to  the demands of the world economy and the permanent search to  raise the competitiveness of the countries of the region. As  proof of that, he said, we have the negotiations that have been  started with several area countries, which led to a free trade  agreement with Chile.    The official announced that, within the framework of the  Ibero-American Summit to be held in Cartagena de Indias,  President Salinas de Gortari will sign on 13 June the G-3 [Group  of Three] trade agreement with his Colombian and Venezuelan  counterpart.    Trade negotiations with the Central American countries are  continuing, and the negotiations with Bolivia may conclude in  the coming weeks, he added. On the trade agreement with Chile,  Serra Puche commented that, according to a joint evaluation  commission, there has been a two-way flow of exchange amounting  to 86 percent since the treaty entered into force in 1992.    During the ministerial meeting taking place at the Foreign  Secretariat with representatives from 27 countries, Serra Puche  pointed to the role SELA plays as the appropriate forum to  reflect on the challenges that Latin American integration  entails.</p>

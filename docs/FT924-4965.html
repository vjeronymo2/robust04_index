			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Business wants pay rises to stay under 3.5% THE head of Germany's industrial federation said in a newspaper interview published yesterday that wages should increase no more than 3.5 per cent, about the expected level of inflation for the coming year, AP reports from Berlin. Several large unions are in wage negotiations or preparing for them while the German economy is on the brink of recession, and the public sector workers' union, which struck for 11 days last spring, has announced an unexpectedly low bid for 5 per cent pay increases. Mr Tyll Necker, president of the Federation of German Industry, was quoted in the mass-circulation Bild newspaper as saying 3.5 per cent should be the upper limit of wage rises because inflation is expected to be at that level. Asked about possible strikes, Mr Necker replied: 'Resistance against excessive claims of the unions is far higher in the current economic situation than in boom times. 'With zero (economic) growth there is nothing to share out.' The steel industry last week offered 3 per cent raises during talks with the IG Metall steel union, which is demanding 7.5 per cent. The public sector workers' union said on Friday it would seek 5 per cent increases for its 2.1m workers. The union, the second largest after IG Metall, is a pace-setter for wage negotiations, and its initial demand was considerably lower than the 6.5 per cent demanded by the bank workers' union.</p>

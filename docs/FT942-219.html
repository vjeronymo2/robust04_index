			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Saudis shock Belgium to qualify with Holland Saudi Arabia produced one of the most unexpected results of the opening round of the World Cup finals yesterday when they toppled previously unbeaten Group F favourites Belgium 1-0. Their winning goal came after only five minutes when Saeed Owairan burst from an unmarked position in his own half to carve open the Belgian defence with a spectacular run and emphatic finishing shot. It was the first goal conceded by Belgium in the tournament and ensured that the Saudis qualified for the second round. In Orlando, Holland swept through, beating Morocco 2-1. Bryan Roy, who had been on the pitch just 11 minutes, scored the winner in the 78th minute, gratefully snapping up a chance provided by Dennis Bergkamp, who had earlier scored the first Dutch goal.</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Central Asian republics join trade grouping FIVE FORMER Soviet central Asian republics along with Afghanistan at the weekend joined the Economic Co-operation Organisation (ECO), a grouping which was established by Pakistan, Iran and Turkey to expand mutual trade and business ventures. The five are Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Tajikistan is also seeking ECO membership but was unable to send a representative to the Islamabad ceremony. Pakistani officials are optimistic that, with a total population of 300m, the ECO member countries have a market which is sizeable enough to support new initiatives. However, some western experts have expressed concern in recent months over the rise of a new Islamic bloc after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Pakistani officials and representatives from other member countries who attended the weekend meeting denied that the ECO would emerge as such a bloc which would threaten other countries. Mr Sheharyar Khan, the Pakistani foreign secretary, said: 'This is not an Islamic bloc. This is an economic bloc. We are all Islamic countries but we are focusing on economic co-operation'.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Much more than a facade Sir, Observer falls into the error ('Directorless', November 30) of regarding the IoD's building in Pall Mall merely as an administrative headquarters. Behind its historic facade is a heavily used, modern business centre at which, every day, businessmen and women transact business with customers, suppliers and clients. Far from being a burden, our Pall Mall facilities are central to the service the IoD offers to its members, and make a substantial contribution to its revenues. The challenge for my successor will be to build on its present success. Peter Morgan, director general, Institute of Directors, 116 Pall Mall, London SW1Y 5ED</p>

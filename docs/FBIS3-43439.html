Andrew Trench has details:    ANC Transkei media officer Nat Serache confirms the contents  of a scathingly critical ANC report which reveals the  organization in the homeland is in a mess. The report is of a  visit to Transkei by ANC Deputy Secretary General Jacob in  September and October 1993. The report reveals an ANC mired by  organizational ineptitude, a lack of administration, and  describes a leadership fraught with rival factions. The report  warns that if the ANC's problems in Transkei are not sorted out,  it could face a disaster in the elections. Serache also confirms  that last month drastic action was taken to solve the problems.  At the organization's regional congress all but one of the top  officials were ousted by delegates. Serache says the new  leaders are trying to pull the ANC back on track, but he  concedes they have their work cut out for them.</p>

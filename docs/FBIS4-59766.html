			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] The destiny of and the belief in Yemeni unity  continues to capture the feelings of Yemenis. It is an  irrevocable fate. It is an objective we achieved after struggle  and a long wait. The objective of unity has been realized and  has achieved victory. It is now becoming firm and strong,  deeply rooted in hearts and the land. Unity is spreading  through time. How can we say no, while we watch the unionist  heroes from the forces of unity and legitimacy brand unity with  sweat, effort, steadfastness, and the unionists' march forward?  We see the unionist citizens welcoming them with joy and  support, united with them in all love and appreciation, and with  all joy and belief in unity. We witnessed this in al-Dali',  Abyan, Lahij, and other places. They are scenes that prove a  belief in unity and a concern about it continuing, regardless of  sacrifices and no matter how much the gangs of apostasy and  secession try to harm it or hide from its overwhelming light in  the burrows of apostasy, the dens of secession, and the  labyrinths of their wicked conspiracy.    With the amazing and delightful scenes that shine with the  brightness of unity and love for it and faith in it, we hear  support and see the rallying around Constitutional legitimacy  and unionist leadership. We hear it, with satisfaction and  peace of mind, in the cable from the people of al-Dali' to  President Leader Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of  the Armed Forces. This cable disproves and silences all claims  by the horns of apostasy and secession and puts their feet back  in their mouths. The cable throws a stone at the secessionists  and defies the evils of the secessionists. It is a cable that  radiates with a right that cannot be avoided. It follows the  road that cannot be changed and seeks to achieve the same  objective we have.    Perhaps what makes the issue deeper and clearer are the  statements by the citizens to the Yemeni Television cameras,  expressing their joy about the defeat of the positions of  apostasy, removing the traces of secession, destroying the dens  of partitioning, and defeating the remnants of the losing  secessionist conspiracy, whose price has been paid.    The citizens' words express their belief in unity and their  adherence to it as an objective, a fate, and a hope that all the  good people of Yemen sought to achieve. There is no argument  that the leadership that believes in Yemeni unity and is the  representative of Constitutional legitimacy expressed the hopes  of the citizens and translated the feelings of all the people.  It did so when President Leader Lieutenant General 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and  supreme commander of the Armed forces, instructed the minister  of defense to destroy all the positions that are linked to  partitioning, or show signs of it, and to erase all traces of  division and separation between the one Yemeni land and the one  people. Yes, they are instructions that express the feelings of  every Yemeni, translates his will and shows his fate.  Therefore, the unionist forces along with the unionist masses  in all areas embarked on destroying all these traces based on  Salih's instructions. They translated these instruction into a  tangible reality, out of their faith that this is right and is  what the people want. All signs, events, actions, stands, and  words show without any doubt that unity is rooted in the depths  of the hearts and land, and is spreading through time. It will  continue to reap its benefits everywhere and at all  times--benefits that will not stop. The people will enjoy its  benefits every time and will persistently defend its generosity  in any circumstance.    How can we say no, when unity is the greater objective and  the irrevocable fate? It is the dream we achieved through  sacrifices and struggle and through the perseverance and faith  of the heroic men -- men who fulfilled what they had promised.  They achieved the promise and lived up to the pledge, They gave  birth to unity for all Yemen from the depths of time on the  great day of 22 May. Here are the sons of all Yemen continuing  to care for, protect, and defend it with all love, sincerity,  faith and insistence, despite the gangs of apostasy and  secession.    Therefore, we are sure that the parasites of the gangs of  secessionism will be uprooted from the land, God willing.  Moreover, the apostasy will be disintegrated by the brightness  of the sun of unity. God is with right and its people and with  unity and those who protect it. God supports those who are  sincere and faithful, defeats the liars and renegades, and  destroys those who defy God's will and deviate from the masses'  consensus.    Seest thou not how God sets forth a parable? A goodly word  like a goodly tree whose root is firmly fixed and its branches  reach to the heavens. It brings forth its fruit at all times,  by the leave of its lord. So God sets forth parables for men,  in order that they may receive admonition. And the parable of an  evil word is that of an evil tree. It is torn up by the root  from the surface of the Earth. It has no stability. God will  establish in strength those who believe, with the word that  stands firm, in this world and in the hereafter; but God will  leave, to stray, those who do wrong; God does what he wills.

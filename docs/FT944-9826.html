			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Consensus is way forward to a minimum wage Sir, In his article on the TUC's budget submission ('TUC demands Pounds 1bn boost for employment', November 7), Robert Taylor was good enough to report my remarks on GMTV the previous day that the level of a national minimum wage would need to be 'set in the light of the economic circumstances at the time' of its introduction. However, this was just part of the picture. First, the minimum wage should be fixed at around half male median earnings, a position which has been TUC policy since 1991. Second, the social partners should be consulted by government before the precise level is fixed. Third, there is a constructive role for trade unions to play in monitoring its implementation and enforcement. The hourly rate has dominated much of the debate to date on a national minimum wage. But there are far-reaching institutional questions which arise from the commitment. Our intention in the year ahead is both to campaign against low pay and to build some consensus with employers on the way forward. That we are making progress can be seen from the recent survey by the Engineering Employers' Federation, which found 40 per cent of its members favoured the introduction of a national minimum wage.

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Aspects that may shape investor choice - The recovery potential of the hotel and leisure sector THE 70,000 shareholders in Queens Moat Houses and Resort Hotels might be forgiven for choosing to ignore stock market talk of the recovery potential in the hotel and leisure sector. Trading in the shares of the two groups was suspended in March and July respectively - in each case while their financial positions were examined. Yet the sector has still managed to outperform the rest of the stock market for most of the year, buoyed by increasingly bullish research from analysts. Mr Paul Slattery, at Kleinwort Benson, the stockbroker, says: 'The strong share price performances by hotel stocks so far in 1993, in spite of the horrors of the two suspensions, indicates the extent to which investors have put their faith in recovery.' Queens Moat shares were suspended after the group failed to make a Pounds 7m preference dividend payment. It has since negotiated a standstill of its Pounds 1bn debts. Only three of the original 16-member board remain as directors. Resort, meanwhile, has followed Queens Moat's lead and called in independent accountants to examine its books after concerns arose over what the company called 'a number of financing and reporting issues'. The suspension of two of the sector's most visible companies comes at what many analysts see as the end of one of the industry's most traumatic periods. As the recession bit, the receiver became the second largest hotel owner in the country amid a slump in earnings and a jump in debts. Investors also suffered dividend cuts. Forte, the UK's largest quoted hotel group, reduced its dividend payment in April for the first time in 20 years. Despite this, demand for hotel stocks has been growing. However, the sector's problems have undoubtedly changed investors' stock selection. One fund manager said that while the recovery potential of the hotel sector was undeniable, committing funds to it had become more challenging. 'Investors are now much more sensitive to the quality of management,' he says. On the other hand, Mr Peter Hilliar at BZW, the stockbroker, believes investor confidence has been left largely unscathed. He says it is the banks which are reluctant to return to the sector, having been burdened with numerous bad debts from bankrupt hotels. However, evidence of a recovery in the hotel market remains debatable and is firmly handcuffed to any revival in the domestic economy. Industry observers suggest that the London market has hardened in the last quarter. Room demand is some 8 per cent up, although achieved room rates have fallen slightly as hoteliers offer budget deals to make up the seasonal shortfall in business users. The combined impact on revenue is moderately positive, according to one hotel company director. But the same executive admits that the provinces remain 'flat and soggy'. Most industry analysts accept that recovery will be sluggish this year, although London business should be buoyed by an increase in US tourists. There is also talk of inflation-busting price increases being pushed through in the 2-star bracket. An industry-wide acceleration in business is predicted in 1994, with much improved profits being delivered in 1995. Concluding that the industry 'is facing a better outlook than at any time over the last four years,' BZW forecasts that earnings for the quoted hoteliers will grow by 45 per cent this year and 40 per cent the year after, compared with market averages of 15 and 16 per cent respectively. Not everyone in the leisure market agrees. Hefty turnover in Forte and Ladbroke shares on the London market in recent weeks is testimony to a classic two-way pull, as those looking to buy for the recovery have been met by a wave of sellers untrusting of the troubled sector. For instance, a 2 per cent stake in Forte recently sold into the market by one institution was snapped up by another, pushing turnover to 29m shares in one day, the highest ever daily volume in Forte shares. Mr Jason Holden, at NatWest Securities, which last week reiterated its 'sell' advice on Forte, remains cautious over the sector's recovery prospects. 'We do not doubt that trading profits are set to improve, but the hotel industry post the recession is going to be fundamentally different to that of the glory days of the late 1980s. Some in the stock market have not yet taken this on board.' The 1980s saw the sector being driven as much by asset price inflation as by the fundamentals of the hotel business. Many in the market believe that after the recession, with asset inflation virtually eliminated, investor attention will shift in favour of other criteria in judging performance. Most analysts believe that those companies with realistically-valued assets in their balance sheets will do best. In addition, low-cost business hotels with strong brands, such as Forte's Travel Lodge and Whitbread's Travel Inn, are seen as having the best margins against the luxury end of the market. Added to an experienced and visible management to reassure the more nervous investor, these are the aspects of the business likely to shape investor choice. Stakis, which has taken the pain of over-priced assets in its balance sheet recently, has crept on to several brokers' 'buy' lists in recent weeks. The shares, which stood at 111p four years ago, have recovered from their low-point of 22p some 18 months ago and have climbed to 59p. Friendly Hotels, which has suffered on the back of Resort's suspension, has ridden criticisms that its management is not visible enough, and the shares have also gathered support lately. Valuation worries continue to surround Forte and Ladbroke, although the former wins most specialists' vote for its strong brands and management changes. Although by no means unanimous, many analysts believe the rebound in Forte's profits will be strong. Smith New Court, the stockbroker, is forecasting a more than doubling of profits at Forte over the next two years - a figure it agrees is 'aggressive'. However, Smith's Mr Bruce Jones asserts: 'Our estimates may be six months too early. But the sector is on the turn. The profit bounce potential at Forte is considerable.'</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG EIGHT ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NEBRASKA BURIES MINNESOTA, 48-0  </P> <P> Ken Clark ran 18 times for 100 yards and two touchdowns Saturday night as No. 3  Nebraska avoided a slow start for the first time this season and beat  Minnesota, 48-0, at Minneapolis.  </P> <P> Clark has rushed for 398 yards in three games and has 2,239 career yards,  moving him from 11th to seventh on the Nebraska list. No. 6 is Jeff Kinney with  2,244 yards.  </P> <P> Darrell Thompson, Minnesota's all-time rusher with 3,530 yards, was held to 45  yards in 17 carries.  </P> <P> Although Minnesota (1-1) leads the series 29-19-2, the Cornhuskers (3-0) have  won the last 13 contests since 1960, including an 84-13 victory in 1983 in  their only other visit to the Metrodome. In their last nine meetings, the  Cornhuskers have outscored Minnesota, 433-58.  </P> <P> It was the Gophers' worst loss since Oklahoma beat them, 63-0, in the second  game of 1986.  </P> <P> The Cornhuskers were tied, 17-17, at halftime in their opener before beating  Northern Illinois, 48-17, and they trailed Utah, 13-7, before winning, 42-30,  last week.  </P> <P> But the Gophers had no such success, gaining just 52 yards in the first half,  including minus-two passing.  </P> <P> After Brent Herbel's 33-yard punt in the second quarter, Nebraska took over at  the Minnesota 37 and scored five plays later on a 26-yard pass from Gerry  Gdowski to Richard Bell with 3:50 left in the half.  </P> <P> Gdowski completed 10 of 15 passes for 180 yards. Bell caught five passes for  121 yards.  </P> <P> Chris Drennan made a 42-yard field goal and Leodis Flowers scored on a one-yard  dive to give Nebraska a 34-0 lead after three quarters. Flowers added a 37-yard  touchdown run in the fourth and Mark Dowse added a seven-yard scoring run in  the fourth.  </P> <P> Texas Tech 31, Oklahoma St. 15 -- Quarterback Jamie Gill came off the bench to  direct three second-half scoring drives, and backup tailback Anthony Lynn  rushed for 97 yards and two touchdowns as the Red Raiders won at Stillwater,  Okla.  </P> <P> Second-string quarterback Jason Rattan started in place of Gill and led the Red  Raiders (3-0) to a 10-9 halftime lead. But Gill, who had injured his hip last  week, led three drives that buried the Cowboys. Gill wound up completing six of  seven passes for 110 yards.  </P> <P> Oklahoma State (0-3) forced four Red Raider turnovers but couldn't take  advantage, settling for two of Cary Blanchard's three field goals. Quarterback  Mike Gundy also scored on a one-yard run when the game was out of reach.  </P> <P> Northern Illinois 37, Kansas State 20 -- Linebacker James Matlock's pass  interception robbed the Wildcats of their momentum in the fourth quarter to  lead the Huskies at Manhattan, Kan.  </P> <P> The loss, Kansas State's third this season, extended the nation's longest major  college winless streak to 30 games and the longest losing streak to 16.  </P> <P> Northern Illinois is 2-1.  </P></p>

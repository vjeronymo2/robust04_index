			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Pyongyang today  refuted a report made by the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) that the discharge of spent fuel from a nuclear power  reactor has now made it impossible to select fuel rods for later  measurements.    A spokesman for the General Department of the Atomic Energy  of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said the  operation to discharge the spent fuel in the five megawatt  nuclear power reactor started from early may for technical or  safety reasons, the NODONG SINMUN reported today.    The whole process is under strict containment and  surveillance by the IAEA which installed four monitoring  cameras, he said.    "Our core refueling operations are being done in such a  manner to maintain the ability to take measurements later," the  spokesman was quoted as saying by the KCNA NEWS AGENCY.    He described claims that those later measurements will be  very difficult as an attempt to internationalize and politicize  a technical issue to pursue a "sinister political purpose."    "If some officials of the agency secretariat declare that  the  technical possibility of the future measurement of the fuel rods  has been lost, we have to take a decisive countermeasure," he  said.    The spokesman urged the IAEA secretariat to return to a fair  position that is conducive to the settlement of the nuclear  issue in the Korean peninsula.</p>

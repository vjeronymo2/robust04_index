Skaarup: "Numbers </F> Employed in PET Have Grown by 733 Percent"]    [Text] The secret part of the police force, the PET [Police  Intelligence Service], has been growing in explosive fashion,  unnoticed, since the service was set up 41 years ago. Its job  is to prevent attacks on state security. The earliest figures  available are from 1958, and from 1958 to 1992 the number of  policemen in the PET has risen from 33 to 242.    That represents an increase of 733 percent. By comparison,  the police force as a whole has grown by only 153 percent over  the same period, figures reached by SONDAGS POLITIKEN's study of  the police staff analyses.    The more policemen employed at the PET, the greater the  proportion of police working according to methods and budgets  which are so secret that not even the Folketing's special  control committee can find out anything about them. Only the  very broad guidelines for the PET's work are presented to the  committee.    A number of former justice ministers with whom SONDAGS  POLITIKEN has been in touch say that the growth in the PET's  staffing levels, and hence budget, has taken place without  political interference.    "It is not the result of a politically driven wish to  increase the staffing of the PET. It is a plan adopted by  successive Danish commissioners of police, and one which I am in  fact quite happy with. The world is after all no less troubled  than it ever was," former Justice Minister Hans Engell (KFP  [Conservative Party]) said.    Between 1982 and 1992 alone the numbers of crime police  employed in the PET grew from 100 to 143. Of all the  departments under the commissioner for police, that  unquestionably makes the PET the one to have received most new  resources. The flying squad, which helps the regional police  forces to tackle the most serious crimes, has grown from only 68  to 75 employees over the 10-year period. Another equally  hard-pressed department, the fraud squad, has had its strength  built up by a mere two detectives to a total of 32.    Chief Constable Birgitte Stampe, PET, justifies part of the  growth in the service's personnel by citing two technical  factors: A number of PET police were previously paid by the  ordinary police force, but were later transferred to the PET's  payroll. And since 1983 the PET has had to guard the members of  the royal family and carry out other guard duties for people at  risk. That takes 30 bodyguards. "Although I cannot give you  any figures, it is true that these factors do not entirely  account for the growth in personnel. But the remainder can be  explained by the fact that intelligence work today requires more  staff than before. That is the threat assessment picture," PET  boss Birgitte Stampe said.</p>

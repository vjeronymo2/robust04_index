			<p>BFN     [Text] The security forces, in an operation code named  Jayamaga against the LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam],  began their task to extend the Army's area of control by  (?acquiring) 75 square km in the Vavuniya District. A military  spokesman told LANKAPUVATH that the troops -- directed from  (Aptran) by Army Commander Lieutenant General Gerry De Silva --  had already extended their forward defense localities by 35  square km last afternoon. They also liberated 500 farmer  families from the LTTE control in Vavuniya's green rice belt.  The operation has been launched with a view to rescuing farmer  families from the LTTE. The Army commander had toured the new  forward defense locality. He also held a series of meetings  with the farming families. Arrangements have been made to  immediately supply emergency stocks of logistics.    In another incident in the Eastern Province, troops of  Operation (?Fighting) located and destroyed three terrorist  bases and 24 huts in which the LTTE cadres were accommodated.  They also recovered 43 bags of rice, stocks of medicines, and  antipersonnel mines. A report from Amparai says that STF  [Special Task Force] commanders have destroyed two LTTE hideouts  at Kanchikudichiyaru and located an abandoned terrorist camp and  destroyed it.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / US figures point to sustained recovery A SHARP rebound in housing starts and a solid increase in industrial production were yesterday seen as encouraging signs that the US economic recovery will be sustained through the summer. Industrial output rose 0.6 per cent in May, to register its fourth consecutive monthly increase. Housing starts jumped 11 per cent, making good much of an erratic 17 per cent decline in April. 'The recovery is on track and gaining momentum, but still remains about half-speed relative to previous upturns,' said Mr David Littmann, senior economist at Manufacturers National Corp, a Detroit bank. The main factor driving the recovery was the Federal Reserve's 'very stimulative' monetary policy. Doubts about the recovery's momentum had been raised by reports in the past 10 days showing weaker-than-expected retail sales and employment last month. The mixed pattern of statistics, however, is characteristic of a sluggish economic recovery, in which different sectors advance at differing speeds. Housing starts are running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.23m, roughly in line with the average rate for the first quarter. In the first five months of this year, starts were 28 per cent higher than in the same period last year. The housing recovery was broadly based, affecting all types of residential structures and all regions. Building permits, a guide to future trends, dropped slightly last month. The rise in industrial output last month was led by increased production of cars, light trucks and other durable consumer goods. Production is now running 2.2 per cent higher than in May last year. Separate figures yesterday indicated that the US current account deficit fell to Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 2.9bn) in the first quarter, against Dollars 7.2bn in the final three months of last year. The improvement reflected lower oil prices, higher receipts from tourism and increased earnings on overseas assets.</p>

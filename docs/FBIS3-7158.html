The Ho Chi Minh City People's  Committee [HCMCPC] also issued Announcement No. 100/TB-UB on 15  September 1993 to clarify its views.    Regarding Bishop Huynh Van Nghi, the Ho Chi Minh City  government's attitude has been respectful:    - On 25 August 1993, the Ho Chi Minh City Fatherland Front  and the HCMCPC Religion Department directly informed Bishop  Huynh Van Nghi that his appointment to the HCMCAO was at  variance with the SRV law, therefore, it was not accepted. The  Decree No. 69 issued by the Council of Ministers on 21 March  1991 stipulates in its Article 19 that: "[The appointment of]  clergymen such as Buddhist bonze superiors; Catholic cardinals,  bishops, and supervising priests; and equivalent clergymen in  other religions must be approved by the Council of Ministers".  This regulation is also practiced by many countries in the  world.    - On 5 September 1993, an HCMCPC authoritative official met  and requested Bishop Huynh Van Nghi to stop all his activities  as an HCMCAO supervisor.    However, Bishop Huynh Van Nghi has continued to select and  appoint his general representative and representatives in charge  of congregations and to set up the standing committee of the  Ecclesiastical Regional Council,... at the same time, he has  also presided many religious retreats, meetings,..., thus  creating bad public opinion and affecting the public  respectability to the law.    - On 28 September 1993, the HCMCPC Religion Department sent  a  letter to Bishop Huynh Van Nghi reminding him not to conduct any  religious activities in Ho Chi Minh City pending an agreement  between the SRV Government and the Vatican.    Regretfully, Bishop Huynh Van Nghi has not reciprocated the  Ho Chi Minh City government's goodwill.    The HCMCPC had approved and created favorable conditions for  the congregations to ordain 11 novices. But Bishop Huynh Van  Nghi, on behalf of the HCMCAO, prevented the congregations'  inviting other bishops to preside over the ordination in the  city, causing difficulties for the congregations and relatives  of the novices. Moreover, Bishop Huynh Van Nghi also sent  letters to the supervising priests of related provinces, blaming  the government. (the letter dated 5 October 1993 was copied and  widely distributed among church followers).    For many months, Bishop Huynh Van Nghi continued to write  and  disseminate religious affairs letters and other documents on  behalf of the HCMCAO.    The aforementioned activities by Bishop Huynh Van Nghi are  violating the Decre No. 69 of the Council of Ministers, showing  disrespect to the Ho Chi Minh City Government, and affecting the  fine time-honoured relation between the government and the  HCMCAO.    The law cannot be held in contempt. On 22 February, the Ho  Chi Minh City government held a working session with Bishop  Huynh Van Nghi to point out his violations.    In observance of the SRV Government's policy of freedom of  religion, for more than 18 years, the HCMCPC has always created  favorable conditions for the people to have an improved  religious life-style and standard of living. The Catholic  compatriots, due to the 1 May 1980 Open Letter of the Vietnam  Bishop Council and the leadership of Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh,  have actively contributed to the Ho Chi Minh City construction  and protection and the building of the all-people unity and the  unity between religious and nonreligious people. The government  highly evaluates the patriotism of the Catholic compatriot who,  together with other people in the city, has overcome  difficulties and shared achievements and pride.    The HCMCPC is very much in sympathy with the earnest  aspiration of the Catholic priests and followers to have  somebody to lead this diocese for the continuation of the fine  direction executed by Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh for many years  and for religious prosperity and happiness.    On behalf of the HCMCPC, for the chairman,  Signed: Vice Chairman Vo Viet Thanh</p>

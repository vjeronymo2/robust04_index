			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>   [Text] Amman--Jordan on Tuesday [3 May] dispatched its  State Minister for Foreign Affairs Talal al-Hasan to Cairo to  attend Wednesday's signing of the Palestine Liberation  Organisation (PLO)-Israel self-rule agreement after visible  hesitation and an earlier decision to boycott the ceremony.    Informed sources said Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali  on Tuesday gained support for his argument to send a top-level  Jordanian representative to the signing ceremony despite  Jordanian dismay at the lack of PLO coordination with Jordan and  the continuing naval blockade on al-'Aqabah.    The decision, which seemed to have been a compromise between  sending a more senior-level delegation or dispatching no  representative at all, was taken by the Cabinet at its regular  meeting yesterday.    "President Husni Mubarak had personally invited His Majesty  to attend the ceremony and this invitation was declined," said a  well-informed source. Another source said that the King had  excused himself by pointing to the 40 days of mourning at the  Royal Court over the passing of Her Majesty Queen Zayn al-Sharaf.    Egypt later extended another invitation to the prime  minister  and the minister of state for foreign affairs to attend the  cermeonies, but this suggestion was also turned down, with  Jordan opting finally for sending the minister of state.    A senior Jordanian official told the JORDAN TIMES on Monday  that Jordan had sent a letter regetting that it would not be  able to attend the ceremony. A PLO official also confirmed that  the organisation had received a negative reply from the Kingdom.    It was not immediately clear what caused the change of heart  between late Monday and Tuesday. According to well-informed  sources, Dr. al-Majali himself was arguing for a Jordanian  representation at the ceremony, especially that 43 other foreign  ministers from around the world were scheduled to attend.    Jordan had intended to use the occasion to register its  growing displeasure at the low level of coordination by the PLO  with Jordan over decisions that ultimately affect vital  Jordanian interests.    The Kingdom also believed that attending the meeting would  contradict a vow to suspend its active role in Middle East peace  negotiations until it finalised an agreement with Washington  whereby inspections of vessels heading to al-'Aqabah would be  conducted by Lloyds Register of London.    Dr. al-Majali, according to the sources, had argued that  with  43 foreign ministers attending the signing ceremony "Jordan's  presence can be treated like that of any of these countries."    According to the sources, the premier also believed that  Jordan's absence would cause "more embarassement for the Kingdom  than would serve its purpose."    Other sources said that at least one other factor figured in  the decision of the government to attend the Cairo meeting.  After several delays the Joint Egyptian-Jordanian Higher  Committee was scheduled to begin talks here Thursday headed by  Egyptian Prime Minister Atif Sidqi and Dr. al-Majali.    "If only to show good will to this scheduled meeting, Jordan  probably could not have boycotted a ceremony hosted by Egypt," a  well-informed analyst said.    PLO sources also said Tuesday that the organisation had  insisted on Jordanian attendance till the time the decision was  taken by the Cabinet and that the PLO would have liked Jordan's  prime minister to be present at the signing ceremony.</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW COULD WE OVERLOOK 288 MAJOR LEAGUE WINS?  </P> <P> I wonder how Tommy John might react when he learns from Jim Murray's May 16  column that only one active pitcher (Nolan Ryan) has won more games than Bert  Blyleven's 258.  </P> <P> Is this Murray's not-so-subtle way of suggesting that John is over the hill and  only "technically" active?  </P> <P> GERRY SCHWARTZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P>  Editor's note: It's no technicality that Tommy John has won more games than  Bert Blyleven and Nolan Ryan, but he has not reached 300 yet. He has 288. Ryan  has 277.  </P> <P>  The only person who has been not so subtle about John's ability is Dallas  Green, the New York Yankees manager who said before spring training that he  didn't want John in the rotation. Maybe the Angels' public relations people  took that into account when they listed Blyleven as second among active  pitchers in their media guide, which was printed before the season started.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / As They Say in Europe: Still Harry Lime's town TO THE British, the French and Italians, Europe consists of those three states, plus the Germans. Then there is a jumble of funny countries, mostly new, dotted about the middle and a large beach called Spain. And finally there are the boring countries. They have often been neutral, mostly outside the EC and now trying, for some unfathomable reason, to get in. But they are not always boring. I find Austria interesting, as do the natives who resent the fact that this once great power plays such a diminished role on the world stage. The latest lament came in a column by Willy Hillek in the Vorarlberger Nachrichten. He had just been in the US. The experience led him to write: 'For the world's leading power, the USA, Austria is de facto non-existent.' He added that the only time his little country had made the news in the US was during the Waldheim outcry. The former Austrian president made a considerable impact as a result of the omission of the more interesting aspects of his war service in his autobiography. US ignorance of Austria is something of which I have some experience: when I lived in Vienna I regularly received mail from the US which reached me via Sydney. I understand the New South Wales postal department has a full-time employee whose job it is to forward letters from Australia to Vienna. In spite of this widespread ignorance and apathy, there is much that deserves a wider audience. The outside world does not appreciate the steady flow of scandals such as the Dollars 200m that disappeared in the construction of Vienna's general hospital, the anti-freeze additive in wine affair, the curious system for procuring fighters for the air force and much else. Last month a former chancellor was in court (he was acquitted) while one of his ministers got nine months over illegal arms exports. The latest scandal, if that is the word, has blown up over the state of the Roman Catholic Church in Austria. To get to the bottom of it all I needed a guide from the Hamburg weekly, Die Zeit. Like everybody in north Germany it finds something vaguely ludicrous about Austria, but on this occasion wrote gravely that the present Pope's 'counter-reformation' had left a deeper impression on Austria than on any other country in Europe. This explains the preoccupation of the domestic press with religious issues. The second biggest tabloid, Kurier, has been running a series entitled 'The flight from celibacy.' It is briskly written stuff: 'Herbert Bartl was a priest for only two years in Vienna- Breitensee when he decided to hang up his soutane and get married. That was 24 years ago. Now he is a priest- without-office and a double father . . .' The latest uproar concerns the bishop of St Polten, Kurt Krenn. He is widely attacked for being 'too conservative.' That is an astonishing allegation in Austria, akin to British sports writers criticising the England football manager because his team scored too many goals. But the Austrian catholic church gained a modest reputation for progressiveness because its leaders showed a tepid preference for maintaining the independent 'Austro-fascist' state in the face of the challenge of Hitler's more robust version in the 1930s. Bishop Krenn's conservatism is based on his belief that too much attention has been paid to the gospels rather than church tradition. Opponents say he sees the role of women as Kinder, Kuche, Kirche (children, kitchen, church). He has the support of the leader of the 'Freedom Party,' Jorg Haider, who gained fame a by proclaiming the virtues of the labour laws of the Third Reich. Since anti-clericalism in Austria tends to be a tendency of the far-right this came as a surprise, but Haider was on his way for an audience with John Paul II who had appointed Krenn to his bishopric. The bishop has been forceful in his own defence. As Die Zeit writes: 'In interviews he compares himself with Jesus ('He was also crucified.')' Then there was the unusual piece in Austria's biggest selling paper, Kronen-Zeitung. A columnist writing under the pseudonym Christianus defended Krenn on the day a local demonstration was due to take place against him: 'Jesus also experienced fear which on the night before his suffering took him into profound fear of of death on the Mount of Olives.' It turned out that 'Christianus' was none other than Krenn himself. So that afternoon 15,000 turned up in rain outside St Polten cathedral where thunderous applause greeted the appeal from Father Udo Fischer: 'Mr Bishop, it's enough, resign. The Vatican has given us a present. We are sending it back.' Since I receive the Austrian papers a week late and nobody else reports events from that country, I am sorry to say that I do not know if the call has been successful.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed "Own Information" report: "A U.S. Flag Has </F> Been Flogged"]    [Text] Representatives of youth, patriotic, and left-wing  organizations in the city of Ivanov have staged a public  flogging of a U.S. flag. It was flogged with birch rods,  "indiscriminately, at whatever part came to hand." People say  that it would be much better to flog a live American. He would  be screaming and shouting, twisting and rolling, and doing many  amusing things.    Cruel? Possibly. But one can well understand these people,  driven to despair and sick with the "good life U.S.-style" being  foisted on them by TV.</p>

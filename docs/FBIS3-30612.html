			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Feb. 5, IRNA -- The Montenegrin Interior  Ministry has announced charges against eight more Muslims from  the Sandzak region according to the Belgrade press Saturday. At  least 150 prominent Muslims have been arrested by the Serbian  and Montenegrin authorities over the past two weeks and many  more since Spring 1993, according to Sandzak sources.    The accused, according to the Ministry statement, are  "members of the extreme wing of the (Muslim) Party for  Democratic Action (SDA), who were preparing to create a republic  of the Sandzak". Of the four arrested so far, the first, Umer  Hadzic, is accused of "participating in the constitution of the  Sandzak Republic on the instructions of Muslim National Council  (MNVS) chairman, Sulejman Ugljanin."    The authorities hold a warrant for Ugljanin's arrest. This  was carried out, the statement said, "with the help of legal  experts from Croatia, Bosnia and elders of the Islamic community  in Zagreb."    The other three are accused of forming a parallel "ministry  of security" for the Sandzak and with possession and  distribution of arms in Pljevlja, a Montenegrin town notorious  for its harrassment of the Muslim population.    The MNVS has reported mass arrests of prominent Muslims over  the past ten days, including the leadership of the Montenegrin  SDA. Muslims are subjected to house searches without warrant,  the confiscation of valuables and general police terror, MNVS  said.    For two years now, countless attacks on Muslim people and  property have taken place in Pljevlja and other places in  Sandzak, a mainly Muslim area which stretches over parts of  serbia and Montenegro, bordering on Bosnia.    According to the fund for human rights in Belgrade,  harrassment has not been confined to Serb and Montenegrin  nationalists, but also to large forces of the police and army.  This has led to the emptying of Sandzak villages of their  Muslim population and to a mass exodus from the region.    Opposition weekly VREME in its latest edition refers to the  trial of 25 Muslims which opened on January 31 in Novi Pazar.  According to Belgrade TV's reporting of the event, says VREME,  "all the accused are guilty already. All that has to be done is  to pronounce sentence."    "Not a word that they were questioned without the presence  of  a lawyer, that there was no legal proceeding, that the security  around the court was of an unprecedented degree, that lawyers  were searched before they entered the court, that large numbers  of investigators were scattered about the court and that the  press had printed parts of the accusation before the trial,  thus, raising the temperature," says VREME. Ultimately, the  court was obliged to accept the defence's contention that the  trial had been prejudiced by advance publicity and to adjourn it  for ten days.    Leading the defence is Kosovo Albanian lawyer, Azem Vllasi,  himself the victim of a rigged political trial during the surge  of Serb nationalism which followed the coming to power of  Slobodan Milosevic in 1988.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ren Zhongping (0117 0112 1627): "Properly </F> Handle Contradictions Among the People in the New Situation"]    [Text] Contradictions among the people have existed  universally in our social life for a long time. The real  significance in setting out this issue today lies in the fact  that our cause of reform is developing in depth. The reform  measures presented this year are particularly important, because  they will affect the underlying structure of the interests of  various social areas in a relatively broad scope, and will  sooner or later affect the regions, units, and individuals to  various degrees. Just as we have seen, our social life is full  of vitality and is extraordinarily active; however, the other  side of the coin is the complex situation created by the  entanglement, collision, and friction among various kinds of  contradictions. True, those contradictions take place under the  prerequisite of the identification of the people's basic  interests, but, if they are not handled properly, negative  consequences will surface and will give rise to problems which  will be serious enough to affect the overall situation. This  precisely requires our leading organs and leading cadres to be  aware of the times and size up the situation, to be sober and  good at properly handling the relations between reform,  development and stability, to firmly take the initiative in  their own hands in work, to convert negative to positive  factors, and to give play to mass enthusiasm for reform and  construction initiatives.  <H8>  I. </H8>   Today we can see a great difference in the expressive forms  and characteristics of the contradictions among the people. It  is very necessary for us to have a clear picture of the  background to today's situation and the historical conditions  that have given rise to those contradictions in order to adopt  the correct policies and strategies to appropriately arrange  work. This can be generalized in the following aspects.    First, the various reform measures we are presenting today  are primarily based on the goal of reform, which is to build the  socialist market economic structure while continuously  readjusting the interest pattern and relations in various areas,  thus meeting the requirements for the development of the  productive forces. When the old balance is tipped, it will  inevitably result in a series of contradictions. For example,  the interest relations between the central government and  localities, between the local government and enterprises,  between the enterprise and its workers and staffers will all  undergo new changes. Generally, these changes will make the  interest relations in all aspects tend to be more rational;  however, every aspect has its own specific interests and hopes  that it will gain benefits but not suffer losses in the  readjustment of the interest pattern. That being the case,  various contradictions at every tier will markedly increase. At  the same time, there is the contradiction between nurturing a  socialist unified market and the separatism of departments and  localities, the contradiction between legitimate and  illegitimate operations, and the contradiction between proper  and improper competition. Under the highly centralized planned  economic structure of the past, such conditions were not so  obvious, but they have become increasingly conspicuous with  every passing day in the course of converting to the market  economy.    Second, we have been pushing forward economic restructuring  amid the high-speed operation of the national economy and have  been maintaining rapid economic growth in the course of  accelerating structural conversion. This being the case, the  entire economic environment has been relatively tense. There  are several contradictions in this area: between accelerating  the growth rate and improving both the economic structure and  economic returns; the imbalance between the eastern coastal  areas and the middle and western areas in regional economic  development; between the people's expectations in their longing  to improve their living standards as quickly as possible and the  limited material and financial strength; and the expansion in  the scale of production and increased consumer spending, which  will again result in a shortage of capital and skyrocketing  prices. In addition, the differences in distribution and income  between different regions and between employers of different  economic forms, the imbalance between those having a relatively  easy time and those taking up arduous tasks in their work, and  the widening gap between prosperity and impoverishment have all  surfaced. And,    Third, China has also gone through profound changes in its  superstructure and ideology as the country opens up wider to the  outside world with every passing day. During the transitional  period when the old structure is being converted to the new,  both practical work and ideology have taken on extraordinary  complexity and activity. For example, we will find  contradictions between the issue of how to guide the market  mechanism into distribution and distribution according to work  as well as common prosperity, the contradiction between the  issue of how to handle the price system and existing wage and  consumption policies, and the contradiction between  money-worship and egoism and collectivism and between hedonism  and corruption and the tradition of struggling hard amid  difficulties. A solution to all these contradictions cannot be  found overnight; consequently, some knotty problems and mistakes  in work will often appear. Many units and departments are  facing these kinds of problems, which will eventually be  reflected in every individual's personal interest; this being  the case, it is liable to result in fluctuations and a loss of  balance to some extent in the people's thinking, psychology, and  emotions.    There is no need to be evasive about the fact that a huge  amount of various contradictions exist among the people today.  Each pair of contradictions, however, contain the restriction of  various complicated factors, which affect one another as they  interact. The state's reform policy, the masses' practical  interests, the people's thinking and concepts, and the effects  of the social environment are more often than not interwoven.  This being the case, there is a certain degree of difficulty in  their solution. Our attitude is as follows: First, we must  recognize that this is an inevitable phenomena in the course of  social progress and development; some are old problems, but  there are new contradictions as well. Our reform serves  precisely to gradually resolve or ease these contradictions and  iron out these kinds of problems in relations. Second, we must,  at the same time, be brave in facing the difficulty and  complexity of the cause of reform, adopt the correct policies  and strategies to appropriately handle all kinds of  contradictions and maintain the vitality of reform, while taking  the opportunity to guide reform in depth.  <H8>  II. </H8>   To seize the opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening up,  promote development, and maintain stability is the overall  direction for the work of the whole party and the whole country  this year. In handling the contradictions among the people in  the new situation, it is necessary to proceed from, be subject  to, and serve this overall direction. Based on this  understanding, in handling the contradictions among the people  in the new situation, we should do a good job of grasping the  following points:    First, our starting point is to resolve contradictions, iron  out differences, promote understanding, and give play to  positive factors. Most of the various kinds of contradictions  among the people which exist today fall into the category of  interest relations or issues of ideological understanding and  concepts; generally, they do not have a confrontational quality.  Our principle is to do more work in reconciliation,  coordination, and mediation. When faced with contradictions and  disputes, the leading organs and leading cadres should be good  at eliminating misunderstandings, removing hurdles to find  channels for solutions, building bridges for mutual  communication, and balancing the interest relations between all  parties involved. Practice has pointed to the fact that  understanding and communication are very important and represent  an effective way to resolve contradictions. If all sides  involved are able to seek common ground while reserving  differences and understand and make concessions to each other --  all the while taking the overall situation into account -- many  contradictions, including some very knotty ones, can find  relatively appropriate solutions peacefully. The key lies in  showing sincerity, adopting a constructive attitude, and taking  practical measures.    Second, our basic train of thought is that those problems  that surface in the course of reform should be resolved by  deepening reform and those problems that surface in the course  of development should be resolved in the same manner. Take, for  example, the issue of employment -- it is by no means a simple  issue of making arrangements. If we fail to open up more  channels for employment, do not adopt various forms of  employment, and continue to rely on the government to take care  of everything, a solution will be very difficult to find. To  use another example, some enterprises are suffering from  deficits due to poor management, overstocking of products, and  attempts to sell poor-quality products at high prices. Simple  protective measures cannot provide a radical solution; only by  pushing the enterprise toward the market to participate in  competition will the problems be solved. From a long-term point  of view, development is the last word [fa zhan si ying dao li  4099 1455 2508 4289 6670 3810]; when the national economy  develops, there will be far greater leeway for resolving all  kinds of contradictions and problems. As social material and  spiritual wealth increases, the nation becomes prosperous and  strong, and the people become well off, many contradictions will  be easily resolved. If the economy fails to develop, everything  else will be out of the question.    Third, resolving contradictions by means of democracy and  the legal system constitute an important principle which we must  follow. The masses of the people are the main force of reform.  Without the support and cooperation of the majority of the  masses, we will accomplish nothing in our work. Hence, it is  necessary to develop democracy and consult the masses on all  major issues. Before a major policy is introduced, it is  necessary to listen to opinions from various quarters and choose  and follow what is good. After a policy is announced, it is  necessary to organize the broad ranks of the cadres and the  masses to earnestly implement it. At the same time, we should  solicit the views of the masses and constantly revise,  compliment, and improve the policy. Centering on the  requirements of establishing a socialist market economic system,  we have formulated a series of laws, regulations, and systems.  This is the foundation for settling all kinds of contradictions  and problems. No unit or individual may override the law,  regulations, and system and do as it or he likes. The style of  "seriously resolving the major issues while paying little  attention to minor ones" must be discouraged. Whatever reason  one has, the contradictions and problems can only be resolved  within the framework of state law, regulations, and systems.  Practice has proven that complying with the law and regulations  is the effective way to eliminate unreasonable quibbling and  remove artificial interference.  <H8>  III. </H8>   Leading organs at all levels, particularly the leading  cadres, shoulder great responsibility for properly handling the  contradictions among the people in the new situation. New  contradictions and problems will emerge in large numbers at a  time when we are making strenuous efforts to push reform  forward. We must work conscientiously, seriously, and earnestly  and pay special attention to the following:    Make great efforts to strengthen ideological and political  work. During the transition, in which the old system will be  replaced by a new one, the thinking of the masses will be  exceptionally active due to changes in the social structure and  interests setup. The expression of differing views and thinking  is quite natural. If we neglect ideological education and lack  correct guidance, a trifling matter can easily lead to an  incident. Hence, ideological work should be more meticulous  alongside deepening reform. It is necessary to conduct  ideological education work in connection with reality rather  than evade contradictions and put on bureaucratic airs. We  should resolve practical problems one by one, explain the  policies as well as the difficulties to the masses, and keep  from covering up problems and contradictions. This is one of  the methods for dispelling misunderstanding and increasing  common understanding. For example, the policies on grain  delivery, tax imposition, retention of profits, residential  land, land requisition, and resource exploitation should be  clearly explained. The masses should understand the duties they  must undertake as well as the rights they can exercise. In the  distribution of income, it is necessary to explain the  difference between income gaps and unfair distribution and  clarify which ways of becoming rich are reasonable and which are  not. It is particularly necessary to tell them that we are  against those who make exorbitant profits. We should take  special note of conducting education among the masses with the  idea of reform so that they can understand that short-term  individual and immediate interests should be subordinate to the  long-term interests of the state and society as a whole. When  the facts are presented and the truth is explained, the majority  of the masses will certainly take the overall situation into  account.    Fighting corruption, running a clean administration, and  getting rid of bureaucracy constitute an important way to  mitigate all kinds of contradictions. The masses of some  localities hate corruption and bureaucracy more than anything  else. Corruption is primarily manifested by some cadres making  a profit through abusing their special position to engage in  economic activities. Although this involves only a handful of  people, it has had a negative influence among the masses. The  disputes in interests in a number of localities have been  complicated precisely due to this factor, and some have even  become antagonistic. A bureaucratic work style is also an  essential reason why contradictions come about and are  aggravated. Some contradictions and disputes, though not  serious, may lead to drastic mass reactions if they are left  unattended for a long period of time. We should encourage the  spirit of earnestly undertaking responsibility and opposing the  practices of shifting responsibility onto others and glossing  over mistakes. If the opinions and requirements of the masses  are reasonable, they should be met immediately where conditions  permit. Regarding reasonable opinions and requirements which  cannot be resolved for the time being for various reasons, it  necessary to do persuasive work and create the conditions for  resolving them. As regards the requirements which are not very  reasonable, as long as they are not deliberately provocative, we  should explain principles, introduce policies, and give the  masses a clear answer. In a word, we must go deep into the  realities of life among the masses. Leading cadres should do  work in those places where there are contradictions and problems.    We should be concerned about the well-being of the masses  and help them resolve their difficulties. For various reasons,  the income of some workers in loss-making enterprises has  dropped and they have had difficulties securing their  livelihood; the interests of some peasants have also dropped,  and they have had to deal with a number of problems in  production and livelihood. This is related to the stability of  the overall situation. The enthusiasm of some localities for  construction is now running high, but, due to the shortage of  capital, they often neglect the basic livelihood of the masses.  This merits attention. We would rather cut a number of  projects and curtail other expenditures and use the money that  is saved to ensure that the "rice bags" and "vegetable baskets"  of the masses are full. It is particularly necessary to show  concern for the workers in some loss-making enterprises who have  financial difficulties, provide timely help, and make proper  arrangements for their livelihood. We should always bear in  mind the problems related to the livelihood of the masses --  such as social order, water and electric supply, and schooling  -- and must be eager to meet their needs. In this way, our  social life will be filled with tranquility and harmony. There  will be fewer contradictions and friction, and those that appear  will be easily resolved.    In the new situation, the contradictions among the people  will be extremely complicated. These contradictions should be  resolved through persuasion, education, mediation, and  consultation. We must absolutely avoid being rigid, rough, and  brutal [sheng ying cu bao 3932 4289 4723 2552]. However, it is  also necessary to take note of the change in the nature of the  contradictions. When tackling the phenomenon of complicated  contradictions, we should make an accurate judgment of their  nature and adopt timely measures. We should strive to gain an  initiative in all our work and try to nip all problems in the  bud.    The handling of contradictions among the people covers much  ground. Therefore, we should mobilize the forces of all fields  and encourage everybody to do work. Party committees and  governments at all levels must properly perform organization and  coordination work; the democratic parties at all levels and mass  organizations should vigorously offer cooperation; and all  localities, departments, and units should get involved. To  handle the contradictions among the people in the new situation,  we must have correct guidelines and work methods, and this  requires a powerful organizational guarantee.</p>

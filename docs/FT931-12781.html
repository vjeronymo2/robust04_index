			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Northern Telecom up 24% to Dollars 253m SHARES IN Northern Telecom surged yesterday after the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker reported a surprisingly strong 24 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings. Fourth-quarter earnings climbed to USDollars 253m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, from Dollars 204m, or 83 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose 10 per cent to Dollars 2.54bn. Order backlog at the end of the year was a record Dollars 3.9bn, up 19 per cent from December 1991. For the year as a whole, earnings climbed to Dollars 548m, or Dollars 2.17, from Dollars 515m, or Dollars 2.03. Revenues advanced to Dollars 8.41bn from Dollars 8.18bn. On the Toronto stock exchange yesterday, Nortel's shares jumped by CDollars 3.38 to CDollars 57.38 (USDollars 44.88) before the close. Dr Paul Stern, chairman, said income from almost all product lines improved last year. Slimmer margins in the highly competitive market for office switches was offset by stronger volumes. The bottom line also benefited from a drop in expenses to Dollars 1.56bn last year from Dollars 1.6bn. Strong revenue growth in the US was due partly to the recovery of business deferred earlier in the year, and partly to expanding market share, especially at the expense of AT&amp;T. The two companies won a joint USDollars 1bn order for digital switching systems earlier this week from Pacific Bell. Dr Stern said the order would double Nortel's market share with the San Francisco-based utility. Thanks largely to the 1991 takeover of Britain's STC, Nortel's revenues outside North America have grown from 8 per cent to 25 per cent of total business over the past four years. Dr Stern predicted that proportion would rise further, but expressed disappointment with business conditions in Europe, which he blamed mainly on the overall economic slowdown. In contrast to the lengthening list of North American technology companies announcing lay-offs and other cutbacks, Nortel said its workforce had grown by 2,000 in the past year to 58,500.</p>

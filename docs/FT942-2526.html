			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Feedback I was particularly interested in your article on unit trust charges on May 14/15. Might I draw attention to two situations where there could be losses in value for investors related to bid/offer spreads, in cases where managers decide the timing of purchases and/or sales. In the first case, it is possible for the individual investor to detect what is happening, and perhaps even to reduce the impact. I am not sure if one could establish the facts in the second case: I hope it does not happen. Regular monthly savings in a unit trust: When operating a regular monthly savings scheme, the managers may fix a few day(s) in the month when they buy units for the regular savers. On such days, purchases normally will outweigh re-purchases, in which case the fund may move to an offer valuation. Naturally, sales of units will, in general, be on other days, probably with a bid valuation. This practice effectively increases the bid/offer spread - in one case that I know, from 5.3 per cent to 8.6 per cent. The difference would normally be less. Managed fund of in-house unit trusts: For a fund consisting of in-house unit trusts, it would not be surprising to find that when the fund sells units of one of the unit trusts in the fund, the re-purchases for that unit trust, for that day, outweigh purchases; and the reverse when the fund buys that unit trust. If the spread for the unit trust moves to the bottom of the permitted range in the first case, and to the top in the second, then the spread effectively is increased. With active management, the impact could be significant, even when no initial charges exist (or when those that do exist are rebated). C. Vince 10 Keepers Wood Chichester West Sussex</p>

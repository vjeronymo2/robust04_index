			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Rain dwindled and rivers began receding in Maine after flooding forced some  evacuations, the National Weather Service said. A flood watch continued for the  Androscoggin and Kennebec rivers -- both more than four feet above flood stage  -- but officials said they should fall back inside their banks. In Auburn, many  of about 50 residents who had been evacuated were allowed to return home.  Several homes and businesses were flooded in that city and in Lewiston and  Augusta. No damage or injuries were reported, police said. In Texas, residents  cleaned up from storms that demolished three apartment complexes and blew over  10 helicopters at Ft. Hood.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Malou L. Sayson] </F>   [Text] Southern Mindanao is fast shedding off its image as  the country's traditional economic backdoor and in no time will  emerge as the new growth area in the east of the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The reason for this change is  its abundant agriculture and natural resources which have  continued luring unprecedented investments since the early  1990's. Southern Mindanao's passport to a grandiose  transformation is its so-called SOCSARGEN (South Cotabato,  Sarangani, General Santos City) growth corridor, dubbed as the  "agricultural paradise" of the south.    Agriculture Secretary Roberto S. Sebastian said the  diversified agricultural potential highlighted by the vast and  rich fishing grounds of the Celebes and Solomon seas could  easily make the area the main gateway to East ASEAN markets.    The growth trend has emerged in the early 1990's when  investments jumped 800 million to around one billion pesos at  present. New firms have also been noted to have mushroomed.  Sebastian said there are about 200 big local and foreign  investors who have confirmed investing in SOCSARGEN.    Malaysia is one of the leading investors in the area as  signalled by the recent visit of Malaysian Prime Minister  Mahathir bin Mohamed. Sebastian said a Philippine trade mission  is set to visit Malaysia to discuss agriculture complementation  between the two countries, especially in the aspect of fishing.    A world-class fishport, 20 minutes away from Polomoloc,  South  Cotabato, is just a part of the infrastructure investments of  over $200 million committed by the governments of the  Philippines, the United States and Japan. Sebastian said the  fishport complex, designed to cover a one-kilometer shoreline  with a projected daily capacity of 1,000 metric tons of fish  catch, could make SOCSARGEN competitive with Thailand's port. He  said fish processing activities are concentrated in Thailand;  but once the fishport complex is established, the country can  capture part of the fish market. This is due to SOCSARGEN's  proximity to the rich fishing grounds of the Solomon and Celebes  seas located east of the country.    Just by cutting the transit time is enough to lure  commercial  fishing vessels to land their catch in Southern Mindanao instead  of Thailand, Sebastian added. Commercial fishing firms operating  in General Santos City are leading participants in this  lucrative regional fishing market. There are 34 commercial  deep-sea fishing firms with a combined fleet of over 600  commercial fishing vessels' based in the city, making it the  second port next to Navotas in fish landings and the leading  port for tuna. The five fish canning plants producing as much as  $30.8 million worth of products are also projected to increase  production with the building of the fishport complex.    Sebastian said by 1996, the $30-million Japanese-financed  fish port will be completed to consist of a 300 meter wharf for  2,000 gross ton reefer carriers, a 750 meter landing quay and a  cold storage for 1,500 metric tons of large tuna. The port has  also the capability to accommodate a 60-ton ice plant, brine  airblast and contact freezers and some 4,500 square meters of  fish market stalls.    SOCSARGEN's great marine wealth is completed by high  agricultural productivity contributed by the unrivaled soil  fertility of the Allah and Koronadal valleys. He said the area  produces 40 percent of the country's pineapples, 23 percent of  its corn, 75 percent of its cotton, and eight percent of its  coconuts.    SOCSARGEN is also a major production area for countries area  for cut flowers, prawns, bananas, asparagus, seed corn and a  leading production site for hogs, livestock and feedgrains.</p>

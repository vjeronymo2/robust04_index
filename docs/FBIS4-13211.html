			<p>BFN     [Text] Marrakech, Apr. 16 (MAP) -- Chairman of the GATT  conference Sergio Enrique Bonilla and GATT director general  Peter Sutherland hailed here Friday [15 April] the conclusion of  the Uruguay Round.    During a joint press conference, Bonilla and Sutherland  underlined that the signature of the Uruguay Round final act in  Marrakech is a historic step to world economic integration and  towards the establishment of the international multilateral  trading system.    Sutherland, who expressed conviction that the projected  world  trade organization will see the light next January 1st as  initially scheduled, said the commitments expressed by every  member country in the Uruguay final act are categorical.    To a question on the concerns of some developing countries  that their economies will be negatively impacted by the new  international trading system, the GATT director general  underlined that the efficient contribution of developing  countries to the conclusion of the Uruguay round is evidence to  their trust in the viability of the multilateral system.    As to the situation of African countries, particularly  sub-Saharan ones, Sutherland stressed that every individual  country will draw benefits from the multilateral system,  specifying that the African representatives who took the floor  during the Marrakech conference underlined the paramount  importance of the GATT accord for their respective economies.    Tackling the pending issues, the GATT director general  explained that negotiations will be continued on these  questions, particularly those related to financial services, the  intellectual property and the audiovisual.</p>

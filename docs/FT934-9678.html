			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / World News in Brief: Markets' slide halted as dealers await US data The slide in financial markets last week was largely checked yesterday as dealers awaited the next set of important US economic data today, but the underlying tone remained nervous. In London, the FT-SE 100 index ended eight points down at 3,077.6, while Germany's DAX index fell 1.75 to 2,010.8 and France's CAC-40 index rose 3.78 to 2,084.79. In the US, Treasury bonds again appeared weak, but most other US bond and stock market prices were little changed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 4.47 higher at 3,647.9. In Tokyo the Nikkei average rose marginally on bargain hunting, closing higher for the first time in five trading days at 18,625.16, up 34.7 points. World stocks, Page 39; London stocks, Page 42</p>

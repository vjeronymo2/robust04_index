			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Armen Baghdasarian: "Is the Railway Explosion </F> First of a New Series?"]    [Text] As is known, the rail line entering Armenia was  blown up in the Azeri-populated Marneuli region of Georgia early  in the morning of 18 November. While Russian mass media reported  that a 27-meter segment of the rail line was blown up, Armenian  sources reported a 100-meter segment destroyed. It would not be  correct to say that the explosion was unexpected, because it is  easy to see that with the onset of the cold the gas pipeline and  the railway entering Armenia from Georgia should become the  favorite target of Azeri diversionists, given that the problem  of guarding these lines of vital importance to the republic has  not been solved.    On 18 November, the Armenian foreign ministry issued a  statement in connection with the explosion saying: "This  terrorist diversion operation was planned and executed by the  authorities of the Republic of Azerbaijan. This criminal act  against the Armenian Republic and its people, a new  manifestation of the policy of state terrorism endorsed by  Azerbaijan, is an attempt by the warmongering circles of that  state to bring the Armenian nation to its knees and to force the  Armenian authorities to abandon the principle of finding a just  and civilized solution to the Karabakh problem by methods that  are categorically rejected by the international community.  Azerbaijan has once again confirmed that political elements who  are bent on solving the current conflict by the force of arms  still enjoy strong influence in governing circles." In this  particular instance the railway was repaired relatively quickly,  and train traffic from Georgia into Armenia has resumed.  However, nobody would be especially surprised if the explosions  continue. While the explosions had two targets last year, the  gas and the railway line, this year they have a third target:  the Caucasian electrical power transmission line through which  the Sakenergo administration is obligated to supply Armenia with  electricity from Russia at the rate of 100 megawatts.    It is nice to have trust, but it would not be bad if there  were more substantial guarantees on issues that are of vital  importance. Experience shows that such guarantees can only be  had with the military control of communication routes. Once  again we have to broach this issue because, despite various  agreements, the gas pipeline and the rail line are generally not  protected. Meanwhile, the situation in the republic is much  worse than what it was last year despite the assurances given by  the authorities. It turns out that the constantly-heard phrase  "this is our last winter" also depends on the good will of our  neighbors. Of course the Armenian gas repairmen have already  rushed to the scene of the explosion. Of course, the prime  ministers of Armenia and Georgia are having serious talks and  will eventually remember the age-old friendship between our  nations. However, those do not change anything and are not  likely to change anything ever.    The situation in the Azeri-populated eastern regions of  Georgia is extremely tense, and the explosion of the railway  line is an excellent opportunity to send [Georgian] military  forces to protect that segment of the railway. Armenian units  could join those forces thus reducing Georgia's burden  significantly. After all it is not that hard to protect a  40-kilometer railway segment, and as they say: "If the mountain  will not come to Mohammed... [Mohammed has to go to the  mountain]."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Kurayshan from Tunis] </F>   [Text] Palestinian-Israeli meetings resumed in Tunis this  morning. As is known, the Israeli delegation is led by Amnon  Shahaq while the Palestinian delegation is made up of Dr. Nabil  Sha'th, Ahmad Quray', and Akram Haniyah. Yesterday, the two  delegations held a meeting that was also attended by President  Yasir 'Arafat and Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh.    According to Dr. Samir Ghawshah, PLO Executive Committee  member, the Israeli delegation did not present serious proposals  on the safety of Palestinians in the occupied territories. What  he proposed, Ghawshah said, did not meet the minimum  requirements. This, he added, means practically emptying the  Security Council Resolution [904] of its substance.    Speaking to our radio, the Palestinian official said the  Israelis had, for example, proposed turning the International  Red Cross representatives in the occupied territories into  international observers, according to an Israeli concept of the  way to implement the Security Council's call for a temporary  international presence in the occupied territories. It seems  that during its talks here in Tunis, the Israeli delegation  showed no positive response to proposals by Norwegian Deputy  Foreign Minister Larsen on the security measures that should be  taken in the occupied territories as Yitzhaq Rabin promised in  his telephone call with Yasir 'Arafat last Friday.    U.S. peace coordinator Dennis Ross is due in Tunis this  afternoon. According to some sources, a quadrapartite meeting  of the Palestinian and Israeli delegations as well as Ross and  Larsen is expected to be held to help develop the Israeli  proposals to protect the Palestinians. It will be according to  these proposals that the Palestinian stand toward the resumption  of negotiations will be determined.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIPLOMATIC MOVES FOCUS ON CAMBODIA  </P> <P> With fighting escalating in Cambodia between government troops and three  guerrilla factions, a flurry of diplomatic moves was reported to be under way  Wednesday in an effort to settle the conflict.  </P> <P> After four days of denials, the government in Phnom Penh admitted Wednesday  that guerrillas of the Khmer Rouge faction had attacked four villages on the  outskirts of Battambang, Cambodia's second-largest city, last Friday.  </P> <P> The Khmer Rouge had said that Battambang was set afire in the fighting, but a  statement issued by the Cambodian government and broadcast by Phnom Penh radio  said that between 100 and 200 Khmer Rouge guerrillas were repulsed after  attempting to blow up a bridge near O Sralau. Nine Khmer Rouge guerrillas were  reported killed in the encounter; government casualties were not given.  </P> <P> The Khmer Rouge attack at Battambang, although apparently on a far smaller  scale than suggested by early guerrilla reports, was nonetheless a  psychological lift for the resistance at a crucial moment in the conflict,  according to Western diplomats.  </P> <P> Fighting has intensified in western Cambodia since September, when Vietnam  completed the withdrawal of its troops after more than a decade of occupation.  </P> <P> Diplomats met in Paris last August in an effort to bring an end to the fighting  but had no success, primarily because the Phnom Penh government refused to  accept the participation of the Khmer Rouge in a four-party interim government  that would administer the country until after elections.  </P> <P> The Khmer Rouge, which has been accused of killing more than 1 million  Cambodians while it ruled the country from 1975 to 1979, is the strongest of  the three rebel factions, all based in Thailand, that have been fighting to  overthrow the Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh. The resistance  alliance occupies the Cambodian seat at the United Nations.  </P> <P> In an effort to overcome the impasse of the talks in Paris, Australia proposed  in October that the United Nations take over the administration of Cambodia  pending elections.  </P> <P> So far, reaction to the Australian proposal has been generally favorable,  although the Khmer Rouge reportedly told Australian envoy Michael Costello in  Bangkok last week that the plan is unacceptable. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the  leader of another resistance faction, has given qualified acceptance to the  plan, provided that the U.N. seat remains in the hands of the opposition.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the United States indicated its support for the Australian  proposal.  </P> <P> The State Department also said that the United States and four other permanent  members of the U.N. Security Council -- Britain, France, the Soviet Union and  China -- will meet Monday and Tuesday in Paris to consider the latest  diplomatic moves. The U.S. delegation will be headed by Assistant Secretary of  State Richard H. Solomon, the State Department's top Asia expert.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Igor Rogachev, deputy foreign minister of the Soviet Union, opened  talks in Beijing on the Cambodian dispute, and diplomats said this could be the  most interesting of the diplomatic initiatives.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union is the principal supplier of arms to the Phnom Penh  government, while China is the arms supplier of the Khmer Rouge. Rogachev was  reportedly pursuing an initiative put forth by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard  A. Shevardnadze aimed at achieving a moratorium on all arms supplies to  Cambodia. The Chinese are not considered likely to agree.  </P> <P> Costello, the Australian envoy, met over the weekend with Vietnamese officials  and Cambodian Premier Hun Sen. Costello is to arrive today in Paris.  </P> <P> In Bangkok, meanwhile, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, who has been the  host for four rounds of peace talks involving the Cambodian factions, met  Wednesday with representatives of the guerrilla groups. He planned to travel to  Ho Chi Minh City on Saturday for talks with the Vietnamese and Cambodians.  </P></p>

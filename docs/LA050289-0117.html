			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQ SAYS OPEC TO RAISE QUOTAS TO CURB OUTPUT  </P> <P> The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to raise its  production quota in June to help return bloated prices to the cartel's  $18-a-barrel target level, Iraq's oil minister said Monday.  </P> <P> The Middle East Economic Survey quoted Issam Abdul-Rahim Chalabi as saying an  increase in the output ceiling should end overproduction by some of the  organization's 13 members.  </P> <P> Chalabi said the increase is expected to be formalized at a June meeting of  OPEC ministers and take effect in the second half of the year. A new output  level has not been determined, the minister said. However, industry observers  expect an increase of about 1.5 million barrels a day.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prices Nearly Double  </P> <P> Last November, OPEC set a production quota of 18.5 million barrels a day in an  effort to raise world oil prices, which had fallen to $10 to $12 a barrel. At  the time, the cartel was producing more than 22 million barrels, far more than  the market could absorb.  </P> <P> Since then, oil prices have nearly doubled, although several OPEC members are  producing above their quotas, putting the cartel above its self-imposed limit.  OPEC does not want to see prices too high, lest they encourage non-OPEC  producers to increase production.  </P> <P> Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have both demanded higher quotas, and the  U.A.E. has consistently been overproducing since November, oil sources have  reported.  </P> <P> Chalabi warned, however, that there could be no going back on the principle of  equal quotas for Iraq and Iran, which fought an eight-year war ending in a  cease-fire last August. He said Iraq will not even discuss the matter.  </P></p>

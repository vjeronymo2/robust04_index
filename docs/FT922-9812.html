			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Letter: UK engineers' dull image no bar to growth in Europe Sir, Ron Kirby (Letters, April 24) and A V Drew (Letters, April 29) raise important, but infrequently debated issues about the contribution of civil engineering to UK commerce. Despite the public's perception of our industry, epitomised by the (true) joke that if you look up the word 'boring' in Yellow Pages you are directed to 'see Civil Engineers', revenues of the top 10 UK consulting firms grew by 14 per cent in 1991's recession-ridden business environment. Indeed, no fewer than six of Europe's top 10 civil engineering firms are British. My firm has grown 80 per cent in the last two years to rank in the top five and has recruited actively in that period. Last March we bought control of a firm located in former East Germany with the full support of the employees. Our management capability and technical excellence led them to favour us in preference to offers from other European countries and the US. British engineering is as strong now as it has ever been; why else, for example, would a Japanese organisation have come to us to design a telescope in Hawaii? However, recently, when the City of London rightly decided to celebrate the centenary of Tower Bridge in 1994, it chose to create a theme based on London in 1894, ignoring our pleas to mention other great river crossings designed by British engineers in Sydney, Hong Kong, across the Bosporus in Turkey and even in Hull. The 500,000 foreign visitors expected to visit the bridge will thus leave thinking Britain's engineering talent dried up in 1894. Would such a state of affairs be allowed to happen in Germany? I think not, but then our firm in Germany, which though large is not unrepresentative, has women in over half its technical positions while in the UK annual job applications from female engineers to Acer can be counted on the fingers of one hand. In Germany, engineering is recognised as a foundation for the country's wealth. In the UK, it is undervalued and misunderstood. 'Design' is viewed as glamorous; engineering as dull.

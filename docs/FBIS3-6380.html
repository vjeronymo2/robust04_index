The program is part  of the federal government's plan to develop closer links with  the Indonesian military. Prime Minister Paul Keating says  Australia's defense relationship with Indonesia is the key to  establishing defense in and with Asia. David Pembrook asked  Brigadier Adrian Danger to explain the training the Indonesians  would undertake during their stay.    [Begin recording] [Danger] Well, the Indonesian Special  Forces will be operating with our Special Forces in the west in  counter hijack training. We have arguably one of the best  facilities in the world for teaching people how to deal with  (?quick) counter terrorist operations, and specifically how to  deal with hijacked aircraft.    [Pembrook] Is that the only training they will be  undertaking?    [Danger] Oh, they will be undertaking some other basic  training such as communications and the like. But that is the  major emphasis here and that is very important to the public of  Australia and to the general public of Indonesia. We need to  have a mutual confidence, if you like, that if a Qantas airliner  with a whole bunch of Australians is hijacked in Indonesia, in  Jakarta, that those skills are there to safeguard the traveling  public. Conversely, we need to have confidence that the  Indonesians need to have confidence that if Garuda is hijacked,  at say, Mascot, then they know that we have those skills, and  that exchange is reasonably common among Special Forces around  the world.    [Pembrook] But do you as a spokesperson for the Defense  Forces have any misgivings about training soldiers from a unit  who were alleged to have been involved in the torture and  suppression of minorities in their country.    [Danger] Look, Amnesty International from time to time will  make remarks as they do against the internal affairs of  Indonesia, against human rights issues in other countries around  the world, including Australia. That is not the concern of our  task in terms of counter hijack.    [Pembrook] But at the same time, do you have any misgivings  that we are skilling these people up, even though it is to do  with counter terrorism, that we are indeed improving the skills  of these people, who according to Amnesty are involved in the  suppression of minorities in Indonesia.    [Danger] No, we are not skilling these people to deal with  internal affairs of Indonesia or any other country. These are  skills which are specific to protecting the traveling public.

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Seoul up before transactions deadline THERE were another four record highs in the region, but Seoul, still some way short of its mid-year peak, probably came top for topicality as it rose ahead of today's deadline for 'false name' transactions and holdings. Tokyo and Taiwan were closed for public holidays. SEOUL had reported fears of a massive, last minute withdrawal of funds from bank and stock accounts by large depositors in an effort to hide their money from the tax collectors. In the event, the market chose to anticipate government market boosting measures after today's deadline for implementing the 'real-name' financial system, and the composite index ended 9.74 higher at 722.09 in turnover of Won396.7bn, compared with Won209.3bn during Saturday's half-day session. Sammi Corp and Sammi Steel went limit-down, losing Won600 each to Won10,300 and Won10,400 respectively, following unconfirmed rumours about the group. HONG KONG scored its sixth rise in seven sessions, the Hang Seng index climbing 186.62, or 2.3 per cent to a new record high of 8,192.18 as overseas money continued to come into the market, and domestic investors followed suit. Turnover was a provisional HKDollars 5.48bn, up from HKDollars 3.86bn on Friday. Property companies were traded heavily, Sun Hung Kai rising HKDollars 2.75 to HKDollars 45.25 following last week's 43 per cent jump in profits. Henderson Land soared by HKDollars 4.50, or 19 per cent to HKDollars 28.70 on news of a USDollars 400m bond issue convertible after three years into shares in its Henderson China Holdings unit, which is not even listed yet. AUSTRALIA consolidated its break through the 2,000 level and advanced again, the All Ordinaries index closing at another post-1987 crash high of 2,039.8, up 13.6. Continuing foreign interest and a rise in the gold price helped push the index higher. Golds put on 35.9 to 2,130.2 following a USDollars 2.00 rise in bullion prices over the weekend. Overall, turnover was light at ADollars 314.22m. MANILA hit another record high as it rode the sharp rise of Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT) on Wall Street, the composite index ending 43.81, or more than 2 per cent higher at 2,026.53. Combined Manila/Makati turnover rose from 667.4m pesos to 742.8m. PLDT, which turned over 55m pesos by itself, climbed by 55 pesos, or 3.8 per cent to 1,520 pesos. KUALA LUMPUR extended its rally on the back of strong speculative and institutional buying, the KLSE composite index closing 10.53 higher at a new record high of 895.15 as volume rose from 702.6m shares to 839.1m. Brokers said that the strong presence of foreign institutions continued to inject liquidity into the market, which has been driven by anticipation of a generous 1994 budget to be presented later this month. They expect the composite index to test the key 900-point level this week. SINGAPORE saw healthy interest, generated by the giant flotation of Singapore Telecom shares due today. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 15.12 higher at 2,046.57. Sentiment was boosted by the huge size of the Telecom offer - over 1bn shares at a minimum price of SDollars 2 each. Some dealers said that the Telecom valuation made other Singapore blue chips look cheap. Analysts, however, said that the offer was overpriced at 27 times prospective earnings against the market p/e of 22. BANGKOK extended its rally into an eighth trading day, the SET index rising 25.10, or 2.3 per cent to 1,123.74 in heavy turnover of Bt16bn. Active stocks included major property developers and banks. Interest rate hopes saw Bangkok Land climb Bt7 to Bt140, Tanayong Bt7.50 to Bt84.00 and Krisda Mahanakorn Bt5 to Bt135. Bangkok Bank jumped Bt6 to Bt153 and Krung Thai Bank Bt1.50 to Bt52.50. KARACHI took settlement day in its strike, the KSE index closing 16.12 higher at 1,378.24 on fresh institutional buying.</p>

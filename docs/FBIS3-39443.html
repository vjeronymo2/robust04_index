			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Emma Tucker report: "George Argues for Independence"] </F>   [Text] Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England,  yesterday spelt out his vision for an independent central bank  in a rare television interview.    Granting independence to the Bank would be the "most likely"  way of achieving long-term, sustainable growth with low  inflation, he said, but this could only happen when there was a  consensus on the case for monetary stability.    "I think it would be helpful if there were that  understanding," he said. "It would help us to achieve price  stability which would enable the economy to grow in a more  stable way and help reduce the risks of boom and bust."    Mr George, appearing on London Weekend Television's Walden  programme, said it was appropriate to talk about a switch to  independent accountability for the Bank, rather than pure  independence.    "Our task would be specified within a statutory framework  set  out by the government," he said. He envisaged that parliament  would define the objectives of monetary policy by setting an  inflation target.    Mr George agreed politicians had become more attuned to the  dangers of inflation but said they remained subject to  short-term pressures which might make them take a risk which the  Bank would not.    Mr George denied that the Bank would be "consistently  tighter" on interest rates than under present arrangements.    He and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, saw "very much eye  to eye" in the present circumstances. "But there would be  circumstances where we would want to see interest rates higher  than the government, because we would not be facing the same  short-term political pressures."    The governor indicated that tomorrow's inflation report from  the Bank would contain a much more positive assessment of the  long-term prospects for inflation.    "The recorded level of inflation is increasing as it is  bound  to do because of the impact of indirect tax increases, but the  underlying level of inflation is comfortably within the  government's target for the time being," he said. "We don't  expect it to rise over the far-out period but you will have to  wait to see the detail."    Many City analysts believe the government will cut interest  rates before the end of the year to soften the impact of tax  increases. But there is a growing feeling that it will not want  to take any risks with inflation and that the next move in  interest rates will be up.</p>

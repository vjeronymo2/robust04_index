			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Challenge fear hits telecoms NEWS that AT&amp;T, America's biggest telephone operator, intends to attack the UK market focused attention on UK telecom operators BT and Cable &amp; Wireless yesterday and sent both stocks lower in what some analysts considered a knee-jerk reaction. Many telecoms specialists were surprised to see BT shares slip 9 1/2 to 411p on heavier than average turnover of 11m. They argued that as BT had already applied to operate in the US it should have been no surprise that its US counterpart would make a quid pro quo move. They added that AT&amp;T's proposals posed a far greater threat to Cable's telecom subsidiary Mercury, which was targeting the international market. Cable shares fell 13 to 729p with 2.6m traded. The shares have performed very well on the back of a strong Hong Kong market and several UK buy recommendations. However, both stocks were further hit yesterday by the shift away from recession defensive stocks to issues geared for recovery.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / The Loyalist Ceasefire: Milestone on the long road to a lasting settlement The announcement yesterday of an open-ended loyalist ceasefire was, as Mr John Major said, 'unalloyed good news'. It was widely recognised that the immensely difficult task of forging a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland would be almost impossible unless talks could take place in an atmosphere of peace. Now another big part of the jigsaw has fallen into place. In the words of Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister: 'What is most significant now is we are going to be having negotiations without the fear of violence in the background.' But it would almost certainly be a mistake to anticipate that progress towards agreement on Ulster's future will be anything other than slow and fitful in view of the gulf still separating some of the main protagonists. Many unionists remain convinced that reform can be limited to setting up a devolved assembly with narrowly defined powers. That is a million miles from Sinn Fein's perception of the eventual outcome. As one participant said yesterday: 'Somebody is being deceived in this process.' In view of the caution underlying London's welcome of yesterday's announcement, what looks set to happen next is a relatively brief period of stocktaking. The loyalists' assertion that the 'permanence of our ceasefire will be completely dependent upon the continued cessation of all nationalist/republican violence' will be used to increase the pressure on republican leaders to make clear that their ceasefire is for good. Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, says the loyalists' decision to emphasise that they will not return to arms unless republicans do likewise means that 'another of the IRA's fig-leaves has been shed'. Mr Mates believes that no unionist 'of any shade' would be prepared to sit down with republican leaders until the question of permanence is resolved. Unionists are also expected to be quick to emphasise that armed republican splinter groups such as the INLA have yet to say that they have laid down their arms. But there are strong signs that the government may shortly adjust its stance on the six-week-old IRA ceasefire in recognition of the fact that it may never be given a pledge that it is permanent. The idea that London should open a 'reversible' dialogue with the IRA's political wing will be considered by Mr Major and cabinet colleagues next week. A staged response - perhaps lifting the exclusion orders on prominent Sinn Fein members first then reopening indirect contacts - would allow the government to be seen to be responding positively while maintaining the option of withdrawing contacts. Until now, the government's position has been that it would start a preliminary dialogue with republican leaders within three months of a permanent end to IRA violence. Public confirmation of any adjustment in the government's position could come in a Commons debate pencilled in for October 26. There is also thought to be a strong likelihood of a summit meeting soon between Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister Mr Reynolds is keen for Sinn Fein to be brought into the political process as soon as possible via his proposed Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. There have recently been signs that this may be delayed until early next month. Once preliminary dialogue starts - which ministers have acknowledged could be under way by Christmas - the focus will quickly move to the question of the paramilitaries' willingness to hand in their weapons. Once again, few believe that these negotiations would be anything other than long-drawn-out and complex. One potential complication about the IRA's weapons arsenals is that a significant proportion of their arms is thought to be stored in the Irish Republic. Moderate unionists would not insist on the surrender of every gun, but they will almost certainly be extremely reluctant to allow Sinn Fein into the full-fledged political talks process until all heavy weapons had been handed in. Another important detail will be whether representatives of the loyalist paramilitaries will be admitted to these talks and, if so, how they are to be represented - bearing in mind that loyalist terror groups are banned. Commenting on this yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said: 'They are very, very anxious that their own political anxieties, their political concerns, should be heeded, should be expressed. Therefore, once we are satisfied that this is for real, we shall want to be considering with them and with other people ways by which it should be possible for their anxieties to be met.' As for the political talks themselves, expectations of when London and Dublin's much-delayed framework document will be published now vary from early next month to not until next year. This should provide a clearer view of what London and Dublin see as the options for developing north-south relations. It should also provide a clear insight into the vital question of whether Dublin is prepared to amend the articles of its constitution enshrining its territorial claim over the province, in return for a commitment by London to amend the 1920 Government of Ireland Act. Bilateral discussions involving the province's constitutional parties on the shape of Ulster's future government are also carrying on, amid signs that Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party is considering ending its boycott.</p>

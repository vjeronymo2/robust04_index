			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Core businesses help Polypipe improve 11% POLYPIPE, the maker of plastic pipes and fittings, yesterday reported a rise in interim profits from Pounds 5.27m to Pounds 5.85m pre-tax. The 11 per cent improvement was achieved in spite of taking account of a loss from newly-acquired Oasis Leisure, the garden furniture maker. Earnings per share for the six months to end-December rose marginally to 2.54p (2.53p) and the interim dividend is being stepped up by 5 per cent to 0.63p. Mr Kevin McDonald, the chairman, said the core guttering and waste pipes business continued to perform well. New acquisitions during the year had added Pounds 8.3m to sales but had been responsible for a Pounds 400,000 loss at the operating level. The largest loss was at Oasis, bought from the receivers last March, though it normally loses before the summer's peak demand season. Polypipe plans to using Oasis's spare out-of-season capacity to manufacture large products for the rest of the group. Group margins had fallen from 15.5 to 12.3 per cent which Mr McDonald hoped would be reversed at the full year. The group was ahead of forecasts this year and the chairman said there was a feeling there had been a slight upturn in the economy. Polypipe is more dependent on the house refurbishment market so had been relatively unaffected by the recession in the housing market, Mr McDonald said. The group entered the second half with net cash of Pounds 8m.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Another cautious cut for growth: Yesterday's reduction in UK base rates was overdue, but may not be enough to spur a quick recovery Mr Norman Lamont's decision to cut bank base rates yesterday by 0.5 percentage points to 10 per cent is a moderate gamble with sterling's international standing that will not translate into a perceptibly strong recovery in the UK economy for some time. The rate cut will clearly do no harm to the Conservative party in tomorrow's local elections. But it was overdue on economic grounds, as the government's provisional figures for Britain's gross domestic product in the first quarter of this year are likely to show when published later this month. These could well indicate a continuing decline in output in a recession that has already become the longest since the 1930s. Although there has since been a marked recovery in consumer and business confidence, especially since the Conservatives' election victory on April 9, hard evidence of economic revival has been patchy. On the other hand, the government's decision means Britain's officially inspired interest rates are now only 0.25 percentage points higher than the comparable German Lombard rate at 9.75 per cent. The differential between UK and German short-term rates has not been so low since 1981, when UK rates briefly dipped below those of Germany after a period of two years when sterling, then a petro-currency, had been exceptionally strong. Since he became chancellor nearly 18 months ago, Mr Lamont has pursued a cautious but successful policy of reducing interest rates in response to falling inflation in the UK. Although the differential between UK and German rates has narrowed from about 7 percentage points in October 1990, when Britain joined the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, yesterday's rate cut  - the first in eight months  - falls into this cautious category. It came after careful testing of the money and foreign exchange market conditions late last week by the Bank of England. Also fed into the judgment of the Treasury and the Bank of England were the impressions of future German policy moves and dilemmas garnered by the chancellor and Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank of England governor, at last week's meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries in Washington. The cut should help to turn the UK's so far elusive economic recovery into reality. But there are doubts whether the upturn can be strong enough to meet the Treasury's target of 1 per cent growth in GDP this year. This fact alone implies that the UK economy could take advantage of further rate cuts to return to steady growth while avoiding the risk of higher inflation. But, despite the recent recovery of sterling in the EMS and the economic and social problems currently wracking Germany, yesterday's rate cut looks as if it will be the last for some months. This is bad news, given that Britain's policymakers are not dealing with a conventional recovery. High levels of debt in the corporate and personal sectors have weakened the usual levers of policy by dissuading businesses from investment and households from new purchases. Initial returns from leading high street traders suggest that there has been no significant increase in retail sales since the election result lifted the threat of increased income tax burdens from higher-income earners. Motor traders, whose fortunes were boosted in Mr Lamont's March Budget by the halving of the special car tax and tax incentives for company fleet buyers, appear to have experienced some recovery. It is expected that official figures tomorrow will show that UK car sales in April recorded the first year-on-year rise since October 1989. But in the vitally important housing market there is little sign of an upturn. Although mortgage rates followed base rates downwards and the government decided last December to give housing a further boost through a temporary suspension of stamp duty on most house purchases, sales of houses fell to a seasonally adjusted 87,000 a month in the first quarter of this year from 102,000 in the previous quarter. The decline took place against a grim background of still rising unemployment, falling house prices and a continuing, albeit diminishing, wave of house repossessions. Expectations were high that the housing market would revive once pre-election uncertainties were dispelled by the return of Mr John Major's government. But yesterday, senior UK officials admitted that it was hard to find any trace of 'animal spirits' in the housing market in recent weeks. The dilemma facing Britain's policymakers was highlighted by the building societies' response to yesterday's base rate cut. The biggest lender, the Halifax building society, responded with a reduction in mortgage rates. But the scale of the cut  - 0.3 percentage points to 10.65 per cent for new borrowers  - was less than the base rate reduction, reflecting the decision of the societies and other mortgage lenders to cut rates by 0.5 percentage points earlier this year in anticipation of a pre-election base rate cut that never materialised. The new Halifax rates will mean that the average borrower with an endowment-linked mortgage of Pounds 60,000 will save just Pounds 13.13 a month. Although such a saving will be augmented by the effects of the modest tax cuts in Mr Lamont's March budget, it is unclear whether they will untie consumers' purse strings. Indeed, the mortgage rate and tax cuts may do little more than offset an overall drop in real personal disposable incomes. According to Salomon Brothers, the US securities house, real incomes may have fallen by 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the final three months of 1991, as rising unemployment counteracted the effect of wage settlements. Although the UK's inflation performance has been mildly disappointing in recent months, with the annual rate of increase in the retail prices index and the so-called underlying rate of RPI, which excludes mortgage interest payments, both higher in March than in October last year, the Treasury and Bank felt no qualms in sanctioning a base rate cut yesterday on domestic economic grounds. Where they did pause for thought was on the international front. Last week in Washington, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, tried to assure Germany's leading trading partners that a further rise in short-term German interest rates was improbable. But a week is a long time in German monetary politics. When the UK authorities took the plunge yesterday, they were aware that the Bonn government might be about to make concessions in the bruising public sector wage dispute and conscious that tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting would have the wage round and the inflationary pressures besetting Germany high on its agenda. The Frankfurt-based Bundesbank directorate might oppose a rate increase, partly out of consideration for Germany's allies. But would the hardline counter-inflationists among the state central bank governors take a similar line? And would they, as they have done in the past, steamroller an interest rate hike through the council? That Mr Lamont decided to cut base rates partly reflects the enhanced standing that the UK and sterling have enjoyed in financial markets since the election. Mr Major's new government, armed with a working majority that should be good for a full five-year term, has suddenly made Britain appear an island of political stability compared with Germany, France or the US. Also important has been a gradual reappraisal of Germany's problems in financial markets and foreign finance ministries. When the Bundesbank pushed up its key interest rates in December to the highest levels since the 1930s, the D-Mark's function as the anchor currency in the ERM was unquestioned. All Germany's ERM partners, except Britain, followed suit with interest increases of their own. The UK response was to let the sterling exchange rate take the strain by allowing it to fall within the pound's wider 6 per cent fluctuation margins. Now nobody is quite so sure that a German rate increase would trigger the same response. British policymakers, for example, argue that a German rate rise would be more readily accepted by the markets as a sign of Germany's own serious problems, ranging from the difficulty of absorbing eastern Germany and the strain that this entails for public sector budgets, to the current public service workers' strike which could boost already high German wages to uncompetitive levels. In short, Germany's problems pose a risk for the UK government's interest rate policy. But it appears a risk worth taking. This is particularly the case if future inflation and productivity trends are taken into account. Although the course of the annual rate of RPI may be uneven, there is little doubt in the Treasury and the Bank that inflation in Britain is on a downwards course. Similarly, UK productivity is growing, partly because of the labour shake-out that accompanied the recession. So why are the UK authorities not considering a faster reduction in interest rates? One reason is that to bring UK rates below German levels would really be a step into the unknown. Britain's inflation rate, as measured by the RPI, may be below Germany's. But this does not mean that the UK's low inflation credentials are well established. Seared on the corporate memory of European finance ministries is the French experience at the end of last year, when the authorities in Paris were forced to move their rates upwards following the Bundesbank's December move. This was despite France having an inflation rate that was markedly below that of Germany and a tighter, more credible fiscal policy. UK domestic politics are a further spur to monetary caution. The last election was a very risky venture for Mr Major and his team because the economic and political cycles had been allowed to become unsynchronised. The prime minister defied traditional wisdom by winning an election while the economy was gripped by recession. At the start of a new five-year term, Mr Lamont has no interest in accelerating the recovery at the risk of reigniting inflation. Depending on events in Germany a further very small rate cut may be in the pipeline, but it is highly unlikely until late in the year.</p>

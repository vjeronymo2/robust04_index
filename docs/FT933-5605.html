			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Bank launches Ecu settlement THE Bank of England yesterday launched an Ecu securities settlements system, designed to improve the market's liquidity and secure London's position as an Ecu trading centre. The Bank estimates that around 80 per cent of Ecu bond turnover is based in London. However, volume has plummeted since hopes of imminent European monetary union, with the Ecu as a single European currency, have receded. In the second quarter of this year, Ecu bond trading volume reached the equivalent of only Pounds 157bn, nearly a 50 per cent drop from the same period last year. In addition, London lost the battle for dominance of the Ecu bond futures market to Paris. Mr Ian Plenderleith, an associate director of the Bank, said: 'The European Settlements Office (ESO) builds on a series of initiatives by the Bank to broaden the Ecu market infrastructure in London by providing real-time settlement for the professional market.' The ESO offers same-day settlement for Ecu bonds and money market instruments, with electronic bridges for transferring bonds from Euroclear and Cedel, the international bond clearing houses. They have five-day settlement, although there are proposals to reduce it to two or three days. With this technology in place, based on its gilts clearing operation, the Bank could consider offering clearing services for bonds in other currencies. Same-day settlement is also intended to aid the development of an Ecu 'repo' market. A repo, or repurchase agreement to sell and then buy back bonds at a set price and time, allows traders to finance bond holdings more cheaply. 'The impact on the market will not be immediately noticeable, but it is a statement of confidence in the Ecu market,' said Mr Jonathan Davies, senior bond analyst at UBS. For many traders, Euroclear and Cedel will remain more attractive, because they settle all Eurobonds and most European government bonds, allowing traders to switch between markets. The range will soon be extended to include gilts. 'I do not really see the need for another clearing system, at a time when the Ecu market is returning to its roots as a retail bond market,' one trader said.</p>

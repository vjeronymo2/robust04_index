			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / EC unity on social policy sought THE European Commission wants to do all it can to end Britain's isolation from the rest of the European Community on social policy. Mr Padraig Flynn, EC social affairs commissioner, speaking to a Confederation of British Industry conference in London yesterday, said: 'I believe we must continue to seek to progress social policy measures among the 12 together.' Under the deal negotiated by Mr John Major, the prime minister, Britain can opt out of social regulations that the other 11 EC states may introduce in the future. But Mr Flynn warned the government that the EC would go ahead with its proposed works council directive without UK involvement if European employers and union organisations failed to reach agreement within nine months on alternative non-legal information and consultation procedures for workers in European trans-national companies. 'There is wide agreement between 11 member states on this point,' he added. Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, told the CBI that it was 'quite wrong' for the EC to go ahead with a directive on which there was total disagreement between employers and unions.</p>

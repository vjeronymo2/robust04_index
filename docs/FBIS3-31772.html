			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] We begin this news bulletin with a  report from Zagreb where a cease-fire agreement was signed today  between representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the  Croatian Defense Council [HVO].    [Reporter] The agreement on the cessation of combat  activities between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO will  go into effect on 25 February at 1200. This is stipulated by the  agreement signed in Zagreb this evening after six hours of  negotiations by the commanders of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army  and the HVO, Generals Rasim Delic and Ante Roso.    The agreement precludes all offensive operations and  envisages the cessation of combat activities in all combat  zones. UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] units are to be deployed  along the separation lines in all the combat zones. Heavy  artillery is to be placed under UNPROFOR supervision or  withdrawn to a minimal distance from the front line -- mortar  launchers to a 10-km distance and tanks and heavy guns to a  20-km distance. A joint commission, presided over by UNPROFOR,  will be formed beforehand, on the 25th, when the cease-fire goes  into effect. The commission will be based in Kiseljak and its  task will be to resolve disputed issues through UNPROFOR's  mediation.    Butrus-Ghali's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, declared that  this evening's agreement was historic and that it will bring  Bosnia-Herzegovina closer to a final peace.    [Presenter] We will acquaint you with this peace agreement  in  its entirety in continuation of our program. According to the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's press center in Zagreb, the two  delegations agreed the following:    The cease-fire, which includes an immediate and absolute  cessation of hostilities, comes into effect at 1200 on 25  February of this year and envisages the following:    -- There will be no further offensive activities or attacks;    -- All forms of propaganda spread by each side against the  other will cease;    -- The separation lines and positions must remain as they  were at the aforementioned time;    -- UNPROFOR will be deployed in sensitive areas and at key  locations in order to monitor the observance of the cease-fire  agreement;    -- All heavy weapons over 12.7 caliber shall either be  placed  under UNPROFOR supervision or withdrawn to a minimal distance  from the separation lines by 1200 on 7 March -- mortar launchers  to a distance of 10 km and tanks and artillery to a distance of  20 km;    -- A mixed commission presided over by UNPROFOR is to be  formed to tackle the problems listed in the appendix which is an  integral part of this agreement. The commission will be formed  on 25 February 1994 in Kiseljak;    -- The agreement also envisages measures to be implemented  according to their order of priority: the opening of roads for  the passage of humanitarian aid and UNPROFOR convoys, the  passage of commercial and civilian traffic, especially, but not  exclusively, between the following towns: Zenica-Stari Vitez,  Mostar-Jablanica-Konjic-Sarajevo, Kiseljak-Vares, and  Kiseljak-Bilalovac-Busovaca. Only the checkpoints on these roads  will be controlled by UNPROFOR, although both sides will be  permitted to man them as well;    -- The disbanding of internment camps, the release of POW's  and the exchange of bodies with the help of international  organizations such as the International Red Cross;    -- The unhindered and regular distribution of humanitarian  aid by the UNHCR, including heating fuel for domestic  consumption as well as the steady supply of water, electricity,  and gas;    All the above-mentioned measures are to be taken with the  aim  of bringing living conditions of the population of  Bosnia-Herzegovina back to normal. This agreement in no way  prejudges political discussions or accords that could possibly  take place or be reached in future.    It was also agreed that monthly, or more frequent,  high-level  meetings should take place between Generals Roso, Delic, and  Rose, or their representatives in case they are prevented from  attending.    The signing of the agreement was attended by the UN  secretary  general's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, as well as UNPROFOR  commanders, Generals Jean Cot and Michael Rose.    The Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation insisted in the talks on  the withdrawal of regular Croatian troops from  Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was rejected by General Roso who  denied the presence of such forces on the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    This was a report on the agreement signed by Generals Rasim  Delic and Ante Roso in Zagreb today, which we received from the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's press center.</p>

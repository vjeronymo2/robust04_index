			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Letter from Cairo: Fragile harmony when shouting stops A Christmas morning lull is inconceivable in the teeming chaos of Imbaba, the poor Cairo suburb which in the past two years has become a byword for militant Islamic fundamentalism. The morning will pass with the same incessant hubbub of daily life as any other. Indeed, it is hard to conceive of anyone enjoying a peaceful Christmas or anything else in Imbaba, where the few klaxoning cars which manage to negotiate its narrow, mud-caked streets - through the ditches, the donkey carts, the street-vendors, the mounds of rubbish and hundreds of scampering children - are barely audible above the din of people going about their business. But the few Coptic Christians whose homes and shops are scattered throughout what one Islamic militant leader last year declared the 'Islamic state' of Imbaba believe that this Christmas will, at least, be more secure than last. 'It is much better than it was, the harassment has decreased,' says Sabri, a 23-year-old Copt who sells spitroast chicken from a spartan grill on Luxor Street. 'The people who used to insult us have been arrested - there are no more left.' Across the road from his cafe more than 200 Christians gather in the simple Church of Jesus, men and women sitting apart in the undecorated church. It is adorned only with three neon-lit crosses above the altar, a few ceiling fans and some dusty but incongruously ornate chandeliers. The priest implores the faithful to raise their eyes from their poor lot and 'work not for this life, but the next'. At the back, a uniformed security guard keeps vigil. State security agents materialise instantly from the crowds outside to try to deflect the curiosity of this visiting jour-nalist. It is such watchful eyes which will assure a safe Christmas, says Sabri. 'This year we will celebrate Christmas and new year properly,' he continues. 'I feel we can this time. Last year the ones with beards stood outside the church - there was no feeling of festivity.' The 'ones with beards' are the militant Islamic fundamentalists who lent Imbaba its notoriety as they began to tighten their grip on the million people who live in the suburb's warren of bare-brick apartments and filthy streets. Preaching an absolutist Islam and a violent defiance of Egypt's secular government, these young men attacked 'un-Islamic' video shops and hairdressing salons, rounded on Moslems who drank alcohol and forced women who were not already doing so to don the veil. 'Islamic law is being applied in Imbaba,' one self-proclaimed young 'emir' said at the time, 'and, God willing, it will be applied to all of Egypt.' Up to a year ago, the militants were also harassing Imbaba's few Christians. Nobody was physically assaulted, says Sabri, but the threatening attention disturbed the otherwise calm coexistence of the two great faiths in the suburb. It was a peace, tinged perhaps with suspicion but only rare violence, which has characterised Coptic-Islamic relations in Egypt since Islam arrived from the Arabian Peninsula in the 17th century and quickly won predominance over the Coptic (which means Egyptian) Church, founded by St Mark in 41AD. But the surge of Islamic fundamentalism over the past two years, one rooted in growing poverty and disaffection with the government, began to poison social relations in Imbaba and elsewhere. Sabri recalls how, every Tuesday night, militants would gather outside the Church of Jesus. Some would brandish swords and knives, others would chant 'kill the infidels'. One night they tried unsuccessfully to torch the church. Anis, a 50-year-old Copt whose tiny tailor shop also sits across Luxor Street from the Church of Jesus, says he feared an explosion of anti-Christian feeling. 'I felt that everyone, all the young unemployed men here, would join them. If the government hadn't come in, I don't know what would have happened.' But the government did come in - mainly in an attempt to crush the cells of Islamic extremists it believed were using the central Cairo district as a base from which to launch bombings and shootings. Goaded by claims that Imbaba had become an Islamic state-within-a-state, the government one night in December last year flooded Imbaba with 14,000 armed troops and hauled off 600 alleged ringleaders. More arrests followed throughout January and February. The government then signalled its resolve to smash the extremists in March by launching a series of bloody raids on alleged extremist hide-outs, shooting 14 people dead in their homes. Since then, says Anis, the harassment has ceased. Gangs no longer gather to glower threateningly at the icon of Christ which adorns his shopfront. He no longer has to wash off black paint daubed over the holy image. Life, he says, has resumed its normal flow. But Anis does not speak comfortingly of the future. 'If the government keeps a grip on things, then we can continue to live together,' he says. 'If not, then no.' The government's priority, he says, is to conquer militant fundamentalism, not to protect Christians. 'Look at what is happening in Upper Egypt,' he adds. He is referring to clashes between militants and Copts in the villages around the Islamic strongholds of Dairut and Assiut. These flared into bloody clashes 20 months ago which eventually subsided. But sporadic killings continue and at least a dozen Copts have been slain in Upper Egypt in the past two months. 'The government just lets things go - the extremists kill Christians there, but they do nothing to protect them,' Anis says.</p>

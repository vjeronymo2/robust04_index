			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["jb"-signed report: "Report on Dukovany Is Not Secret"] </F>   [Text] Prague -- The report on the results of activities  of the State Bureau for Nuclear Safety (SUJB) in 1993, described  as secret by the Austrian weekly NEWS, was discussed by the  Czech Government on 6 April, and reporters were briefed about it  at a news conference. Ladislav Bartak, director of the SUJB  Nuclear Materials Section, told LIDOVE NOVINY about this  yesterday. He emphasized that the report on the results of the  activities of the bureau is available to any interested party.  He explained that only three of the 315 incidents registered by  the SUJB at the Dukovany nuclear power plant in 1993 were marked  level one on the INES [International Nuclear Event Scale]  international scale, and this level does not represent a danger  to nuclear safety, but rather a deviation from the officially  authorized operational regime. One hundred and two incidents  were denoted zero -- insignificant for nuclear safety. The  remaining incidents are not even registered on the INES scale.  The international scale has eight degrees (0 to 7). The  Chernobyl disaster was assessed as degree seven.</p>

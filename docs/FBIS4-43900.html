			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin -- Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt has  called for a revitalization of the traditionally good economic  relations with Saudi Arabia. According to the prereleased text  of his speech held at the opening of the two-day conference of  the bilateral economic commission in Berlin on Thursday [23  June], Rexrodt told Saudi Economics and Finance Minister Shaykh  Muhammad al-'Ali Aba-al-Khayl that he hopes to get some  information on future cooperation opportunities. The  commission, which was established in 1975, held its last meeting  in Riyadh in late February 1992. The conference will end in  Potsdam on Friday with the signing of a final protocol.    Rexrodt said he regrets that German investment in Saudi  Arabia is still very modest in volume and that it has not gone  up over the past few years. The reasons for this are not only  to be sought in Germany. Creating favorable conditions for  investment is also important for Saudi Arabia, Rexrodt said.    Rexrodt went on to express concern over the fact that German  exports to Saudi Arabia dropped by almost 15 percent in 1993,  while German imports only went down 1.1 percent. German exports  were at a high of 8.5 billion German marks [DM] in 1982. In  1993, the figure was DM3.6 billion. Imports from Saudi Arabia  amounted to some DM2 billion in 1993. The main products  imported were petroleum, fuels, and lubricating oil.    According to the Saudi Industrial Ministry, there are some  70  German-Saudi joint ventures. The German Society for Technical  Cooperation (GTZ) has arranged for over 100 experts to provide  training and consultation for Saudi institutions. Cooperation  in science and technology concentrates on the use of solar  energy for hydrogen production.</p>

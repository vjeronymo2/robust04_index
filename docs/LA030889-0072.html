			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Gulf &amp; Western Inc.: The New York-based conglomerate said net earnings for  the first quarter increased 7% to $69 million. Revenue rose 14% to $1.4  billion. The company said results were paced by a record performance from its  consumer-commercial finance unit and significant contributions from Paramount  movies such as "The Naked Gun" and "Scrooged" and television operations. These  results more than offset normal seasonal losses from publishing-information  operations, the company said.  </P></p>

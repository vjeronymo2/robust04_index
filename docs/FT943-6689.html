			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: BP sells nutrition business for Dollars 425m - Largest MBO since Gardner Merchant in 1992 British Petroleum yesterday capped a two-year effort to dispose of its nutrition business when it sold the bulk of its remaining interests for Dollars 425m (Pounds 274m), in the largest management buy-out since 1992. The sale means that BP has realised about Dollars 1.5bn in disposal proceeds since it announced its withdrawal from the nutrition industry two years ago in a move to cut debt and return to its core oil and gas business. The buy-out, which is jointly led by CINven and Baring Capital Investors, is the largest since the purchase of Gardner Merchant, the contract catering company, from Forte in 1992. Companies included in yesterday's sale are centred around the Dutch Hendrix group, which BP bought in 1979. The new company, Nutreco, will retain the existing management team led by Mr Richard van Wijnbergen, chief executive. It has 20 operating companies throughout Europe and the Americas, employs 5,700 people and will have a new headquarters at Boxmeer in the Netherlands. About two thirds of Nutreco's Dollars 2.3m of sales is in its animal feeds business, a mature market where the company is involved in a straight fight for market share. The other third of the business is in what CINven believes is the growth market supplying fish feed, an area that will benefit from growing demand for fish. It operates salmon farms in Canada and Chile. BP is being paid Dollars 425m, but the venture capitalists are raising an additional Dollars 125m for a working capital facility. CINven says the proportion of debt in the deal is in line with the market norm - a debt to equity ratio of between 1-to-1 and 2-to-1 - although it appears to be higher given the large working capital facility. BP Nutrition still has a Thai shrimp farming operation and a US fish trading arm which it wants to sell, but yesterday's disposal marks its effective withdrawal from the sector. BP's interest in nutrition began in the late 1970s, when it became involved in a process to turn oil residues into animal feeds. It came at a time of high oil prices and a trend among oil companies to diversify. The acquisition of Hendrix in 1979 for about Pounds 60m formed one of two main pillars of BP's nutrition division. The other was the purchase in 1986 of Purina Mills, the largest US animal feeds group. It was sold last year to a management group for Dollars 425m. The consumer products group within the division was also bought out by its managers last year for Pounds 250m, while the European pet foods part of the business went to Dalgety, the food and agricultural supplies group, for Pounds 42m. BP yesterday said there was no sense of failure associated with the company's diversification into nutrition. It emphasised that there had been no write-downs on any of the transactions. Two years ago some analysts had predicted that BP might struggle to find buyers for the businesses. Disposal proceeds this year now total about Dollars 1bn, compared with a target of between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.5bn. The final figure is likely to be in the middle of that range, according to company officials.</p>

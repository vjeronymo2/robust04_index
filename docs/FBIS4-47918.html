			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] has called  upon the UN Security Council to condemn the genocide being  committed in Rwanda and set up a tribunal to try those who have  been committing these crimes, beginning with October 1990 up to  now.    In a letter to the UN Security Council dated 1 May 1994, the  RPF said that the massacres in Rwanda have been two-pronged:  First, to eliminate all the political opponents of President  Habyarimana's MRND [Republican National Movement for Democracy  and Development] and CDR [Coalition for the Defense of the  Republic], and second, the massacres have been intended to  exterminate people of Tutsi origin.    The RPF says that the neo-Nazi ideology in Rwanda is using  the news that Tutsi people originated from Ethiopia and should  be therefore thrown into rivers [word indistinct] which will  eventually lead them back to Ethiopia. The massacres have  claimed more than 500,000 people [as heard] and the number is  increasing every hour.    The RPF states that the international community should go  after these criminals in Rwanda who are committing genocide in  contravention of the UN convention against genocide adopted on 9  December 1948. This genocide has been planned for some time but  was put into effect when the RPF started an open confrontation  with Habyarimana's dictatorship. [passage omitted]    The death of President Habyarimana was used as a pretext to  escalate the massacres in Rwanda. The massacres are continuing  to this day, organized by the illegitimate government in Rwanda.  The RPF requests the UN Security Council to isolate this  government on all fronts. The RPF is willing to furnish more  evidence on the genocide in Rwanda if it is requested to do so.  This letter to the UN Security Council was signed by the RPF  chairman, Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe.</p>

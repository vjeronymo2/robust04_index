			<p>SUMMARY                                    Iraqi leaders and media have vigorously supported Yemeni  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's use of force to crush the  forces of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bidh, and have blamed  the fighting in Yemen on a U.S.-Saudi-Kuwaiti conspiracy to  break up Yemeni unity.  President Saddam Husayn's perception  of the intra-Yemeni war as a proxy conflict with Saudi  Arabia, in which his personal prestige and Iraq's strategic  interests are at stake, is reflected in the strong and  unprecedented public riposte that his half-brother Barzan  received for expressing a lone dissenting view on Yemen.                              END SUMMARY      Baghdad signaled its position on 18 April, ten days before  the first Yemeni battle on 27-28 April.  The Iraqi News  Agency (INA) cited a Salih emissary to Saddam as saying that  Saddam "had a distinguished role in the realization of  Yemeni unity, and that his excellency is still extremely  interested in safeguarding this Yemeni Arab achievement" (18  April).      Within days after major fighting erupted on 4 May, and  within a day of the south's secession on 21 May, Baghdad  authoritatively expressed its unreserved support for Salih  against al-Bidh in statements by the ruling Ba'th Party  National Command and the foreign minister, respectively:      -- The Ba'th Party informed "genuinely patriotic and pan-  Arab" Yemenis that "we support you in confronting this  danger" and in ending "the sedition and conspiracy against  unity."  The Ba'th Party also rejected "every reason, act,  or justification that encroaches on the entity of unity"  (Baghdad radio, 8 May).      -- Foreign Minister Muhammad Said al-Sahhaf said Iraq  "emphasizes its full support for the territorial and popular  unity of sisterly Yemen and supports the legitimate and  constitutional authority in Yemen, led by President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih."  He added that "we strongly condemn the  ugly secessionist action carried out by 'Ali Salim al-Bidh  and his group," which he also characterized as "the renegade  and backward forces" (INA, 22 May).     Iraqi media blamed the fighting primarily on alleged U.S.,  Saudi, and Kuwaiti efforts to destabilize Yemen.  For  example:      -- An editorial in the Information Ministry's daily Al-  Jumhuriyah claimed that the killing in Yemen had been  "arranged" by the United States and its "reactionary" Arab  "satellites" -- an unmistakable allusion to Saudi Arabia and  Kuwait (INA, 7 May).      -- An article in Babil, the daily of Saddam's son 'Udayy,  claimed that the United States "provides weapons to, and  protects, the separatists in southern Sudan, northern Iraq,  and southern Yemen," thus promoting "the spilling of Arab  blood"  (INA, 24 May).      -- In another Babil article, Information Ministry First  Under Secretary Nuri Najm al-Marsumi accused "the Saudi and  Kuwaiti rulers and the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa" of  "involvement in a multi-chapter conspiracy" against Yemeni  unity.  He charged the Yemeni socialists with "coordinating"  with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and forgetting that they are  "no more than tools to destroy their homeland and future"  (INA, 26 May).      Barzan's Heretical Analysis      In contrast to the officially approved propaganda line in  Iraqi media, Barzan -- who is an adviser to Saddam as well  as the Iraqi ambassador to the UN institutions in Geneva --  presented a totally different analysis in Al-Jumhuriyah (8  May).  Without blaming any external forces, Barzan described  the fighting in Yemen as "the result of a relationship  between two contradictory regimes, which were placed within  the framework of unity."  Seeming to question the judgment  of Saddam, who was the strongest non-Yemeni promoter of this  framework, Barzan added that "many people all over the Arab  homeland seeking or opposing the concept of unity voiced  their doubts" about the project.      Barzan's main thesis was that Yemenis have two reasonable  alternatives, each of which is far superior to the current  war:  "Either [incomplete] unity that respects everyone and  guarantees mutual rights, or a return to the state of  separation and the previous situation."  He argued that the  Yemenis had made an "impulsive" and "emotional" choice for  unity "without paying heed" to "the reality of internal  political divisions" and without sufficiently exploring  "whether each party is willing to make concessions . . .  in  order to achieve unity."   Seeming to criticize Salih and  his supporters, Barzan said the situation developed into "an  all-out war" because "some people think it is either full  unity or an all-out war," a view he described as "wrong."  Apparently showing some understanding for the position of  al-Bidh and his followers, Barzan said that "no one can  ignore certain realities in Yemen's unity, namely, that some  leaders who were addicted to authority found themselves  after the unity in secondary positions and were stripped of  their actual authority."  Barzan added that "any belief by  any party that the unity can be saved by force will deepen  the wounds and increase the destruction and will make unity  a dream that will never see the light."  On the other hand,  "returning to the situation that prevailed in 1989 means  there will be a relationship based on mutual respect and a  hope that unity will be achieved one day."      Response to Barzan      Although Barzan has published unorthodox views in the past,  this article is the first to elicit a monitored hostile  response.  Published in Babil just one day after Barzan's  article, the response was almost certainly approved at the  highest level since its author, using the pseudonym "'Umar  al-Kazimi," was evidently given access to Barzan's article  before its publication and would not have dared to attack  Barzan without Saddam's backing.      Al-Kazimi claimed that it had gradually become clear from  Barzan's writings that he has acquired ideas "different from  our way of thinking in Iraq" and has moved "closer to the  inclinations of persons who live abroad" -- a very serious  charge in Baghdad's political lexicon.      Denying that Yemen has "two conflicting regimes," al-Kazimi  said that "when Iraq was strong . . . Yemeni unity was a  model," but that since then "one Yemeni side" succumbed to  "Saudi intrigues" and started to move "in the direction of  the sides that were hostile to Iraq" in the Mother of  Battles.  Al-Kazimi placed this change in the context of a  decrease of Arab support for Iraq, citing Morocco, Tunisia,  and Jordan as countries that have become less neutral or  less pro-Iraqi than they were in August 1990.  In contrast  to Barzan, Al-Kazimi claimed that "the plan being carried  out in Yemen today is not just an outcome of the conflict  between Yemenis, but also a plan drawn up and studied abroad  to divide Yemen."      Indirectly emphasizing the conflict's strategic and  ideological significance for Iraq, al-Kazimi said that "the  existence of a strong Yemen south of Saudi Arabia and a  strong Iraq north of it constitutes a strategic danger to  the ruling family in the Arabian Peninsula," and added that  both Iraq and Yemen cherish "pan-Arab aspirations."      In contrast to Barzan's opposition to achieving unity by  armed force, al-Kazimi claimed that "no Arab unity has been  achieved without the use of armed force" because it is the  only way to deal with "egotistical Arab individuals who love  shaykhdoms and being a shaykh."  He commended Salih for  rejecting mediation, which al-Kazimi claimed would have led  to Yemen's division.  He called the war in Yemen "a full  liberation war" and compared it to "the period of treachery  and treason" in the spring of 1991, which he depicted as an  attempt to divide Iraq into three states.      Taking Barzan's statement that "the dream of unity has .  become a nightmare, and not just in Yemen" as intended to  apply to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and its current domestic  situation, Al-Kazimi replied, "No.  Never" and claimed that  unlike the attempted union of Syria and Egypt (1958-61),  Iraq and Yemen each possess "real unity" and that "the firm  conviction" of unity will never be shaken.  He added, "we  totally disagree" with Barzan's thesis.      Al-Kazimi seemed to presuppose that Barzan regarded the  Mother of Battles as an aberration and Iraq's fault.  Thus,  he took Barzan to task for saying that 20 Arab states have  managed to coexist without fighting by responding that "half  of the regimes of the nation turned their armies" against  Iraq.  He concluded by praising the Yemeni "unionists" and  claiming that Yemen can be "redeemed" only by "bloodshed"  and "sacrifices."     Background      The line that Saudi Arabia and the United States are seeking  to destabilize Yemen has appeared in Baghdad media since  1992.  For example:      -- In May 1992, the party daily Al-Thawrah claimed that as  part of an "American plan" to "punish Yemen for its support  of Iraq," Washington's "main agent [King] Fahd" was working  "to destroy Yemen politically and economically" (INA, 20 May  1992).      -- In May 1993, an editorial in Babil accused Saudi Arabia  and the United States of "systematic and comprehensive  action to remove the Yemeni leadership and undermine Yemeni  unity so as to enable reactionary forces linked to them to  seize power" (INA, 2 May 1993).      -- In November 1993, an article in Al-Qadisiyah claimed that  Saudi Arabia had spent large sums "in bribes" for "the  perpetration of crimes aimed at igniting sedition" in Yemen  (INA, 11 November 1993).      Throughout this period, Baghdad has proclaimed its support  for Yemen.  For example, member of the Ba'th Party Command  'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur, speaking to a visiting Yemeni  politician from Salih's party, "reasserted support for, and  solidarity with, fraternal Yemen in its confrontation  against Saudi plots in an effort to safeguard its national  unity, stability, and sovereignty" (Baghdad radio, 8 June  1992).      Baghdad has also indicated willingness to show its support  for Yemen in a practical manner.  After a trip to Yemen in  January 1993, Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan said he had  informed his Yemeni interlocutors of "Iraq's constant  readiness to meet Yemen's needs in terms of the necessary  technical assistance and consultations in all spheres so  that Yemen's potential for development and progress may be  enhanced."  He added that he had discussed "areas in which  we could enhance bilateral cooperation to foster a unity of  views and close the doors and loopholes to . . . the  malicious plots targeting Yemeni unity" (Baghdad radio, 2  January 1993).      Implications      Saddam's reported statement to Salih's emissary that he is  "extremely interested" in safeguarding Yemen's unity -- as  well as the unprecedented appearance of a quick rebuff to  Barzan's heretical views on Yemen -- reflects Saddam's  investment of his prestige in the cause of Yemeni unity and  his desire to thwart the Saudi ruling family, which he views  as a strategic and ideological enemy that is at odds with a  country he regards as a strategic and ideological ally.  The  Iraqi regime seems to perceive the Yemeni conflict as a  continuation within the Arab context of the divisions  manifested in the Mother of Battles and would therefore  regard a Salih victory as being a victory for Iraq as well.      While Barzan's dissent on Yemen cannot be taken as a signal  of disloyalty to Saddam, the public airing of such  differences within the regime is bound to be noticed by  politically astute Iraqis and raise doubts about the  ultimate survivability of the regime.

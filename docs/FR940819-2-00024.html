			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 7: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Petitioners contend that CBCC made no provision in its calculation of charcoal costs for the effects of inflation when CBCC harvested an area. Petitioners note that the Department requested additional documentation from CBCC at verification regarding CBCC's estimates of charcoal harvest and the other assumptions CBCC built into its calculation of charcoal cost. Petitioners contend that, because CBCC failed to provide information, the Department should apply BIA. Petitioners argue that use of BIA is appropriate when a respondent refuses to submit information after being asked to do so, and where the refusal to provide the requested information impedes the Department's proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners contend that CBCC's failure to provide the appropriate information justifies the use of noncooperative BIA for CBCC. Finally, if the Department determines not to use noncooperative BIA for CBCC, petitioners suggest that the Department adjust CBCC's reported cost for company-produced charcoal upward to an amount equal to that charged to CBCC from unrelated suppliers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with petitioners that we should adjust CBCC's charcoal replacement costs. However, we disagree that CBCC was noncooperative and should receive a margin based solely upon BIA. We discovered errors made by CBCC when it calculated its cost of producing charcoal, a primary raw material used in the production of silicon metal. For purposes of calculating replacement costs, CBCC substantially understated its cost of producing charcoal by inaccurately recording the costs associated with its forests which provide the raw material needed to produce charcoal. We note, however, that CBCC reported cost information consistent with that which is maintained in its normal cost accounting system. Therefore, we have recalculated the cost of CBCC's production of charcoal. We relied upon the actual weighted-average monthly cost CBCC was charged by unrelated vendors.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 8: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Petitioners argue that the Department should revise CBCC's reported 1992 quartz replacement costs upward to account for the more costly delivery charges the Department discovered at verification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  At verification we noted that CBCC changed procedures for quartz purchasing in 1992. Because we found that CBCC's reported quartz replacement costs for 1992 did not reflect the entire cost of the material, we randomly chose May 1992 as a sample to determine the amount of the discrepancy. In establishing the amount of the discrepancy, we valued all quartz purchases received in May at the delivered price in effect for the region of origin. This reconciliation indicated that CBCC's estimate of delivery charges for this month understated the per ton cost for quartz by approximately four percent. Because CBCC did not fully report its quartz replacement costs, we have applied partial BIA for this material. As BIA, we have adjusted upward the reported quartz prices reported for January through May 1992 by four percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 9: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Petitioners contend that CBCC's calculation of inventory holding gains/losses is flawed. Petitioners note that there is a large difference between the amount of silicon metal produced by CBCC and the amount of silicon metal sold by CBCC. Petitioners also object to the limited data provided by CBCC for electrode paste and charcoal and argue that CBCC's inclusion of a large year-end depreciation charge in December 1991 resulted in significantly understated COPs for all but one month of the review period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners assert that, by using sales and production data provided by CBCC, petitioners have derived a corrected inventory holding gain/loss calculation for CBCC. Petitioners contend that the Department should use petitioners' revised calculation of CBCC's inventory holding gains/losses in the final results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have reviewed CBCC's calculation of inventory holding gains/losses (see CBCC's February 24, 1993 submission at Exhibit A) and have found certain inconsistencies which render that calculation unacceptable. For certain months CBCC reported sales and shipments of silicon metal but showed no removal of silicon metal from inventory. In other months, the tonnage of silicon metal removed from inventory was either much less or much greater than the amount of merchandise that CBCC reported in its sales listings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, we find that petitioners' ``corrected'' calculation of CBCC's inventory gains/losses is also unacceptable since it fails to account for finished silicon metal consumed in the production of other products. Accordingly, we have rejected both CBCC's and petitioners' calculation of inventory gains/losses, and have removed this item from our COP/CV calculations, which has the effect of increasing COP/CV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 10: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Petitioners argue that the Department should make an addition to CBCC's COP to account for certain costs (power, secondary materials and crushing costs) which CBCC omitted from CBCC's revised COP/CV calculation. Petitioners note that these expenses were included in CBCC's original COP/CV response.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CBCC contends that power, secondary materials and crushing costs were included in its revised response under the variable ``VARCOM.'' CBCC argues that it summarized these three costs in order to comply with the Department's reporting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Although the power, secondary materials and crushing costs were not detailed in CBCC's revised COP/CV calculations, the total reported costs furnished by CBCC (variables ``TOTCOP'' and ``TOTCV'') did include these expenses. CBCC did omit these items from the variables representing variable overhead, fixed overhead, and total variable cost of manufacturing,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  variables ``VARFOH'', ``FIXFOH'', and ``TOTCOM''. However, since CBCC included these expenses in its calculation of total COM, no adjustment to CBCC's reported COP or CV is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 11:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Petitioners contend the Department should reject CBCC's allocation of general and administrative (G&amp;A) and selling expenses. (CBCC allocated these expenses to individual products using the ratio of each product's cost of goods sold (COGS).) Petitioners contend that the Department should follow its established practice and allocate these expenses to total COGS, as the Department did in the preliminary results of this review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CBCC suggests that the allocation of G&amp;A and selling expenses used in the Department's preliminary calculations results in a systematic overstatement of these expenses. CBCC argues that the Department should allocate the ratio of G&amp;A and selling expenses by the historical ratio of these expenses to historical COM. CBCC notes that the Department followed this methodology in the redetermination of the original investigation for this proceeding (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Silicon Metal from Brazil: Preliminary Determination on Remand, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (November 17, 1993, at 5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

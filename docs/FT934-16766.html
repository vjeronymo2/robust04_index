			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Gloomy forecast for construction THE RECESSION in the construction industry is set to continue, more jobs will go and sustained recovery is not expected until 1995, a forecast yesterday from the Building Employers Confederation says. The confederation's autumn state-of-trade inquiry, based on a poll of 600 companies, found that only a third of companies were confident of an increase in output over the next 12 months, with the rest predicting a decline or at best no change. A fifth of companies expect to reduce their workforce still further over the next few months. Employment in the industry has fallen by more than 500,000 since the middle of 1989 - the present recession is now the longest in the industry since the 1930s. Sir Brian Hill, the confederation's president, said: 'The construction recession is still continuing and it must be worrying that the majority of firms do not expect any improvement in output over the next 12 months. This will postpone any sustained recovery until 1995. 'This must also mean that unemployment levels will remain high over the same period, which in turn will further damage the industry's training and recruitment programmes.' The survey's findings are in line with recent industry forecasts of a further 2 per cent fall in construction industry output this year, making a total fall of about 17 per cent over the past three years. However, the confederation said more companies reported an increase in third-quarter output, compared with the second quarter. Work inquiries had also improved, albeit only slightly and from a low base. The survey found that the housing market had shown some improvement from last year, but was still a long way from recovery. The confederation said fears of redundancy and uncertainties about possible tax changes in the November Budget continued to undermine buyers' confidence. In the private commercial sector the level of inquiries had again fallen sharply. In the private industrial sector, growth prospects had improved in line with those in the manufacturing sector. But because of the time lag between output and investment, a large revival is considered unlikely unless Budget measures are introduced to bring forward investment. The repair and maintenance market showed signs of improving. The confederation said output improved among companies in the south, south-west, north and north-west but fell in London, the Midlands and the Yorkshire region. State of Trade Inquiry.

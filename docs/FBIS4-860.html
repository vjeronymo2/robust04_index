			<p>BFN     [Text] In Kigali, the fighting continues. The Rwandan  Patriotic Front [RPF] combatants are still holding all the  positions they captured. Mutara region is under the control of  the RPF combatants. The government troops never returned there.  In the Byumba area, the RPF troops are doing very well.  Contrary to lies that have been spread, Byumba town is entirely  in the hands of the RPF troops. In Ruhengeri, the RPF  combatants control many areas of the prefecture while the  government troops are tired and have started fleeing. They have  now resorted to seeking help from the Interahamwe [Republican  National Movement for Democracy and Development militias] and  Coalition for the Defense of the Republic members, involving  them in a war they know very well that they will never win.</p>

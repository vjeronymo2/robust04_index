			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. A. Arkhipov, V. S. Volkova, V. A. Bakhareva, </F> M. R. Votakh, T. P. Levina, S. K. Krivonogov and L. A. Orlova,  Joint Institute of Geology, Geophysics and Mineralogy, Siberian  Department, Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk; UDC  551.582(571.1)]    [Abstract] A predictive scenario of landscape-climatic  conditions to the year 2000 is proposed for Western Siberia. It  is based on the principle of paleoclimatic analogues,  establishing a correlation between the concentrations of carbon  dioxide gas in the atmosphere and in the ocean surface layer and  the Earth's global temperatures. The results of  chronostratigraphic and paleobotanical studies are used in  reconstructing the landscape-climatic conditions of the Holocene  climatic optimum which prevailed in Western Siberia about 5500  years ago because due to the anthropogenic factor it is expected  that by 2000 the CO[.sub]2[/] level will be restored to the  conditions observed there during that time. The natural climatic  changes in Western Siberia, like those for Siberia as a whole,  fit in quite well with global environmental changes. The  climatic rhythm established for the Holocene, as well as  definite refinements obtained using specifically Siberian  materials, make possible a quite reliable prediction of the  nature and direction of natural climatic processes in the near  future. The natural trend, giving evidence of progressive  cooling, very probably was disrupted in the 1970's by the  anthropogenic factor leading to global warming. The climate is  becoming milder, in northern Siberia warmer and moister, whereas  in the south, in arid steppe regions, it is becoming moister.  The transformation of landscapes, vegetation zonality,  permafrost, variations of river runoff and lake levels will  occur with a definite lag because the rate of anthropogenically  induced climatic conditions exceeds the natural trend by tens or  hundreds of times. How soon serious deformations of natural  systems will begin will evidently be dependent on the climatic  trend in the 21st century. Figures 6; references 47: 42 Russian,  5 Western.</p>

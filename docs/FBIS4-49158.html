			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, May 2 (XINHUA) -- A rational grain price  is the core for the establishment of a grain purchasing and  selling mechanism compatible with a socialist market economy,  said Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji.    Zhu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the  Communist  Party's Politburo, made the remark during an inspection of the  agricultural situation in east China's Zhejiang Province from  April 26 to May 2.    The vice-premier further explained that this grain price not  only can help bring into full play the initiative of farmers in  growing grain, but also can help lessen the difference between  industrial products and farm produce, and urban residents can  also bear it.    Judging from the overall national economic situation, Zhu  said, it is quite necessary for coastal areas to promote  agricultural production, and there are brights prospects for  doing so.    During his inspection tour in Zhejiang, Zhu inspected grain  purchasing centers, grain depots, grain shops, farmers' markets  and the Grand Dike of Taihu Lake in the Hangjiahu area, visited  several successful households specializing in growing grain, and  listened to work reports of local officials, obtaining  first-hand information about agricultural production, especially  about the grain production situation and grain purchasing and  selling system.    The vice-premier also toured factories to see workers who  were on duty on May 1 -- usually a day of leave -- and chatted  with some factory leaders.    Since Zhejiang province is one of China's important grain  producers, especially the key grain production center of  Hangjiahu plain, so grain production here can never be  slackened, said Zhu.    "From the perspective of China's land resources, total grain  output and foreign exchange balance, the coastal areas should  never neglect agriculture after they become economically  prosperous. They cannot become dependent for food supplies on  grain purchased at high prices from inland areas or on grain  imports," he said.    Active efforts should be made to probe into methods for  carrying out agricultural management on a fairly large scale,  said the vice- premier, expressing the belief that depending  only on raising grain prices could hardly solve the problem of  comparatively lower efficiency which grain growers face in these  areas.    He spoke highly of Zhejiang Province's practices in helping  local specialized grain production households in their  contracted management. The vice-premier visited several such  households, each managing 10 hectares or more farmland and  earning more than those working in the local township  enterprises.    He stressed that encouraging households to carry out grain  production by contracting large stretches of farmland and  developing agricultural management on a fairly large scale is in  accordance with the household responsibility system and has  proved to be quite effective. Therefore, it should be persisted  in for a long term, he said.    However, concentrating land use rights in the hands of large  grain growing households should be conducted on a voluntary  basis, said Zhu, while urging the vigorous development of  socialized services for agricultural production and giving aid  to such households in the forms of agricultural machinery,  pesticides, seeds, technology and loans.    The vice-premier focused his tour on the inspection of the  grain purchasing and selling system.    He stressed that reasonable grain prices should based on the  supply and demand in the market but the market should be under  the supervision of the government. He also stressed that  state-owned grain departments should keep necessary grain so as  to play the role of balancing grain prices.    "Governments at various levels should adopt flexible  measures  to exercise management and control over the grain market, in a  bid to maintain a basic stability of grain prices at the  market," he said.    He said that grain deals and allocation between different  regions should be conducted through market under government  control. Unqualified wholesalers must not be allowed to enter  the villages and fields to force up grain prices, he added.    The vice-premier also urged the arrangement of enough funds  to ensure a smooth purchase of farm produce in the upcoming  summer harvest.    Talking about the shortage of circulating funds many  industrial enterprises now face, Zhu said that the State Council  had made some adjustment of credit policies concerning  circulating funds of industrial enterprises so as to alleviate  the difficulty of some state-owned enterprises and promote the  transformation of enterprise management mechanisms in these  enterprises.    He believed that the problem of fund shortages would  gradually be alleviated through concerted efforts of governments  at various levels and enterprises themselves.</p>

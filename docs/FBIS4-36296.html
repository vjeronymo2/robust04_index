			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mahfuz al-Ansari] </F>   [Text] It seems that the UN Security Council resolution  calling for an immediate cease-fire in Yemen has signalled, in  fact and practice, the beginning of a process toward:    1. Secession and the return of the situation to what it  was before April 1990 -- a state in the north with its capital  Sanaa and a state in the south with its capital Aden.    2. Internalization after the failure of the local and  internal efforts to reconcile the warring factions in Yemen.  Added to this is the failure of regional and pan-Arab mediation  efforts by the Arab brothers and neighbors and their Arab  League. Following this national and pan-Arab failure, there is  a need for an "international" solution to at least stop the  bloodbath and end the massacres that the two sides have been  carrying out with great appetite.    3. Intervention after the sides which have an interest  with this or that side and which have aligned with the south or  supported the north have contented themselves with closely  follow-up the situation or secretly helping this or that side  during the past month of fighting.    After this anticipation, caution, claim of neutrality, and  non-disclosure of true positions and feelings and after the  Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire,  the external parties -- neighbors and non-neighbors -- will find  enough cover to intervene publicly and to morally and  financially support the side that they believe will achieve  their objectives.    There is nothing better than an international umbrella which  states will use as an excuse for their intervention. This is  particularly so because up to the moment the Security Council  resolution was issued, the parties to the dispute had embarked  on a course leading to:    1. Secession.    2. Internationalization as a cover from beginning to end.    3. Active foreign intervention with politics and even  with arms and forces.    The race of the two leaders, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali  Salim al-Bid, ended in a tie.    Salih fired three long-range missiles on Aden -- its  mosques,  houses, and inhabitants.    Al-Bid responded by forming a government in the south under  Haydar al-'Attas and including as members all those who can  offer support in the battle for survival and existence.  Al-Bid's traditional allies, his old rivals in the party and  power struggle, and 'Ali Salih's foes in the north, such as  'Abdallah al-Asnaj, are all qualified to join this government.    'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, with his missiles and his forces's  activity around Aden and the roads leading to it, wanted to  settle the situation militarily and from a strong position  before accepting the UN Security Council cease-fire resolution.  'Ali Salim al-Bid wanted to impose a fait accompli. He hoped  that negotiations on an international or regional solution or  settlement through mediation efforts and good offices would be  held on the basis of this fait accompli, which offers two  separate and disputant states--not two disputant regions within  one state.    Before analyzing the situation and its future possibilities  in light of the UN resolution, I would like to explain Egypt's  stance on the crisis.    There is a mistaken feeling which has developed innocently  or  not-so-innocently in the Egyptian public and the Arab and world  media that Egypt's stance essentially supports 'Ali Salim al-Bid  and hence secession. Some consider support for secession an  unforgivable sin. This mistaken feeling is translated by some  inside and outside Egypt as reflecting hostility to President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salim for his stand on the terrorists whom he has  sheltered and to whom he has opened training centers where they  plan and concoct plots under complete freedom without any  restrictions.    The truth of the matter is different. Cairo's relations with  Sanaa -- the Sanaa of unity or the Sanaa of the north -- is very  good, especially with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.    The reason is that Cairo has accurate data, containing  numbers and names, on the size of this "presence" of "political  Islam" groups on the land of Yemen. They include Egyptians,  Sudanese, Palestinians, Lebanese, Algerians, Afghans, and others.    Egypt knows the powers that foster, protect, finance, and  nurture these activities in and out of Yemen. It knows the  "influence of the state," as represented by President Salih and  his men and institutions, and knows the extent and limits of its  ability to control. It knows about the power of the tribes and  the leaders of "political Islam," their size, influence, and  scope of control.    In many of its features, dimensions, and characteristics,  this situation is similar to the relation between the authority  of Sudanese President Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir and  that of "Shaykh Hasan," or Dr. Hasan al-Turabi and his [National  Salvation] front. Despite the ranks shown on their shoulders  and the military medals decorating their chests, the heads of  authority in Sanaa and Sudan, Salih and al-Bashir, own but do  not rule, and neither al-Turabi nor al-Ahmar carry ranks on  their shoulders or military medals on their chest.    Cairo certainly knows what is happening on the Yemeni and  Sudanese soils; it knows about the existence, the figures, the  size, and the activity linked to violence and political Islam  groups.    What interests us today is Yemen and the "extremist" and  hostile presence there. We are interested in Yemen, both its  northern and southern sectors, particularly during its time of  unity from May 1990 to May 1994.    In the northern governorate of Sa'dah, there is a camp named  Sinnarah that provides training in urban warfare, blowing up  roads, and spreading armed anarchy. Among the members of this  camp, there are Algerians, Tunisians, Sudanese, Libyans,  Palestinians, and of course Egyptians, specifically 16 Egyptians.    There is (al-Raht) camp in the governorate of Lahij in the  south. It belongs to the al-Jihad Organization and its training  techniques focus on "sabotage" operations. Weapons, equipment,  and supplies are sent directly to this camp from the capital of  the north, or rather the capital of unity, Sanaa, via mountain  paths across (Tawr al-Bahah).    In the governorate of Ta'izz, a major northern city, lies  Rawnah camp, where a number of Egyptians belonging to the  al-Jihad Organization and the Vanguards of Conquest receive  their training.    There is also the camp of ('Ataq and Gharran) in the  governorate of Shabwah, the oil-rich area of the south.    In all these camps, as well as in homes and hideouts and in  the areas protected by northern army brigades like al-'Amaliqah  Brigade, stationed in the south, there are active Egyptian  elements. These elements arrive there, receive their training,  then disperse to carry out the tasks entrusted to them. Cairo  knows this and knows many other things.    It knows that Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar and his half brother  'Ali Salim are among the major loyalists and active leaders of  political Islam and its organizations, those of the "Iranian  school," those led and financed by Usamah Bin-Ladin and his  disciples, or those of the international organization in which  Shaykh Hasan al-Turabi plays an important, powerful, and active  role.    A number of integrated, conflicting, and interlinked factors  are involved in that blend; they move it and guarantee its  existence. That blend involves the temptation of money, an  abundance of it. It involves the "suspicious" connection with  the elements of international collusion that seek to keep the  area under control by maintaining its backwardness and  infighting, or by fanning tribal or regional fanaticism or local  rivalry. It also involves love for adventure and a desire to  seek a certain role, even through crime and terrorism, and  finally involves a twisted and erroneous understanding of Islam,  its message, and essence.    Ugly and serious as it might be, one thing is certain -- the  fact that acting in the name of unity or partition, the central  government in Sanaa exercises control only on "civilian" areas  in and around big cities. Control beyond these limits is in the  hands of tribes and their chieftains, who are backed by the  groups and the "amirs and shaykhs" of political Islam, who are  in actual control at present.    In this light, Cairo has realized that backing the civilian  authority -- as represented in the head of state, his  foundations and institutions and, particularly, his army -- is  the only way to maintain and safeguard Yemen's march toward  breaking free from tribalism and imams rule. This is the only  way to guarantee an end to grudges, rivalry, and infighting just  to oblige the "chieftain" or the leaders or amirs of  organizations that pursue violence and terrorism in the name of  religion.    When Cairo declared its stand through President Mubarak  that unity cannot be imposed by force and maintained by  bloodshed, it meant to prevent deepening the wound and meant to  curb the dispute, division, and hatred caused by wars and  destruction. It sought to preserve Yemen's forces,  institutions, and lively and enlightened forces both in the  north and the south.    If the experiment of the past four years could not build  unitary institutions in the army, administration and in people's  minds, the path is still open and the future is still full of  hope provided that ties are maintained, partition is not  consolidated by wasted blood in the north and the south, and  Yemen's strength and resources are preserved. That is why the  contacts by the two sides of the crisis Salih and Salim with  President Mubarak have not ceased.    Let us go back to the beginning of the article. What will  happen after the Security Council resolution to halt the  fighting which, as we indicated, opened the way to  internationalization, partition, and intervention?    One of the strategic experts concerned with the Yemeni  crisis  and its developments presents three possible scenarios after the  Security Council's cease-fire resolution.    First, in his view, the north will declare that it has  accepted the resolution, which it did. But at the same time it  continues its action on the ground by striking at cities and  homes, especially Aden, it completely rejects dialogue with the  Socialist Party leaders, especially al-Bid and his men, and it  demands dialogue with other Socialist Party leaders to be  designated by itself. Through big, tempting promises, the north  could impose on them its conditions and achieve the formula it  is seeking which is naturally the continuation of the unity  under its leadership and control.    Such a scenario is not applicable and is far from being a  solution and settlement. It opens the door to a painful,  drawn-out war of annihilation between the north and the south  and also opens the door to a sharp division within the Socialist  Party ranks and leaders and the southern leaders amid the  tragedies of war and the effects of bombardment and destruction  with an apparent superiority of the northern forces.    In second scenario, the north will accept the cease-fire  through negotiations with the south and Socialist Party leaders,  led by al-Bid. The conditions for this second probability are:    -The south and its forces should be able to hold out  militarily and prevent the northern forces from capturing Aden,  Hadhramout, and Mukalla through a reasonable and firm military  position.    -This steadfastness by the southerners should be coupled  with  and backed by active, effective international pressure and  sincere goodwill efforts forcing the northerners to initiate a  dialogue and disengage the forces. This will pave the way for  talk about unity at present and in the future or about any other  formula.    In the third scenario, the Security Council's resolution  will  be practically rejected outright and the fighting and marches on  cities and important junctions will continue even if the  cease-fire remained in place while the true situation is the  opposite.    Such a probability, as well as the blood and destruction  caused by it every day and every moment and the potential  foreign interventions in favor of this or that party may prompt  the international community and the international organization  to escalate its resolutions from a kind request for a cease-fire  to punishing the violators of the cease-fire through the  imposition of a blockade and economic and military sanctions and  the like.    Such a worsening and crumbling situation will not be  accompanied by only foreign and regional interventions from the  neighbors but may also prompt many countries to promote the  recognition and perpetuation of a complete separation between  the north and the south and may subject the two sides of the  crisis to the will of the parties that provide each side with  money, arms, food supplies, and political support.    This picture in general reflects the situation in Yemen as  it  would be after the war continued and acts of destruction and  shelling continued and went beyond all limits of what is  prohibited, thus violating all laws.    Perhaps the voice of wisdom and reason and the call of  patriotic conscience may preserve the Yemeni homeland or what  remains of its elements of strength and life and what remains of  the dreams and hopes of unity and merger.</p>

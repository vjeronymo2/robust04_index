			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ILL WINDS BLOW AT TORREY PINES  </P> <P> Winter, or at least what passes for one in this usually temperate zone, has  arrived just in time for today's start of the $900,000 Shearson Lehman Hutton  Open.  </P> <P> And one trip around Torrey Pines Golf Course during Wednesday's pro-am showed  that, despite sunny skies, the change in weather could mean trouble for the 156  golfers who usually turn this annual tournament into one of the easiest scoring  stops on the PGA Tour.  </P> <P> As blustery winds -- close to 35 m.p.h. with a temperature that barely got over  50 -- blew off the Pacific Ocean, spectators huddled in small groups, trying to  fend off the gusts. The golfers dressed in layers: long johns, bulky sweaters  and rain suits. A few donned wooly pullover caps more suited to the slopes than  the links.  </P> <P> This was the kind of a day that helped put the eastward lean into the  indigenous torrey pines that dot the seaside course.  </P> <P> "Something hot feels good," said Payne Stewart as he entered the interview  room, spooning into a bowl of soup. "It's a bit brisk out there."  </P> <P> It wasn't so biting that Stewart abandoned his trademark knickers but windy  enough that it could influence the way the tournament will be played.  </P> <P> "The wind is affecting the tee shots," Fred Couples said. "I was hitting a lot  more one-irons and three-woods to the green. If it stays windy like this and  the greens dry up, it is going to be very tough."  </P> <P> That would be a major departure.  </P> <P> Last year's winner, Greg Twiggs, shot a four-round total of 271, 17 under par,  as the first 38 finishers were within eight strokes of each other. Couples said  he is not expecting that kind of scoring if the weather continues as it has.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying that someone isn't going to shoot a 64 or 65," said Couples,  who finished in a four-way tie for 12th last year at 276. "But he will have a  big lead instead of being one shot ahead like usual here."  </P> <P> The field also might have something to do with that. It is not the strongest  that has contested the tournament in its 23 years at Torrey Pines.  </P> <P> Only two of the 10 leading money winners from the 1989 PGA Tour -- No. 2  Stewart and No. 6 Tim Simpson -- are entered. And arguably its biggest draw,  two-time champion Tom Watson, withdrew late last week for personal reasons.  </P> <P> But in this golfing era of spreading the wealth, there are plenty of other  winners to go around. Twenty five champions of tour events in 1989 and 1990 are  entered, including Twiggs and three -- rookie Robert Gamez (Tucson), Tommy  Armour III (Phoenix) and Mark O'Meara of Escondido (Pebble Beach) -- from the  first six tour events this year.  </P> <P> Twiggs, the former San Diego State player, is the most recent of a group of 10  returning former champions at Torrey Pines, including the past seven winners.  Twiggs' victory was his first on the tour and worth $126,000, more than he had  made in his first four years on the tour.  </P> <P> And if a recent trend holds, chances are reasonable for another first-time  winner. Three of the first six tour events this year were won by first-timers  -- Gamez, Armour and David Ishii Sunday at the Hawaiian Open.  </P> <P> Unlike most stops on the tour, the field is split over two courses for the  first two days as the players alternate rounds between the North and South  courses. The final two days are played exclusively on the South.  </P> <P> One of the keys to the title has been a low score on the North Course. Both  courses are par 72, but the North at 6,659 yards is 362 yards shorter than the  South. Couples said, however, that the weather also could play havoc with that  traditional strategy, although winds are expected to diminish somewhat today.  </P> <P> "Usually you have to shoot a 68 on the North Course or you lose ground, but it  won't be that way this year," he said.  </P> <P> Another key for players is to not let the general condition of the course  disturb their often-fragile psyches. Having grown finicky from a steady stream  of tournaments played mostly on exclusive country-club courses, the pros wince  a bit when it comes time to play Torrey Pines, one of two municipal courses on  the 44-stop PGA Tour (the other is En-Joie Golf Course in Endicott, N.Y., site  of the B.C. Open).  </P> <P> The greens are not as smooth, the rough not as lush and the fairways not as  well groomed as most tour courses. It's one of those things the pros like to  talk about when they come to Torrey Pines, and maybe one of the reasons several  of the bigger names skip it each year.  </P> <P> Even given that, some players are finding conditions better than what they have  been used to here.  </P> <P> "It's not country-club plush," Couples said. "You miss the fairway, and you'll  get some nasty lies. But there is a lot of grass on the greens, and that is  what the players like."  </P> <P> Tournament Notes  </P> <P> Mark O'Meara withdrew from the pro-am because of a stiff neck, one of his  partners said. But tournament officials said Wednesday night that O'Meara  remained in the field for today's start and that no changes have been reported  in the field since Monday. . . . The pro-am events were won by the teams of  Mark Wiebe with a 53 on the North Course and Mark Lye with a 55 on the South  Course. Lye's team included San Diego residents Richard Keyser and Charlie  Lyon. Gary Koch had the low score on the North Course with a 66. David Ogrin  and Buddy Gardner shared low on the South with 69s.  </P> <P> SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON OPEN FACTS  </P> <P> What: 38th annual PGA Tour event in San Diego, fifth year event has been  sponsored by Shearson Lehman Hutton.  </P> <P> Where: 23rd year at Torrey Pines, 7,021-yard, par-72 South Course and  6,659-yard, par-72 North Course.  </P> <P> Format: 72 holes of medal play, today through Sunday.

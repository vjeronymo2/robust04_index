			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais may fall into red CREDIT Lyonnais, the big French bank clouded by controversy following aggressive expansion, last year had its worst results for two decades, according to Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, chairman. This suggests that Credit Lyonnais, one of Europe's biggest banks and a flagship of the French public sector, may have made a loss in 1992 since in 1974 the group fell into the red with a net loss of FFr177m (Dollars 31.49m) under the impact of recession and a prolonged strike. Mr Haberer said in an interview with a French newspaper yesterday that it would not be possible to privatise Credit Lyonnais in current economic conditions. France's conservative coalition, which is the firm favourite to win this month's parliamentary elections, has confirmed that it hoped to privatise both Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris, the other large state-controlled bank. Credit Lyonnais was last year affected by the slowdown in the French economy and the legacy of the aggressive lending policy it pursued since Mr Haberer became chairman in 1988. As a result, it has been much more vulnerable than other French banks to the weakest areas of the economy, notably commercial property and small businesses. It has been hit by its involvement with a number of international corporate failures, including Mr Robert Maxwell's media group, the Olympia &amp; York property company and MGM, the troubled Hollywood film studio. Mr Haberer, who was appointed by the current socialist administration and whose position may be jeopardised by a change of government, blamed last year's poor performance on a steep increase in provisions. He said Credit Lyonnais had been badly affected by its exposure to property and business failures in France and by the difficulties of its Dutch subsidiary, which was responsible for the MGM deal. Credit Lyonnais has announced that it barely broke even in the first half of last year with net profits of just FFr119m after provisions of FFr6.3bn. Mr Haberer said it would be forced to make higher provisions for the second half.</p>

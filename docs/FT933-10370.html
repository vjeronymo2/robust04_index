			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: Roussel-Uclaf rises 38.5% to FFr470m ROUSSEL-UCLAF, one of France's largest chemicals companies, yesterday announced a strong increase in net profits for the first half of the year and forecast full-year net profits would be between 15 per cent and 20 per cent higher than the 1992 result. The company, which is 54 per cent owned by Hoechst, the German chemicals group, reported net profits of FFr470m (Dollars 81m) for the first six months of the year. This represents an increase of 38.5 per cent on the comparable period in 1992 after subtracting exceptional gains from the sale of stakes in Jouveinal and Laboratories Takeda France. Roussel-Uclaf said that the strong first-half performance reflected the impact of cost-cutting measures arising from its restructuring programme. The programme, which is scheduled to be completed in 1995, involves the closure of eight factories in Europe. The group said that productivity had been increased and that average debt during the first six months of this year was about FFr1bn less than in the first half of 1992. The increase in sales largely reflected a strong performance in its human healthcare business, which raised turnover by about 8 per cent. However, its agricultural chemicals business only increased sales by 1.2 per cent in the face of depressed demand, the company said. The slower growth in net profits expected for the full year, compared with the first six months, reflects a strong performance in the second half of 1992.</p>

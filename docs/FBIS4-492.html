			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Patrick Bulger] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 11 SAPA -- Independent Electoral  Commission [IEC] Chairman Judge Johann Kriegler has written to  the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] to warn that its  timetable to inaugurate a new government may have to change. The  judge reminded the TEC in a letter that his commission had up to  10 days to decide whether the election was "substantially free  and fair".    The TEC has decided on a series of dates to inaugurate South  Africa's new national and provincial governments.    They are May 5 for the inauguration of the nine provincial  assemblies, May 6 for the inauguration of the national assembly  and May 10 for the inauguration of the new state president.    In terms of the Electoral Act, the IEC may not pronounce the  elections free and fair within two days after the election. The  law gives the IEC another eight days in which to hear electoral  disputes.    An IEC spokesman said the IEC had until May 9 to declare the  elections free and fair. If it took this long, the TEC's  inauguration dates would have to be changed.    Although both TEC and IEC sources said the judge was merely  pointing out the legal position, he was also pointing out the  possibility of a delay that would have practical implications  for the logistics of the transition.    The period between the end of the elections and the  inauguration of a new government could see the multiparty TEC  assuming effective control of the government, a TEC source said.    "There has been concern about who is in charge after the  elections. This may mean that the TEC will have to take  control," the source said.    He pointed out that in normal democracies, the levers of  power are held by the former government until a new government  takes charge. But if the ruling national party loses by a  landslide and if there is an electoral dispute, the TEC may have  to step into the vacuum.    The TEC's management committee which comprises, among  others,  of members of government, the NP, the African National Congress  and the South African Communist Party, was due to meet for the  last time on April 25.    However, the management committee has now decided that it  will meet again on April 29, ostensibly to wrap up its affairs.    The TEC source said the question of who would control the  security forces in the period between the election and the  inauguration of a new government had been referred to legal  advisers after a dispute about the issue in the TEC-appointed  joint military command council.</p>

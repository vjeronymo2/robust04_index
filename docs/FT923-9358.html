			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Angry Mobutu closes down TV State media yesterday blanked out coverage of Zaire's national conference after delegates voted to change the country's name back to Congo, Reuter reports from Kinshasa. The blackout by radio and television was apparently ordered by President Mobutu Sese Seko who challenged Tuesday's decision to scrap the name he chose in 1971. He has demanded a referendum on the pro-democracy forum's vote by a 2-to-1 majority to revert to the country's former name, flag, motto and anthem.</p>

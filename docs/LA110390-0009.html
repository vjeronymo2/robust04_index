			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. MISSION IN THE GULF  </P> <P> I gather that Anthony Day (Commentary, Oct. 20) believes that the "new world  order" is worth sending American troops into battle for, something much loftier  than cheap oil.  </P> <P> Does that concept rank even higher than making the world safe for democracy and  fighting a war to end all wars? If you look beneath the surface, you might find  that oil was involved in those debacles as well.  </P> <P> Would this quest for peace require us to surrender our sovereignty to the moral  authority of the United Nations? If that's the plan, then American voters need  to address this issue directly.  </P> <P> Let us not be so anxious to jump from the frying pan into the fire.  </P> <P> FRANCES RUSSELL  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

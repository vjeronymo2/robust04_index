			<p>Pollution   Control   <F P=102> 40101005B Beijing CHINA DAILY in English 10 Mar 94 p 1 </F> <F P=103> 40101005B </F> <F P=104>  Beijing CHINA DAILY </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhu Baoxia: ``State Plans Massive Assault on </F> Pollution'']    [Text] The government plans to develop eight major  environmental projects in the next three years in a bid to  control industrial pollution by the turn of the century.    The schemes will be supported by international financial  organizations including the World Bank, the Asian Development  Bank and Global Environmental Facilities (GEF).    Up to $1.2 billion is needed to launch the projects which  will treat water and air pollution and dispose of solid waste,  said an official from the Foreign Economic Cooperation Office of  the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA).    The prevention of acid rain and studies on the environment  are also high on the list of the planned projects.    NEPA is due to get grants of $200 million to $300 million  from GEF to control greenhouse gases and to protect  bio-diversity.    The agency is now selecting suitable projects around the  country. Its reports will be sent to the international  organizations for further evaluation.    NEPA officials hope the eight projects will solve  environmental problems which damage people's health, like  pollution in Lake Dianchi in Yunnan Province and Lake Chaohu in  Anhui Province.    They also hope the projects will check the spread of acid  rain in the south of the country.    In recent years, China has worked more and more with  international organizations on the environment.    By the end of last year, NEPA had set up 21 Sino-foreign  environmental protection projects.    The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank had loaned the  agency $1.14 billion by 1993 and together with the GEF, they had  granted China $65.61 million for environmental protection and  research.    The funding helped environmental protections schemes in  Shanghai and Liaoning Province, research in Hangzhou Bay and  studies on urban infrastructure throughout China.    It also helped to promote local environmental protection  work  and improve NEPA's administrative capacity, said Xie Zhenhua,  the agency's director.    Cooperation between China and the international agencies has  enabled the country to obtain advanced environmental protection  facilities and improved its environmental information network.</p>

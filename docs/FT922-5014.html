			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Taxing times for multinationals in Argentina - In 1983, companies such as Shell, Firestone and BAT Industries entered the South American's government-sanctioned secondary market in tax credits. But within five years, their experience became a tale of fraud, corruption and taxation  - Argentine style TEN years ago, a group of multinational companies operating in Argentina embarked on a what then seemed a legitimate, if complicated, tax-reduction scheme. But far from saving the companies a few million dollars a year, they say the scheme became a nightmare of fraud, corruption and arbitrary government that cost them about Dollars 100m. An embittered executive now warns companies to 'think five times' before investing in Argentina. He says: 'You must be very wary and mistrustful. Everything carries risk.' That jars with Argentina's new free market image as a country where the rules of the business game are fair and predictable. The story begins in 1983, when companies such as Shell, Pirelli, BAT Industries, Perkins Engines, Texas Instruments and Firestone entered a government-sanctioned secondary market in tax credits. This involved Argentine companies that were entitled to government tax rebates on one side and companies that owed the government taxes on the other. The Argentine companies won rebates on their investments in development zones in deprived regions and on sales that originated in those regions. Rather than wait for payment from the DGI, the bureaucratic and inefficient tax department, they would 'sell' their tax credits at a discount. The 'buyer' - invariably a multinational - could then reduce its tax bill by 'paying' part of its tax bill with tax credits to the DGI at their full face value. One of the biggest players in the tax credit market was Koner-Salgado, an Argentine conglomerate. It sold over Dollars 100m-worth of credits over a six-year period. But, in 1988, the DGI suddenly declared Koner-Salgado's credits worthless after investigators said the company faked investments to generate tax credits. The DGI then ordered Koner-Salgado's clients to pay back all the taxes they had 'paid' with its allegedly fraudulent credits. But the multinationals point to the fact that the DGI investigation took place in 1985, three years earlier. They say DGI officials suppressed the report, failed to warn buyers of Koner-Salgado credits, and continued accepting the credits until the report was leaked in 1988. At first the companies refused to pay up, arguing they were being made to pay for a crime committed by others. They alleged that the DGI had acted in bad faith. The case reached the Supreme Court over a year ago. But it said that before it could rule on the case, the plaintiffs first had to comply with the DGI's tax demand of hundreds of millions of dollars. They could then try to recover the money by suing the DGI. A tax lawyer explained that the DGI's apparently arbitrary claim was based on legislation under which it could paradoxically rule a company was evading taxes even if it acted legally. This is because transactions are not assessed for tax on their legal 'appearance' but on their underlying 'real' purpose. The lawyer says: 'The government is never wrong. It is like Big Brother. Argentina is a perverse country where something may be permitted one day and the next day it has become a crime.' Naturally, the government's view is rather different. The present head of the DGI is Mr Carlos Tacchi, a tax lawyer before entering government last year. He holds up the Koner-Salgado affair as an example of his offensive against tax evasion, in which he does not discriminate between evaders, be they large or small. Although Mr Tacchi refused to be interviewed for this article, he has claimed companies knew the credits were false all along. He says that, like all other tax specialists - including the multinationals' advisers - he was offered commissions to push the deep-discounted credits. Mr Tacchi, who is as honest as he is ferociously efficient at collecting taxes, implies that at best, companies were robbed by corrupt employees and advisers. At worst, they actively dodged taxes. Rather than begin long, expensive litigation in a judicial system not known for its independence or impartiality, the companies decided to negotiate. In the end, all but two accepted a compromise, their liability was reduced, and they were given five years to pay. But Firestone and BAT Industries' affiliate Nobleza-Piccardo decided to fight. Their resistance is understandable: Firestone was originally asked for Dollars 180m and Nobleza Dollars 130m. Lobbying by the companies and the UK and US embassies achieved little. Last October, a court froze Firestone's assets as a first step to its liquidation. Firestone swiftly capitulated, followed by Nobleza. Mr Tacchi offered them the same deal as the other multinationals. Nobleza, which had bought Dollars 31m-worth of credits, was charged an extra Dollars 6.6m. It has begun paying the full Dollars 37.6m in 60 monthly instalments, with the first nine due all at once. That is a heavy blow for a company with an operating loss of Dollars 11.2m in the first nine months of 1991. None of the companies considers payment as a recognition of guilt. Some are demanding arbitration by an independent tribunal. But even if they do win, the virtually bankrupt government will pay not with cash but with 16-year bonds. Already, a secondary bond market is beginning to emerge. Suspects at the DGI and Koner Salgado have yet to go on trial. But the wheels of Argentina's justice have always ground slowly for the accused. Massive financial fraud that cost the central bank Dollars 15.8bn during the 1980s has gone unpunished because so few of the suspects were ever brought to trial.</p>

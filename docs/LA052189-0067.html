			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIFE IN L.A.  </P> <P> Regarding the cover for "The Quality of L.A. Life": I know the spot well where  Al Seib took his magnificent picture. It used to be, "On a good day you can see  Catalina." Today it's, "On a good day you can just barely make out the top of  City Hall!" Sad isn't the word for it.  </P> <P> FRED BENDER  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Recruitment: Why established theory is now suspect - Teenager's remarkable abilities raise possibility that the exception is the same as the rule IF readers get a spare minute for reflection in the next few days, the Jobs column would appreciate your thoughts on a perplexing question. After all, there have been several times these past two decades when you have solved a problem that baffled the experts in the field. An example was your coup in decoding the medieval spelling of a town's name, which had defeated the French historian Professor Bartolome Bennassar. Today's challenge surely ought to be easier because it calls for no comparably specialised knowledge. Indeed, although the problem is central to the cultural as well as monetary wealth of nations, its nub lies in something you all achieve daily in your work. The question is: how do people do skilled things? True, despite its apparent simplicity, it is a question many august thinkers have examined without finding a cogent answer. But that may be because they are blinkered by their own theoretical presuppositions, and so looking for it in the wrong place - or so I'm beginning to suspect, at least. What awakened the suspicion was a report in the white Times newspaper last Monday on an autistic 19-year-old. Since only a few of you are likely to have seen the report, I'd better outline the case by adding that his name is Stephen Wiltshire, and in his largely speechless lifetime he has rarely shown an interest in the world around him, and still less any ability for most of the things normally studied in schools. While specially trained teachers eventually taught him to read and write, he never did either unless his tutors sat prompting him by his side. Then one day he surprised them by starting to portray them in wickedly observant cartoons. Nor did his talent for drawing stop there, for it turned out that after little more than a glance at complex architectural plans, he could go away and reproduce them line for line. That alone failed to strike the egg-head professions as world-shaking because theory has long had a name for people with some singular capacity like his. The name is idiot savants, defined as 'people of subnormal intelligence who nonetheless show remarkable talent in a restricted field such as memorising or rapid calculation.' But the youngster has now chipped a crack in the egg-heads by doing something which they evidently cannot account for. He has revealed another impressive talent. After just listening to a piece of music, he can identify the sequence of chords of which it is composed - and since that ability is in an entirely different field from his talent for drawing, the experts do not know how to explain it. What I would like to know, on the other hand, is whether readers whose skills are more practical than theoretical likewise find the phenomenon inexplicable. If so, I beg to differ. Although it clashes with present theory, it strikes me as readily comprehensible. The prime reason is that, in themselves, the young man's talents are less than extraordinary let alone unique. Now, that is not to belittle him. As he has two of them to count on, his high-level skills certainly outnumber mine. OK, I perhaps don't yet quite fall under Lyndon Johnson's lampooning description of Gerald Ford as being unable 'to fart and chew gum at the same time'. But there is only one thing I can claim to do at a level anywhere near remarkable - or I hope so at any rate - and that's communicating in written English. Even so, while most of us can't do the things Stephen Wiltshire does, an appreciable minority of people can. Besides, the abilities he exercises in doing them are no more extraordinary than those required by numerous practical activities, managing a workforce being a case in point. Hence the stumbling block preventing the experts from explaining his achievements would seem to lie in the theory, and especially in the first part of the definition of an idiot savant - the bit that assumes him to be 'of subnormal intelligence'. And the justification for including him in the said sad category is surely that he has not shown the sort of capacity which established theory deems to be indicative of at least normal intelligence, including an ability to learn the things which customarily make up the school curriculum. Indeed, so strong is the grip of the theory that if he had shown the academic type of ability, it is unlikely that the experts would think anything even needed to be explained. They would simply look on the boy as much like themselves at his age: as a person of more than adequate general intelligence, with one or two particularly pronounced skills. Moreover, most other people who have succeeded in conventional education would probably take the same view without pause for thought. But the powerful hold of the theory doesn't make it right. On the contrary, the apparent fact that it fails to explain young Stephen's skills is prima facie evidence that the theory is wrong. Nor is it the only reason for supposing that, far from being an exceptional case, he may do what he does in essentially the same way as such things are done by folk who succeeded in education. For, if readers reflect on how you do your own work, I'd guess that most of you will be inclined to agree that your decisive abilities, even though dependent on use of the mind, are often of an intuitive kind rather than of the sort demanded by academic curricula. If you don't, then I am keen to hear of it. But I hope that besides telling me I'm daft, you'll spell out your grounds for saying so in as much detail as you have time for. Should it turn out that my ideas on the matter are wrong, I'll of course admit as much as soon as practicable. In the meantime, however, I'm sticking to my hypothesis that it is mistaken to believe that the capacity to succeed in scholarly exams is indispensable to highly intelligent action, including the making of active judgments as well as direct operations on the outside world such as motivating other people. And what I see as the main flaw in that belief is the assumption, which can be traced back at least 350 years to the philosopher Rene Descartes, that the way people do mentally skilled things is necessarily by first planning out intellectually how they are going to do them, then putting the plan in their skull into effect as if they were following a detailed blueprint. No doubt there are some kinds of expert work which can be done by that two-step method. But as I reported 10 weeks ago, my talks over the years with hundreds of highly skilled people - including theoretical researchers - suggest that the large majority operate differently. With few exceptions, they rejected the idea that they first thought and then acted in distinguishable stages. Their most decisive thinking was somehow embedded in the doing, and could not be separated from it. Accordingly, I feel it is high time the experts scrapped their theoretical presupposition that the talents of people like Stephen Wiltshire are freak deviations from the normal rule governing human expertise. It would be better to concentrate on highly skilled operators who are deemed normal, and identify how they actually do their work with a view to discovering whether or not the established theory is a counter-productive, not to mention enormously expensive, distortion of reality.</p>

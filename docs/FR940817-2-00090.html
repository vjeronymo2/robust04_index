			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The recently finalized rule requires that manufacturers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new fuel and fuel additive products (i.e., fuel and fuel additive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products not registered by their specific manufacturers as of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of promulgation and not fitting the registrable criteria)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit all testing requirements prior to registration, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any alternative Tier 2 tests or Tier 3 tests prescribed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency. As discussed above, under the fuel and fuel additive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing rule, MMT is designated as ``new'' for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration for use in unleaded gasoline. Accordingly, any data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to register MMT for use in unleaded gasoline must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted prior to registration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, Tier 1 requires manufacturers of designated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuels or fuel additives (or groups of manufacturers pursuant to &sect; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 79.56) to supply to the Administrator: (1) the identity and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration of certain emission products of such fuel and fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additives, (2) an analysis of potential emissions exposures, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) any available information regarding the health and welfare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of the whole and specified emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the General Provision of the emission characterization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of Tier 1, it is stated in &sect;79.52(b)(1)(ii) that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the emissions shall be generated three times (on three different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days) without a functional aftertreatment device and, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable, three times (on three different days) with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functional aftertreatment device, and each such time shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyzed according to the remaining provisions in this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b). Measurement of background emissions, under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;79.52(b)(1)(iii), states that it is required that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ambient/dilution air be analyzed for levels of background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical species present at the time of emission sampling (for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both combustion and evaporative emissions) and that background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical species profiles be reported with emissions speciation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data. Ethyl has yet to provide the Agency with data on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterization of emissions resulting from the use of MMT in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unleaded gasoline which meets the requirements of Tier 1 under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these subsections. Thus, to EPA's knowledge, data has not yet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been collected which would fully satisfy Tier 1 requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under &sect;79.52(b)(1) (ii) and (iii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standard Tier 2 testing includes certain specific types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short-term biological testing to screen for specific health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects endpoints, involving the exposure of laboratory animals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the whole emissions of the fuel additive (when added to a base  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel). Where appropriate, the Agency may impose an alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tier 2 test in lieu of a standard Tier 2 test or prescribe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional Tier 2 testing in addition to the standard Tier 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's Office of Research and Development has prepared a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report that specifically identifies research which would allow a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more accurate evaluation of the risk involved in utilizing MMT in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unleaded gasoline. <FOOTCITE>78</FOOTCITE>  Some of the research described in the ORD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report is intended to address toxicologic endpoints which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also addressed by standard Tier 2 tests, <FOOTCITE>79</FOOTCITE>  while other research  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in the report is intended to address other endpoints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA presently has an adequate basis to conclude that there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public health concerns associated with the potential use of MMT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in unleaded gasoline, and anticipates that research addressing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each of the areas identified in the ORD report will be necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to support registration of MMT for use in unleaded gasoline. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not necessary, and would be inefficient, to wait for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completion and submission of all of the standard Tier 2 tests in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to identify the requisite test data, and use of alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tier 2 procedures is therefore appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 78 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ORD originally reviewed the information needed to improve the risk characterization in: Preuss, P.W.

Washington, DC: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development; December 16, 1991. For further information the reader is referred to Air Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;26, II&hyph;A&hyph;16. ORD has reevaluated these information needs in light of new information. See Memo from Peter W. Preuss to Richard Wilson dated July 13, 1994, Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;26, II&hyph;A&hyph;18. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 79 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, it is clear that the standard Tier 2 neurotoxicity will not address adequately the potential neurotoxicity of inhaled manganese to humans. Although the precise mechanisms of such neurotoxicity are not fully understood, it has been shown that manganese toxicity may be associated with degeneration of certain tissues in the brain. These brain tissues include the substantia nigra which is found only in primates and not in lower mammals. Laboratory rodents typically employed in the standard Tier 2 neurotoxcity test do not physically possess this target for manganese toxicity in the brain. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If Ethyl or any other party seeks to register MMT for use in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unleaded gasoline, it will need to submit the required test data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in addition to obtaining the required waiver. In that case, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expects to identify specific alternative Tier 2 tests which must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be performed prior to registration. <FOOTCITE>80</FOOTCITE>  In the case of endpoints  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed by the ORD report, that report will serve as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> starting point for EPA in identifying appropriate alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tier 2 tests. In each instance where EPA does not adopt any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative Tier 2 requirement for an endpoint which is addressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by standard Tier 2 tests, standard information or testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements will continue to apply. The process for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishment of alternative Tier 2 testing requirements for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product includes specific procedures for notification of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer and an opportunity for comment, and is set forth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 C.F.R. 79.58(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 80 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> If there is any reason why Ethyl would prefer to complete the standard set of Tier 2 tests and submit such tests prior to imposition of further data requirements, EPA is willing in the alternative to impose additional testing requirements under Tier 3 procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Submission of any data which is required by the registration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations prior to registration of MMT for use in unleaded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline is not itself a specific legal prerequisite to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> granting of a waiver under section 211(f)(4). However, in these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances, since the Agency is declining to grant the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested waiver based on potential health effects, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considers it reasonable to require that Ethyl submit the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health effects and exposure test data which will be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to registration of MMT for unleaded gasoline before it will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider taking favorable action on another waiver application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the health effects testing rule indicates, EPA believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it should exercise particular caution in registering new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel or fuel additive products that are significantly different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from, or have a usage pattern which is significantly different in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scope or character from, currently registered fuel or fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive products. EPA also believes that the same cautious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach is appropriate in evaluating waiver applications under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 211(f)(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE: PURSUING RESEARCH ON A LIMITED BUDGET  </P> <P> Question: There are dozens of genealogical books I would like to see. However,  buying them all would bankrupt me. What tips do you have for those of us on  limited budgets?  </P> <P> Answer: As in any hobby, our wish lists are usually larger than our funds.  Determine which books are available in your area. Comb public and college  libraries, historical societies, and be sure to ascertain if the book has been  microfilmed by the LDS (Mormon) Family History Library in Salt Lake City and  thus is available on loan for about $3.  </P> <P> The American Family Records Assn. Genealogy Circulating Collection is  accessible -- through your local librarian -- for book requests; fill out an  ALA Interlibrary Loan Request Form and send to Interlibrary Loan Dept.,  Mid-Continent Public Library, Independence, Mo.  </P> <P> A new catalogue of this expanding collection is available (free) from Martha L.  Meyers, Genealogy Reference Librarian, Mid-Continent Public Library, 15616 E.  24 Highway, Independence, Mo. 64050. Many titles are especially popular and you  may have to wait several months to receive such books -- but the price is  right.  </P> <P> Donations of new and used genealogical books are gratefully accepted for this  circulating collection.  </P> <P> If you are a member of the National Genealogical Society and/or New England  Historic Genealogical Society, you can borrow books via mail at minimum  expense.  </P> <P> Q: I finally located a source for a Harris Genealogy (Connecticut 1640-1878).  However, it costs $66. This book is only 239 pages. Why does it cost so much?  </P> <P> A: This particular genealogy is a reprint of an 1878 edition, and the  production costs of reprinting genealogies is expensive because of the limited  market.  </P> <P> The fewer number of books printed, the higher the individual book price. Unless  you know this is your line, the best way to determine its value to you is to  try and find a copy of it -- most likely sources would be the Library of  Congress, New England Historic Genealogical Society's library and major public  libraries with extensive genealogical collections, such as New York City, Los  Angeles, Clayton (Houston) and Family History Library in Salt Lake City.  </P> <P> Q: I am trying to obtain a copy of a local history book about a West Virginia  county which has been out of print for years. What determines which books are  reprinted and when?  </P> <P> A: Demand. If the original publisher of the book is still in business, contact  it regarding plans for re-printing.  </P> <P> If the original publisher no longer exists, contact major genealogical  publishers and suggest it be reprinted. Clearfield Company, 200 E. Eager St.,  Baltimore, Md. 21202, specializes in discount reprints and remainders in the  genealogy field.  </P> <P> It buys rights to older books and works with other publishers.  </P></p>

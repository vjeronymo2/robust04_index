			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Launch of New FT Indices: Economy-related performance calculated from December 31 1985  - shows clearly the impact of investment decisions. In the three years from 1986 to 1988, second-tier British companies, those in the FT-SE Mid 250, significantly outperformed their larger colleagues in the FT-SE 100. Any investment manager who had concluded from these figures that medium-sized companies possessed a magic all their own would have been sadly disappointed, however. From 1989 to 1991, the trend was reversed the FT-SE Mid 250 doing much worse than the FT-SE 100. In 1989, the year in which this effect was most marked, there was a ten percentage points difference between the performance of a portfolio invested solely in mid-sized companies and one invested in the top 100. In the first six months of 1992, the pendulum has swung back again. Size may be one cause of this switchback. Medium-sized companies have proved less capable of withstanding recessionary pressures than larger, more strongly capitalised rivals. A more important factor, however, is likely to have been the much greater reliance by the FT-SE Mid 250 stocks on the UK economy, where the recession has been particularly severe by international standards. Many stocks in the FT-SE 100 obtain the great bulk of their revenues abroad, the businesses in the second tier are focused closer to home.</p>

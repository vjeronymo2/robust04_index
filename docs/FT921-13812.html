			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Travel: We counted them all out . . . NOBODY was decapitated, but it was a close shave. On deck on the Nile Rhapsody was a valuable cargo - 45 Weekend FT readers on a pre-Christmas exploration of Egypt. The boat raced towards a bridge over the Nile. With just sixinches to spare between the bridge girders and the boat's railing, we shot through - the passengers lying flat on deck. Boat manager Hany Selim later explained this triumph of the helmsman. 'He does it all by eye, from where the watermark is on the bridge piers. If it is all right to go, he has to keep up speed as the Nile does rise and fall a little. If he slows down, there's a danger the water will suddenly push the boat up and we hit the bridge.' The immortal Nile held us captive as firmly as any of the conquered princes in the days of the pharoahs, who loved to show their prisoners on monuments with a noose round their necks, hands tied behind their backs and hieroglyphs to identify them - just like mug shots. Our hieroglyphs would have indicated that we were from the far reaches of the FT's empire: readers of ten nationalities living between California and Norway. Most were businessmen and their wives, several recently retired. We also had five engineers, two people in financial services, a leading US antiquarian book dealer and a man from the Foreign Office delighted to be out of reach of Whitehall. Children waved from the banks and fishermen cast their nets. Minarets and coptic churches fell behind as the boat progressed through a dreamworld of river life. We began to see how the Nile means everything to Egypt. It is the main highway, uniting a long ribbon of a country where the desert always threatenes to absorb the green land hugging the river. The start in Cairo was hectic: three days of pyramids, coptic churches, mosques, the museum, the bazaar and traffic jams. Once on the boat, the group began to gell and the river took hold. When the evening mist came down or the helmsman thought it time to stop, he pulled into the bank and sent a man ashore with two large iron mooring-spikes and a sledgehammer. Often we bumped the bottom. I had not realised that the Nile is so shallow, presaging problems ahead. The first stops were a special treat, as we had the sites to ourselves. Helmy el Assar, our guide and protector, who taught the past history and present aspirations of Egypt with quiet passion, led us to lively pictures of acrobats, war and wine-making. Here Howard Carter, aged 17, started his career in archeology in November 1891, copying the paintings. By 10am we were back on board. Then it was time to laze and look at the river, and perhaps hear a lecture, until an afternoon visit to a catacomb of mummified ibises. Bridge parties formed; readers found they had been to the same school; the lecturer ploughed through Egyptian history. On the excursions Mohamet, our tour manager, rounded up strays with the cry: 'FT] FT]', and we grew used to getting up early for the best view of the sites and to let the boat do as much as possible by daylight. At Amarna, green trailers pulled by tractors waited to take us across the desert plain that was briefly Egypt's capital city 3,300 years ago but is now desolated to see tombs with pictures of the heretic king, Akhenaten, and his wife, Nefertiti. Policemen with rifles rode shotgun at the rear of the wagons. The Nile struck at the lock below Luxor. There was not enough water to get through, even if other boats came up behind, sterns to our stern, to race their propellers and whip up a wash to lift us over the bar. We left the boats to it and went to see the fabulous temple of Seti I at Abydos, its fine relief carvings illuminated by the blessing of cheap electricity from the high dam. Here was the raciest scene in Egyptian art, which on the whole is pure as driven sand - the conception of Horuf, which our guide told us to see for ourselves. It made him 'shy and blushy.' Next day we had to change boats, but the temples of Dendera, Luxor and Karnak helped dispel the blues. So to Aswan, a town with terrific shopping and a good restaurant (el Maasri) in the bazaar, and then by air to Abu Simbel. These 13th century BC rock-cut temples of Ramesses II are staggering, with colossal statues of the pharoah. They would have terrified any African approaching Egypt - as they were meant to do at this frontier site. He would have had no doubt of the might and ability to mobilise labour of the world's first superpower. Forty-five Weekend FT readers went out, and 45 returned. Who could ask for more?

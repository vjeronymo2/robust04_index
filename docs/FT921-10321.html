			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Car dealers The market's verdict on the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the motor trade was that while it could have been a lot worse, there is no great rush to buy the sector. Car dealers may have escaped a radical shake-up of the sort inflicted on the brewing industry. But there is no escaping the recession, hence the modest reaction in the distributors' shares. Inchcape was an exception, but that is probably accounted for as much by its recent acquisition of Tozer Kemsley &amp; Millbourn as by the proposed relaxation of import restrictions on Japanese cars. Its Toyota franchise means it should benefit more than most, if only because it can concentrate on importing the most lucrative models while Toyota will produce its cheaper cars in the UK. More generally, the prospect of multiple-franchise dealerships remains sufficiently distant for there to be little reason to mark up share prices now. In the medium term, dealers are as vulnerable as ever to manufacturers' tendency to grab back franchises once they become seriously profitable.</p>

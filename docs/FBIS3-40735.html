			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Amman: "Executive Committee Not </F> Acting to Limit 'Arafat's Individual Control"]    [Text] A member of the Palestinian Democratic Reform  Committee, headed by Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, has declared that  the committee achieved no specific or palpable results in its  meetings with the Executive Committee and President 'Arafat in  Tunis last week. The only exception was a national dialogue  committee; 'Abd-al-Shafi was entrusted with forming a National  Dialogue Committee, and with following up on this task. The  Executive Committee confirmed that the constitutional document  announced had not yet been enacted by the committee. It had been  submitted for popular discussion and for specialized parties to  discuss it and to propose any amendments and submit them to the  Executive Committee. As to the other proposals, a member of the  Reform Committee, who refused to identify himself, said that its  acceptance in principle was, in actual fact, merely a polite  rejection, or an effort to escape and be elusive.    The advisory committee, proposed by what is called the  Planning Council of the National Council, an ineffective council  that has not played any role since it was founded in the second  session of the National Council more than 20 years ago, and the  Manpower Development Department were gutted of their purpose and  abridged by modernizing the Palestinian Data Bank, in place for  more than 12 years. As regards elections, the general impression  we came away with is that the topic of elections was left open  to many different possibilities, as the realization of the  importance and necessity of holding them does not rule out the  possibilities of avoiding them or emptying them (were they to be  held) of their meaning.    A member of the Reform Committee added, "The positions and  participation of our fellow members of the Executive Committee  who took part in the meetings were not helpful to the delegation  in its task. They have ranged from utter silence and aloofness  to our requests, coming up with pretexts and excuses, to  support, confirming our preliminary impression that Brother  'Arafat is still the one who makes the decisions, and that the  other members of the Executive Committee make no effort to limit  this individual control. They are resigned to this fact."  Despite this, the Reform Committee member says that the results  the committee achieved on its own constitute a step forward,  albeit a small one, and that the process must go on, in various  forms, building on this step, in order to achieve decisive  reforms, dealing not only with the existing institutions of the  PLO, but with the structure, institutions, and departments of  the national authority. This way, it will be democratic and  attract our people's many qualified cadres to join. He added  that the memorandum as a format and framework of the action had  achieved its ends, but the democratic demands it contained still  stood, and that action had to be pursued to achieve them and to  turn them into solid proposals. Reform, in its old concept, and  the obselete action linked to it, are not in force. What needs  to be done is for demands to be brought forward for the building  of the new national sovereignty with its various agencies,  departments, and institutions. The Reform Committee delegation,  which visited Tunis, may have seven members: Dr. Haydar  'Abd-al-Shafi, Ibrahim Abu-Ayyash, Dr. Taysir 'Aruri, Tawfiq  Abu-Bakr, Nabil 'Amru, Dr. 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab, and Ghazi  al-Khalili. Zuhayrah Kamal, representative of the women's  component in the territories, will be associated with the  delegation.    The meetings with the Executive Committee chaired by 'Arafat  yielded the following provisions:    1. To form an advisory committee for the Executive  Committee,  with a number of experienced, qualified, and credible persons,  and of varied fields of expertise, which will study the issues  and topics submitted to the Executive Committee, to advise and  consult on them before they are decided.    2. To form two advisory committees, one each in the West  Bank  and Gaza Strip, made up of capable and credible persons who  represent the political and social fabric of our people in the  territories, in such a way that each of these two committees  might be a national authority in local issues of the political  leadership (the Executive Committee), submitting to it advice  and consultation in domestic issues in all that relates to the  building of the institutions of the national authority, its  attendant departments, etc.    3. To create a department to deal with development and the  evolution of manpower, as one of the departments of the PLO.  This office would be concerned with updating the Palestinian  data bank to collect and compile Palestinian resources both in  the diaspora and in the country, to prepare precise information  about them: their qualifications, fields of expertise, and  practical capabilities, to be at the dispoal of of the Executive  Committee and its institutions as needed. It will also prepare  the program and practical plans for training and retraining. It  will train the cadres of the Palestinian revolution and the  workers who are proposed for work in the institutions of the  national authority and its various departments.    4. To improve our negotiating mechanism as a political  command and negotiating committees, to move away from  improvisation in defining policies and selecting negotiating  committee members, relying on defined authority to monitor the  negotiating delegations in receiving information from them or  relaying instructions to them, putting an end to the acquisition  of multiple communications and contacts with the negotiating  delegations, depending on standards of capability, experience,  and specialization in selecting members of the negotiating  committees.    5. To hold elections for the legislative council proposed  for  the national authority on its appointed date this coming July,  in accordance with democratic and contemporary election law.  These elections should not be postponed or avoided, regardless  of excuses, pretexts, or justifications.    In addition, to submit the constitutional document prepared  by the Legal Committee to the people for discussion, for their  comments and amendments, to review it in that light, so that it  may be a democratic constitutional document, conforming to the  democratic principles contained in the declaration of  independence, such as: the establishment of democracy as our  method, respect for opinions and opposing opinions, political  pluralism, the rights of women, etc.    6. To form a National Dialogue Committee made up of  independent figures who enjoy the confidence and respect of all  levels of our people. This committee would conduct an expanded  national dialogue, including not only what are called opposition  factions, but the diverse factions and groups of our people at  home and abroad, with the aim of achieving a state of national  harmony founded on a commitment to democratic dialogue in  managing domestic relations on the Palestinian scene; respect  for political pluralism and for all shades of opinion; and  coordinating national efforts to build the Palestinian national  entity on the basis of commitment to the establishment of an  independent Palestinian state.</p>

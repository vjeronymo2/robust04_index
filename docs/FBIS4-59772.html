			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Lothar </F> Ruehl; place and date not given: "`The EU Discriminates Against  Israel, We Cannot Tolerate That'"]    [Text] [Ruehl] You concluded the Cairo interim agreement  on partial Palestinian autonomy in Jericho and Gaza with PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat under difficult conditions. Indeed, the  signing seemed to be in doubt for a moment. Does that mean that  there are still differences?    [Rabin] When we signed the 1993 Washington declaration, we  knew that we were taking on a great many difficulties. However,  we realized that we had to take risks to achieve our goal: the  end of 100 years of conflict between the Jewish and Arab  populations of Palestine, between Israel and the Palestinians.  Why? Because we are not concluding peace with another country,  but with a population without a state. If we sign a peace  treaty with an Arab neighbor, then we what we are concluding is  a treaty based on a particular border, and we then go on to  decide how that peace is to be implemented along the clear  dividing line between us and our neighbors. That means: On our  side of the peaceful border, we bear the responsibility, on the  other side, the other country -- each side bears a  responsibility toward the other.    [Ruehl] As in the case of Sinai and Egypt?    [Rabin] Yes, as in the case of Egypt. It was not possible  to achieve a permanent solution with the Palestinians in one  move. The reality of this was accepted at the Madrid  international conference as the basis for Israel's participation  in negotiations with the neighboring countries that are in a  state of war with us: Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. This means  that the process consists of two phases: The first phase  centers on the interim agreement on an internal settlement for  the Palestinian people to occur over a transitional period and  only after that, once the reality on the ground has changed,  will we enter phase two, in which we will negotiate a solution.  There is a web of ties linking both populations to each other.  The situation in Gaza is much simpler, but is still complicated  enough. The Israeli settlements there will remain.    [Ruehl] How many settlers are involved?    [Rabin] About 5,000 people, but their settlements are in the  middle of territory that will come under Palestinian  administration. These settlements are extra-territorial with  regard to the jurisdiction of Palestinian local autonomy. There  are a certain number of roads linking these settlements to  Israel, and we will also have to ensure the security of those  routes. Under these circumstances, organizing a peaceful  coexistence between two populations who live intermingled with  each in a confined area is a difficult task. That is why the  agreement must be detailed enough to allow the Palestinians to  run their affairs on the one hand while, at the same time,  Israel can remain responsible for the Jewish settlements and for  the security, including external security, of all the Israelis.  I was in favor of the interim agreement settling as much as  possible.    [Ruehl] But did that involve risks?    [Rabin] It would have been riskier to leave certain points  unclarified and then to argue about them. It will also be  difficult enough to cooperate on changing reality in the spirit  of peaceful coexistence, but we will try. That is the acid test  for the value of the agreement with the PLO. However, one must  also take account of the fact that it was possible to conclude  the negotiations with an accord, that is, the interim agreement,  only one month after the Hebron tragedy. There was only a short  delay. Even if one compares the date with the one that was set  by the Washington declaration for the implementation of  Gaza-Jericho autonomy, 13 April 1994, I see no reason why the  implementation cannot be accomplished by the end of May.    [Ruehl] However, has the delay not placed a burden on the  psychological situation surrounding the implementation of the  autonomy agreement?    [Rabin] All the opponents of the agreement and, in addition  to that, of peace between Israel and the Arabs have sought to  use the delays to torpedo the peace process. It can, however,  be seen that the detailed result facilitated rapid  implementation and that is why the actual implementation of the  agreement could overlap with the last stage of the negotiations.  I assume that we now need no more than three to four weeks, if  the Palestinians are ready to exercise policing duties shortly.    [Ruehl] But that does not mean that all the dangers have  been eliminated.    [Rabin] On the Palestinian side, the strongest opposition to  the treaty and peaceful coexistence with Israel primarily comes  from extremist Islamic fundamentalists. They represent a great  risk. Islamic terrorist groups murder Israelis not just to fight  Israel, but also to try to bring about the collapse of the peace  process. I do not dispute the fact that terrorist attacks in  Israel reduce the level of support for the treaty. People in  Israel have been writing letters of this kind to me: "I was in  favor of a political solution of the kind that you have been  pursuing, but what purpose is served by a agreement with the PLO  if it fails to provide us with more security than before?" Of  course, the Palestinian extremists know that, and that is why I  say that the fulfillment of these security hopes on the part of  the Israelis combined with the fulfillment of the Palestinians  hopes regarding the running of their own affairs will determine  whether or not the Gaza-Jericho agreement will create prospects  for a political solution to peaceful coexistence. We said to  our people that terrorism will be reduced, and the PLO has told  the Palestinians that autonomy will result in effective self-  administration, which will bring social and economic  development. If these two goals are not achieved, then we will  have a problem.    [Ruehl] When you talk about security for Israel, what do  you mean by that?    [Rabin] For Israel, it means the personal security of its  citizens. That is because the Palestinians do not pose a threat  to Israel's existence.    [Ruehl] It is being said in Israel that Rabin's government  has neglected its national security, because it has said that it  is prepared to negotiate the return of Arab refugees from the  1967 war. Hundreds of thousands of Arabs would return and  "flood" Israel. Is there not an indirect threat of this kind?    [Rabin] Of course not. If you read the Cairo agreement, you  will see that it does not contain anything about refugees that  was not already mentioned in the Camp David accord, which former  Likud chairman Begin agreed with Egypt, namely, a discussion  about the refugee problem, irrespective of what territories are  the subject of an autonomy agreement. The bulk of the refugee  problem concerns those people who fled from their homes in  1948/49, from territories that have belonged to Israel since  that time. We will then raise the issue of Jewish refugees from  Arab states. The Washington declaration states that refugee  issues will be raised in later negotiations on a definitive  political solution. Another question is that of the 1967  "displaced persons," that is, those Palestinians in what was  formerly west Jordanian territory who fled during the Six Day  War. A committee composed of the four parties concerned --  Jordan, Egypt, Israel, and the PLO -- will start discussing  these issues one month after the signing of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement. We have not agreed on any figures or numbers in this  respect. We have not assumed any obligations.    [Ruehl] Is this related to the presence of about 120,000  Israeli settlers in territories that have been occupied since  1967, to the question of land that belonged to Arabs until then?    [Rabin] The Washington declaration states that the settlers  will remain during the interim period and that this issue will  not be raised until negotiations take place on a permanent  overall solution. That is in line with the 1978 Camp David  accord. Nothing has changed in this respect. The refugee  question, the question of the settlers, the border question, and  the question of the status of Jerusalem are being kept for the  last set of negotiations, which will also deal with the  principles for respecting religious freedom and free access to  all the holy sites for the various religions in Jerusalem.    [Ruehl] Since 1967, Israeli settlement policy has led to the  appearance of large housing complexes where settlers are  concentrated. Do these new settlements belong to the city of  Jerusalem?    [Rabin] Until now, no Israeli Government has annexed  territory under Israeli control and added it to the territory of  the city of Jerusalem as set out in the 1967 law on the unity of  the capital of Israel. The situation has not changed since the  July 1967 law, which placed Jerusalem under the sovereignty of  the Israeli state. Until the outcome of future negotiations on a  permanent political solution, the remaining territory on the  Jordanian West Bank, which was occupied during the 1967 war with  Jordan will remain under Israeli military rule in accordance  with international law. Until now, we have only concluded a  treaty on internal Palestinian autonomy in the two areas of  Jericho and Gaza. Jerusalem belongs to Israel, and it is and  will remain the capital of Israel.    [Ruehl] Has the PLO the ability to effectively exercise  political and administrative responsibility for the two areas  and to make a success of autonomy?    [Rabin] The PLO must begin by gaining experience in  administration. It will have an opportunity to do so in Gaza  and Jericho, because all the wishes and demands of the  Palestinian population in those areas will be directed to it.  This involves political practice and the local administration,  which has remained in Arab hands since 1967. In Gaza, we make a  distinction between Israeli military rule, which will now come  to an end, and civilian administration under military rule. The  civilian administration is essentially Palestinian: Of the  6,000 employees, only 160 are Israelis. All heads of  administrative agencies are Palestinians. All together, Israel  employs 24,000 in the public service, and 18,000 in  transportation and public utilities, and other facilities. Each  month, $10 million is paid out of the Israeli state budget for  salaries and wages. I put the following question to 'Arafat in  Cairo: "What is going to happen to this expenditure? Who is  going to pay when we leave?"    [Ruehl] What was the PLO chairman's answer to that?    [Rabin] He is relying on international donors, who have  promised support for the development of autonomy. The  Washington conference of prospective donors has envisaged a sum  of about $2.2 billion spread over five years. The PLO will now  have to assume responsibility for the 750,000 Palestinians in  Gaza and the 20,000 or so in Jericho, and it will have to prove  to the population that it can discharge its responsibility.    That is the criterion for measuring the success of autonomy.  This means preventing terrorist attacks above all. The PLO must  see to it that these two regions do not serve as springboards  for terrorist attacks against Israel or against Israelis living  in these areas.    [Ruehl] That is the key issue in the debate in Israel on  the autonomy agreement and the withdrawal of Israeli troops, as  well as in discussion of the protection of settlements in Gaza  and the security of Israel itself.    [Rabin] There are risks, and there is a risk for the PLO in  this respect, too. In future, the PLO must see to security in  its own areas. Without security, there will be no further  positive developments, including economic ones. It is in the  vital interest of the Palestinians to foster security, just as  it lies in Israel's interests for the Palestinian population to  make economic progress and see the light at the end of the  tunnel. That is the only way in which a lasting solution can be  achieved. That is why we are interested in a strong PLO police  force, financial support for autonomy, as well as investment by  the international community in those areas.    [Ruehl] Will you reopen the border crossing-points for  Palestinian workers and businessmen?    [Rabin] Yes, as long as they are not used to bring in  terrorists. During the negotiations on the border, the security  question must be solved in a way that is in line with Israeli  security interests. Between 25 and 33 percent of GDP in Gaza  and the West Bank, which have been administered by Israel since  1967, comes from Palestinians who work in Israel. This  population has to cooperate with Israel when the borders are  open in order to improve its standard of living.    [Ruehl] What kind of international cooperation can provide a  framework for that?    [Rabin] We have to distinguish between several different  aspects: financial support for the Palestinians, that is, aid  totalling $2.2 billion; regional cooperation; and economic  relations with Israel. Trade between the European Union [EU]  and Israel was the main subject of the talks that I have held in  five European countries, including Bonn. In 1993, the Israeli  trade deficit with the former European Community amounted to  $4.5 billion and to $7 billion if all of Western Europe and the  EFTA countries are included. We are not asking for membership,  but we cannoyt tolerate discrimination on the part of the EU.    [Ruehl] What do you mean by discrimination?    [Rabin] For example, Siemens can make a bid for Israeli  power company investment projects, but Israeli firms cannot put  in bids in Germany and the EU countries in the same way.  Certain community rules prevent us from being given a chance to  compete fairly. The value of our exports to the United States  is almost the same as that of our exports to Europe. Trade with  the United States is balanced, and in addition, we receive $3  billion of U.S. foreign aid each year. We are not asking for  special terms or European support, but we do insist on fair  "terms of trade" with a European market open to us. We cannot  demand that the Israeli people pay the price for peace if we  cannot simultaneously offer prospects for positive economic  development within the framework of regional cooperation with  our Arab neighbors and internationally.    [Ruehl] What is your view of the EU's intention of offering  more funds to provide economic support for Palestinian autonomy?    [Rabin] We support it. We do not want European  contributions, but a significant adjustment to the foreign trade  deficit with Europe through appropriate agreements with the EU.  Every billion dollars that is earned in exports means between  15,000 and 20,000 jobs in Israel. A peaceful settlement for the  region must also bring economic advantages to Israel.    [Ruehl] What are the prospects like for extending peace to  Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon?    [Rabin] Unfortunately, Lebanon is not prepared to take even  one step unless it receives a green light from Damascus. Even  Jordan is watching Damascus and waiting for a signal before it  takes further steps, although we have already held negotiations.  I cannot understand why the Jordanians see themselves as being  dependent on the Syrians, but this is the case. As far as Syria  is concerned, there is a great gulf between us. Syria has also  condemned the agreement with the PLO and has not embarked on the  path to peace with Israel, despite all the U.S. attempts at  mediation. These U.S. efforts will continue, but I would not  venture to make any predictions. However, we need a reliable  peace, not just the consolidation of a truce.    [Ruehl] You have only had that kind of peace with Egypt.    [Rabin] President Sadat dispelled mistrust with his visit to  Jerusalem. He went 90 percent of the way to convince the  Israeli people that he was serious about peace. Begin only  needed to go 10 percent of the way. Sadat was actively  committed to peace. That is the difference between him and  Al-Asad, and that is where the problems start. The questions  that people in Israel ask are: We should believe him when he  talks about peace, but can we believe him?    [Ruehl] Do you want Al-Asad to come to the Knesset in  Jerusalem like Sadat?    [Rabin] I did not say that and I do not expect that.  However, President Al-Asad does not have the right to demand  the kind of conditions for peace of Israel that Sadat had claim  to.    [Ruehl] You have indicated that your government would be  prepared to discuss the return of the Golan Heights to Syria  during negotiations on peace and if Syria were to respond  appropriately.    [Rabin] I have actually said even more than that, namely,  that I would be prepared to put the question of a significant  withdrawal form the Golan Heights to the Israeli people in the  form of a referendum, if we can draw up a sensible peace treaty  with Syria.    [Ruehl] That is to say, mutual conditions for the  demilitarization of the border and arms controls?    [Rabin] Yes, and in conjunction with normalization and a  phased withdrawal over a given period of time. We must have a  clear-cut border agreement and take account of the fact that in  the north, vis-a-vis the Golan, Israel has no territory to  withdraw into for defensive purposes and needs security.</p>

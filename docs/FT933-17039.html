			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Baton passes to country that actually likes EC ONE IS a flesh-pumping Flemish Christian Democrat with a passion for football; the other is a high-brow Flemish Socialist who conducts orchestras in his spare time. Meet Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister, and Mr Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign minister, two newcomers on the European scene who will be running the European Community for the next six months. Today Belgium takes over the rotating EC presidency from Denmark. Mr Dehaene and Mr Claes can barely disguise their satisfaction. After the niggling nationalism of the previous British and Danish presidencies, federalist-minded Belgium is pressing for a return to Community orthodoxy. 'We need more Europe, not less Europe,' says Mr Dehaene. Beyond the slogan lie two goals: to restore the authority of the European Commission as policy-motor and arbiter between the 12 member states; and to apply the provisions of the Maastricht treaty, assuming, of course, that it survives the final stage of ratification in the UK and a legal challenge in Germany. Neither task will be easy. The mood in the Community remains sour, best captured by tensions between France and Germany over trade and interest rates. Unemployment in the EC will pass the 18m mark by the end of the year. The EC remains becalmed. Yet the pressure is on the Belgians as a founder member of the EC to end the drift which began, just over a year ago, when Danish voters narrowly voted to reject Maastricht. The stakes are high: the next three EC presidencies - Greece, Germany and France - all face election campaigns in the next 18 months in which support for Maastricht could be a liability. Viscount Etienne Davignon, chairman of the conglomerate Societe Generale de Belgique, argues that credible progress toward monetary union must be made during the Belgian presidency. The challenge is to formulate a deal on the site of the new European Monetary Institute, the precursor of the European central bank, which will supervise operation of the putative single European currency. Belgium is a great enthusiast for the single currency, but its credibility as a member of the 'hard core' currency bloc built around the D-Mark took a knock recently. Mr Philippe Maystadt, finance minister, suggested that the Maastricht criteria for reducing budget deficits might have to be relaxed if the recession continued well into 1994. Mr Maystadt subsequently said he had been misquoted, but the impression of wavering lingered. Belgium also wants to make Maastricht's provisions for a common EC foreign and security policy work. This may seem remote after the disarray over former Yugoslavia; but Belgium is looking for less controversial areas where the 12 can agree to 'joint actions'. An important behind-the-scenes figure over the next six months will be Philippe de Schoutheete de Tervarent, Belgian's veteran ambassador to the EC and an expert in the foreign policy provisions of the treaty. He is a believer in process as much as concrete action. 'The Belgians are playing a long game,' says one EC diplomat. 'They want to encourage the correct habits.' By contrast, the British and Danish presidencies are seen as having introduced bad habits. Their enthusiasm for speedy enlargement of the EC to include Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden by 1995 is not shared in Brussels; nor is the Danish push for more televised ministerial meetings. Five-minute sound-bites on camera are not the best way to restore EC credibility, says Mr Claes. On the positive side, Denmark succeeded in liberalising the EC road haulage market, as well as presiding over the acceleration of the economic and political integration of central and eastern Europe into the EC, which included more generous market access agreements. But too often its ambitions were overshadowed by the imperative of securing a Yes in the second referendum at the end of May and a quaint nationalism. No doubt, EC diplomats will be relieved that the question of whether to fly the Danish flag outside the White House will not dominate planning for an EC-US summit; on the other hand, they may miss the way in which the Queen of Denmark could throw EC protocol to the wind by issuing an invitation to Mr Boris Yeltsin in the middle of planning for an EC-Russia summit. At the very least, they must hope that Belgium's fragile coalition government will last longer than the Danish coalition last January. Two weeks into the presidency it fell victim to a scandal over the treatment of Tamil refugees.</p>

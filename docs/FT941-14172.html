			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / A successful blend: The benefits of the joint ventures Guinness's joint ventures with LVMH - now established in 13 countries - have played a significant role in the rise of the two companies to leading positions in the international drinks market. Their success rests on two essentials: a strong portfolio of brands, especially Scotch whisky and cognac, and an efficient and extensive distribution network. When Guinness took over drinks group Distillers Company in 1986, it acquired a portfolio that included Johnnie Walker, the world's best-selling Scotch, and Gordon's, the leading international gin. It also acquired a fragmented international distribution system. Only a quarter of the network was directly owned; the rest was in the hands of more than 1,300 agents. The task facing Sir Anthony Tennant, then the newly appointed chief executive (now retired), was to broaden the brands portfolio to bring in other categories of drinks, to improve control of distribution - and to do it quickly if Guinness was to compete with other international drinks groups. An alliance with LVMH offered a ready solution, and one that had obvious benefits for the French company as well as for Guinness. LVMH owned the world's number one cognac, Hennessy, and leading champagne brands, Moet Chandon and Veuve Clicquot; and it had a strong distribution network, particularly in the Far East. The combination of the Guinness and LVMH brands created a more marketable portfolio of drinks and improved the two groups' competitive position at a stroke. Mr Tony Greener, the Guinness chairman and chief executive whom Sir Anthony originally brought from luxury goods group Dunhill in 1987 to manage the spirits business, said: 'Joint ventures are a commonsense way of going forward. From a commercial point of view, they are very good value. With carefully chosen partners, you can achieve all the synergistic benefits that you get from a takeover without the high costs.' Guinness has since gone on to strengthen its hand through joint ventures with other drinks companies - Boutari in Greece and Bundaberg in Australia - and takeovers, such as Asbach in Germany and Pampero in Venezuela. But the alliance with LVMH has been gradually built up over the past seven years. It now comprises 17 joint ventures and is the dominant Guinness trading relationship, contributing 25 per cent of the Pounds 769m profits of United Distillers, its spirits business, in 1992. 'With Moet Hennessy,' Mr Greener said, 'we share a belief in the importance of brands and brand development. That underpins everything we are doing.' The Scotch whisky and cognac portfolio has proved especially appealing to consumers in Japan and Hong Kong, and in the developing markets of Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand. Late last year, a joint venture was established in China, where international sales currently account for only 1.4 per cent of the spirits market. 'China could be a 20m-case annual market for premium imported spirits by the next century,' Mr Greener said. The alliance is about to set up a joint operation in Korea, another potentially significant market, and is exploring possible moves into other parts of the world. Yesterday's agreement focuses the partnership more closely on the future development of their international drinks businesses. Mr Greener, assured by the deal that he can prevent the Moet Hennessy brands ever falling into a competitor's hands, said: 'We can contribute our help, support and experience to their strategy and management, as partners with common interests and common goals to build their brands and expand their business.' With many world markets hit by recession, the two companies have to seize whatever advantages they can find.</p>

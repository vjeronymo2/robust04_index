			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> POWER STRUGGLE IN IRAN LEADS TO ARREST OF CLERIC  </P> <P> A former deputy to Iran's late leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, was  briefly arrested during the weekend amid a renewed power struggle in Iran, an  Iranian exile group said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Baghdad-based Moujahedeen Khalq organization said in a statement  distributed in Athens that the senior cleric, the Ayatollah Hussein Ali  Montazeri, was arrested Saturday in the holy city of Qom, 75 miles south of  Tehran.  </P> <P> He was released hours later after tension built up in the city over news of his  arrest, the exile group said. There was no immediate confirmation of the arrest  from independent sources, but on Monday, Iran's new spiritual leader, the  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called on Iranians to unite and issued a warning to  those causing divisions.  </P> <P> Khamenei, whose message was addressed to the Majlis, or Parliament, and  broadcast on Tehran Radio, said he will not tolerate attacks on the principle  of rule of the clergy on which the Islamic Republic of Iran was founded.  </P> <P> Khamenei did not indicate who attacked the principle recently, but reports from  Tehran said demonstrators in Qom chanted slogans against the principle last  week. It was not immediately clear if the demonstrators were Montazeri  supporters.  </P> <P> The Moujahedeen, bitter opponents of Iran's ruling clerics, said Montazeri was  arrested after he issued strong statements attacking President Hashemi  Rafsanjani and Khamenei.  </P> <P> The Moujahedeen, who said they received their information from contacts inside  Iran, said that supporters of the president and Iran's new spiritual leader  staged a demonstration outside Montazeri's house the day before he was  arrested.  </P> <P> Montazeri, who was ousted in April as Khomeini's deputy and designated  successor just two months before the ayatollah died, was engaged in a power  struggle against Rafsanjani and Khamenei at least four years earlier.  </P></p>

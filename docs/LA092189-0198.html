			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PRIVATE FIRM CONTRACTED FOR  HAZARDOUS MATERIALS  </P> <P> The city will turn to the private sector in an effort to avoid what it believes  are excessive new charges for emergency handling of hazardous materials.  </P> <P> The City Council authorized City Manager Lee Risner and City Atty. Richard D.  Jones to enter into a contract for handling hazardous materials with Disposal  Control Services Inc. by Oct 1.  </P> <P> For the past five years, the service has been provided free by Anaheim.  Effective Oct. 1, however, the service will cost $68,400 annually.  </P> <P> The free services had grown out of an agreement among Orange County cities to  support grant proposals by five of the county's largest fire departments for  hazardous materials equipment, training and personnel. Those departments are  Anaheim, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Santa Ana and Orange County.  </P> <P> Recently, however, those agencies established a joint powers agreement and  determined that charges should be imposed to cover rising costs.  </P> <P> According to a study conducted by La Habra, units assigned to hazardous  materials duties also respond to other types of emergencies. This led the city  and a number of other communities with their own fire departments to conclude  that the costs were too high and that fewer units were needed to meet needs.  </P> <P> As part of the plan to contract for services approved by the City Council on  Tuesday, Fire Department personnel will also receive hazardous materials  training, while the option of calling on Anaheim for emergencies beyond the  capabilities of the private company will be retained.  </P></p>

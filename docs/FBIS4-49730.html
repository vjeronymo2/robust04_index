			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Communique Issued by the Seventh Plenary Session of the </F> Autonomous Regional Discipline Inspection Commission"]    [Excerpts] The Seventh Plenary Session of the Xinjiang  Uygur Autonomous Regional CPC Discipline Inspection Commission  [XUARCPCDIC] was held in Urumqi from 31 March to 3 April. Under  the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic  line, the plenary session implemented the guidelines of the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the  Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection  Commission, and the Sixth (Enlarged) Plenary Session of the  Fourth Xinjiang Autonomous Regional Party Committee in an  all-round way; reviewed and summed up Xinjiang's implementation  of the central authorities' decision on successfully tackling a  few tasks related to the anticorruption drive in the near future  since the Fifth Plenary Session of the XUARCPCDIC; and drew up a  plan for the tasks to be handled by Xinjiang in the  anticorruption drive in 1994 around the overall situation of the  whole party's work -- seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open  up wider, promote development, and maintain stability -- and in  accordance with the demand set by the central authorities on  more effectively launching the anticorruption drive in depth and  over a protracted period of time.    Twenty six XUARCPCDIC members attended the meeting. [passage  omitted] The XUARCPCDIC Standing Committee presided over the  meeting. The plenary session approved the report [entitled]  "More Effectively Launch the Anticorruption Drive in Depth and  Over a Protracted Period of Time to Serve the Needs of  Xinjiang's Reform, Development, and Stability" delivered by  Comrade Zhou Shengtao, secretary of the XUARCPCDIC, on behalf of  the XUARCPCDIC Standing Committee.    Comrade Abulaiti Abudurexiti, deputy secretary of the  autonomous regional party committee and chairman of the regional  government, delivered an important speech at the plenary  session. Principal leaders of all major leading bodies attended  the meeting. Comrade Zhang Fusen, deputy secretary of the  autonomous regional party committee, attended the meeting and  delivered a concluding speech.    The plenary session conscientiously studied and discussed  Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech and the guidelines  adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline  Inspection Commission. Those who attended the plenary session  unanimously believed that Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech was very  profound, that it was very apparent it was directed against  those who are corrupt and has a strong significance of serving  as our guideline, that the Third Plenary Session of the Central  Discipline Inspection Commission was a very important meeting  which mobilized all concerned to more effectively launch the  anticorruption drive in depth and over a protracted period of  time and drew up a plan for launching the drive.    The plenary session reviewed and summed up the  implementation  of the central authorities' decision on the anticorruption drive  by the party committees and governments at all levels since the  Fifth Plenary Session of the XUARCPCDIC. It pointed out: The  party committees and governments at all levels have adopted a  resolute attitude, taken prompt actions, and have done a large  amount of work in implementing the party Central Committee's and  the State Council's "Decision on Successfully Tackling a Few  Tasks Related to the Anticorruption Drive in the Near Future"  since August 1993. The vast numbers of cadres and the masses  have wholeheartedly supported and taken active part in the work.  Cadres of discipline inspection and supervisory organs at all  levels have scrupulously done their duties and worked hard.  After more than half a year's efforts, we have achieved  preliminary successes in the anticorruption drive and scored  achievements, to various extents, in fulfilling the three tasks  proposed by the central authorities. Some other negative  phenomena and corruption have been somewhat curbed. Generally  speaking, the momentum of the anticorruption drive is good; its  progress is healthy; it has basically met the requirements  desired by the central authorities and the autonomous regional  party committee and it has played a better role in maintaining  Xinjiang's political stability, promoting its reform and opening  up, and protecting its economic development. The plenary  session maintained that the progress of the anticorruption work  is still unbalanced, that some successes have not been  consolidated, that we must be aware that negative phenomena and  corruption are still serious while realistically affirming the  successes achieved by the anticorruption drive in the earlier  phase, that it is necessary for us to continue to work hard, and  that by no means can we afford to slacken our efforts in the  slightest degree.    The plenary session maintained that the anticorruption  drive is a test for leading cadres of the party and government  organs at all levels and a tempering process for the vast  numbers of cadres of discipline inspection and supervisory  organs. In the course of practice, they will deepen their  understanding of the party Central Committee's important  decision on the anticorruption drive and explore and amplify  some effective measures for launching the anticorruption drive,  such as focusing attention on conducting ideological education  to seek unity of thinking and to enhance consciousness of and  strengthen resolve in the anticorruption drive; strengthening  leadership and practically seeing to the implementation of the  three tasks; strictly having a good grasp of policies, and  subordinating oneself to and serving the needs of economic  construction; insisting on proceeding from facts and solving  whatever problems that exist to let the masses of the people  really benefit from the success achieved in the anticorruption  drive; and dealing with corruption by looking into both its root  cause and symptoms, establishing and perfecting rules,  regulations, and a restrictive mechanism through supervision,  and consolidating the successes achieved in the anticorruption  drive. We must continue to persist in these effective measures  and gradually amplify them.    The plenary session pointed out that 1994 is a crucial year  for us to implement the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee and to realize the shift of  our economic structure to a new orbit. It is also a crucial  year in which we face heavy tasks and a rigorous test in our  anticorruption drive. We must keep in mind the overall situation  of the whole party's work when launching the anticorruption  drive; continue to conscientiously implement the decisions and  opinions of the central authorities and the autonomous regional  party committee on the anticorruption drive; consolidate and  amplify our successes in the anticorruption drive achieved in  the earlier phase; and more effectively carry on the  anticorruption drive in depth and over a protracted period of  time. [passage omitted]    The plenary session called on discipline inspection and  supervisory organs to step up supervision over law enforcement  to guarantee the smooth transmission of government decrees by  revolving their attention around the implementation of the  important policies and measures adopted by the party Central  Committee, the State Council, the autonomous regional party  committee, and the autonomous regional people's government on  deepening reform, developing the economy, and maintaining  stability. [passage omitted]    The plenary session emphatically pointed out that the key to  more effectively launch the anticorruption drive in depth and  over a protracted period of time lies in improving the  understanding of leading cadres at all levels to seek unity of  thinking. Leaders at all levels must take the lead to practice  honesty and exercise self-discipline in compliance with the  demand set by the central authorities on further consolidating  an developing the flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the  masses of the people. The party committees and governments at  all levels must adhere to the strategic principle of "grasping  two links at the same time and taking a tough stand on both,"  place the anticorruption work top on their agenda, and  practically strengthen leadership. Principal leading comrades  of the party and government must personally handle the work and  take steps to solve major problems. [passage omitted] Discipline  inspection and supervisory organs are required to further adhere  to the party's basic line; to closely revolve their efforts  around the central task of economic construction; to subordinate  themselves to and serve the guidelines on the overall situation  of the whole party's work; to conduct discipline inspection and  supervision amid the efforts to promote reform, development, and  stability; and to create a favorable environment for Xinjiang to  deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain  stability through the fulfillment of all their discipline  inspection and supervision duties so as to expedite the  autonomous region's rapid and highly efficient economic  development. [passage omitted] It is necessary to have  discipline inspection and supervisory organs further strengthen  the building of the rank and file of their own cadres. Cadres  of discipline inspection and supervisory organs are required to  conduct intensive study of Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping," to arm their minds with the theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, and to use them as a  guidance for their work. They must go deep into the realities  of life to conduct survey, study the knowledge about a socialist  market economy, enhance their political integrity, and improve  their professional competence. It is necessary to strengthen  the building of the leading groups of discipline inspection and  supervisory organs at all levels and to bring into play the  functions of discipline inspection and supervision in a better  way so as to promote the work to a new level.    The plenary session firmly believed the party committees and  governments at levels will surely be able to achieve new phased  successes in carrying out this year's anticorruption work so  long as they resolutely implement the central authorities'  decision on anticorruption, reach a common understanding,  practically strengthen leadership, fully rely on the masses, and  pay close attention to the implementation of various tasks.    The plenary session called on the vast numbers of party  members and cadres in the whole region to conscientiously study  and implement the guidelines of Comrade Jiang Zemin's important  speech and the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline  Inspection Commission, to surmount all difficulties and  obstacles and steadfastly launch the anticorruption drive in  accordance with the plan and requirements of the autonomous  regional party committee and in the spirit of doing concrete  work with perseverance, and to make new contributions to  maintaining political stability, guaranteeing [the progress] of  reform and opening up, and promoting economic development under  the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic  line.</p>

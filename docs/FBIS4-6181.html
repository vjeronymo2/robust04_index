			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the revelation by six soldiers of the  two- headed government captured on 13 and 14 April, the  government used foreign financial aid for national  reconstruction to hire 500 (Dac Cong) commando troops, selected  from the communist Vietnamese's 7th, 9th, 330th, and 309th  Divisions, to attack Pailin. The soldiers were paid $100 daily.    These Vietnamese soldiers were used to fight in Cambodia  before and some of them even used to be posted in Pailin. They  can say some Cambodian words and have dressed up as Khmer Royal  Armed Forces troops. They are front line forces. Somehow, in  their onslaught on Pailin, 300 of them were killed or wounded in  just a few days. Now, the remaining 200 soldiers are stationed  at Kaong Kang Monastery and Phnum Yat adjoining Pailin town.    Although the Vietnamese soldiers are front line intervention  forces, the Pailin battlefield situation has so far caused them  to prepare for hasty retreat.    These actions are evidence that the two-headed government,  communist Vietnamese, and the alliance have used national  coffers to wage war. And they have gone so far as to hire the  communist Vietnamese troops to destroy the Cambodian nation and  people mercilessly. The nation and people are resolved to  oppose the two-headed government, which has sold the nation out  and destroyed the nation and people, and its masters until  genuine peace is restored to Cambodia.</p>

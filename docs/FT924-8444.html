			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ulster talks reach uncertain end MORE THAN six months of talks on Northern Ireland's political future ended last night with the aspirations of unionists and nationalists far apart and a last-minute failure to agree even an outline of areas of common agreement. Negotiations broke up in Belfast with a joint statement saying there had been no 'comprehensive accommodation in relation to the deep-seated and long-standing problems'. Nor was there a 'heads-of-agreement' document as hoped for last week by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. He will make a statement to MPs today. Although the talks could restart next year, the collapse is a further blow for British and Irish hopes that negotiations could bring movement after two decades of failed political initiatives. Possible straws of hope are the historic ground that was broken - notably Ulster Unionists negotiating with Irish ministers in Dublin - and the fact that channels of communication have been established and some mutual suspicious broken. Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist party leader, said: 'We will persevere in our efforts to achieve progress through informal consultations.' Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, said that for the first time ever there had been serious discussions on all sides. Sir Ninian Stephen, a former governor-general of Australia who acted as independent chairman, said the talks objectives were still 'achievable'. Against that is the last minute procedural squabbling, apparently triggered by the calling of a general election in the Irish republic, that delayed the final plenary from Friday until yesterday. But the costs in terms of discouraging investment in the province, and the possible encouragement the latest setback might have given to those who believe a solution requires resorting to violence, are incalculable. Security forces believe the IRA is still potent. Loyalist paramilitaries remain active. The talks, which began in earnest in April after a brief session before the UK general election, suggest a consensus is elusive. The circumstances were propitious. Time was not a problem and media attention was scant. But, as one Dublin official, admited, 'we have only recently begun to scratch at the surface of the issues'. Three areas were covered: Government in the province. Unionists favour an elected Northern Ireland assembly with powers devolved from Westminster. The SDLP want a system of 'commissioners' that would give nationalists a direct input into decision making. Relations between north and south. Unionists favoured consultative bodies; the SDLP wanted them to have executive powers. Replacements for the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. Unionists wanted a more loose deal, The SDLP and the Irish government wanted only a pact that could 'transcend' the original. The most public arguments were over the Irish constitutional claim over the north. The Democratic Unionist party wanted the articles withdrawn unilaterally and has refused to talk in Dublin until they were. Dublin, in turn, only said it 'could' - not 'would' - hold a referendum to change its constitution. The general election in Ireland has created a good excuse for a pause for reflection. Unionists hope the opposition Fine Gael party will lead a new coalition, since it is more amenable to immediate concessions on articles two and three. But the unionists should not expect to achieve that without some reciprocity. And all sides have yet to show they can strike a deal.</p>

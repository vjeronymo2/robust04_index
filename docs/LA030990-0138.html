			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NEWS GLUT: FILM AT 11 . . . AND 10 AND 9 . . .;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: THERE ARE NEWSCASTS ALL OVER THE DIAL, BUT NETWORK VIEWERSHIP IS  DECLINING.  </P> <P> News, news and more news -- Los Angeles television viewers have never had more  choices, more newscasts, more hours of the day in which to get their fill of  the day's events. As a result, fewer local residents are tuning to the three  network-owned stations that traditionally have provided the bulk of local TV  news.  </P> <P> Total viewership of the daily 5 p.m. newscasts on KCBS Channel 2, KNBC Channel  4 and KABC-TV Channel 7 during February was down 12% from the same month in  1989 -- even though the size of the local audience had grown. The cumulative  audience for newscasts on those stations was also down 3% at 4 p.m. and at 6  p.m. Combined Nielsen ratings at 11 p.m. were the same as last year but off 21%  from February, 1988.  </P> <P> "I have a feeling that people are just sated with it," said Dan Gingold,  assistant professor of broadcast journalism at USC and a former news producer  at Channel 2. "There's just too much of it -- and by the very fact that there  is so much, it tends to be repetitive and rather unsatisfying unless there is a  major story, like an earthquake. . . . It's like eating too many jelly beans --  you lose your taste for it after awhile."  </P> <P> Robert Hyland, general manager at KCBS, would not call last month's sharp drop  "a trend," but he acknowledged that the abundance of broadcast news outlets in  Southern California -- CNN, four major independent stations, two  Spanish-language TV stations, two all-news radio stations, National Public  Radio, Financial News Network, plus the tabloid or "softer" news programs "Hard  Copy," "A Current Affair" and "Entertainment Tonight" -- "may have diluted some  of the numbers."  </P> <P> "There are so many choices today," Hyland said. "TV used to be predictable.  Viewers watched local news, then network news and then the network prime-time  schedule. Now you need a magnifying glass to read the TV Guide. And viewers  don't have loyalty anymore to a network or a station -- they graze through the  schedule each hour and pick out a sitcom or news or ESPN or whatever they  want."  </P> <P> The increasing entertainment choices on cable and the increasing strength of  the counterprogramming on the independent stations have also contributed to the  erosion of the local news audience in the afternoon and at 11 p.m. So has the  declining prime-time ratings of the three stations' parent networks -- down 8%  in February compared to February, 1989.  </P> <P> Local news observers also speculate that the newscasts on Channels 2, 4 and 7  have become indistinguishable, filled increasingly with inconsequential  features. In the past, these observers say, highly promoted, sensationalized  "mini-docs" served to differentiate the stations during ratings sweeps periods,  but those produced last month were far tamer than previous years.  </P> <P> "There just isn't enough local news -- especially since national and  international news are mostly ignored -- to fill all of those hours," said  Steve Bell, general manager of KTLA Channel 5, whose top-rated 10 p.m. newscast  has not been plagued by audience defections. "And as the stations realized  this, they more and more desperately tried to manufacture news and, as a  result, they watered down their own product. The public isn't fooled. They have  simply grown weary of all this and are taking advantage of all the  alternatives."  </P> <P> It is difficult to pinpoint exactly where the audience that used to watch news  has gone, because local ratings for all cable channels were unavailable. But  nationally, basic cable has increased its viewership about 18% in the last  year. And KTLA's reruns of "Hunter," which Bell claims is stealing adult  viewers from the news, won the 6-7 p.m. time period last month, beating local  and national news as well as sitcoms on the three other independents.  </P> <P> The network-owned stations already have cut back their news programming. Where  once they each offered three hours of news in the afternoon, today only KABC-TV  continues to do so -- and it plans to eliminate half an hour this fall.  </P> <P> Bell predicted that both Channel 7 and Channel 4 would junk their 4 p.m. news  if ratings continue to slide. Though the stations generally are eager to crow  about good ratings news, the general managers at both Channel 4 and Channel 7  declined to comment for this article.  </P> <P> John Severino, formerly the general manager of KABC Channel 7 and a former  president of ABC Television, said that the drop in viewership at the network  affiliates is occuring all over the country as the networks' share of the  audience declines.  </P> <P> When he was at ABC in the early 1980s, he recalled, he would travel to the  affiliates and assure them that the three-network share of prime time would  never drop below 90%. "A few months later," he said, "we would tell them it  would never drop below 85%. Then we would go around and say never below 80%.  Now it's down to 65%, and I heard Bob Wright (president of NBC) say recently  that it could fall to 55%."  </P> <P> Severino, who now is president of the Prime Ticket cable sports network, said  that the decreasing network audience means fewer people are available to watch  promos for the affiliate stations' newscasts. That, coupled with the increasing  strength of the independents and the growth of cable, means fewer news viewers.  </P> <P> This fall, Prime Ticket will provide even more competition for the  network-owned stations when it premieres two daily, all-sports newscasts at 7  p.m. and 11 p.m.  </P> <P> Even with the drop in ratings, however, news still remains enormously lucrative  for these stations, Severino said. They can live with lower ratings because of  cuts in expenditures demanded a few years back when new owners took over the  parent corporations -- Laurence Tisch at CBS, General Electric at NBC and  Capital Cities at ABC.  </P> <P> "Years ago, when profits were so high, we could add staff every year," KCBS'  Hyland recalled. "With the market share shrinking, we can't do that. Everyone  has had to cut back. We're all in a lean and mean mode."  </P> <P> Hyland maintained that the cuts have not hurt the quality of the product, but  Bell contended that the stations simply may no longer have the resources to  adequately fill all those hours of news every day.  </P> <P> Though Severino said that he does not believe the stations will cut their news  expenditures any further -- and that they may in fact have to increase their  advertising and promotion budgets -- he thinks that one of the stations will  have to try something radically different to distinguish it from the other two.  If they all continue to look the same and report the same news, he said, the  decline will continue indefinitely.  </P> <P> Hyland said that much depends on what the networks program in prime time. Last  year, CBS aired the blockbuster miniseries "Lonesome Dove" in February, and  that helped draw viewers to local news following the entertainment programs.  Last month, there were no smash hits on any of the networks.  </P> <P> "When the network share goes up, obviously viewers are sampling your station  and it is easier to get them to sample the news," Hyland said. "When there is a  big show at 10 p.m., you can sell your newscast during that program and people  will be willing to hang in there. We're all fighting like hell to give our  station some brand awareness, but when the viewer has 40 choices every half  hour, it's getting more and more difficult to do that."  </P></p>
